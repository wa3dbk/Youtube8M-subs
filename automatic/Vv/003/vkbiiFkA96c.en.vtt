00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
new section of squid port that I built

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.200 
new section of squid port that I built
which<00:02:50.980> is<00:02:51.160> just<00:02:51.430> a<00:02:51.550> little<00:02:53.610> bumper<00:02:54.610> car<00:02:54.850> rally

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
which is a pretty cool you know

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.120 
which is a pretty cool you know
everybody<00:02:58.960> else<00:02:59.080> probably<00:02:59.320> had<00:02:59.590> that<00:02:59.710> idea<00:02:59.830> as

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
everybody else probably had that idea as

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.550 
everybody else probably had that idea as
well<00:03:00.160> but<00:03:00.690> it's<00:03:01.690> one<00:03:01.990> of<00:03:02.080> those<00:03:02.140> decorations

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
that I really couldn't find a place to

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.140 
that I really couldn't find a place to
put<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:04.870> so<00:03:05.020> i<00:03:05.050> just<00:03:05.290> made<00:03:05.650> it's<00:03:05.950> a<00:03:06.310> little

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150

bumper car ride and put it down there so

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.440 
bumper car ride and put it down there so
that<00:03:10.540> is<00:03:11.110> really<00:03:11.470> cool<00:03:11.500> i<00:03:12.400> like<00:03:12.820> it<00:03:13.000> at<00:03:13.090> least<00:03:13.120> i

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
that is really cool i like it at least i

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.000

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
it kind of looks a little plane

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.440 
it kind of looks a little plane
obviously<00:03:18.010> there's<00:03:18.310> no<00:03:18.550> other<00:03:18.700> decorations

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
obviously there's no other decorations

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.680 
obviously there's no other decorations
that<00:03:19.600> could<00:03:19.959> be<00:03:20.170> added<00:03:20.380> to<00:03:20.860> that<00:03:20.890> to<00:03:21.570> you<00:03:22.570> know

look<00:03:26.170> pretty<00:03:26.440> cool<00:03:26.709> so<00:03:27.010> obviously<00:03:27.459> you<00:03:27.610> know

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
look pretty cool so obviously you know

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.150 
look pretty cool so obviously you know
bumper<00:03:28.930> cars<00:03:29.140> are<00:03:29.320> usually<00:03:29.709> you<00:03:29.950> know<00:03:30.040> at

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
bumper cars are usually you know at

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.310 
bumper cars are usually you know at
fairs<00:03:30.520> and<00:03:30.970> boardwalks<00:03:31.630> and<00:03:31.720> stuff<00:03:32.020> so<00:03:32.170> that

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
fairs and boardwalks and stuff so that

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.030 
fairs and boardwalks and stuff so that
makes<00:03:32.890> it<00:03:33.010> fit<00:03:33.190> in<00:03:33.280> pretty<00:03:33.489> well<00:03:34.860> I'm<00:03:35.860> not

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
makes it fit in pretty well I'm not

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.949 
makes it fit in pretty well I'm not
complaining<00:03:36.610> but<00:03:36.760> I'm<00:03:36.880> just<00:03:37.090> want<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:37.840> throw

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
complaining but I'm just want to throw

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.790 
complaining but I'm just want to throw
this<00:03:38.170> out<00:03:38.320> there<00:03:38.380> that<00:03:38.830> I<00:03:39.670> think<00:03:40.090> yay<00:03:40.300> have

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
this out there that I think yay have

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.729 
this out there that I think yay have
really<00:03:41.820> not<00:03:42.820> liked<00:03:43.200> skimped<00:03:44.200> out<00:03:44.380> on<00:03:44.620> the

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
really not liked skimped out on the

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.260 
really not liked skimped out on the
decorations<00:03:45.160> I<00:03:45.580> just<00:03:45.790> think<00:03:46.000> that<00:03:46.060> the

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
decorations I just think that the

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.080 
decorations I just think that the

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
were trees bushes fences I just think we

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.170 
were trees bushes fences I just think we
need<00:04:30.590> some<00:04:30.919> more<00:04:31.069> of<00:04:31.130> those<00:04:31.310> you<00:04:31.580> know<00:04:31.699> adding

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
need some more of those you know adding

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.270 
need some more of those you know adding
some<00:04:32.419> stoplights<00:04:33.110> maybe<00:04:33.500> it<00:04:33.830> would<00:04:33.979> be<00:04:34.130> pretty

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280
