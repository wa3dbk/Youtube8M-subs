00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.740
 blog huck's cave point blogspot.com 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.340
 and here I 'll comment with you 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.910
 finally the first official trailer of 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.699
 avenging the age of a leaked trunk 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.160
 snow leaked through some 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.680
 sites to it is more precisely the site 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.779
 comic book movie I'll comment with 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.119
 you here every scene in the trailer is him 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.029
 did not pose as well as HD quality 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.309
 high definition is a quality that 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.899
 actually recorded and made available in the 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.530
 Internet 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.420
 this training was with the destiny to 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.440
 expected to actually leak into the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.960
 on Tuesday during the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.670
 series episodes and shield agents and 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.230
 He's definitely going to do it on that day. 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.969
 with a much better quality but 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.510
 while I'm commenting with you on 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.690
 quality of this trainer so it's like the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.059
 train begins with explosion there the other 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.219
 throne and saying that it is the james spader 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.710
 actor james mirrors him saying that the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:09.180
 mankind is doomed that he dreams 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.220
 that humans should grow up before him 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.560
 do not beg for mercy all that 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.070
 destruction the captain america a visual 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.460
 light dark half falls everything in her type 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.759
 she seems to have a biblical influence is 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.490
 To speak the truth and say all this 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.740
 From all this obscure climate we see 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.890
 there a bruce banner is interpreted by the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.520
 microphone he stuck in a straitjacket 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.900
 with a rather frightening expression 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.240
 This meeting is an expression. 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.520
 scary, which means that some 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.979
 something very wrong there that the hulk did not 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.040
 was not triggered according to what it 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.899
 wanted the hulk again to quote a more faith 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.479
 wild than ever before 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.229
 and I could already see through this trailer and 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.729
 then you please, it 's applied in the 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.670
 link that I think I'll leave the description 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.670
 from my huck cave blog before 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.409
 marvel is to delete the trailer that 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.140
 practically if it wanted to be enabled 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.270
 deleted and for infringing the rights 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.310
 And then we all have 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.110
 these characters from the 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.950
 the group the avengers in a way 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.420
 quite obscure trunk gaining life 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.430
 threatening the whole group at a time when 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.690
 They're doing that party in the 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.360
 Tony Stark, right? 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.849
 the iron man if such then the other 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.090
 will come to life right in that voice is 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:33.989
 locks mills grim future Clemilson 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:38.880
 by the Speyer team and we break , is 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:41.640
 for various scenes the various landscapes and 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.940
 everything very obscure staff is everything very 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.459
 dark bitter really in this movie she 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.799
 want to preserve the very dark and 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.959
 This has been shown in the dark 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.640
 knight of darkness technology but like 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.380
 I already told you here, it's not my way, I do not 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.959
 I like the movie but I'll bet 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.450
 era and bitter era tokens 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.760
 really will take a step beyond the dice 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.620
 comics and having we also have another 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.790
 Brazilian scene is very hot. 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:11.430
 very dark gloomy he kind of 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.489
 worn right falling so there he 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.070
 lost in the woods of fallen on it 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.010
 trying to give a show full of snow like this 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.799
 It's taking time, right? 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.630
 and is actually transmitted in a way 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:28.560
 very subtle shift a rather 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:31.109
 dark and then right but we face is 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.220
 with the two connecting from the two members of the 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:37.200
 avengers that is mercury and 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.139
 scarlet witch who are actually 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.329
 two brothers is who is the pietro and the vanda 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:48.019
 max max silva max new think the name 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:49.950
 what is it that has for them a thousand that go 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.709
 feel how can I say here 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.290
 they will help me even have a 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.200
 understanding with the black widow is more or 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.880
 less the sina and we also have the trailer 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.200
 keep showing and how much 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.609
 narrating with you here the test in 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.480
 training and left the volume down here 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:08.370
 we also have the whole attack of the tron and 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.590
 April as the film debuts in the month of 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.459
 April 2015 side of the United States 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:17.100
 nick fury city devastated their aaf 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.750
 karate screaming and then we see that 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.400
 you will probably have a base with the 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.970
 image in this podcast is that the hair 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.660
 painted a problem that the hulk against 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.910
 The man 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.300
 iron and its reinforced armor, which 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.880
 means with the various thefts to have and is 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.130
 that is the climatic point of the movie 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.450
 even though the animal will pick it up and that 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.210
 Do not know if the goal is to achieve 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.250
 contain the hulk if this feud will last if 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.500
 get is going to catch the latter is to destroy 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.780
 the armor and what shows the trailer 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.400
 is the hulk completely out of control him 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.490
 destroys some of the 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.930
 fruit the town really got the bug got 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.310
 nor adding with the destruction 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.810
 caused by the tone and seeing here is more 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.220
 carefully the trailer the training does not 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.050
 takes too long does not have many firsts 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.780
 we see the black widow with the bike there 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.480
 those chase scenes already 26 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.180
 khannouchi another character appears 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:13.980
 by also I think the character of 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:16.110
 remember the people you forgot 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.450
 his is another character appears there 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.120
 I will not be talking, I'll keep on giving 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.440
 many details and specifics is up 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.830
 because the training is of a quality 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.170
 fairly defined and seems to say 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.910
 characters is the very face that 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.040
 motion capture as part of the 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.900
 huck that's the anti sex 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.980
 then it appears in the table reminded the 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.750
 the name of the face it appears with the 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.610
 movie character is believed name 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.080
 from there so much in capturing movements of the 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.770
 huck as well as the character he 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.470
 will do 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.360
 I forgot the name and I could see the trailer 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.790
 obscure tile makes attack the captain 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.010
 america hulk threw the car against the 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.800
 counter-attack booster and other authentic 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.530
 seems to be in bad shape the hulk 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.540
 rational monster beast even putz grill 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.340
 I'm waiting for this 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.780
 movie for me will be in my opinion a 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.150
 of the best action movies of the past 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.620
 Times it will outweigh the avengers 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.030
 it's the previous movie 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.040
 For me, it will go from 1 billion in the 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.260
 box office will overtake 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.350
 will kick the balloon's mouth will kick 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:16.230
 ferry will join all this movie is elson 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:20.910
 to what is above the knife and asthma 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:23.010
 the fruit hulk father i believe in 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.560
 I think microphone will make a 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.060
 extraordinary performance of the 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.310
 movement and weighing more on that side 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:32.340
 the confrontation between men and 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.950
 monster and in that dark all 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.260
 it will really be worth the guys going 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.340
 it's really worth watching this movie 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.070
 blowing 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:43.290
 cinemas and up to one step beyond what 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:45.780
 is this comics god comics right? 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:48.990
 started with this drift of obscurity 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:51.169
 Superman and Batman with this and got it 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.970
