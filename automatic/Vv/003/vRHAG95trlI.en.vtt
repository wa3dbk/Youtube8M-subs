lot of those backs involved there's

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.580 
lot of those backs involved there's
routes<00:00:37.230> involved<00:00:38.010> there's<00:00:38.360> timing<00:00:39.360> all<00:00:40.260> those

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
routes involved there's timing all those

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.440 
routes involved there's timing all those
issues<00:00:40.980> are<00:00:41.129> part<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.640> what<00:00:41.969> we<00:00:42.090> have<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.329> do

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
issues are part of it what we have to do

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.900 
issues are part of it what we have to do
we<00:00:42.600> get<00:00:42.899> better<00:00:43.190> into<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.219> shuffling<00:00:44.700> thing

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.840 
we need to go higher
play<00:01:57.020> some<00:01:57.500> plays<00:01:57.680> we<00:01:57.920> didn't<00:01:58.250> I<00:02:00.640> didn't<00:02:01.640> see

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
play some plays we didn't I didn't see

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.910 
play some plays we didn't I didn't see
that<00:02:01.880> I<00:02:02.330> think<00:02:02.630> that's<00:02:02.780> his<00:02:03.020> frustration<00:02:03.799> as

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
that I think that's his frustration as

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.230 
that I think that's his frustration as
much<00:02:04.130> as<00:02:04.280> anything<00:02:06.940> you<00:02:07.940> had<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.090> couple

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
much as anything you had a couple

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.180 
much as anything you had a couple
chances<00:02:08.509> one<00:02:08.840> of<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.020> first<00:02:09.709> half<00:02:09.890> get<00:02:10.069> down

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
chances one of the first half get down

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.540 
chances one of the first half get down
to<00:02:10.340> 20<00:02:10.700> I<00:02:10.759> think<00:02:10.789> of<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.090> second<00:02:11.360> order<00:02:12.550> you

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
to 20 I think of the second order you

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.090 
to 20 I think of the second order you
down<00:02:13.850> there<00:02:14.290> do<00:02:15.290> you<00:02:15.350> want<00:02:15.500> me<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.680> take<00:02:15.770> a<00:02:15.830> shot

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
down there do you want me to take a shot

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.199 
down there do you want me to take a shot
the<00:02:16.220> end<00:02:16.370> zone<00:02:16.520> you<00:02:16.550> guys<00:02:16.730> run<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.060> couple

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
the end zone you guys run it a couple

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.350 
the end zone you guys run it a couple
times<00:02:17.390> good<00:02:17.690> stuff<00:02:17.930> back<00:02:18.170> I<00:02:18.410> think<00:02:19.360> Nick

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
times good stuff back I think Nick

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.020 
times good stuff back I think Nick
honestly<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:21.290> I<00:02:21.350> think<00:02:21.590> we<00:02:21.830> would<00:02:22.010> have<00:02:22.130> we

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
honestly and I think we would have we

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.370 
honestly and I think we would have we
wouldn't<00:02:23.360> want<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.510> take<00:02:23.660> in<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:23.900> shot<00:02:24.170> we

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
wouldn't want to take in the shot we

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.430 
wouldn't want to take in the shot we
would<00:02:24.620> you<00:02:25.250> know<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:26.120> then<00:02:26.360> similar<00:02:26.959> with<00:02:27.110> the

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
would you know and then similar with the

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.930 
would you know and then similar with the
rate<00:02:27.590> tailor<00:02:27.920> thing<00:02:28.100> you<00:02:28.250> get<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.489> pick<00:02:28.670> get

I<00:03:01.130> don't<00:03:01.450> know<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:02.750> think<00:03:03.110> our<00:03:03.350> kids<00:03:03.410> played

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:04.270 
I don't know I think our kids played
hard

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
hard

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.449 
hard
I<00:03:04.489> didn't<00:03:05.239> think<00:03:05.390> we<00:03:05.540> executed<00:03:06.170> very<00:03:06.410> well<00:03:06.470> and

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459

in a game like this or gonna make a

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.870 
in a game like this or gonna make a
difference<00:03:11.920> when<00:03:12.920> you<00:03:12.950> go<00:03:13.220> back<00:03:13.459> and<00:03:13.489> you'll

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
difference when you go back and you'll

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.580 
difference when you go back and you'll

momentum standpoint of confidence and

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.580 
momentum standpoint of confidence and
what<00:03:24.230> you<00:03:24.440> want<00:03:24.680> to<00:03:24.799> do<00:03:25.060> that's<00:03:26.060> part<00:03:26.420> of

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.100 

hope<00:03:30.370> it<00:03:30.580> wasn't<00:03:30.819> to<00:03:31.120> not<00:03:31.360> go<00:03:31.599> into<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.900> half

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
hope it wasn't to not go into the half

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.830

six-six<00:03:32.890> and<00:03:33.129> have<00:03:33.849> them<00:03:34.030> break<00:03:34.239> that<00:03:34.660> was<00:03:34.810> a

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
six-six and have them break that was a

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.130 
six-six and have them break that was a
disappointing<00:03:35.680> drive<00:03:36.150> there<00:03:37.150> at<00:03:37.239> the<00:03:37.420> end<00:03:37.599> you
