00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.889
 hi i am lorenzo and this and i die full 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.760
 a channel dedicated to the kitchen and to the 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.029
 barbecue today we will prepare the ribs 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.029
 of pork 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:28.260
 the ingredients are obviously the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.660
 mustard pork chops and a mix 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:37.730
 composed of coarse sugar salt of 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.730
 paprika cane mustard seeds and pepper 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.570
 take the cutlets then remove 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.930
 the membrane in the inner part of the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.930
 cost 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:18.060
 we turn off the mustard on both sides e 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:19.650
 even on the edges I use a brush for 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.840
 try to get a better result 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.430
 homogeneous this operation however can 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.090
 be done easily even with 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.090
 your little hands 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.850
 then add the spice mix 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.870
 trying to cover all of them better 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.870
 how many surfaces 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.400
 once the ribs are done, rest 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.250
 in the fridge to give time to the meat of 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.620
 absorb all the marinating process 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.960
 which can last from half an hour a night 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:08.310
 whole in this case I have waited for a 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:20.730
 couple of hours then I turn on the hug 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:23.930
 usual aspects 20 minutes backhand then 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.930
 the embers in the combustion chamber 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.840
 now that the embers are ready to recover 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:44.049
 cutlets that were two hours in the 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:45.849
 I dispose of the fridge with the most part 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.319
 large towards the embers 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.500
 in this case the temperature will have to 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.739
 be lower than usual 160 170 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.739
 degrees 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.220
 and after four hours the ribs are 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.220
 ready 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.560
 he covers them with Spanish and I leave them 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.270
 rest the five minutes to give the 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.390
 time for the meat to reabsorb all the 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.390
 liquids 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.260
 after five minutes I can then 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.260
 cut them 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:11.160
 and finally our plate is ready 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.160
 go on the attack 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.890
 here
