different<00:00:32.910> types<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.180> maple<00:00:33.480> trees<00:00:34.130> generally

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
different types of maple trees generally

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.389 
different types of maple trees generally
in<00:00:35.370> late<00:00:35.760> August<00:00:36.270> or<00:00:36.510> even<00:00:37.320> late<00:00:37.500> July<00:00:37.860> these

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
in late August or even late July these

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.670 
in late August or even late July these
keys<00:00:38.670> will<00:00:38.879> dry<00:00:39.239> out<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.660> fall<00:00:40.050> from<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.410> tree

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
keys will dry out and fall from the tree

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.389 
keys will dry out and fall from the tree
and<00:00:42.140> again<00:00:43.140> as<00:00:43.320> previously<00:00:43.739> mentioned<00:00:43.860> it's

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
and again as previously mentioned it's

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.220 
and again as previously mentioned it's
important<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.879> let<00:00:45.000> these<00:00:45.239> keys<00:00:45.510> dry<00:00:46.020> out

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
important to let these keys dry out

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.500 
important to let these keys dry out
because<00:00:46.739> there's<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.879> be<00:00:47.940> moisture

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
because there's going to be moisture

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.750 
because there's going to be moisture
contained<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:49.079> these<00:00:49.379> seeds<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.010> until

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
contained in these seeds and until

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.240 
contained in these seeds and until
they're<00:00:50.940> dried<00:00:51.210> out<00:00:51.420> it's<00:00:52.260> better<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.800> allow

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
they're dried out it's better to allow

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.130 
they're dried out it's better to allow
any<00:00:53.670> moisture<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.239> leave<00:00:54.420> before<00:00:54.840> storing

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
any moisture to leave before storing

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.709 
any moisture to leave before storing
them<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.699> I<00:00:56.699> keep<00:00:56.910> them<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.120> my<00:00:57.210> Jeremiah

exact type of variety that you're
dealing<00:02:05.189> with<00:02:05.369> now<00:02:06.299> let's<00:02:06.570> look<00:02:06.689> at<00:02:06.810> red<00:02:07.079> maple

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
dealing with now let's look at red maple

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.740 
dealing with now let's look at red maple
for<00:02:07.649> example<00:02:08.129> red<00:02:08.759> maple<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.270> going<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.479> flower

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
for example red maple is going to flower

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.350 
for example red maple is going to flower
in<00:02:10.080> April<00:02:10.560> but<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.129> seeds<00:02:11.459> aren't<00:02:11.730> available
