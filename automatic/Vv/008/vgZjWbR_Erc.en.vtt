is<00:01:46.500> one<00:01:46.680> thing<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:46.979> game<00:01:47.190> definitely<00:01:47.400> has

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
is one thing this game definitely has

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.940 
is one thing this game definitely has
everything<00:01:48.540> from<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.900> visuals<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.620> audio

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
everything from the visuals to the audio

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.649 
everything from the visuals to the audio
to<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.220> weapon<00:01:50.580> design<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.060> very<00:01:51.090> polished

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
to the weapon design is very polished

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.450

and<00:01:51.870> well<00:01:51.960> put<00:01:52.140> together<00:01:52.260> it's<00:01:53.130> when<00:01:53.340> it's

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
and well put together it's when it's

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.950 
and well put together it's when it's
broken<00:01:53.729> down<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.210> looked<00:01:54.360> at<00:01:54.510> on<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.690> game

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
say each level looks the same but often

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.230

you'll<00:02:13.110> find<00:02:13.140> several<00:02:13.530> rooms<00:02:13.920> in<00:02:14.069> a

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
that look identical but to me this is

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.820 
that look identical but to me this is
kind<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.600> welcome<00:02:17.840> type<00:02:18.320> of<00:02:18.470> first-person

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
kind of a welcome type of first-person

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.890 
kind of a welcome type of first-person

doom and quake and I don't know it's

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
kind of felt refreshing after a little

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.060 
kind of felt refreshing after a little
while<00:02:32.110> strangely<00:02:33.110> enough<00:02:33.170> also<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.860> game's

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
while strangely enough also the game's

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.610 
while strangely enough also the game's
final<00:02:34.370> two<00:02:34.670> levels<00:02:35.060> they're<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.170> only<00:02:36.350> two

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
final two levels they're the only two

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.500 
final two levels they're the only two
not<00:02:36.650> set<00:02:37.220> in<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.370> real-life<00:02:37.670> location<00:02:38.270> and

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
not set in a real-life location and

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.940 
not set in a real-life location and
they're<00:02:38.930> also<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.230> most<00:02:39.320> beautiful

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
they're also the most beautiful

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.710 
they're also the most beautiful
graphically<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.880> most<00:02:41.030> original<00:02:41.360> in

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
graphically and the most original in

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.630 
graphically and the most original in
design<00:02:42.050> it's<00:02:42.890> kind<00:02:43.070> of<00:02:43.190> funny<00:02:43.400> in<00:02:43.550> a<00:02:43.610> way

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
design it's kind of funny in a way

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.670 
design it's kind of funny in a way
because<00:02:44.000> for<00:02:44.630> all<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.810> flack<00:02:45.050> this<00:02:45.260> game<00:02:45.440> gets

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
because for all the flack this game gets

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.740 
because for all the flack this game gets
with<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:45.860> lack<00:02:46.130> of<00:02:46.160> originality<00:02:46.480> it's<00:02:47.480> a<00:02:47.600> two

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
with the lack of originality it's a two

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.240 
with the lack of originality it's a two
most<00:02:47.990> original<00:02:48.320> levels<00:02:48.830> that<00:02:49.010> are<00:02:49.070> the

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
most original levels that are the

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.310 
most original levels that are the
standouts<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:50.090> it<00:02:50.570> also<00:02:50.690> makes<00:02:50.840> me<00:02:51.110> think

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
standouts and it also makes me think

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.570 
standouts and it also makes me think
that<00:02:51.440> maybe<00:02:51.500> this<00:02:51.800> game<00:02:52.010> might<00:02:52.220> have<00:02:52.340> fared

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
that maybe this game might have fared

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.040 
that maybe this game might have fared
better<00:02:52.790> if<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:53.240> were<00:02:53.330> like<00:02:53.510> on<00:02:53.660> a<00:02:53.690> space

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
better if it were like on a space

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.530 
better if it were like on a space
station<00:02:54.080> or<00:02:54.560> something<00:02:54.890> like<00:02:55.070> doom<00:02:55.340> where<00:02:56.330> you

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
station or something like doom where you

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.330 
station or something like doom where you
know<00:02:56.660> they<00:02:57.260> just<00:02:57.470> were<00:02:57.770> able<00:02:58.040> to<00:02:58.130> create

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
know they just were able to create

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.840 
know they just were able to create
everything<00:02:58.730> themselves<00:02:59.800> anyway<00:03:00.850> there

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
everything themselves anyway there

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.520 
everything themselves anyway there
seemed<00:03:02.150> to<00:03:02.180> be<00:03:02.300> a<00:03:02.390> shortage<00:03:02.810> of<00:03:02.900> enemy<00:03:03.290> types

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
seemed to be a shortage of enemy types

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.200 
seemed to be a shortage of enemy types
in<00:03:03.710> the<00:03:03.770> game<00:03:03.950> too<00:03:04.190> there<00:03:04.460> are<00:03:04.490> maybe<00:03:04.700> ten<00:03:04.940> or

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
in the game too there are maybe ten or

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.700 
in the game too there are maybe ten or
eleven<00:03:05.630> throughout<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:05.990> entire<00:03:06.260> game<00:03:06.500> and

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
eleven throughout the entire game and

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.170 
eleven throughout the entire game and
that<00:03:06.770> includes<00:03:07.220> what<00:03:07.610> I<00:03:07.640> guess<00:03:07.910> would<00:03:08.120> be

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
that includes what I guess would be

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.970 
that includes what I guess would be
considered<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:08.720> boss<00:03:08.900> characters<00:03:09.440> though

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
considered the boss characters though

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.740 
considered the boss characters though
these<00:03:10.160> giant<00:03:10.760> bugs<00:03:11.000> you'll<00:03:11.300> probably<00:03:11.510> seen

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
these giant bugs you'll probably seen

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.600 
these giant bugs you'll probably seen
them<00:03:11.870> in<00:03:11.990> the<00:03:12.050> trailer<00:03:12.410> I<00:03:12.560> think<00:03:13.460> there<00:03:13.550> were

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
them in the trailer I think there were

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.430 
them in the trailer I think there were
only<00:03:13.670> three<00:03:14.270> in<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.540> whole<00:03:14.720> game<00:03:14.930> and<00:03:14.960> I<00:03:15.260> think

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
only three in the whole game and I think

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.290 
only three in the whole game and I think
they're<00:03:15.530> all<00:03:15.680> in<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:15.920> same<00:03:16.130> level<00:03:16.430> so<00:03:16.730> really

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
they're all in the same level so really

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.420 
they're all in the same level so really
the<00:03:17.840> bottom<00:03:17.960> line<00:03:18.170> is<00:03:18.320> to<00:03:18.620> expect<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.100> lot<00:03:19.280> of

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
the bottom line is to expect a lot of

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.700 
the bottom line is to expect a lot of
repetition<00:03:19.580> and<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.180> single<00:03:20.450> player<00:03:20.710> now

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
repetition and the single player now

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.830 
repetition and the single player now
luckily<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.310> core<00:03:22.580> mechanic<00:03:23.120> of<00:03:23.210> shooting<00:03:23.660> is

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
luckily the core mechanic of shooting is

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.690 
luckily the core mechanic of shooting is
as<00:03:24.020> visceral<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.650> satisfying<00:03:25.190> as<00:03:25.430> it's<00:03:25.580> ever

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
as visceral and satisfying as it's ever

enough<00:06:41.590> ground<00:06:41.860> work<00:06:42.069> here<00:06:42.280> to<00:06:42.400> really<00:06:42.699> make

00:06:42.929 --> 00:06:42.939 
enough ground work here to really make

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:45.089 
enough ground work here to really make
something<00:06:43.150> special<00:06:43.560> hopefully<00:06:44.560> high<00:06:44.710> voltage

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:45.099 
something special hopefully high voltage

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:48.360 
something special hopefully high voltage
