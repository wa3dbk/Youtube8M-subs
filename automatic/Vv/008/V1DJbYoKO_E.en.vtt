00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.790
 karl grammer of fc bayern managed 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.080
 the third time in four years is the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.150
 team in the final of the uefa 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.890
 champions league and the fans are 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.020
 Hot on her flight from the want her 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.529
 Heroes will see them in a few minutes 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.529
 arrive 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.660
 it was a veritable siege 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.090
 as the bavarian stars then came the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.579
 reporters tv-crew fans all 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.989
 rushed at their stars and the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:59.520
 were visibly surprised but always 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:01:01.140
 even before euphoria we now have over 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.670
 These two games we showed that 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.979
 we were the better team in 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.960
 this moment the two players but 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.340
 I mean that does not mean so 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.119
 I think I always think so too 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.720
 What keeps us calm and two feet 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.659
 on the ball 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.790
 25 times the endgame is on now 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.740
 legendary ground in wembley stadium in 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.060
 London and then meet two Germans 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.890
 teams each other 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.140
 borussia dortmund and the fc bavaria zum 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.369
 first time a german endgame in the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.439
 champions league history in the 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.590
 20-year uefa champions league 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.590
 history 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.610
 that was a great performance again and again 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.909
 the moment we have to enjoy and now 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.909
 About the final next week I mean 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.280
 We should be so good now 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.869
 everybody already knows that 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.869
 the important thing is a final 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:17.140
 who knows that it at first 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.090
 taste for this finale 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.950
 it already on saturday in the bundesliga 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.959
 Curiously, someone has the script 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.030
 written that the fc bavaria munich 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.220
 then guest is at borussia dortmund 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.360
 yes, that will be a completely different game 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.569
 I do not think that either 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.910
 compare to the final and from it 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.590
 Whatever happens on Saturday, whoever 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.739
 I think that's not that 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.739
 leading
