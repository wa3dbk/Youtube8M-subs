now<00:03:02.510> if<00:03:02.570> you<00:03:02.630> guys<00:03:02.720> remember<00:03:02.870> last<00:03:03.260> year<00:03:03.500> i

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
now if you guys remember last year i

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.460 
now if you guys remember last year i
think<00:03:03.740> this<00:03:03.830> female<00:03:04.190> late<00:03:04.370> like<00:03:04.520> 35<00:03:05.090> eggs<00:03:05.470> look

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
think this female late like 35 eggs look

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.730 
think this female late like 35 eggs look
it<00:03:06.590> up<00:03:06.680> but<00:03:06.910> she<00:03:07.910> was<00:03:08.030> even<00:03:08.270> bigger<00:03:08.420> this<00:03:08.660> year
