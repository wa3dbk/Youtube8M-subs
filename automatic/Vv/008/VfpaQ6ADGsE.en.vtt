car so let's go find out what that
overboost<00:01:54.060> function<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:54.660> all<00:01:54.840> about<00:01:55.110> I

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
overboost function is all about I

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.690 
overboost function is all about I
wouldn't<00:01:58.229> be<00:01:58.290> surprised<00:01:58.710> at<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:58.950> zero<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.340> 60

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
wouldn't be surprised at that zero to 60

wouldn't be surprised at that zero to 60
down<00:01:59.910> is<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.120> bit<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.420> lot<00:02:00.630> they<00:02:01.440> say<00:02:01.620> five

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
down is a bit of a lot they say five
