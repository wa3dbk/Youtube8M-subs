powerful in this game a lot of people
have<00:02:58.780> been<00:02:59.020> comparing<00:02:59.590> this<00:02:59.830> sniper<00:03:00.160> rifle<00:03:00.670> to

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
have been comparing this sniper rifle to

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.900 
have been comparing this sniper rifle to
the<00:03:01.090> m40a5<00:03:02.010> that<00:03:03.010> we<00:03:03.160> last<00:03:03.400> saw<00:03:03.670> in

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
the m40a5 that we last saw in

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.520 
the m40a5 that we last saw in
battlefield<00:03:04.480> 4<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:04.810> they'd<00:03:04.900> be<00:03:04.959> right<00:03:05.080> to

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
battlefield 4 and they'd be right to

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.590 
battlefield 4 and they'd be right to
think<00:03:05.560> so<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:06.730> design<00:03:07.090> of<00:03:07.270> this<00:03:07.360> weapon

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
think so the design of this weapon

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.920 
think so the design of this weapon
itself<00:03:08.080> does<00:03:08.440> take<00:03:08.800> cues<00:03:09.220> from<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:10.030> m-40<00:03:10.690> line

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
itself does take cues from the m-40 line

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.680 
itself does take cues from the m-40 line
of<00:03:11.200> sniper<00:03:11.560> rifles<00:03:12.040> but<00:03:12.280> it<00:03:12.730> incorporates

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
of sniper rifles but it incorporates

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.330 
of sniper rifles but it incorporates
those<00:03:13.900> features<00:03:14.350> above<00:03:14.770> that<00:03:14.980> I've<00:03:15.130> just

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
those features above that I've just

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.220 
those features above that I've just
mentioned<00:03:15.640> which<00:03:16.060> makes<00:03:16.330> it<00:03:16.510> stand<00:03:16.720> out<00:03:16.959> a

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
mentioned which makes it stand out a

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.040 
mentioned which makes it stand out a
little<00:03:17.739> bit<00:03:17.920> more<00:03:18.250> it<00:03:18.970> is<00:03:19.150> worth<00:03:19.390> noting<00:03:19.840> that

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
little bit more it is worth noting that

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.949 
little bit more it is worth noting that
in<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.650> game<00:03:21.100> the<00:03:21.670> icon<00:03:22.180> that<00:03:22.300> was<00:03:22.420> available

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
in the game the icon that was available

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.760 
in the game the icon that was available
during<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.320> beta<00:03:23.650> was<00:03:24.550> for<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.390> m40a5<00:03:26.170> which

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
during the beta was for the m40a5 which

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.400 
during the beta was for the m40a5 which
might<00:03:27.130> be<00:03:27.340> why<00:03:27.520> people<00:03:28.030> who<00:03:28.540> like<00:03:28.810> this<00:03:29.110> rifle

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
might be why people who like this rifle

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.130 
might be why people who like this rifle
want<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.100> use<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.550> r700<00:03:31.120> so<00:03:31.660> much<00:03:31.870> other<00:03:32.110> than

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
want to use the r700 so much other than

want to use the r700 so much other than
I<00:03:32.290> was<00:03:32.739> just<00:03:32.920> in<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.130> beta<00:03:33.310> it<00:03:33.610> was<00:03:33.760> used<00:03:34.000> as<00:03:34.209> a

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
I was just in the beta it was used as a

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.470 
I was just in the beta it was used as a
placeholder<00:03:35.370> rate<00:03:36.370> of<00:03:36.519> fire<00:03:36.730> on<00:03:37.030> this<00:03:37.209> thing

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
placeholder rate of fire on this thing

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.960 
placeholder rate of fire on this thing
is<00:03:37.690> where<00:03:38.500> it<00:03:38.650> gets<00:03:38.890> a<00:03:39.070> little<00:03:39.100> bit<00:03:39.700> weak

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
is where it gets a little bit weak

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.240 
is where it gets a little bit weak
coming<00:03:40.480> in<00:03:40.570> at<00:03:40.690> only<00:03:40.780> 60<00:03:41.500> rounds<00:03:41.739> per<00:03:42.070> minute

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
coming in at only 60 rounds per minute

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.990 
coming in at only 60 rounds per minute
that's<00:03:43.000> nearly<00:03:43.480> 50%<00:03:44.410> slower<00:03:44.620> than<00:03:45.519> the<00:03:45.700> Scout

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
that's nearly 50% slower than the Scout

that<00:04:13.630> it<00:04:13.900> allows<00:04:14.230> you<00:04:14.500> to<00:04:15.070> hold<00:04:15.340> onto<00:04:15.549> an<00:04:15.790> area

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
that it allows you to hold onto an area

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.690 
that it allows you to hold onto an area
much<00:04:16.450> more<00:04:16.750> effectively<00:04:17.470> as<00:04:17.769> I<00:04:18.310> mentioned<00:04:18.640> if

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
much more effectively as I mentioned if

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.190 
much more effectively as I mentioned if
you're<00:04:18.820> taking<00:04:19.120> down<00:04:19.269> players<00:04:19.630> at<00:04:19.780> closer

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
you're taking down players at closer

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.290 
you're taking down players at closer
range<00:04:20.590> you<00:04:21.220> are<00:04:21.400> going<00:04:21.609> to<00:04:21.669> be<00:04:21.760> dropping<00:04:22.030> them

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
range you are going to be dropping them

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.290 
range you are going to be dropping them
in<00:04:22.479> one<00:04:22.780> hit<00:04:23.200> I<00:04:23.490> think<00:04:24.490> the<00:04:24.790> reason<00:04:25.150> that<00:04:25.180> I

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
in one hit I think the reason that I

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.230 
in one hit I think the reason that I
like<00:04:25.630> this<00:04:25.870> weapon<00:04:26.350> so<00:04:27.160> much<00:04:27.460> is<00:04:27.790> that<00:04:28.000> it

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
like this weapon so much is that it

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.480 
like this weapon so much is that it
seems<00:04:28.510> to<00:04:28.720> me<00:04:28.840> that<00:04:28.870> it<00:04:29.140> takes<00:04:29.380> far<00:04:29.800> more<00:04:30.070> skill

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
seems to me that it takes far more skill

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.730 
seems to me that it takes far more skill
to<00:04:30.760> take<00:04:31.450> somebody<00:04:31.930> out<00:04:31.960> with<00:04:32.290> it<00:04:32.470> I<00:04:32.560> mean

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
to take somebody out with it I mean

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.010 
to take somebody out with it I mean
unlike<00:04:33.220> the<00:04:33.400> Scout<00:04:33.700> elite<00:04:33.850> which<00:04:34.630> has<00:04:34.840> a

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
unlike the Scout elite which has a

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.960 
unlike the Scout elite which has a
ridiculous<00:04:35.650> rate<00:04:36.040> of<00:04:36.190> fire<00:04:36.430> where<00:04:36.669> you<00:04:36.790> can

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
ridiculous rate of fire where you can

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.420 
ridiculous rate of fire where you can
just<00:04:37.150> vault<00:04:37.450> bullets<00:04:37.870> downrange<00:04:38.410> not<00:04:39.130> care

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
just vault bullets downrange not care

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.130 
just vault bullets downrange not care
really<00:04:39.760> where<00:04:40.150> you<00:04:40.300> hit<00:04:40.539> somebody<00:04:40.840> whether

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
really where you hit somebody whether

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.239 
really where you hit somebody whether
it's<00:04:41.229> the<00:04:41.440> leg<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:41.890> arm

00:04:42.239 --> 00:04:42.249 
it's the leg the arm

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:44.639 
it's the leg the arm
body<00:04:42.519> it<00:04:42.669> doesn't<00:04:42.819> really<00:04:42.999> matter<00:04:43.239> and<00:04:43.649> within

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:52.469 
later you've got the kill with the r700
it<00:04:50.079> requires<00:04:50.469> you<00:04:50.709> to<00:04:50.739> be<00:04:51.009> more<00:04:51.729> precise<00:04:52.179> with
