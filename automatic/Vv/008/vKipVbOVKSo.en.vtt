00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
little prisms in there so let me cut the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.130 
little prisms in there so let me cut the
top<00:00:38.130> of<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.340> bag<00:00:38.489> open<00:00:38.760> let's<00:00:39.690> see<00:00:39.840> what<00:00:39.990> they

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
top of the bag open let's see what they

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.810 
top of the bag open let's see what they
say<00:00:40.350> here<00:00:40.500> milk<00:00:40.770> chocolate<00:00:41.310> cocoa<00:00:42.060> solids<00:00:42.600> oh

not much
so<00:00:45.800> we<00:00:46.800> must<00:00:46.980> cut<00:00:48.350> let's<00:00:49.350> see<00:00:49.560> what<00:00:49.710> they<00:00:49.830> look

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
so we must cut let's see what they look

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.640

one size so there's two sizes it looks
like<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.170> here<00:00:59.329> these<00:01:00.329> smaller<00:01:00.720> ones

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
like in here these smaller ones

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.700 
like in here these smaller ones
this<00:01:01.739> one<00:01:01.920> has<00:01:02.130> a<00:01:02.810> looks<00:01:03.810> to<00:01:03.960> be<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.290> can't<00:01:04.619> even

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
this one has a looks to be I can't even

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.160 
this one has a looks to be I can't even
tell<00:01:05.040> an<00:01:05.820> ornament<00:01:06.270> or<00:01:06.450> something<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:06.990> there

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
tell an ornament or something on there

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.880 
tell an ornament or something on there
can't<00:01:07.530> tell<00:01:08.090> and<00:01:09.090> then<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> tree<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.409> that's<00:01:10.590> one

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
can't tell and then a tree so that's one

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.330 
can't tell and then a tree so that's one
this<00:01:11.460> has<00:01:11.670> got<00:01:11.850> some<00:01:12.120> kind<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.450> leaf<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.340> then

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
this has got some kind of leaf and then

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.870 
this has got some kind of leaf and then
a<00:01:14.729> mistletoe<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.930> looks<00:01:16.110> like<00:01:16.400> so<00:01:17.400> that's<00:01:17.520> two

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
a mistletoe it looks like so that's two

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.280 
a mistletoe it looks like so that's two
styles<00:01:18.450> now<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:19.130> then<00:01:20.130> another<00:01:21.020> leaf<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.229> a

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
styles now and then another leaf and a

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.649 
styles now and then another leaf and a
mistletoe<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.040> looks<00:01:23.220> like<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:24.210> common

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
mistletoe so that looks like the common

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.940 
mistletoe so that looks like the common
trend<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.260> the<00:01:25.920> big<00:01:26.130> one<00:01:26.340> has<00:01:27.060> another<00:01:27.950> so

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
trend and the big one has another so

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.100 
trend and the big one has another so
that<00:01:29.130> repeats<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.820> small<00:01:30.150> one<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.630> bet<00:01:30.840> you

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
that repeats the small one so I bet you

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.240 
that repeats the small one so I bet you
we're<00:01:31.979> gonna<00:01:32.100> find<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.790> big<00:01:32.970> one<00:01:33.150> here<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.600> has

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
we're gonna find a big one here that has

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.609 
we're gonna find a big one here that has
we're<00:01:35.250> not<00:01:35.570> all<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.780> big<00:01:36.930> ones<00:01:37.080> seem<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.530> be

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
we're not all the big ones seem to be

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.600 
we're not all the big ones seem to be
the<00:01:37.799> same<00:01:39.979> there's<00:01:40.979> no<00:01:41.040> difference<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
the same there's no difference in the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.100 
the same there's no difference in the
big<00:01:41.790> ones<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.090> we<00:01:42.180> had<00:01:42.299> two<00:01:42.510> different<00:01:42.540> small

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
big ones so we had two different small

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.280 
big ones so we had two different small
ones<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.590> one<00:01:44.280> different<00:01:44.729> big<00:01:44.909> one<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:46.110> let's

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
ones in one different big one so let's

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.810 
ones in one different big one so let's
take<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> look<00:01:46.680> inside<00:01:52.070> nice<00:01:53.070> they're<00:01:53.430> stamped

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
take a look inside nice they're stamped

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.960 
take a look inside nice they're stamped
with<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.330> design<00:01:55.490> let's<00:01:56.490> check<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> back

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
with the design let's check the back

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:03.760 
with the design let's check the back
side<00:01:58.880> yep<00:01:59.880> same<00:02:00.150> thing<00:02:02.240> might<00:02:03.240> as<00:02:03.299> well<00:02:03.420> use

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
side yep same thing might as well use

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.679 
side yep same thing might as well use
while<00:02:04.770> I'm<00:02:04.950> here<00:02:05.189> but<00:02:06.150> here's<00:02:06.330> the<00:02:06.420> ones<00:02:06.600> that

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
while I'm here but here's the ones that

while I'm here but here's the ones that
I<00:02:06.780> made<00:02:09.739> of<00:02:10.739> course<00:02:11.330> that<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.480> good

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
I made of course that is good

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.550 
I made of course that is good
I<00:02:13.620> haven't<00:02:14.280> made<00:02:14.370> one<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.760> put<00:02:14.940> LPS<00:02:15.810> on<00:02:18.560> so

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
I haven't made one that I put LPS on so

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.660 
I haven't made one that I put LPS on so
