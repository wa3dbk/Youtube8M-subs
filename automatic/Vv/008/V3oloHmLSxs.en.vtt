strong if you do not have a roll cage
the<00:00:52.379> system<00:00:53.100> what<00:00:53.219> will<00:00:53.370> flex<00:00:53.640> much<00:00:53.910> more<00:00:54.180> okay

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
the system what will flex much more okay

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.840 
the system what will flex much more okay
and<00:00:54.750> then<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.050> will<00:00:55.230> actually<00:00:55.410> cost<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.190> mother

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
and then you will actually cost a mother

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.610 
and then you will actually cost a mother

bought failure case this year we are

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.470 
bought failure case this year we are
introducing<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.250> thing<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.059> precision

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
introducing the thing the precision

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.450 
introducing the thing the precision
keyboard<00:01:01.079> we<00:01:01.289> call<00:01:01.469> precision<00:01:01.680> keyboard<00:01:02.340> is

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
keyboard we call precision keyboard is

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.990 
keyboard we call precision keyboard is
based<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.229> island<00:01:04.229> style<00:01:04.530> or<00:01:04.830> some<00:01:05.430> will

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
based on the island style or some will

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.030 
based on the island style or some will
like<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.240> call<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.720> chiclet<00:01:06.960> keyboard<00:01:07.560> so

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
like to call it a chiclet keyboard so

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.750 
like to call it a chiclet keyboard so
the<00:01:08.549> difference<00:01:09.060> from<00:01:09.780> our<00:01:10.310> keyboard<00:01:11.310> cake

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
the difference from our keyboard cake

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.340 
the difference from our keyboard cake
compared<00:01:12.180> with<00:01:12.270> other<00:01:12.479> brands<00:01:12.869> are<00:01:12.990> actually

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
compared with other brands are actually

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.190 
compared with other brands are actually
the<00:01:13.470> tactile<00:01:13.920> feel<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.479> classic<00:01:15.990> thing

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
the tactile feel that the classic thing

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.010 
the tactile feel that the classic thing
pad<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:16.560> okay<00:01:17.159> even<00:01:17.549> though<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:18.540> looks

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
pad have okay even though it looks

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.350 
pad have okay even though it looks
similar<00:01:19.710> okay<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.369> when<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.700> feel<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
similar okay but when you feel on the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.480 
similar okay but when you feel on the
typing<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.290> actually<00:01:22.619> there's<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.070> tactile

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
typing is actually there's a tactile

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.820 
typing is actually there's a tactile
feel<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.990> fan<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
feel to it this is the fan of the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.030 
feel to it this is the fan of the
default<00:01:26.340> 30s<00:01:26.970> okay<00:01:27.689> as<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.290> can<00:01:28.439> see<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.829> one

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
default 30s okay as you can see this one

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.840 
default 30s okay as you can see this one
is<00:01:29.070> made<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.579> copper<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.390> couple<00:01:31.259> transmit<00:01:31.850> hot

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
is made of copper a couple transmit hot

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.450 
is made of copper a couple transmit hot
air<00:01:33.060> more<00:01:33.450> efficiently<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.380> what<00:01:35.040> we<00:01:35.189> have

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
air more efficiently and what we have

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.870 
air more efficiently and what we have
here<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.970> we<00:01:36.299> have<00:01:36.479> multiple<00:01:37.320> exhaust<00:01:38.040> okay<00:01:38.579> so

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
here is we have multiple exhaust okay so

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.330 
here is we have multiple exhaust okay so
it<00:01:39.090> will<00:01:39.270> actually<00:01:39.390> channel<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.619> hot<00:01:41.040> air<00:01:41.189> out

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
it will actually channel the hot air out

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.319 
it will actually channel the hot air out
more<00:01:41.610> efficiently<00:01:42.119> we<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:42.899> an<00:01:43.049> anti-static

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
more efficiently we have an anti-static

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.420 
more efficiently we have an anti-static
anti<00:01:45.329> static<00:01:45.570> discharge<00:01:46.200> feature<00:01:46.470> okay

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
anti static discharge feature okay

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.050 
anti static discharge feature okay
so<00:01:47.880> what<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.329> do<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.720> ensure<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:50.399> dust

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
so what this do is ensure that the dust

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.120 
so what this do is ensure that the dust
gain<00:01:51.479> normally<00:01:51.899> after<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.229> few<00:01:52.619> years<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.920> usage

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
gain normally after a few years of usage

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.120 
gain normally after a few years of usage
dust<00:01:53.759> will<00:01:53.939> be<00:01:54.090> collected<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.439> fan<00:01:55.829> blades

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
dust will be collected on the fan blades

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.490 
dust will be collected on the fan blades
as<00:01:56.430> well<00:01:56.670> as<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.969> vents<00:01:57.299> okay<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.380> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
as well as the vents okay so the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.139 
as well as the vents okay so the
discharge<00:01:58.680> feeds<00:01:59.130> over<00:01:59.280> actually<00:01:59.700> ensure

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
discharge feeds over actually ensure

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.160 
discharge feeds over actually ensure
that<00:02:00.180> all<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.630> fans<00:02:00.869> all<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.950> dust<00:02:02.310> are<00:02:02.610> being

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
that all the fans all the dust are being

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.660 
that all the fans all the dust are being
discharged<00:02:04.170> more<00:02:04.549> efficiently

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
discharged more efficiently

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.020 
discharged more efficiently
thus<00:02:06.329> your<00:02:06.630> fan<00:02:07.049> will<00:02:07.259> always<00:02:08.250> be<00:02:08.429> clean

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
thus your fan will always be clean

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.639 
thus your fan will always be clean
and<00:02:09.209> then<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.660> will<00:02:09.840> actually<00:02:09.959> more

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
and then this will actually more

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.559 
and then this will actually more
