00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
volcano stove to kind of protect it I've

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.330 
volcano stove to kind of protect it I've
opened<00:00:59.710> it<00:01:00.010> up<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:02.230> has<00:01:02.530> gone<00:01:02.680> to<00:01:02.890> Crystal

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
opened it up this has gone to Crystal

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.010 
opened it up this has gone to Crystal
also<00:01:03.789> I<00:01:04.000> don't<00:01:04.150> know<00:01:04.240> if<00:01:04.300> you<00:01:04.450> can<00:01:04.600> see<00:01:04.900> it

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.020 
also I don't know if you can see it

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.000 
also I don't know if you can see it
around<00:01:05.710> the<00:01:06.040> outside<00:01:06.490> edge<00:01:06.730> the<00:01:07.890> something<00:01:08.890> is

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
around the outside edge the something is

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.440 
around the outside edge the something is
separated<00:01:09.550> from<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.850> cubes<00:01:10.530> from<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.680> bar

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
separated from the cubes from the bar

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.370 
separated from the cubes from the bar
put<00:01:13.450> that<00:01:13.630> in<00:01:13.840> there<00:01:14.020> I<00:01:15.750> go<00:01:16.750> from<00:01:16.990> one<00:01:17.140> side<00:01:17.320> to

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
put that in there I go from one side to

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.870 
put that in there I go from one side to
the<00:01:17.620> next<00:01:18.630> see<00:01:19.630> if<00:01:19.720> I<00:01:19.840> can<00:01:19.990> put<00:01:20.170> these<00:01:20.880> little

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
the next see if I can put these little

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:31.800 
the next see if I can put these little
pieces<00:01:22.210> in<00:01:22.600> there<00:01:26.400> okay<00:01:30.090> I've<00:01:31.090> got<00:01:31.270> 2<00:01:31.450> cups<00:01:31.660> of

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
pieces in there okay I've got 2 cups of

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:39.510 
pieces in there okay I've got 2 cups of
water<00:01:32.050> here<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:36.600> bottle<00:01:37.600> I<00:01:38.430> figured<00:01:39.430> I'd

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
water here in the bottle I figured I'd

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.580 
water here in the bottle I figured I'd
do<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.820> worst<00:01:40.000> case<00:01:40.270> scenario<00:01:40.810> first<00:01:41.140> in<00:01:41.410> case

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
do the worst case scenario first in case

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.090 
do the worst case scenario first in case
this<00:01:41.860> does<00:01:42.130> work<00:01:42.510> rather<00:01:43.510> than<00:01:43.840> doing<00:01:44.020> one<00:01:44.380> cup

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
this does work rather than doing one cup

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:56.910 
this does work rather than doing one cup
first<00:01:47.940> let's<00:01:48.940> light<00:01:49.300> this<00:01:55.530> yep<00:01:56.530> there<00:01:56.710> you<00:01:56.740> can

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
first let's light this yep there you can

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.770 
first let's light this yep there you can
see<00:01:57.130> it<00:01:57.360> put<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.480> two<00:01:58.630> cups<00:01:58.930> in

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:49.700 

and<00:02:02.780> let's<00:02:03.020> see<00:02:03.200> where<00:02:03.380> this<00:02:03.470> goes

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.610 

I<00:02:50.630> don't<00:02:51.630> know<00:02:51.690> what<00:02:51.840> it's<00:02:51.990> doing<00:02:52.080> here<00:02:52.470> now

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
I don't know what it's doing here now

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.180 
I don't know what it's doing here now
but<00:02:52.800> it's<00:02:52.920> giving<00:02:53.190> off<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.310> bunch<00:02:53.640> of<00:02:53.790> smoke

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
but it's giving off a bunch of smoke

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.520 
but it's giving off a bunch of smoke
looks<00:02:56.190> like<00:02:56.370> it's<00:02:56.550> just<00:02:56.610> about<00:02:56.850> ready<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.240> end

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
looks like it's just about ready to end

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.930 
looks like it's just about ready to end
that's<00:02:58.530> what<00:02:59.070> I'm<00:02:59.130> going<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.340> say<00:02:59.520> five

it's getting up to 156 with the residual

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:48.750 
it's getting up to 156 with the residual
heat<00:03:37.490> still<00:03:38.490> going<00:03:38.790> up<00:03:39.080> 157

alright<00:03:49.450> let's<00:03:49.659> say<00:03:49.780> 157<00:03:50.739> as<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.879> top<00:03:52.090> heat

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
alright let's say 157 as the top heat

00:03:52.420 --> 00:04:01.080 
alright let's say 157 as the top heat
here<00:03:54.360> now<00:03:55.360> it's<00:03:55.750> up<00:03:55.840> to<00:03:55.870> 158<00:03:59.730> just<00:04:00.730> doesn't

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
minutes with one bar of trioxane of

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.059 
minutes with one bar of trioxane of
course<00:04:11.860> I<00:04:11.980> was<00:04:12.129> made<00:04:12.310> it<00:04:12.489> back<00:04:12.640> in<00:04:12.819> 82<00:04:13.829> 2<00:04:14.829> cups
