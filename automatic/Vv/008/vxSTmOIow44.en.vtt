when<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:12.900> get<00:02:13.020> older<00:02:13.349> when<00:02:13.530> you

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
when you get older when you

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.339 
when you get older when you
you<00:02:14.099> learn<00:02:14.280> about<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.849> game<00:02:15.200> tactically<00:02:16.200> and

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
you learn about the game tactically and

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.740 
you learn about the game tactically and
positionally<00:02:17.069> and<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.269> know<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.540> they

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
positionally and so you know that they

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.360 
positionally and so you know that they
bring<00:02:19.319> players<00:02:19.530> up<00:02:19.799> in<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.040> right<00:02:20.190> way<00:02:20.340> I

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
bring players up in the right way I

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.520 
bring players up in the right way I
think<00:02:20.489> and<00:02:20.909> obviously<00:02:21.569> that's<00:02:21.750> that's<00:02:22.230> proved

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
think and obviously that's that's proved

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.860 
think and obviously that's that's proved
whether<00:02:22.799> they<00:02:22.890> brought<00:02:23.220> Theo<00:02:23.569> Gareth<00:02:24.569> and

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
whether they brought Theo Gareth and

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.210 
whether they brought Theo Gareth and
some<00:02:25.110> other<00:02:25.260> really<00:02:25.500> good<00:02:25.680> players<00:02:25.950> through

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220
