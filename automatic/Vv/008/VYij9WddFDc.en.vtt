guess it's like a symphonic song it's in
every<00:01:09.210> Halo<00:01:09.390> game<00:01:09.600> she's<00:01:09.780> really<00:01:09.960> cool<00:01:10.080> it's

just want to walk all the way up here in
the<00:01:13.080> music<00:01:13.470> starts<00:01:13.799> playing<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.310> also

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
the music starts playing and you also

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.609 
the music starts playing and you also
get<00:01:14.760> an<00:01:14.880> achievement<00:01:14.970> now<00:01:15.689> keep<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.110> mind<00:01:16.350> it's

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
get an achievement now keep in mind it's

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.200 
get an achievement now keep in mind it's
really<00:01:17.009> hard<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.340> hear<00:01:17.490> unless<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.880> finish<00:01:18.060> a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
really hard to hear unless you finish a

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.940 
really hard to hear unless you finish a
scarab<00:01:18.570> mission<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.020> highly<00:01:19.290> suggest<00:01:19.560> that

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
scarab mission so I highly suggest that

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.980 
scarab mission so I highly suggest that
you<00:01:20.220> kill<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.610> Scarab<00:01:21.030> then<00:01:21.420> get<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.689> Hornet

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
you kill the Scarab then get the Hornet

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.120 
you kill the Scarab then get the Hornet
and<00:01:22.049> come<00:01:22.170> over<00:01:22.259> here<00:01:22.470> sitting<00:01:22.590> here<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> song

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
and come over here sitting here the song

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.429 
and come over here sitting here the song
but<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.970> really<00:01:24.299> takes<00:01:24.600> sometimes<00:01:25.020> kind<00:01:25.350> of

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
but it really takes sometimes kind of

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.929 
but it really takes sometimes kind of
just<00:01:25.590> sit<00:01:25.740> here<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.159> was<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.610> waiting<00:01:26.790> for

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
just sit here I was just waiting for
