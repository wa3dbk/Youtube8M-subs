00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
in the delay they've kind of thoughts

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.710 
in the delay they've kind of thoughts
themselves<00:02:32.490> hey<00:02:32.670> wait<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:32.910> minute<00:02:33.180> maybe<00:02:33.450> we

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
themselves hey wait a minute maybe we

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.990 
themselves hey wait a minute maybe we
didn't<00:02:34.020> break<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:34.410> game<00:02:34.620> high<00:02:34.950> enough<00:02:35.250> and

didn't break this game high enough and

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.370 
didn't break this game high enough and
maybe<00:02:36.150> they<00:02:36.390> didn't<00:02:36.690> from<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.960> sounds<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.290> it

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380

have<00:02:39.390> actually<00:02:39.480> played<00:02:39.750> this<00:02:40.080> title<00:02:40.500> yet<00:02:40.710> but

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
have actually played this title yet but

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.010 
have actually played this title yet but
it'll<00:02:41.640> be<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.880> little<00:02:42.090> bit<00:02:42.240> surprising<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:42.870> me

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
it'll be a little bit surprising to me

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.010 
it'll be a little bit surprising to me
if<00:02:43.110> games<00:02:43.410> like<00:02:43.650> watch<00:02:43.920> dogs<00:02:43.950> was<00:02:44.520> rated<00:02:45.480> 15

if games like watch dogs was rated 15
here<00:02:46.350> in<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.560> UK<00:02:46.770> instead<00:02:47.340> of<00:02:47.430> 18<00:02:47.880> that<00:02:48.150> would

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
here in the UK instead of 18 that would

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.150 
here in the UK instead of 18 that would
be<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.390> little<00:02:48.630> bit<00:02:48.810> surprising<00:02:49.290> given<00:02:50.040> that

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
be a little bit surprising given that

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.890 
be a little bit surprising given that
it's<00:02:50.370> all<00:02:50.459> that<00:02:50.610> open-world<00:02:51.060> sandbox<00:02:51.420> II

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
it's all that open-world sandbox II

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.420 
it's all that open-world sandbox II
title<00:02:52.290> that's<00:02:52.709> probably<00:02:53.010> going<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.280> have<00:02:53.370> a

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
title that's probably going to have a

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.940 
title that's probably going to have a
lot<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:53.730> violence<00:02:54.300> so<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.290> little<00:02:55.800> bit

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
lot of violence so a little bit

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.350 
lot of violence so a little bit
surprising<00:02:56.370> that<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.700> decided<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.209> change

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
surprising that the decided to change

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.970 
surprising that the decided to change
their<00:02:57.570> minds<00:02:57.840> but<00:02:57.959> maybe<00:02:58.170> for<00:02:58.380> once<00:02:58.560> they

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
their minds but maybe for once they

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.710 
their minds but maybe for once they
aren't<00:02:59.610> being<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.910> little<00:03:00.090> bit<00:03:00.270> silly<00:03:00.480> like

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
aren't being a little bit silly like

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.460 
aren't being a little bit silly like
they<00:03:00.810> normally<00:03:00.959> do<00:03:01.230> with<00:03:01.350> their

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
they normally do with their

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.949 
they normally do with their
classifications<00:03:02.330> anyway<00:03:03.330> that<00:03:03.540> is<00:03:03.570> me<00:03:03.750> done

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
classifications anyway that is me done

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.780
