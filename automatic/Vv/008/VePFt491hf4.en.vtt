for<00:03:34.340> lmq<00:03:35.340> at<00:03:35.580> this<00:03:35.730> point<00:03:35.940> in<00:03:36.030> time<00:03:36.180> because<00:03:36.450> I

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
for lmq at this point in time because I

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:43.780 
for lmq at this point in time because I
think<00:03:37.770> that<00:03:39.860> they<00:03:41.780> very<00:03:42.780> well<00:03:42.870> could<00:03:43.020> end<00:03:43.560> up

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
think that they very well could end up

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.510 
think that they very well could end up
having<00:03:44.790> some<00:03:45.560> legal<00:03:46.560> issues<00:03:46.710> because<00:03:47.250> of<00:03:47.400> all

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
having some legal issues because of all

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.660 
having some legal issues because of all
this<00:03:48.860> something<00:03:49.860> to<00:03:49.950> do<00:03:50.070> maybe<00:03:50.250> with<00:03:50.550> the

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
this something to do maybe with the

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.320 
this something to do maybe with the
visas<00:03:51.000> or<00:03:52.100> with<00:03:53.100> their<00:03:53.340> eligibility<00:03:53.850> to<00:03:54.060> be<00:03:54.240> in

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
visas or with their eligibility to be in

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.310 
visas or with their eligibility to be in
the<00:03:54.420> LCS<00:03:54.810> so<00:03:55.320> I<00:03:55.710> think<00:03:56.370> that<00:03:56.550> this<00:03:56.670> is<00:03:56.820> a<00:03:56.850> really

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
the LCS so I think that this is a really

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.170 
the LCS so I think that this is a really
really<00:03:58.320> lengthy<00:03:58.800> report<00:03:58.980> on<00:03:59.340> it<00:03:59.520> I've<00:03:59.850> got<00:04:00.150> a
