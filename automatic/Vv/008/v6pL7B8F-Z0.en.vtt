00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
really loved the PSG so I said this one

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.450

is<00:00:45.539> for<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.559> basically<00:00:46.739> did<00:00:47.430> a

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
is for you and I basically did a

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.369 
is for you and I basically did a
free-for-all<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.750> had<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.020> get<00:00:49.170> used<00:00:49.260> to

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
free-for-all and I had to get used to

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.010 
free-for-all and I had to get used to
the<00:00:49.500> sniper<00:00:49.739> because<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.460> mean<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.600> is

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
the sniper because I mean it is

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.670 
the sniper because I mean it is
different<00:00:52.620> than<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.980> l96<00:00:53.579> it's<00:00:53.789> lighter<00:00:54.090> it

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
different than the l96 it's lighter it

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.319 
different than the l96 it's lighter it
shoots<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.829> lot<00:00:55.980> quicker<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.670> think<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.270> a

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
shoots a lot quicker I think it's a

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.260 
shoots a lot quicker I think it's a
little<00:00:57.390> bit<00:00:57.539> more<00:00:57.719> accurate<00:00:58.350> um<00:00:58.559> as<00:00:59.520> far<00:00:59.879> as<00:01:00.090> it

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
little bit more accurate um as far as it

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.700 
little bit more accurate um as far as it
being<00:01:00.300> as<00:01:00.870> strong<00:01:01.230> as<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.949> l96<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.750> does<00:01:04.470> have

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
being as strong as the l96 it does have

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.679 
being as strong as the l96 it does have
is<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.129> times<00:01:05.610> where<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:05.970> just<00:01:06.119> feels<00:01:06.330> like<00:01:06.390> is

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
is is times where it just feels like is

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.270 
is is times where it just feels like is
getting<00:01:06.930> hit<00:01:07.110> markers<00:01:07.439> but<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.770> maybe<00:01:07.979> just

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
getting hit markers but that maybe just

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.219 
getting hit markers but that maybe just

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.729 
and I was trying to get the hang of it
man<00:03:57.910> i<00:03:57.940> was<00:03:58.269> going<00:03:58.510> negative<00:03:58.750> i<00:03:59.410> couldn't

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
man i was going negative i couldn't

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.500 
man i was going negative i couldn't
really<00:03:59.890> handle<00:04:00.190> it<00:04:00.489> you<00:04:00.700> don't<00:04:00.880> have<00:04:00.910> sand<00:04:01.180> it

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
really handle it you don't have sand it

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.680 
really handle it you don't have sand it
my<00:04:02.170> Katie<00:04:02.440> didn't<00:04:02.769> really<00:04:03.070> didn't<00:04:03.790> like<00:04:03.910> it

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
my Katie didn't really didn't like it

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.210 
my Katie didn't really didn't like it
bounced<00:04:05.080> back<00:04:05.260> and<00:04:05.620> i'm<00:04:05.680> still<00:04:05.920> trying<00:04:06.130> to
