Firebird and we're here what we've done

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.189 
Firebird and we're here what we've done
is<00:00:20.460> level<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.970> frame<00:00:21.240> we<00:00:21.660> started<00:00:21.990> out<00:00:22.080> we

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
is level the frame we started out we

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.480 
is level the frame we started out we
stripped<00:00:22.470> all<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.680> sheet<00:00:22.890> metal<00:00:22.920> off<00:00:23.220> pulled

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
stripped all the sheet metal off pulled

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.320 
stripped all the sheet metal off pulled
the<00:00:23.580> motor<00:00:23.760> out

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
the motor out

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.179 
the motor out
it<00:00:25.019> had<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.310> 390<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.580> an<00:00:26.849> engine<00:00:27.539> adapter<00:00:28.189> it

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
it had a 390 in it an engine adapter it

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.770 
it had a 390 in it an engine adapter it
wasn't<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.670> original<00:00:29.849> motor<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:32.540> so<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.570> had

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
wasn't the original motor and so I had

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.959 
wasn't the original motor and so I had
another<00:00:33.989> crossmember<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.520> pulled<00:00:35.790> that

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
another crossmember in it we pulled that

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.790 
another crossmember in it we pulled that
out<00:00:36.210> we're<00:00:36.899> gonna<00:00:36.960> have<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.320> remove<00:00:37.559> that

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
out we're gonna have to remove that

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.319 
out we're gonna have to remove that
crossmember<00:00:38.489> because<00:00:38.670> that's<00:00:38.879> going<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.180> get

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
crossmember because that's going to get

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.590 
crossmember because that's going to get

all different points of the chassis we

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.950 
all different points of the chassis we
need<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> longer<00:01:08.100> level<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.909> one<00:01:09.150> want

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960
