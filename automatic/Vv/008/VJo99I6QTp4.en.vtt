 yes will measure my on the prime minister 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:08.670
 Israel bends its line 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.690
 some words iran not stop some 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.360
 sanctions 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.759
 Iran does not stop sanctions should be 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.550
 backed by clear and real military 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.070
 threats in case diplomacy and 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.939
 sanctions will not work 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.220
 categorical statement by 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.199
 leaders in the animated new example with 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.789
 netanyahu warned him 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.460
 american israeli committee on 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.470
 public relations negotiating iran 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.600
 just trying to gain time to 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.880
 continue working on the nuclear program 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.420
 such statements no longer sound 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.989
 first time 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:44.940
 aristov how to stop them need to be strengthened 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.100
 pressure need to tighten sanctions in 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.379
 Israel should be aware that if 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.480
 sanctions and diplomacy will not work 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.570
 they run into real military 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.460
 threatening it is necessary 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:01.949
 other options will not bring results 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.899
 and the threat is approaching after the January 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.330
 election prince from many sighed with 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.310
 relief unexpected victory for the party 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.590
 centrist and peace advocates gave reason 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.080
 believing that netanyahu would give up 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.060
 threats to attack iran ask people 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.130
 voted against netanyahu 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.350
 they think they have expressed their thoughts 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.250
 clearly enough to those who threaten 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.530
 attack Iran 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.540
 you need to remove the trigger finger and try 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.920
 solve the problem by economic 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.990
 sanctions and diplomacy 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.060
 but analysts are not sure that Netanyahu 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.020
 going to change my rhetoric 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.970
 on stakes at is in maine we calculate from 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.250
 netanyahu is very concerned about his place in 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.420
 stories he is well aware that this 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.579
 his third term in office 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.040
 prime minister afraid that aspiration 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.840
 to attack Iran he is guided in that 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.420
 number and the desire to enter your name in 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.000
 history of the israeli people stem cells 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.909
 is it if you are auto due or 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.490
 pips and it makes the Israelites 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.860
 nervous about daniel ben ari 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.390
 sells a bomb shelter ventilation system 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.360
 in case of chemical or biological 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.850
 attacks he says whenever 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.399
 netanyahu mentions iran demand for it 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.979
 production starts to grow 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.049
 heym some others prefer not 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.239
 think about the threat but it exists and about 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.220
 this is why customers know 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.930
 just call to find out about the system 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.060
 although they still cannot buy it 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.560
 about some the situation worries more and 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.450
 as soon as the media report some 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.470
 tensions they call and order 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.409
 imagine such a system 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.920
 oh well fuck i need a purse from me 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:34.650
 they were not given a war by profitable business and 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.799
 Israel is the real problem on 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.840
 such things are spent a lot of money on 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.519
 throne and 3 israeli 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.129
 graphic designer who is unexpected 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.109
 created a whole online movement for yourself 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.540
 posting to facebook that 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.549
 Israel will never bomb Iran 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.849
 other residents of Israel soon created 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.950
 own posters with the same content 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:58.049
 the Iranians responded in the same way they 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.720
 oppose netanyahu and wherever 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.609
 more powerful signals 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.250
 big power I think in many ways people vote 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.810
 against netanyahu for fear they fear 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.549
 what will be the war and he's a man 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.720
 who will wage this war 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.699
 infinite reasoning is possible 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.650
 Israeli attack against Iran also 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:18.930
 scare foreign investors off 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.730
 many situation causes concern 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.290
 someone can bring a big war 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.319
 income but for others 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.859
 it means a catastrophe floor slier rt 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.859
