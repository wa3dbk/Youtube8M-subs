00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
all the kind of jobs they claim they

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.110 
all the kind of jobs they claim they
provide<00:01:16.900> are<00:01:17.260> the<00:01:17.770> lowest<00:01:18.100> end<00:01:18.460> job<00:01:18.790> they<00:01:18.970> can

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
provide are the lowest end job they can

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.210 
provide are the lowest end job they can
possibly<00:01:19.300> get<00:01:19.750> and<00:01:20.260> so<00:01:20.409> the<00:01:20.530> local<00:01:20.800> economy

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
possibly get and so the local economy

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.100 
possibly get and so the local economy
suffers<00:01:21.610> because<00:01:21.760> of<00:01:21.970> that<00:01:22.150> it<00:01:22.659> may<00:01:22.840> not<00:01:22.990> be

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
suffers because of that it may not be

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.840 
suffers because of that it may not be
very<00:01:23.170> noticeable<00:01:23.799> but<00:01:24.070> it's<00:01:24.220> definitely<00:01:24.729> the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
very noticeable but it's definitely the

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.360 
very noticeable but it's definitely the
case<00:01:24.880> so<00:01:25.720> that's<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.440> biggest<00:01:26.680> reason<00:01:27.190> for

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
case so that's the biggest reason for

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.149 
case so that's the biggest reason for
the<00:01:27.790> for<00:01:28.120> the<00:01:28.240> society<00:01:28.960> you<00:01:29.530> want<00:01:29.770> to<00:01:29.979> have

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
the for the society you want to have

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.270 
the for the society you want to have
local<00:01:30.790> available<00:01:31.420> but<00:01:32.170> the<00:01:32.920> biggest<00:01:33.130> reason

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
local available but the biggest reason

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.010 
local available but the biggest reason
is<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.760> consumer<00:01:34.330> you<00:01:34.420> want<00:01:34.570> to<00:01:34.630> have<00:01:34.720> locally

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
is the consumer you want to have locally

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.630 
is the consumer you want to have locally
available<00:01:35.080> is<00:01:35.350> because<00:01:35.649> it<00:01:35.770> tastes<00:01:36.100> way<00:01:36.340> way

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
available is because it tastes way way

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.179 
available is because it tastes way way
way<00:01:36.820> better<00:01:37.200> because<00:01:38.200> when<00:01:38.619> we're<00:01:38.799> picking<00:01:39.130> a

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
way better because when we're picking a

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:40.859

to make a really tasty finished product

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.419 
to make a really tasty finished product
aren't<00:02:08.320> available

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
aren't available

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.699 
aren't available
so<00:02:10.000> whenever<00:02:10.810> you're<00:02:11.019> buying<00:02:11.200> local<00:02:11.560> you're

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
so whenever you're buying local you're

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.069 
so whenever you're buying local you're
buying<00:02:11.920> full<00:02:12.129> flavor<00:02:12.370> after<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:13.060> while<00:02:13.780> they

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:14.079 
buying full flavor after a while they

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:16.020 
buying full flavor after a while they
get<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.349> milder<00:02:14.650> global<00:02:15.010> producer<00:02:15.549> and<00:02:15.970> they

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
get to milder global producer and they

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.880 
get to milder global producer and they
start<00:02:16.269> to<00:02:16.450> create<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.810> relationship<00:02:17.230> with<00:02:17.739> them

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
start to create a relationship with them

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.729 
start to create a relationship with them
and<00:02:18.010> then<00:02:18.790> you<00:02:18.939> get<00:02:19.060> an<00:02:19.180> urban<00:02:19.720> girl<00:02:19.959> divide

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
and then you get an urban girl divide

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.890 
and then you get an urban girl divide
that<00:02:21.040> is<00:02:21.189> bridged<00:02:21.629> because<00:02:22.629> then<00:02:22.780> the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
that is bridged because then the

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.660 
that is bridged because then the
consumer<00:02:23.409> starts<00:02:23.709> to<00:02:23.799> understand<00:02:24.189> when<00:02:24.489> and

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
consumer starts to understand when and

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.580 
consumer starts to understand when and
how<00:02:24.819> and<00:02:25.060> why<00:02:25.239> their<00:02:25.780> product<00:02:26.200> comes<00:02:26.379> into

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
how and why their product comes into

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.750 
how and why their product comes into
