00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
ranger that I've got and saw in one of

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.060 
ranger that I've got and saw in one of
my<00:00:10.800> very<00:00:10.980> first<00:00:11.250> videos<00:00:12.710> it's<00:00:13.710> been<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.889> great

truck so far it's got a hundred and
eighty-six<00:00:16.800> thousand<00:00:17.279> on<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.930> I'm<00:00:18.930> just

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
eighty-six thousand on it I'm just

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:27.290 
eighty-six thousand on it I'm just
putting<00:00:19.350> some<00:00:19.470> new<00:00:19.710> plugs<00:00:25.820> the<00:00:26.820> old<00:00:26.939> ones<00:00:27.150> are

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
putting some new plugs the old ones are

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.259 
putting some new plugs the old ones are
pretty<00:00:27.449> beat<00:00:27.750> up<00:00:27.779> but<00:00:28.519> got<00:00:29.519> some<00:00:29.699> new<00:00:29.849> ones<00:00:30.060> on

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
pretty beat up but got some new ones on

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.120 
pretty beat up but got some new ones on
and<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.779> was<00:00:30.900> having<00:00:31.050> an<00:00:31.260> issue<00:00:31.410> where<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:31.920> was<00:00:32.099> a

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
and I was having an issue where it was a

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.010 
and I was having an issue where it was a
misfiring<00:00:32.880> every<00:00:33.239> time<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.450> would<00:00:33.660> accelerate

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
misfiring every time I would accelerate

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.470 
misfiring every time I would accelerate
I<00:00:34.440> thought<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.520> was<00:00:35.610> my<00:00:35.730> timing<00:00:36.149> chain<00:00:36.360> at

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
I thought it was my timing chain at

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.930 
I thought it was my timing chain at
first<00:00:36.780> but<00:00:37.559> then<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.800> got<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.399> thinking<00:00:38.430> about

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
first but then I got to thinking about

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.110 
first but then I got to thinking about
it<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.960> old<00:00:40.110> ones<00:00:40.410> were<00:00:41.000> really<00:00:42.000> bad

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
it and the old ones were really bad

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.010 
it and the old ones were really bad
condition<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.719> last<00:00:42.899> time<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.110> checked<00:00:43.230> I

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
condition the last time I checked I

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.549 
condition the last time I checked I
meant<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.110> replace<00:00:46.440> them<00:00:48.140> let's<00:00:49.140> see<00:00:49.350> when

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
meant to replace them let's see when

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.680 
meant to replace them let's see when
when<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.039> put<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.309> spark<00:00:50.640> plugs<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:51.149> two<00:00:51.510> months

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
when I put the spark plugs in two months

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.470 
when I put the spark plugs in two months
ago<00:00:51.930> but<00:00:52.920> these<00:00:53.100> are<00:00:53.250> actually<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.640> really<00:00:54.059> bad

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
ago but these are actually in really bad

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.139 
ago but these are actually in really bad
condition<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.469> was<00:00:56.190> surprised<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.760> how<00:00:56.879> bad

aftermarket tachometer i installed it
works<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> champ<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:24.420> fact<00:01:24.630> what<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.259> hell

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
works like a champ in fact what the hell

works like a champ in fact what the hell
started<00:01:26.009> up<00:01:26.159> right<00:01:26.400> now<00:01:28.520> it<00:01:29.520> looks<00:01:29.579> like<00:01:29.790> a

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
started up right now it looks like a

then cost me thirty-five dollars at

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.370 
then cost me thirty-five dollars at
autozone<00:01:46.900> probably<00:01:47.900> one<00:01:47.990> of<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.170> best

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
autozone probably one of the best

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.910 
autozone probably one of the best
investments<00:01:48.800> for<00:01:49.370> this<00:01:49.520> thing<00:01:49.700> I<00:01:49.850> ever<00:01:49.880> made

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
investments for this thing I ever made

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
investments for this thing I ever made
unfortunately<00:01:51.920> it<00:01:51.980> didn't<00:01:52.250> come<00:01:52.400> with<00:01:52.430> attack

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
unfortunately it didn't come with attack

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.170 
unfortunately it didn't come with attack
when<00:01:53.240> I<00:01:53.270> had<00:01:53.570> it<00:01:53.780> first<00:01:54.430> so<00:01:55.430> I<00:01:55.460> want<00:01:55.790> to<00:01:55.880> fix

that saying is how I actually need one I
put<00:02:00.350> one<00:02:00.530> in<00:02:01.150> 35<00:02:02.150> bucks<00:02:02.480> had<00:02:02.750> to<00:02:02.840> remove<00:02:03.050> the

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
put one in 35 bucks had to remove the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.610 
put one in 35 bucks had to remove the
cluster<00:02:03.680> had<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:04.100> figure<00:02:04.310> out<00:02:04.580> which<00:02:05.390> wire<00:02:05.690> was

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
cluster had to figure out which wire was

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.170 
cluster had to figure out which wire was
supposed<00:02:06.890> to<00:02:06.980> go<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.340> tack<00:02:07.550> if<00:02:07.820> it<00:02:07.970> came

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
supposed to go to the tack if it came

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.000 
supposed to go to the tack if it came
into<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.510> cluster<00:02:08.990> and<00:02:09.560> all<00:02:09.649> I<00:02:09.680> did<00:02:09.979> was

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.010 
into the cluster and all I did was

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.220 
into the cluster and all I did was
splice<00:02:10.520> into<00:02:10.760> that<00:02:10.970> wire<00:02:11.270> and<00:02:11.600> if<00:02:11.930> they<00:02:12.020> call

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
splice into that wire and if they call

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.830 
splice into that wire and if they call
