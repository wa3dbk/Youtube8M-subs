00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
pieces of foam together I'm going to

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.010 
pieces of foam together I'm going to
take<00:02:00.719> some<00:02:00.990> pins<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.770> I'm<00:02:02.549> gonna<00:02:02.899> stick<00:02:03.899> it

take some pins and I'm gonna stick it
from<00:02:04.229> one<00:02:04.439> side<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.770> foam<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.399> other<00:02:07.369> so

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
from one side of foam to the other so

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.570 
from one side of foam to the other so
the<00:02:08.789> foam<00:02:09.209> will<00:02:09.599> be<00:02:09.780> holding<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.190> want<00:02:11.489> to

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
the foam will be holding that I want to

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.550 
the foam will be holding that I want to
hold<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.940> wing<00:02:12.239> together

I always do is I just leave it there I
let<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.770> gorilla<00:02:25.980> goo<00:02:26.370> expand<00:02:27.150> out<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:27.660> the

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
let the gorilla goo expand out of the

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.530 
let the gorilla goo expand out of the
crack<00:02:28.110> as<00:02:28.920> much<00:02:29.340> as<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.670> wants<00:02:29.850> but<00:02:30.270> I'm<00:02:30.390> not

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
crack as much as it wants but I'm not

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.440 
crack as much as it wants but I'm not
leaving<00:02:31.020> it<00:02:31.140> flat<00:02:31.590> on<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.010> table<00:02:32.450> I'm

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
leaving it flat on the table I'm

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.850 
leaving it flat on the table I'm
actually<00:02:33.600> going<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.020> put<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.290> on<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.560> floor

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
actually going to put it on the floor

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.040 
actually going to put it on the floor
flat<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.489> leaning<00:02:35.850> against<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.420> table<00:02:36.630> so

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
flat and leaning against the table so

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.479 
flat and leaning against the table so
it's<00:02:37.319> got<00:02:37.530> enough<00:02:38.930> room<00:02:39.930> from<00:02:40.319> all<00:02:40.560> around<00:02:40.950> it

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
it's got enough room from all around it

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.610 
it's got enough room from all around it
just<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:42.030> expand<00:02:42.630> as<00:02:42.780> much<00:02:42.989> as<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.290> needs<00:02:43.319> to

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
just to expand as much as it needs to

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.680 
just to expand as much as it needs to
I'm<00:02:44.160> also<00:02:44.340> going<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.640> put<00:02:44.850> some<00:02:45.060> weights<00:02:45.450> on

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
I'm also going to put some weights on

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.810 
I'm also going to put some weights on
top<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.260> wing<00:02:48.380> just<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.560> little<00:02:49.830> given<00:02:50.489> some

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
top of the wing just a little given some

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.140 
top of the wing just a little given some
kind<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.269> pressure<00:02:52.190> there<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.400> go<00:02:53.580> you<00:02:53.910> can

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
kind of a pressure there you go you can

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.449 
kind of a pressure there you go you can
see<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.570> weight<00:02:57.470> so<00:02:58.470> at<00:02:58.739> this<00:02:58.860> point<00:02:59.100> I'm<00:02:59.280> just

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
see the weight so at this point I'm just

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.820 
see the weight so at this point I'm just
gonna<00:02:59.550> leave<00:02:59.850> it<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:01.920> dry<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.330> I'll<00:03:03.330> be<00:03:03.569> back

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
gonna leave it to dry and I'll be back

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.410 
gonna leave it to dry and I'll be back
45<00:03:04.830> minutes

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
45 minutes

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.680 
45 minutes
Dada<00:03:06.500> 45<00:03:07.500> minutes<00:03:07.800> later<00:03:08.100> you<00:03:08.850> can<00:03:09.120> see<00:03:09.420> that

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
Dada 45 minutes later you can see that

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:18.770 
Dada 45 minutes later you can see that
it's<00:03:09.870> nice<00:03:10.110> and<00:03:10.700> strong<00:03:15.140> and<00:03:17.239> I'm<00:03:18.239> also<00:03:18.540> going

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
to show you what to do with the access

to show you what to do with the access
gorilla<00:03:21.900> glue<00:03:22.170> that<00:03:23.480> expanded<00:03:24.480> over<00:03:24.870> here<00:03:25.049> you

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
gorilla glue that expanded over here you

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.500 
gorilla glue that expanded over here you
can<00:03:25.680> see<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.160> gorilla<00:03:26.700> just<00:03:26.910> all<00:03:27.060> over<00:03:27.269> in<00:03:27.420> the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
can see the gorilla just all over in the

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.720 
can see the gorilla just all over in the
craft<00:03:27.780> but<00:03:28.079> I<00:03:28.260> didn't<00:03:28.829> put<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.010> lot<00:03:29.130> so<00:03:29.610> it

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
craft but I didn't put a lot so it

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.729 
craft but I didn't put a lot so it
didn't<00:03:29.970> expend<00:03:30.390> too<00:03:30.690> much<00:03:30.720> which<00:03:31.230> is<00:03:31.410> really

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
didn't expend too much which is really

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.670 
didn't expend too much which is really
nice<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:33.209> guess<00:03:33.390> now<00:03:33.959> we're<00:03:34.290> going<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.560> glue

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
nice and I guess now we're going to glue

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.390 
nice and I guess now we're going to glue
the<00:03:35.220> other<00:03:35.370> side<00:03:35.640> of<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.030> link<00:03:37.130> these<00:03:38.130> are<00:03:38.310> the

to put the wing I'm going to use exactly

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.409 
to put the wing I'm going to use exactly
the<00:05:04.919> same<00:05:04.979> thing<00:05:05.370> that<00:05:05.490> I<00:05:05.610> did<00:05:05.669> before<00:05:06.180> I'm

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
the same thing that I did before I'm

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.629 
the same thing that I did before I'm
going<00:05:06.630> to<00:05:06.690> put<00:05:06.900> it<00:05:06.990> together<00:05:07.310> rub<00:05:08.310> them

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
going to put it together rub them

going to put it together rub them
against<00:05:09.150> each<00:05:09.240> other<00:05:09.509> let<00:05:09.870> the<00:05:10.080> glue<00:05:10.440> get<00:05:10.770> in

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
against each other let the glue get in

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.180 
against each other let the glue get in
all<00:05:11.099> the<00:05:11.130> pores<00:05:11.550> of<00:05:11.729> the<00:05:11.880> EPP<00:05:12.180> and<00:05:12.949> again<00:05:13.949> use

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
all the pores of the EPP and again use

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.540 
all the pores of the EPP and again use
those<00:05:14.460> same<00:05:14.880> pins<00:05:15.270> on<00:05:15.840> the<00:05:16.080> outside<00:05:16.530> and<00:05:16.889> make

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
those same pins on the outside and make

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.770 
those same pins on the outside and make
sure<00:05:17.849> that<00:05:18.349> when<00:05:19.349> the<00:05:19.620> other<00:05:19.770> half<00:05:20.039> is

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
sure that when the other half is

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.300 
sure that when the other half is
somewhat<00:05:21.780> attached<00:05:22.169> to<00:05:22.500> it<00:05:22.590> until<00:05:22.889> the<00:05:23.070> glue

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
somewhat attached to it until the glue

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.760 
somewhat attached to it until the glue
dries<00:05:23.340> and<00:05:24.090> again<00:05:24.990> I'm<00:05:25.110> going<00:05:25.289> to<00:05:25.349> just<00:05:25.440> place

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
dries and again I'm going to just place

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.650 
dries and again I'm going to just place
it<00:05:25.800> on<00:05:26.070> the<00:05:26.190> floor<00:05:26.460> and<00:05:26.520> let<00:05:26.970> that<00:05:28.490> dry<00:05:29.660> and

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
it on the floor and let that dry and

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.760 
it on the floor and let that dry and
then<00:05:30.750> we're<00:05:30.960> going<00:05:31.080> to<00:05:31.139> go<00:05:31.289> through<00:05:31.500> the<00:05:31.560> next

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
then we're going to go through the next

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.080 
then we're going to go through the next
step<00:05:32.630> at<00:05:33.630> this<00:05:33.840> point<00:05:34.320> what<00:05:35.130> am<00:05:35.250> i<00:05:35.639> one

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
step at this point what am i one

step at this point what am i one
mentioned<00:05:36.599> for<00:05:36.960> a<00:05:36.990> sign<00:05:37.740> office<00:05:38.220> I<00:05:39.590> like<00:05:40.590> to

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
mentioned for a sign office I like to

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.770 
mentioned for a sign office I like to
have<00:05:41.159> my<00:05:41.669> top<00:05:42.590> matching<00:05:43.590> and<00:05:43.889> flash<00:05:44.780> rather

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
have my top matching and flash rather

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.219 
have my top matching and flash rather
than<00:05:46.169> have<00:05:46.470> my<00:05:46.710> bottom<00:05:47.280> is<00:05:47.490> the<00:05:47.729> bottom<00:05:48.229> bottom

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:49.229 
than have my bottom is the bottom bottom

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:50.659 
than have my bottom is the bottom bottom
will<00:05:49.380> take<00:05:49.560> a<00:05:49.680> lot<00:05:49.830> more<00:05:49.860> of<00:05:50.130> use<00:05:50.340> and<00:05:50.490> it<00:05:50.580> will

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
will take a lot more of use and it will

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.629 
will take a lot more of use and it will
get<00:05:50.940> ugly<00:05:51.180> really<00:05:51.659> fast<00:05:52.190> so<00:05:53.190> when<00:05:53.340> I'm<00:05:53.490> doing

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
get ugly really fast so when I'm doing

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.300 
get ugly really fast so when I'm doing
these<00:05:53.940> pins<00:05:54.419> I'm<00:05:54.840> making<00:05:55.289> sure<00:05:55.470> that<00:05:55.620> the<00:05:55.860> top

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
these pins I'm making sure that the top

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.390 
these pins I'm making sure that the top
part<00:05:56.669> is<00:05:56.880> flush<00:05:57.360> rather<00:05:58.289> than<00:05:58.560> having<00:05:58.860> the

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
part is flush rather than having the

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.820 
part is flush rather than having the
bottom<00:05:59.909> and<00:06:00.120> this<00:06:00.630> way<00:06:00.870> it's<00:06:01.259> a<00:06:01.380> lot<00:06:01.560> easier

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
bottom and this way it's a lot easier

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.159 
bottom and this way it's a lot easier
and<00:06:02.159> looks<00:06:02.580> much<00:06:02.849> nicer<00:06:03.150> by<00:06:03.570> the<00:06:03.630> time<00:06:03.930> you're

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
and looks much nicer by the time you're

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:06.980 
and looks much nicer by the time you're
done<00:06:04.199> with<00:06:04.650> that<00:06:05.430> but<00:06:05.820> don't<00:06:06.419> worry<00:06:06.570> about<00:06:06.780> the

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
done with that but don't worry about the
