00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 welcome to a new channel video 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.819
 of the geek walker today we have the unboxing 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.819
 of the meif x 4 pro 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.470
 ok let's proceed to see the box 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.349
 this mail that so kindly has 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.000
 yielded Emilio well as we can observe 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.650
 the box is a little bigger than the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.500
 3000 food that I have had is a bit 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.720
 more fat otherwise is normalito no 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.430
 does not have anything to highlight the box a 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.199
 ordinary load when the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.600
 we open so we found the typical 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.730
 little notes the European charger because 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.530
 this is the european version here I put you 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.019
 the specifications of the charger if what 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.940
 you get to see is a normal usb charger 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:50.219
 and current here inside we would find 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.379
 the phone but let's see first the 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.149
 accessories is appreciated that come 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.010
 some headphones I do not know of what quality 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.809
 they're good though I had some meizu's 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.120
 12 euros that I liked a lot like 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.239
 you can see the packaging is identical to 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.550
 from the bodies of apple the usb cable 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.270
 Micro USB also gives it a certain air 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.880
 to live in the apple devices 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.950
 and now we go to see and the box is 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.149
 that if you have never had an email 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.610
 to surprise a bit because it seems like a 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.409
 book is a small booklet with three or 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.240
 four hard cardboard pages where we 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.159
 specific a little bit as the most 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.750
 remarkable phone and then 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.640
 Well, we are already with the 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.340
 device on the left side 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.840
 we found the volume keys in the 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.729
 part of below we have the hole for 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.209
 put the nail and remove the tapita 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.250
 microphone the microusb connector and the 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:41.100
 speaker the right side comes 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.780
 completely empty in the part of 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.429
 above we found the button to 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.979
 turn the microphone on and off to 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:49.049
 cancel the noise and the 3.5 jack for 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.539
 plug our headphones into the 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.840
 back we have the camera 20 7 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:57.239
 megapixels capable of recording at 4k and a 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.659
 two-color led on the bottom we have 

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:03.179
 the logo of the meizu brand we are going to remove 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.930
 the lid is removed quite easy is a 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:08.420
 slightly flexible plastic lid 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.650
 and we can see that the back we see 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:15.050
 the nfc chip this tells me x4 works with 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.330
 microsim cards and are introduced by 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.580
 up here as it came dry battery 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.890
 I've waited a few days I've recorded another 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.570
 video that comes next 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.130
 while a few days of use since ya 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.900
 I can comment something else I have already prohibited 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.570
 try the phone loads it a hundred 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.300
 hundred and I can tell you for example that 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.580
 the screen I really like this and psa 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.110
 two here it looks really good even at 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.940
 sun has very good viewing angles 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.280
 good you are not going to see any pixel 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.500
 because with this definition it is impossible 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.810
 I believe the human eye is going very well 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.750
 phone goes fast is going fluid at the moment 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.270
 I do not have many complaints about the good if 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.360
 we could maybe put a the theme of the 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.670
 3,350 milliamp battery that for me 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.800
 use and with this screen of 2k then to me 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.510
 I do not get to 4 hours screen and 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.950
 for me it is something insufficient too 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.300
 I understand that many people four hours 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.640
 screen is enough for one day 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.860
 to show you some little things that you have 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.030
 flame as for example slide towards 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.610
 up directly with the screen 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.380
 off leave the button pressed 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.480
 seconds and blocks 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.430
 double-tap and awaken the 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.630
 screen do a sherpa from one side and 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.000
 open the application that you have 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.650
 selected and the slide settings 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.510
 from the bottom up to get the 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.250
 multitasking a cool thing is that by 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.080
 end in this European version of this 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.580
 device we can see the hours of 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.560
 screen since in other devices 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.720
 you had to put it in English or do 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.400
 stories installing things as you can 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.380
 see here is in Spanish although some 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.150
 things yes they are in English but so 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.170
 less than the ideal screen hours 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.330
 which is what interests me for 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.890
 know how long it takes if you put them on and 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.480
 the brands and also in Spanish if 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.190
 we make a touch just without getting 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.310
 to click is the backspace button 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.930
 giving the home button as you can see me 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.430
 I move inside the menus and in 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.920
 place to make a shuai up for 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.450
 do backspace possibly play without 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.850
 get to click if we click 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.200
 strong we go to the main desk in 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.720
 the top part we have a led 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.610
 notifications on white camera 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.770
 of 5 megapixels and the sensors of 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.870
 proximity in the bottom 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.520
 we found a single physical button that 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.890
 It is also a fingerprint reader 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.960
 fingerprints I've been using it and 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.020
 say that it looks a lot like the 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.370
 iphone wild the galaxy s 6 works on 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.820
 any position where you put 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.590
 the finger and it's pretty fast and precise 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.150
 the native camera application of the 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.770
 doctors being very well that 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.770
 the blast is very fast 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.040
 if we move through the settings you see 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.139
 where you put the size of the photo and size 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.660
 of the video we can put to 4k but if you 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.430
 you fix it is as if the translation does not 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.950
 would have fit and they will be registered and a 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.620
 little bad but good the quality of 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:52.480
 photos of this 20.7 megapixel camera 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.480
 I think it's pretty good 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.050
 if we lower the curtain of notifications 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.879
 we see that it is typical of flame which 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.289
 I like it a lot and we can see here my 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:02.419
 samsung earth fit that right now the 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:04.189
 I have disconnected but say that as 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.800
 the exynos processor that carries this 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:09.080
 device is samsung as it is worn 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.750
 perfectly with my bracelet and can 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.590
 use it without any problem 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.900
 I will continue using that device 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.729
 for a few more days so that in the 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.439
 video for my final impressions 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.520
 I can tell what I thought about the 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:22.189
 experience using it as 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.289
 unique device so you already know if 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:26.509
 you do not want to miss that video the best 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.250
