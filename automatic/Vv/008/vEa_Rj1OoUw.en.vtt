he has written a program that tells the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.980 
he has written a program that tells the
kinect<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.860> watch<00:01:38.130> out<00:01:38.460> for<00:01:38.909> people<00:01:39.150> crossing

actually using this and has had it in

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.450 
actually using this and has had it in
place<00:01:44.850> since<00:01:45.630> august<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.470> last<00:01:46.530> year<00:01:46.979> but<00:01:47.310> it's

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
just now getting to be public knowledge

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.880 
just now getting to be public knowledge
because<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.820> was<00:01:51.110> national<00:01:52.110> security<00:01:52.649> at<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
because it was national security at the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.170 
because it was national security at the
time<00:01:53.070> whenever<00:01:53.280> they<00:01:53.520> were<00:01:53.579> setting<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.090> up

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
time whenever they were setting it up

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.260 
time whenever they were setting it up
they<00:01:54.689> say<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.890> Kinect<00:01:56.280> can<00:01:56.670> distinguish

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
they say that the Kinect can distinguish

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.429 
they say that the Kinect can distinguish
between<00:01:57.829> animals<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.070> humans<00:01:59.250> and<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.840> alerts

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
between animals and humans and it alerts

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.280 
between animals and humans and it alerts
soldiers<00:02:02.399> or<00:02:02.670> whoever<00:02:03.090> needs<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.780> be<00:02:03.869> alerted

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
soldiers or whoever needs to be alerted

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.139 
soldiers or whoever needs to be alerted
whenever<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.979> picks<00:02:05.340> up<00:02:05.520> something<00:02:06.000> or

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
whenever it picks up something or

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.190 
whenever it picks up something or
somebody<00:02:07.069> crossing<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.489> border<00:02:08.910> or<00:02:09.200> wherever

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
somebody crossing the border or wherever

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.120 
somebody crossing the border or wherever
this<00:02:10.470> kinect<00:02:10.890> can<00:02:11.069> see<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.580> they<00:02:12.300> also

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
this kinect can see and they also

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.940 
this kinect can see and they also
that<00:02:13.790> in<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.270> future<00:02:14.510> that<00:02:15.410> they<00:02:15.590> plan<00:02:15.920> on

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
that in the future that they plan on

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.910 
that in the future that they plan on
being<00:02:16.580> able<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.210> detect<00:02:17.570> heat<00:02:18.080> signatures<00:02:18.680> and

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
being able to detect heat signatures and

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.890 
being able to detect heat signatures and
also<00:02:19.850> heart<00:02:20.630> rates<00:02:20.960> so<00:02:21.740> it<00:02:22.490> appears<00:02:23.180> that<00:02:23.420> they

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
also heart rates so it appears that they

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.260 
also heart rates so it appears that they
