00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:11.520

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.920
 you hear his voice but you don't know where 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.440
 It comes and where it goes so is 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.950

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:51.450
 telling you we are talking about what we know and 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.020
 We testify that they had seen and you 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.360
 do not accept our testimony 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.120
 if i told you about earthly and you don't 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:06.040
 believe as you believe if I speak 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:08.500
 you about heaven no one went up to heaven 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:13.960
 as soon as he came down from heaven 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:17.740
 son of man is in heaven and how 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:21.430
 Moses lifted up the serpent desert so must 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:25.960
 son of man be lifted up in order 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:29.880
 whoever believes in him has not perished but had 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:34.060
 eternal life his god so loved the world 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:38.440
 that he gave his only begotten son, that 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:42.130
 whoever believes in him has not perished but had 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:46.239
 Eternal life and baths God sent a son 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:51.160
 his own world to judge the world but to 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:55.680
 the world was saved through him a believer in 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:58.209
 he is not judged and the unbeliever is already condemned 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:03.160
 because he did not believe in the name 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:07.330
 the only begotten son of God the court is 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.920
 that light came into the world but people are more 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:14.030
 they loved darkness rather than light 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:18.120
 because their deeds were evil 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:21.360
 for everyone who does evil hates the light 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.660
 and does not go to the light so as not to face 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.730
 his deeds are evil 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:33.630
 but the one who comes in truth goes to the light 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:37.860
 that his deeds should be revealed because they are in 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:41.130
 God made them after this Jesus came with 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:45.810
 his disciples into the land of Judah 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.250
 and there lived with them and baptized ioan also 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.860
 baptized wine not 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.970
 near salim because there were many 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:58.670
 waters and came there and were baptized 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:02.910
 for John was not yet imprisoned 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:07.890
 then the way new pupils dispute occurred 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:10.230
 with the Jews about cleansing and came cyan and 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.500
 told him crappy 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.859
 the one that was with you at jordan 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.609
 and about which you testified here he 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.109
 baptizes 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:24.510
 and all go to him John answered 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:28.430
 man can not take anything on 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:32.580
 yourself if not given to him from heaven 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:37.580
 you are my witnesses in what I said 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:40.669
 I am not Christ, but I am sent before him 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:44.449
 having a bride is a groom 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:48.530
 and the friend of the bridegroom standing and listening to him 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:50.349
 gladly rejoice when hearing the voice of this groom 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.610
 then my joy 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:59.419
 turned to him should grow and me 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:03.650
 diminish coming over and eat above 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:06.550
 and all who is from the earth to the earth, and 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:11.419
 speaks as a matter of the earth 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:14.229
 those who come from heaven are above all and that 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:17.229
 he saw and heard about that and 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:19.539
 testifies and no one accepts 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:22.699
 his testimony 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:26.180
 who received his testimony sim 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:29.779
 imprinted that god is true 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:34.750
 for the one whom God sent speaks 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:40.060
 the word of gods and baths measure God gives the spirit 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:44.120
 father loves son and gave all his hand 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:47.900
 believer in a son has everlasting life and not 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:52.870
 the believer in the son will not see life but anger 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.870
 God rests on it
