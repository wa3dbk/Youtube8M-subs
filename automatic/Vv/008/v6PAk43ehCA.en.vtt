on Twitter so I couldn't wait to
actually<00:00:22.730> talk<00:00:23.029> about<00:00:23.210> survival

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:30.120 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.780 

the<00:00:30.690> base<00:00:30.960> bowl<00:00:31.290> of<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.620> is<00:00:31.860> you<00:00:32.370> are<00:00:32.490> defending

the base bowl of it is you are defending

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.730 
the base bowl of it is you are defending
a<00:00:33.030> series<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.390> objectives<00:00:33.870> playing<00:00:34.500> as<00:00:34.710> the

a series of objectives playing as the

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.230 
a series of objectives playing as the
cog<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.370> get<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.580> use<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.730> classes<00:00:36.210> that

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:36.240 
cog and you get to use the classes that

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.340 
cog and you get to use the classes that
we<00:00:36.420> have<00:00:36.540> an<00:00:36.660> overrun<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.080> you<00:00:37.170> have<00:00:37.260> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
we have an overrun so you have the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.080 
we have an overrun so you have the
engineer<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.010> soldiery<00:00:38.400> of<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.640> scout<00:00:38.910> of

engineer the soldiery of the scout of

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.850 
engineer the soldiery of the scout of
the<00:00:39.180> medic<00:00:39.450> it's<00:00:39.840> all<00:00:39.990> about<00:00:40.110> teamwork<00:00:40.500> of

the medic it's all about teamwork of

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.230 
the medic it's all about teamwork of
what<00:00:41.070> classes<00:00:41.430> you're<00:00:41.520> gonna<00:00:41.640> pick<00:00:41.880> and<00:00:42.060> use

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:42.240 
what classes you're gonna pick and use

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.940 
what classes you're gonna pick and use
their<00:00:42.480> special<00:00:42.810> abilities<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.440> help<00:00:43.470> survive

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
their special abilities to help survive

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:59.810 
their special abilities to help survive
10<00:00:44.700> waves<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.120> enemies

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.880 

its<00:01:00.480> shares<00:01:00.900> the<00:01:01.079> same<00:01:01.320> kind<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.710> like

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
its shares the same kind of like

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.880 
its shares the same kind of like
gameplay<00:01:02.310> mechanics<00:01:02.850> as<00:01:03.140> overrun<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.379> so

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
gameplay mechanics as overrun and so

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.040 
gameplay mechanics as overrun and so
there's<00:01:05.100> three<00:01:05.339> objectives<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.420> primary<00:01:06.990> a

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
there's three objectives a primary a

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.360 
there's three objectives a primary a
secondary<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.800> third<00:01:07.979> one<00:01:08.130> being<00:01:08.310> the

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
secondary and the third one being the

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.760 
secondary and the third one being the
generator<00:01:08.880> right<00:01:09.090> or<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.330> main<00:01:09.510> objective

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
generator right or the main objective

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.560 
generator right or the main objective
the<00:01:10.770> battlefield<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.520> single<00:01:11.940> directional<00:01:12.450> so

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
the battlefield is single directional so

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.910 
the battlefield is single directional so
you<00:01:12.630> start<00:01:12.960> defending<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.440> first<00:01:13.650> one<00:01:13.860> and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
you start defending the first one and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.140 
you start defending the first one and
then<00:01:14.010> when<00:01:14.190> that<00:01:14.280> falls<00:01:14.550> you<00:01:14.729> fall<00:01:14.940> back<00:01:15.119> to

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
then when that falls you fall back to

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.090 
then when that falls you fall back to
the<00:01:15.330> second<00:01:15.750> one<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.110> when<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.740> falls<00:01:16.979> you

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the second one and when that falls you

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.950 
the second one and when that falls you
fall<00:01:17.280> back<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.640> final<00:01:17.850> generator<00:01:20.630> in<00:01:21.630> ord

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
fall back to the final generator in ord

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.200 
fall back to the final generator in ord
we<00:01:22.140> had<00:01:22.290> 50<00:01:23.070> ways<00:01:23.190> was<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.580> goal<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.759> survive

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
we had 50 ways was the goal to survive

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.969 
we had 50 ways was the goal to survive
and<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.930> might<00:01:25.080> hear<00:01:25.170> 10<00:01:25.410> way<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.590> go<00:01:25.830> out

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
and so you might hear 10 way to go out

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.550 
and so you might hear 10 way to go out
short<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.729> 10<00:01:27.030> crazy<00:01:27.420> intense<00:01:27.869> waves<00:01:28.170> and

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
short it is 10 crazy intense waves and

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.020 
short it is 10 crazy intense waves and
it's<00:01:28.890> actually<00:01:29.340> really<00:01:29.490> hard<00:01:29.580> to<00:01:29.880> survive

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
it's actually really hard to survive

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.880 
it's actually really hard to survive
those<00:01:30.330> 10<00:01:30.509> waves<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:31.229> actually<00:01:31.560> had<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.740> bring

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
those 10 waves we actually had to bring

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.950 
those 10 waves we actually had to bring
in<00:01:32.070> QA<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.490> ensure<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.240> we<00:01:33.720> weren't<00:01:33.869> gonna

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
in QA to ensure that we weren't gonna

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.480 
in QA to ensure that we weren't gonna
ship<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.350> multiplayer<00:01:34.770> game<00:01:34.860> mode<00:01:35.160> that<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.399> was

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
ship a multiplayer game mode that it was

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.950 
ship a multiplayer game mode that it was
impossible<00:01:36.090> than<00:01:36.210> beat<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.539> the<00:01:36.660> highest

impossible than beat on the highest
difficulty<00:01:37.380> level<00:01:37.830> going<00:01:38.399> all<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.640> way<00:01:38.759> to

the hardcore Oh or in seeing is

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.740 
the hardcore Oh or in seeing is
definitely<00:01:41.460> gonna<00:01:41.550> be<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.759> challenge<00:01:41.820> for<00:01:42.360> any

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
definitely gonna be a challenge for any

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:56.000 
definitely gonna be a challenge for any
co-op<00:01:43.080> group<00:01:43.259> announced<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.680> federal<00:01:43.800> tackler

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.980 

I<00:01:56.100> think<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.910> key<00:01:57.270> abilities<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.840> you're

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
I think the key abilities that you're

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.750 
I think the key abilities that you're
going<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.170> see<00:01:58.320> if<00:01:58.710> they're<00:01:58.920> used<00:01:59.130> well<00:01:59.400> give

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
going to see if they're used well give

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.480 
going to see if they're used well give
you<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.940> big<00:02:00.120> big<00:02:00.390> advantage<00:02:00.810> if<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.950> have<00:02:02.190> an

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
you a big big advantage if you have an

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.510 
you a big big advantage if you have an
engineer<00:02:02.940> who's<00:02:03.180> repairing<00:02:03.690> a<00:02:03.750> fence<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.520> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
engineer who's repairing a fence and the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.580 
engineer who's repairing a fence and the
locusts<00:02:05.880> forces<00:02:06.300> are<00:02:06.450> incoming<00:02:06.930> there's<00:02:07.410> no

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
locusts forces are incoming there's no

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.780 
locusts forces are incoming there's no
way<00:02:07.740> he's<00:02:07.920> going<00:02:08.040> to<00:02:08.130> be<00:02:08.190> able<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.399> repair<00:02:08.670> that

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
way he's going to be able to repair that

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.760 
way he's going to be able to repair that
fence<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:09.810> you've<00:02:09.930> got<00:02:09.960> this<00:02:10.290> moment

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
fence and so you've got this moment

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.620 
fence and so you've got this moment
where<00:02:11.130> all<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.700> classes<00:02:12.120> are<00:02:12.210> doing<00:02:12.480> their

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
where all the classes are doing their

changing<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.650> trying<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:31.860> figure<00:02:31.950> out<00:02:32.100> the

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
changing and trying to figure out the

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.500 
changing and trying to figure out the
best<00:02:32.310> way<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.550> be<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:32.910> game<00:02:33.180> is<00:02:33.360> changing

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
best way to be that the game is changing

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.940 
best way to be that the game is changing
on<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.140> so<00:02:34.230> you're<00:02:34.350> constantly<00:02:34.560> having

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
on you and so you're constantly having

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.070 
on you and so you're constantly having
to<00:02:35.010> adapt<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.550> figure<00:02:35.790> out<00:02:35.820> oh<00:02:36.180> man<00:02:36.930> we

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
to adapt and figure out oh man we

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.300 
to adapt and figure out oh man we
thought<00:02:37.200> this<00:02:37.380> was<00:02:37.500> gonna<00:02:37.590> work<00:02:37.710> but<00:02:37.860> now<00:02:38.130> that

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
thought this was gonna work but now that

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.590 
thought this was gonna work but now that
it's<00:02:38.550> different<00:02:38.910> because<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.390> know<00:02:39.480> we're

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
it's different because you know we're

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.120 
it's different because you know we're
facing<00:02:39.750> different<00:02:40.020> enemies<00:02:40.410> how<00:02:40.920> are<00:02:40.980> we

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
intensity level was just right the

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.510 
intensity level was just right the
length<00:03:05.020> of<00:03:05.140> experience<00:03:05.590> was<00:03:05.740> just<00:03:05.920> write<00:03:06.130> the
