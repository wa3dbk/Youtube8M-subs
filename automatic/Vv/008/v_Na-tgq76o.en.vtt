this year the kind of objective right
from<00:00:30.790> the<00:00:30.880> beginning<00:00:30.970> was<00:00:31.390> to<00:00:31.420> actually<00:00:31.750> match

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.560 
from the beginning was to actually match

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.680 
from the beginning was to actually match
what<00:00:32.830> you<00:00:32.950> have<00:00:33.100> in<00:00:33.220> real<00:00:33.340> life<00:00:33.550> if<00:00:34.240> you<00:00:34.420> want

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
what you have in real life if you want

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.720 
what you have in real life if you want
that<00:00:34.810> formula<00:00:35.080> one<00:00:35.350> experience<00:00:35.950> the<00:00:36.430> stuff

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
that formula one experience the stuff

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.670 
that formula one experience the stuff
we've<00:00:36.880> been<00:00:36.910> doing<00:00:37.030> the<00:00:37.270> 2012<00:00:38.050> has<00:00:38.230> moved<00:00:38.530> that

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
we've been doing the 2012 has moved that

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.520 
we've been doing the 2012 has moved that
on<00:00:38.860> a<00:00:39.040> whole<00:00:39.280> new<00:00:39.460> generation<00:00:39.640> now<00:00:43.380> the<00:00:44.380> whole

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
on a whole new generation now the whole

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.290 
on a whole new generation now the whole
weather<00:00:44.770> scenario<00:00:45.340> system<00:00:45.760> has<00:00:45.880> really<00:00:46.150> been

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
weather scenario system has really been

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.150 
weather scenario system has really been
refined<00:00:46.720> this<00:00:46.840> year<00:00:47.050> so<00:00:47.350> you'll<00:00:47.739> get<00:00:47.860> wet<00:00:48.070> the

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
refined this year so you'll get wet the

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.380 
refined this year so you'll get wet the
friends<00:00:48.460> come<00:00:48.670> in<00:00:48.700> now<00:00:48.970> and<00:00:49.090> it<00:00:49.210> could<00:00:49.360> be

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
friends come in now and it could be

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.390 
friends come in now and it could be
raining<00:00:49.630> at<00:00:49.930> one<00:00:50.230> section<00:00:50.710> of<00:00:50.830> the<00:00:50.920> track<00:00:51.130> but

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
raining at one section of the track but

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.010 
raining at one section of the track but
dry<00:00:51.580> on<00:00:51.730> another<00:00:52.030> so<00:00:52.330> you<00:00:52.390> get<00:00:52.600> those<00:00:52.750> real

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
dry on another so you get those real

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.660 
dry on another so you get those real
moments<00:00:53.500> where<00:00:53.680> you're<00:00:54.160> not<00:00:54.280> sure<00:00:54.520> which

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
moments where you're not sure which

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.729 
moments where you're not sure which
tires<00:00:54.970> to<00:00:55.210> be<00:00:55.330> on<00:00:55.480> so<00:00:55.780> that<00:00:56.080> really<00:00:56.260> mixes<00:00:56.620> up

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
tires to be on so that really mixes up

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.259 
tires to be on so that really mixes up
the<00:00:56.770> racing<00:00:57.220> quite<00:00:57.430> a<00:00:57.460> lot<00:00:57.670> they'll<00:00:58.030> have<00:00:58.180> you

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
the racing quite a lot they'll have you

00:00:58.269 --> 00:00:59.610 
the racing quite a lot they'll have you
to<00:00:58.390> where<00:00:58.570> you<00:00:58.809> mind<00:00:59.019> should<00:00:59.199> I<00:00:59.260> switch<00:00:59.470> the

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
to where you mind should I switch the

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.979 
to where you mind should I switch the
intern<00:00:59.980> or<00:01:00.220> wet<00:01:00.460> sore<00:01:00.730> dries<00:01:01.000> it's<00:01:01.690> really

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
intern or wet sore dries it's really

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.380 
intern or wet sore dries it's really
unpredictable<00:01:02.350> now<00:01:02.830> it's<00:01:03.730> really<00:01:03.970> matching

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
unpredictable now it's really matching

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.540 
unpredictable now it's really matching
what<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:04.660> people<00:01:04.989> are<00:01:05.199> seeing<00:01:05.350> on<00:01:05.530> TV

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.560 

significant<00:01:09.550> work<00:01:09.700> has<00:01:09.850> gone<00:01:09.880> into<00:01:10.030> the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
significant work has gone into the

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.300 
significant work has gone into the
physics<00:01:11.050> model<00:01:11.380> particularly<00:01:12.100> the

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
physics model particularly the

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.000 
physics model particularly the
suspension<00:01:12.909> which<00:01:13.330> has<00:01:13.480> a<00:01:13.510> real<00:01:13.840> kind<00:01:14.050> of<00:01:14.200> sea

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
suspension which has a real kind of sea

watch fastest laps or pole laps on TV at
the<00:01:22.540> weekend<00:01:23.050> now<00:01:23.530> you<00:01:23.590> can<00:01:23.740> really<00:01:24.040> get<00:01:24.159> the

the weekend now you can really get the

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.500 
the weekend now you can really get the
sense<00:01:24.280> of<00:01:24.550> doing<00:01:24.790> the<00:01:24.850> same<00:01:25.030> things<00:01:25.330> as

sense of doing the same things as

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.810 
sense of doing the same things as
drivers<00:01:26.200> it's<00:01:26.440> just<00:01:26.650> those<00:01:26.770> extra<00:01:27.370> elements

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
drivers it's just those extra elements

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.219 
drivers it's just those extra elements
and<00:01:27.970> make<00:01:28.090> you<00:01:28.180> fill<00:01:28.360> up<00:01:28.479> a<00:01:28.570> real<00:01:28.750> formula<00:01:29.110> one

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
and make you fill up a real formula one

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.740 
and make you fill up a real formula one
driver<00:01:32.550> we've<00:01:33.550> got<00:01:33.700> some<00:01:33.850> really<00:01:34.000> cool<00:01:34.240> engine

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
driver we've got some really cool engine

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.260 
driver we've got some really cool engine
audio<00:01:34.990> what's<00:01:35.710> your<00:01:35.890> driving<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.280> car<00:01:36.550> the

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
audio what's your driving the car the

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.580 
audio what's your driving the car the
other<00:01:37.390> cars<00:01:37.690> were<00:01:37.750> out<00:01:37.960> in<00:01:38.080> circuit<00:01:38.470> and

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
other cars were out in circuit and

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.900 
other cars were out in circuit and
particularly<00:01:38.950> on<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:39.070> pacifiers<00:01:39.610> and<00:01:39.790> things

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
particularly on the pacifiers and things

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.450 
particularly on the pacifiers and things
are<00:01:40.060> just<00:01:40.090> so<00:01:40.330> much<00:01:40.480> more<00:01:40.690> realistic<00:01:40.840> I<00:01:41.460> think

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
are just so much more realistic I think

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.970 
are just so much more realistic I think

are really going to see a big uplift in

are really going to see a big uplift in
that<00:01:46.270> area<00:01:46.390> at<00:01:46.510> issue

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.930 

we've<00:01:50.860> had<00:01:51.040> a<00:01:51.070> bit<00:01:51.220> of<00:01:51.250> a<00:01:51.340> change<00:01:51.550> in<00:01:51.730> direction

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
we've had a bit of a change in direction

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.110 
we've had a bit of a change in direction
for<00:01:52.090> 2012<00:01:53.020> and<00:01:53.410> 10<00:01:53.890> and<00:01:54.130> 11<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.640> player<00:01:54.880> had

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
for 2012 and 10 and 11 the player had

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.880 
for 2012 and 10 and 11 the player had
the<00:01:55.360> main<00:01:55.540> user<00:01:55.780> interface<00:01:56.290> the<00:01:56.500> main<00:01:56.680> menu

sitting<00:01:57.670> inside<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:58.060> paddock<00:01:58.390> that<00:01:58.570> you<00:01:58.660> have

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
sitting inside the paddock that you have

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.140 
sitting inside the paddock that you have
the<00:01:58.960> interviews<00:01:59.380> but<00:01:59.770> for<00:01:59.950> 2012<00:02:00.730> we<00:02:00.850> wanted<00:02:01.120> to

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
the interviews but for 2012 we wanted to

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.940 
the interviews but for 2012 we wanted to
try<00:02:01.300> something<00:02:01.570> different<00:02:01.720> so<00:02:02.620> now<00:02:02.770> it's

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
try something different so now it's

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.890 
try something different so now it's
about<00:02:03.070> projecting<00:02:03.670> a<00:02:04.090> passion<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:04.750> the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
about projecting a passion and the

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.630 
about projecting a passion and the
technicality<00:02:05.590> of<00:02:05.620> forming<00:02:06.010> on<00:02:06.130> to<00:02:06.370> make<00:02:06.520> it

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
technicality of forming on to make it

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.040 
technicality of forming on to make it
really<00:02:06.880> look<00:02:07.000> cool<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:07.420> also<00:02:07.690> ease
