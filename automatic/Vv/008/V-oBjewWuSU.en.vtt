 frost on 2 lanes is difficult 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.800
 there is no doubt to the guy 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.120

 final 100 meters royal crawl 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.060

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.120
 frost 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.210
 the fastest is best to say 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.680
 again, faster than all frost pushed off 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:19.010
 from the starting stand in general starting 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.799
 reaction you are his company is a hobby 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:28.220
 and swims very fast now hoping 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:40.510
 what the first floor and the second behind him but 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:40.510
 now doterpe however this will reach out 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.460
 and went to drink their rivals just to mom 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.280
 oh wave this wave tsunami 7 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.270
 handle and 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.270
 frost but overwhelmed 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:07.060
 he dragged 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.880
 85 percent of the distance behind you 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.110
 competitors 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.280
 Alas, I remained fifth 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.280
 48 0 1 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.560
 Well, that's alas 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.000
 failed to finish work brilliantly 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.980
 started 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.010
 but this problem is by the way the absence 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.620
 the finish line you press on but you and 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.940
 In this sense, of course, how cool 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.950
 frost at the beginning in the middle looked 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:42.810
 so he was not competitive 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:46.140
 capable 5 result magnusson champ 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:50.790
 Americans by the way very seriously now 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.820
 on the head they gave 11 hundredths of a second magnus 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.160
 he won the fagin andrey m 3 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.260
 but annoyingly that was not enough 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.709
 Morozov because it seemed that it was not 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:10.950
 just a chance to fight for medals a chance 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:14.270
 win but fifth place 48 0 1 48 0 1 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:22.570
 Frost's personal best 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:26.760
 47 62 magnus 47 71 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.760
 swam by the way worse than on .
