00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.840
 hello everyone with amway921 and in this 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.820
 today's short video I want 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.429
 to introduce you to a rather rare tank 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.220
 with the pearl of my tank collection this 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.859
 soviet premium among so 4 levels 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.840
 from 32 its rarity due to the fact that 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.330
 he is not for sale now he is now 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.310
 unique endangered endangered species 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.019
 the real dinosaur of our game 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.269
 the fact is that once he did 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.710
 sold and during this time it had 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.469
 buy only twenty two thousand 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.969
 seven hundred people according to the news here 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.010
 there he is among the rarest and 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.469
 unsold now but for now here's an example 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.020
 so here is just tanks ranked sixth 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.610
 place but first leading positions 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.899
 Of course, tanks that never do 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.000
 sold and they were only given out 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.340
 developers alpha tester gave 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.190
 beta tester and so on but this is tara 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.750
 it was previously sold was promotional if 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.670
 not mistaken him in the village study 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.469
 It was not possible to buy only through 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.170
 shop and there is the price of this package 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.809
 was a serious 60 whole dollars 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.790
 there , in addition to this tank, we put 12 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.380
 half a thousand gold and total 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.390
 equivalent value which 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.330
 stayed on hotel c2 was a little 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.580
 whether 2,400 gold and this construction even 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.500
 with the top fives so much 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.180
 almost twice ie he was 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.490
 very expensive wallet 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.259
 and very dear to the owner now because 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.090
 indeed he is very very rare and 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.979
 why do we watch this video with you 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.630
 to know such rare tanks because 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.380
 that when the game has a little 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.020
 unique 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.790
 know it always attracts 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.619
 attention sometimes if you meet 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.750
 randomly in the random of a similar opponent 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.610
 then you know who it really is 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.890
 historically, this 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.720
 tank has a twin brother with whom they 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.880
 born born were created which 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.340
 called from 20 and in the game we have it too 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.810
 there he pump and tank 4 level 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.000
 lungs externally 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.340
 they are almost indistinguishable especially if 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.530
 about 20 put the same like 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.079
 guns this here howitzer jolly 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.360
 and they are really similar in dynamics 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.219
 both fire both motor but true 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.320
 they turn here agility with them 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.700
 weak but dynamics 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.910
 mobility is just fine 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.209
 and most importantly, what's interesting is that 32 has 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.940
 much more than a-20 booking 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:19.090
 foreheads up to 20 20 millimeters sloped and 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.450
 apparently this is the meaning of the name of the 20th 32 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.459
 not 32 millimeters 35 that is one and a half 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.010
 times more powerful in armor so the funny thing 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:31.390
 no funny thing is that the level of battles 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.769
 our game is 32 levels 4 and 5 are the most 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.769
 sand greenhouse 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.500
 while a -20 tanchik for incomprehensible 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:42.430
 whom because he gets from 4 to 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.080
 8 already a level of crazy variation and 20 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.540
 it's impossible to play now 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.849
 ok, this is generally not clear why 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.430
 Tanchik this simply some tears alone 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.090
 they tanks they game and here every battle 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.870
 here is such 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.940
 greenhouse but what's funny ya 32 have here 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.040
 This howitzers are the only three guns 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.840
 shells and so interesting that they all 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.900
 used in battle they are all relevant 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.519
 go for example by land mines that 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.620
 have armor penetration small quite 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.209
 only 38 millimeters can be for example 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.130
 punching or cutting 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.290
 what some cardboard nursery rhyme that's straight 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.870
 orders or are there any alecto 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.730
 or here still similar tanchiki 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.319
 all the other punching they punch 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.000
 sixty six millimeters well 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.489
 cumulative any stronger 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.940
 tanks odesa there b1 something or do not let 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:30.549
 god even kv-5 kv-5 not only in one nose 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.889
 KV-1 no good now such porridge 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.959
 do not cook because they are the most golden 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:36.160
 the times from these two also passed along with 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.709
 its them for sale 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.260
 because earlier its cumulative to 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.720
 updates 86 punched 100 millimeters 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.370
 then it all ponerfili accuracy 7 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.280
 apnuli but breaking through 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.560
 these all imba ponerfili and a-32 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.540
 now meeting any at all 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.730
 solid opponents has no 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.459
 a chance to cause them any 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.230
 the pain and in this is all its current 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.930
 tragedy probably for this reason you 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.450
 completely withdrawn from sale because it 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.829
 it would be worth it somehow to shoot him up 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.859
 but then it would really be already 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:10.720
 Imbo imbo absolutely he is playing now 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:13.389
 very nice and comfortable i'm here some 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.010
 time the train just plunged into it 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:17.590
 the time when I first appeared 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.959
 when he rolled in the booze in it the truth 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.690
 on 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.090
 also then the truth was somewhat different 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.229
 I think everything when he appeared well 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.490
 and now I will say that he 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.560
 really causes on and warmer 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.930
 posts on it here is the game always 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.880
 brings joy and celebration because 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.520
 every fight you count or at the top 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.080
 list or somewhere in the middle and present 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.030
 let's say so the average tank and which 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.280
 able to surprise everyone 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.130
 all upset hiring lead opponents 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.900
 and the owner will only please if one day 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.630
 suddenly there will be some opportunity for you 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.300
 and it happens to take possession of this tank 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.110
 never sell it since being 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.880
 among 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.610
 Well, it seems not so small 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.970
 numbers up to 22,000 people are all the same 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.740
 not so rarely but still 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.360
 it's rare enough for all of these 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.250
 millions of users who play 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.940
