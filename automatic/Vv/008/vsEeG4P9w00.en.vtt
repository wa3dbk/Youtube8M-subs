00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:10.309
 hello to all and all his teeth you are 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.599
 I hope fishing on the potato 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.420
 what are you waiting for battlefield said 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.190
 yes this is the theme of the video 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.230
 I had some parts 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.480
 little sinaï on the end of the beta that 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.640
 I had filmed in a bus show you 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.080
 that a little bit 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.619
 what do you expect from battlefield airlines 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.430
 which will see that from March 19 in 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:36.059
 europe 17 in the united states africa and beat 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.910
 there we know the colony of we know 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.920
 I never try to chew a little 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.800
 take a vpn to play one or 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.870
 two days before to get out 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.149
 a video on the day so the 19th 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.309
 so you give my overall opinion I 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.480
 will make a big video for you 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.739
 to say i think of the game etc 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.120
 despite who I think he will have someone 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.739
 in the first days there will be two 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.219
 three small balancing updates 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.879
 etc. 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.619
 we will see this simply in the 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.320
 video I'm talking to you a little bit so 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.450
 for those who are hesitant to take this 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.240
 that this fairline boat give you 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.650
 some opinions of a positive opinion or 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:20.400
 negative on the game if you are a 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.570
 player who is not badly foundry as to 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.880
 it does not bother them that vehicles 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.259
 but not too much here he does not like too much in 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.509
 down 4 because there are a lot of tanks 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.220
 helicopter has I think you 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.049
 will like a federline boat 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.759
 in general it will be infantry to 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.409
 some one two two watchou but 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.610
 good some of the armored vehicles 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.829
 there is just a police side vehicle and 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.780
 side so to the gangster so there is a 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.479
 vehicle like a little common 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.369
 troop transport that is armored but 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.750
 not like a tank that is a 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.670
 little shielded where we can call back 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.080
 who can appear from south sees this it's 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.600
 a bit the most armored vehicle 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.280
 ground level at the level of the helicopters 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.900
 did not say more attack as on the 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.450
 boobs are the bf a bit military and 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.640
 adjust transportation costs and nelly 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.869
 that a little like little bear become a 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.190
 motorway knowledge but we have 10 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.310
 in the game these eavesdropping attacks 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.959
 here is a little between them and alico de 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.870
 gratitude n listen with me without 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.100
 too much both here are tony oates after the 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.920
 vehicles there will be no plane 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.360
 there are a lot of gips and his two motorcycles 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.820
 but here it is not really 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.700
 very heavily armored vehicles dyer 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.900
 the engineer has no rpg had not 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.510
 in any case on the beta the 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.220
 rocket launchers so you have them at a 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.540
 battle pick up ie the packs 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.030
 that could picked up on the floor so 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.190
 all classes I can have 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.450
 recovered a rocket launcher to destroy 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.390
 the icons but it's not bad 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.950
 the engineer at angoulême 320 for this 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.930
 that I had noticed you this fight 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.510
 previous beta videos 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.610
 we have it if you are a player who 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.130
 like the ivory and maple center 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.730
 more nervous than on surfaces 3 4 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.290
 all that on b4 by that you will like 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.739
 I think very low of the year I you 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.810
 advise for what is really the 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.290
 big a big battle of vehicles and 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.410
 so 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.480
 good I think when we watch for 64th 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.209
 big cards but there will be no 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.160
 not as many vehicles as 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.820
 on the old bf who will have won deep 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.070
 etc. 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.140
 we must understand the context if there 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.790
 these cops against against gangsters they 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.609
 not going out the armored tanks 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.829
 field I mean that makes sense 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.570
 so here's for those who love everything 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.860
 which is pretty big armored vehicles 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:30.110
 I advise you to wait 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.490
 in my opinion the opinions of other people 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.810
 who will make videos on it and that's 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:37.550
 to see if you can you 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.040
 cowardly interest or not frankly 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.230
 I like the infantry as much as 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.420
 the vehicle is frankly this beta 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.090
 11th plus style is a lot more fun 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.030
 to play that on b4 for example even on 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.070
 bf3 I ​​do not think he's just missing the c4 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.080
 sniper that's a big regret I 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.930
 think the battlefield bad sniper 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.290
 company 2 with no removal with 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.270
 the c4 or the mortar I think me it's 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.640
 the best snipers of caps last bf 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.450
 there I think the bad company 2 is the one 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.500
 who was a lot 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:12.620
 who is most pleasant to play 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.760
 so that's why for the game me 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.640
 I for those who see there who love 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.750
 the vehicles were waiting a little bit 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.890
 if you do not like the splitting of course 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.570
 if you are like me I put you 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.030
 as well the triple woman vehicle I 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.770
 advise you I tell you two three 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.690
 little stuff on bf 4 fight these guys 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.180
 there a first no for what they in 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.419
 be bad company 2 either down 4 or 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.419
 either battlefield 3 so on harlan you 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:38.450
 so will have a veteran pack there will be 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:40.610
 so different xp bonuses of that and 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.710
 you will have a free dlc 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.600
 so that serves as something good 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.250
 July is pretty rare 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.140
 to have a death the gratuity is for 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.430
 apologize for your literal son 4 that has 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.260
 been a little launch was a little 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.700
 chaotic 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.479
 I sincerely hope that the launch of 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:58.550
 battlefield there it will be fine who 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.050
 will be normal in fact exceptional tobacco 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.450
 but who will be normal we will have the 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:06.800
 drinking servers that will touch a 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:08.300
 minimum 50 on bf four starts so 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.800
 this is I really hope and jose to all 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.050
 a good launch for those who go 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.120
 can buy this game I hope 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.370
 infinitely that when we look at 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.540
 will be normal we talked a lot 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.430
 are much said visceral games week in 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.140
 this low of villars line which is that which 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.210
 was really paying a lot of attention 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.640
 because the game is playable from 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.920
 output in a proper way and so it's 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.800
 I honestly think we 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.820
 a good one right now it's up to see 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.860
 I would not be told the future I'm not 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.270
 a term so I do not know but 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.820
 I hope in any case that in a good 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.900
 launch is necessarily from the beginning I 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.880
 think there will be some problems 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.820
 balancing or but weapons I think 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.890
 that from the first days it will be that 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.500
 will not be fired they really have on 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.690
 twitter really seem to be close 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.680
 from the commune of the community to listen 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.480
 the community etc 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.630
 there are so many developers who are 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:02.510
 French at visceral I think 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:05.090
 honestly that there is way we are a 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:07.310
 fairly balanced game from here first 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.800
 days and now that's the norman judge 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.720
 plays with a toy for 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.170
 competition I do not know how it's going 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.200
 pass 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.910
 so that's it's really having 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.900
 especially going to see a patch on 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:23.210
 battlefield 4 so early March who 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.980
 inaugurates in improvement at the level of 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.480
 dunes and codes so that's what 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.290
 is told on paper we will see who 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.390
 will be at stake 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.010
 an animation of the collision of 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.140
 soldiers so face is pretty good on 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.960
 will see what exactly will change and 

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.490
 they will therefore make an obligation to 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.990
 the iteration of by eskwad for the 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.930
 competition in 5v rye for the year 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:44.330
 2015 is planned for this year so 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.260
 we'll see it's true it's a 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:50.000
 little damage to the competition 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:52.250
 on on battlefield 4 ap the faithful party 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.100
 to viktor troicki to hostage mode who has 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:57.140
 looks nice for the competition so that 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:00.200
 it's a little pity but hey 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:02.790
 will see well anyway and especially on 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.610
 the 7th there 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:07.320
 so dice to dice los angeles who 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:11.520
 So take care of battery the setting of 

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:14.160
 six months fuel or anna will create a 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.570
 map with the community on the cpe and 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.940
 can be very bleak to be able to 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:20.430
 them on the set up and every week they 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.860
 will make changes on the map and 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:25.860
 following the feedbacks so the returns 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:27.960
 players on the forum it's them who 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.270
 will change the map the balances round and 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:33.540
 so they will create really 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:36.840
 create a map with the community on the 

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:38.370
 7th game mass attack on PC necessarily or 

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.260
 on console I do not know if they are mills 

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:42.390
 was on his floor and so suddenly the 

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.610
 card will be bitter and free and a plan 

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:46.890
 implemented in battlefield 4 then 

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:48.900
 it is true that it is a little late 

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:51.270
 we're going to say build there he goes out in 

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.560
 a few days they do that I think about 

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.900
 on battlefield 4 is that it's a 

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.640
 little pity but hey it's 

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.810
 always that we will not criticize already the 

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.300
 free map etc 

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:02.880
 so here I think it will be a 

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:05.280
 good thing to see in the times you 

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.770
 have given some news me I hear 

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.320
 I am obviously waiting to build the year with 

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:12.630
 great impatience 

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:15.150
 that's for sure but I leave you at 

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:17.360
 on it I tell you next time on 

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.360
 lease
