snowflake to version I'd love to do this
one<00:05:32.630> see<00:05:33.199> all<00:05:34.099> right<00:05:34.250> next<00:05:34.580> question<00:05:34.789> again

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
one see all right next question again

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.650 
one see all right next question again
from<00:05:35.569> Brandon<00:05:36.050> this<00:05:36.199> is<00:05:36.259> a<00:05:36.410> different<00:05:36.710> random

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
from Brandon this is a different random

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.939 
from Brandon this is a different random
when<00:05:38.660> is<00:05:38.810> the<00:05:38.930> next<00:05:39.050> twenty<00:05:39.380> five<00:05:39.530> percent<00:05:39.560> off

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949 
when is the next twenty five percent off

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.450 
when is the next twenty five percent off
or<00:05:40.699> 25<00:05:41.240> sep<00:05:41.509> more<00:05:41.780> speed<00:05:42.080> boost<00:05:42.289> sales<00:05:42.500> perfect

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
or 25 sep more speed boost sales perfect

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.249 
or 25 sep more speed boost sales perfect
so<00:05:43.669> there's<00:05:43.849> never<00:05:44.060> a<00:05:44.210> specific<00:05:44.780> date<00:05:44.990> that

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:45.259 
so there's never a specific date that

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:47.650 
so there's never a specific date that
will<00:05:45.380> target<00:05:45.650> say<00:05:46.009> this<00:05:46.400> state<00:05:46.639> it's<00:05:47.569> a

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
will target say this state it's a

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.360 
will target say this state it's a
randomly<00:05:48.110> so<00:05:48.349> basically<00:05:48.830> my<00:05:48.949> biggest

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
randomly so basically my biggest

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.800 
randomly so basically my biggest
feedback<00:05:49.729> would<00:05:49.880> be<00:05:49.940> checking<00:05:50.479> weekly

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
feedback would be checking weekly

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.839 
feedback would be checking weekly
