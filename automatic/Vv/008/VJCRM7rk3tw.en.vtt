 what this 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.059
 is a transparent one 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.590
 It's a great nature over the Alps 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.210
 In our case, the traffic lights began to cross 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.230
 in Ghana not at all and the tree aisle up the lake 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.720
 that was almost 400 kilometers around a good 5000 vertical meters spread over six days 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.780
 and four countries about 27 hours driving time like countless banks 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.670
 become 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.370
 what do you need a lot from a sentence 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.280

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.500
 I understand 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.600
 of course, one wonders, of course, in the six days so wrong r 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.970
 The answer is of course first we want to lay 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.890
 For Tippelt acreage he really likes it 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.940

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.890
 how was the movie remembered 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.440
 it is located on the river Gera 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.530

 Art teacher created a lot better 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:12.559
 what you see more 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:15.339
 No that's great

 the view Wiesbaden the ladies stand and the cultural experience Paukner 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:33.609
 These are physically exhausting 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:37.489
 since his reasons for making more of course be prepared Clemens 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.589
 Baptized grateful for the process led a thousand meters in altitude, though

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.699
 who have 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:15.789
 sometimes it will be a bit natural, of course 

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:20.559
 the reward is then a bottle of beer and brave judgment if you still 

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:22.279
 would like to continue cycling 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:23.790
 at the end of the day 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.610

 in the 2nd 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.669
 please very limited Mark Webber 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:25.520
 That applies to tailwind 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.509

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.059
 Moritz are 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:50.339

 now 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:11.789
 Dr 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.180
 Mid brought another record 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.180
 like Prof 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:21.960
 Grefrath 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.960
 but it is perfect 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:34.369
 moreover, in the following countries, such as Chile 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.400
 fifth came in fifth 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:44.349
 prohibited by Christopher Irmler as for example the pedestrian too 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:48.439
 But now it is now clear what his whole place is 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.860
 cross at the traffic lights 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.949
 at the fourth final game 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:55.949
 in the end you arrive somewhere south of the Alps 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.889
