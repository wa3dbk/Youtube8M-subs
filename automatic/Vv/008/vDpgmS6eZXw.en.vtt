00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.310
 i was a fidgety philipp 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.099
 someday discovered the dance and have 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.709
 noticed there is not much talk for 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.749
 I went to discos a lot 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:18.179
 danced and the sow left out until 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:21.449
 I realized what it lacks 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:23.310
 an inner page a page line the 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.080
 more connected with my body and 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.779
 who does not work against him or her 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.929
 works on performance but with him 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.240
 connected in motion 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:36.030
 I'm five back dancers and bt the 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.820
 evenings in the church on to the church dance 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.010
 that is such a passion of mine 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.760
 also comes from my biography ago because 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.750
 I as a theologian long time of the church 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.530
 have worked and try how to do it 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.440
 use new church rooms and also with 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.310
 dance can fill 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.950
 is to come into the church 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:04.199
 devotion style and I had as 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.790
 child always fantasie that 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.740
 I thought wow in the people here 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.540
 start to stand up 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.650
 move when they show their feelings 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.030
 could cry laugh anger everything that goes 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.400
 belongs to the human being 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.980
 then it will be a place very much 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:29.900
 also has to do with freedom 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:37.350
 he wiped with david matches has one 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:40.040
 color administrators have a step 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.040
 Find 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.300
 in the color 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.520
 visor 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.909
 Where 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.979
 2 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.130
 the whole thing is a meditation a wild one 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.009
 meditation a movement meditation the 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.850
 how a wave begins to build up 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:03.729
 softly flowing female and then becomes 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.680
 very expressive in the second rhythm 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.690
 male staccato has hers 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.989
 climax in chaos in the third rhythm 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.510
 chaos is the place where the idea is 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.220
 giving up control the wave is building 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.709
 then off you go into something playful 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.970
 lyrical the fourth rhythm and that 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.970
 whole ends in silence 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.500
 for me, dancing is kind of like 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.790
 connection with god it is a prayer 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.040
 prayer means nothing other than me 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.590
 entertain me with god and that means 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.110
 I use all my possibilities 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.700
 I get as a human gift 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.910
 and that's not all 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:50.069
 word and head but also hands feet 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.069
 heart whole body 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.970
 In the beginning something was david schrey 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.130
 but she gets really loud or she 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.590
 go out so that I thought 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.630
 fits that in the frame and more 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.630
 I've lost that fear before and 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.520
 it came as a kind of yes that it is the 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.100
 Above all, it needs to touch me when 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.050
 people also come in their grief or 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.230
 also in her pain and hers too 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:35.310
 to let show in community 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:37.800
 meanwhile it is more that i can 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.440
 have a greater confidence and 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.350
 that I'll say okay, there's a good one 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.490
 I can feel her three whole bodies 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.410
 gets so pure and I start with it 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.750
 try to play as wii wants 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.300
 But now I express that 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.070
 I'm sure I'll try 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.520
 to find an access as I also in the 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.240
 everyday more in the expression of feelings 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.240
 coming 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.069
 Death is a wonderful subject 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.350
 I like to do it because I like more 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.290
 and more me with the death and also 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.359
 with the concrete one to my imminent 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.760
 I discover that death connects 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.650
 live now that is not there where 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.600
 I could save on or because in 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.610
 every moment it can happen in now 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.470
 The next second could be here 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.260
 work together, I would not know it 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.600
 and then to say that okay okay 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.780
 now now it's nothing 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.030
 was more important than to enjoy the 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.710
 to be moment 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.169
 my body is a gift i must in 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.270
 Give yangon back and use it 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.460
 I fully support him with everything he does 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.510
 has and that is the message of death 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:56.480
 take the body and with everything you do 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:59.560
 have the job and bring the life 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.560
 out into the world 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.890
 how so 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.430
 I 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.009
 so 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.440
