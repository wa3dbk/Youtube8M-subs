still<00:00:13.000> trying<00:00:13.240> to<00:00:13.330> figure<00:00:13.450> out<00:00:13.630> where<00:00:13.840> it<00:00:13.960> came

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:14.139 
still trying to figure out where it came

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.019 
still trying to figure out where it came
from<00:00:16.410> down<00:00:17.410> take<00:00:17.980> a<00:00:18.010> closer<00:00:18.369> look

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
from down take a closer look

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:25.019 
from down take a closer look
one<00:00:19.630> of<00:00:19.750> the<00:00:19.840> stars<00:00:20.110> are<00:00:20.410> still<00:00:20.680> here<00:00:22.230> but<00:00:24.029> you

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
one of the stars are still here but you

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.810 
one of the stars are still here but you
know<00:00:25.119> looks<00:00:25.359> like<00:00:25.510> it's<00:00:25.720> been<00:00:25.960> pretty<00:00:26.199> well

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
know looks like it's been pretty well

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.820 
know looks like it's been pretty well
worked<00:00:27.820> over<00:00:28.300> over<00:00:28.810> the<00:00:28.960> years<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:32.500> you<00:00:32.769> know

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:32.830 
worked over over the years so you know

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:48.520 
worked over over the years so you know
it<00:00:33.010> has<00:00:33.220> been<00:00:33.489> found<00:00:33.760> before

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:01:04.219 

look<00:00:49.530> at<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:50.270> -<00:00:51.980> my<00:00:52.980> club<00:00:53.280> box<00:00:59.630> okay<00:01:03.110> here<00:01:04.110> on

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
look at the - my club box okay here on

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.609 
look at the - my club box okay here on
the<00:01:04.350> front<00:01:04.620> end<00:01:04.800> of<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:06.380> right<00:01:07.380> there

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
the front end of it and right there

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.130 
the front end of it and right there
across<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.869> front<00:01:09.869> grille<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.470> Oldsmobile<00:01:12.140> so

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
across the front grille is Oldsmobile so

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.510 
across the front grille is Oldsmobile so
it's<00:01:13.290> an<00:01:13.440> old<00:01:13.970> Oldsmobile<00:01:17.720> not<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:20.100> get<00:01:20.399> it

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
it's an old Oldsmobile not and get it

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
it's an old Oldsmobile not and get it
for<00:01:20.729> parts<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.270> suppose<00:01:21.660> but<00:01:23.210> now<00:01:24.210> I'm<00:01:24.330> going<00:01:24.479> to

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
for parts I suppose but now I'm going to

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.920 
for parts I suppose but now I'm going to
look<00:01:24.630> around<00:01:24.899> and<00:01:25.050> try<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.290> figure<00:01:25.500> out<00:01:25.710> how

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
look around and try to figure out how

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:34.190 
look around and try to figure out how
the<00:01:27.930> only<00:01:28.170> thing<00:01:28.440> I<00:01:28.590> can<00:01:28.830> figure<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:33.200> who

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
the only thing I can figure is that who

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.200 
the only thing I can figure is that who
used<00:01:34.440> to<00:01:34.619> be<00:01:34.740> an<00:01:34.890> old<00:01:35.040> trail<00:01:35.399> down<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.910> creek

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
used to be an old trail down this creek

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:45.190 
used to be an old trail down this creek
bed<00:01:37.310> that's<00:01:38.310> coming<00:01:39.180> down<00:01:39.330> through<00:01:39.690> here<00:01:39.780> and

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:53.649 

it<00:01:46.670> was<00:01:47.670> probably<00:01:48.330> abandoned<00:01:50.810> words<00:01:51.810> died

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
it was probably abandoned words died

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.770 
it was probably abandoned words died
probably<00:01:54.659> an<00:01:54.750> old<00:01:54.960> trail<00:01:56.090> going<00:01:57.090> down<00:01:57.510> to<00:01:57.750> a

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
probably an old trail going down to a

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.399 
probably an old trail going down to a
mine<00:01:58.229> shaft<00:01:58.260> or<00:01:58.890> something<00:01:59.340> like<00:01:59.520> that<00:02:00.080> but<00:02:01.080> I

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
mine shaft or something like that but I

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.460 
mine shaft or something like that but I
think<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.920> old<00:02:02.070> trail<00:02:02.520> goes<00:02:02.909> over<00:02:03.450> there<00:02:04.020> it's

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
think the old trail goes over there it's

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.380 
think the old trail goes over there it's
been<00:02:04.710> washed<00:02:04.979> out<00:02:05.250> over<00:02:05.580> the<00:02:05.700> years<00:02:05.939> quite<00:02:06.360> a

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
been washed out over the years quite a

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.630 
been washed out over the years quite a
bit<00:02:06.659> but<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.670> looks<00:02:08.670> like<00:02:08.850> remnants<00:02:09.540> of<00:02:10.430> of<00:02:11.430> an

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
bit but it looks like remnants of of an

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.340 
bit but it looks like remnants of of an
old<00:02:11.820> trail<00:02:12.120> that's<00:02:12.420> headed<00:02:12.750> down<00:02:12.959> through

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
old trail that's headed down through

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:21.160 
old trail that's headed down through
that<00:02:13.560> direction<00:02:14.220> there<00:02:16.880> okay<00:02:19.610> this<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.850> the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
that direction there okay this is the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.170 
that direction there okay this is the
right<00:02:22.170> side<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.709> it

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.120 

thinking<00:02:27.989> maybe<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.650> roof<00:02:28.830> being

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
thinking maybe that the roof being

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.220 
thinking maybe that the roof being
bashed<00:02:29.400> in<00:02:29.670> like<00:02:29.849> that<00:02:30.060> is<00:02:30.239> not<00:02:30.420> necessarily

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
bashed in like that is not necessarily

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.690 
bashed in like that is not necessarily
controlling<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:32.270> it's<00:02:33.270> probably<00:02:33.720> from<00:02:34.700> people

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
controlling it it's probably from people

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.690 
controlling it it's probably from people
jumping<00:02:36.180> on<00:02:36.360> under<00:02:36.780> no<00:02:37.380> beating<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.250> up<00:02:38.400> or

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
jumping on under no beating it up or

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.890 
jumping on under no beating it up or
whatever<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.690> looks<00:02:39.900> like<00:02:41.660> pretty<00:02:42.660> well

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
whatever it looks like pretty well

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.190 
whatever it looks like pretty well
trashed<00:02:43.200> out<00:02:44.060> anything<00:02:45.060> God<00:02:45.510> knew<00:02:45.780> has<00:02:45.930> been

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
trashed out anything God knew has been

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.259 
trashed out anything God knew has been
taken<00:02:47.360> instead<00:02:48.360> of<00:02:48.480> people<00:02:48.660> at<00:02:49.019> home<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:50.269> so

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
taken instead of people at home and so

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:59.259 
taken instead of people at home and so
forth<00:02:52.340> so<00:02:56.269> kind<00:02:57.269> of<00:02:57.360> an<00:02:57.480> interesting<00:02:58.140> old<00:02:58.260> find

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
forth so kind of an interesting old find

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.860 
forth so kind of an interesting old find
not<00:03:00.269> Bigfoot<00:03:00.780> but<00:03:01.190> interesting<00:03:02.190> I<00:03:02.870> imagined

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
not Bigfoot but interesting I imagined

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.170 
not Bigfoot but interesting I imagined
that<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:04.080> was<00:03:04.200> some<00:03:04.440> old<00:03:04.590> miner<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.310> that<00:03:05.970> was

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
that it was some old miner that that was

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.530 
that it was some old miner that that was
his<00:03:06.470> transportation<00:03:07.470> back<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:07.950> forth<00:03:08.390> to<00:03:09.390> his

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
his transportation back and forth to his

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.400 
his transportation back and forth to his
workings<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:11.299> I<00:03:12.299> can<00:03:12.510> just<00:03:12.720> imagine<00:03:12.959> how<00:03:13.349> he

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
workings and I can just imagine how he

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.220 
workings and I can just imagine how he
felt<00:03:13.799> up<00:03:14.040> here<00:03:14.599> back<00:03:15.599> in<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.989> early<00:03:17.750> 1920s<00:03:18.750> 30s

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
felt up here back in the early 1920s 30s

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.500 
felt up here back in the early 1920s 30s
I<00:03:19.590> don't<00:03:19.769> know<00:03:19.860> whatever<00:03:20.099> this<00:03:20.370> whole<00:03:20.580> thing

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
I don't know whatever this whole thing

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.620 
I don't know whatever this whole thing
is<00:03:21.750> made<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:25.160> he's<00:03:26.160> all<00:03:26.370> up<00:03:26.700> here<00:03:26.940> by<00:03:27.090> himself

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
is made and he's all up here by himself

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.380 
is made and he's all up here by himself
or<00:03:27.959> maybe<00:03:28.140> with<00:03:28.410> somebody<00:03:28.650> else<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:30.269> know

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
or maybe with somebody else and you know

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.720 
or maybe with somebody else and you know
the<00:03:30.540> engine<00:03:30.870> blows<00:03:31.109> the<00:03:31.650> tranny<00:03:31.920> goes<00:03:32.190> out<00:03:32.459> or

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
the engine blows the tranny goes out or

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.030 
the engine blows the tranny goes out or
something<00:03:33.060> like<00:03:33.150> that<00:03:33.320> and<00:03:36.410> so<00:03:37.410> they

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
something like that and so they

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.259 
something like that and so they
abandoned<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:40.100> never<00:03:41.100> came<00:03:41.340> back<00:03:41.640> I<00:03:41.850> imagine

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
abandoned it never came back I imagine

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:42.949 
abandoned it never came back I imagine
what<00:03:42.390> it<00:03:42.510> felt<00:03:42.750> like

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
what it felt like

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.740 
what it felt like
so<00:03:43.230> crap<00:03:43.650> now<00:03:43.890> we've<00:03:44.040> got<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.220> walk<00:03:45.410> back<00:03:46.410> in<00:03:47.750> you

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
so crap now we've got a walk back in you
