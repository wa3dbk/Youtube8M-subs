00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.299
 nice girl my last comment 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.109
 of modern warfare 3 last why 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.530
 the last of the series we say that I have 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.210
 opened a few weeks ago and this one 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.519
 game before starting it as you see 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.199
 there is the menu there is the weapons menu where 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.449
 you can choose perks weapons skill 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.070
 we say to each other special cision 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:30.570
 that the prepartite lobby to leave it for 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.730
 you see a little like how it works 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.410
 still the same though they are 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.550
 more things so I decided to 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.079
 release it as you see here will use the pk 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.500
 pines but will change it as soon as 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:48.120
 more you will use mp5 because obviously more 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:51.899
 strong and how he chooses the perks 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.610
 marksman blast shield and blinda i and 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.530
 rewards that you will not use because I have 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.789
 noticed that each class has its own 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.100
 reward for his strech pacan then 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.199
 he selected those but he will not use them 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.850
 where the game will change class 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.880
 always on resistance so it's always the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.610
 same map of the first game that 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.760
 I commented some time ago and how 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.610
 we will see soon this pkp will last around 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.890
 half a second to try to shoot 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:26.360
 the sniper will die come from one day 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:29.310
 exact will issue mp5 will put the mm5 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.700
 always with the amps coop with the viewfinder 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.310
 interchangeable veroli and knows as perks 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.960
 that is always the same 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.400
 always what all the miners are 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.650
 understandability from other players 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.570
 then there is assassin which is invisible to 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.970
 one therefore highly blood tests 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.259
 cold the ninja complete this then 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.979
 admire stable and who is always the one for 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.360
 for the recoil of the weapon first thing to the 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.710
 outside the comment engineer 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.619
 obviously the map doesn't have the write 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.899
 because it is always the same less useless 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.369
 I wanted to tell you to sign up for 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.680
 like the facebook page 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.560
 who created the new facebook page 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.369
 who has always created tonic that he had 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.769
 created 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.810
 what had changed her and put gold 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.489
 red and created a new one that I will 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.769
 I leave the link since on facebook more 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.989
 whether or not you were all put like 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.940
 ii and maybe if you want to ask me something 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.750
 do not believe directly there because the 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.879
 so check is often a like 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.030
 I do n't change my life so let's say it 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:32.640
 put yourself good then as a second thing 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.920
 I wanted to say that I was made a bg 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.819
 from galax media that I thank is not 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:42.299
 I leave the link of the description e 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.739
 I wanted to ask you to give me an opinion on 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.680
 as it seems to you 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:49.019
 and very nice because I noticed that there 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.519
 that is, this new style of making i 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.480
 vigilant from people with all 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:59.159
 those strange things around and very much 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:02.190
 nice to look at we say how 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:04.010
 surprise that I know I didn't have you 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.540
 said last time but I don't remember 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.239
 and that it's nice that I say anyway that 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.250
 bring to the pvr bought from side effects 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.540
 that he won't use anymore because now I have it 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.769
 I his motto is anyway and therefore will have 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.410
 going to start doing again 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.239
 comments Thursday so I'll put them on 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.639
 floors on Thursday maybe half in 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.690
 this lob Monday because it was for 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:29.970
 let's finish the series then the 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.609
 next comment the next comments 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.739
 we say they will all come on Thursday e 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:37.139
 maybe in the middle of the week like 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.910
 today I invent something Monday night 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:43.260
 something with the mini and some 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:45.360
 asshole, then, a failure 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.280
 yes since many have told me emilio 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.140
 days comment Thursday starts there 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.110
 to do so does not change anything to me 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.260
 David put the comments Thursday, October and 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:58.049
 Wednesday then to do a little for 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.370
 talk a little at the origins in many who 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.230
 asked to continue doc 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.549
 commander because now that I get it back 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:08.819
 the pvr however really takes away too much 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:11.940
 time with if I will make Sumerian offerings but 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:15.320
 I'm not sure it depends on how long 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:18.600
 but I do not think it does that I do 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.400
 and anyway since you see this game 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.030
 it started half way through the mind 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.740
 already over, this video does not last long for 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.090
 now right for the latest information 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.389
 things then from the facebook page of the 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:34.470
 background of the commentaries and the dvr 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:37.110
 above all and this character 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.370
 sympathetic is less scarce than the others 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.960
 he manages to do those as you see 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.630
 before he even risked making one 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.010
 triple with a machine that excluded 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.169
 this even manages to shoot 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.389
 decently without aiming so not not 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.520
 it's bad 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:54.870
 He dies like a dog as though still 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:57.780
 it doesn't suck we say this map with 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.250
 which I already said I think it gives me 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.199
 the idea of ​​being the main one 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.680
 of the game with the one that happens the most 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:06.479
 often kind of terminated afghan I don't know 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.770
 because it gives me this impression 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.389
 maybe why they only used this one 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.590
 but from what I saw 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.349
 surely this is what I like 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:18.300
 more because I have not seen people 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:19.979
 camp over too much and then allow the 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.960
 game is almost over then bobo 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:24.389
 the invitation to register on the page 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.020
 facebook to tell me how it looks the 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.729
 background ea 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.819
 I like what we can do 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:34.910
 reach 150 because I saw that the 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:36.199
 first video 565 then the last 230 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.430
 so we went close and they are 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:41.090
 pleased with this because it means that 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.949
 you like the commentaries and leave a 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.530
