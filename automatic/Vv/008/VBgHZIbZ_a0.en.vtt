00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
strength and competitiveness it's

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.289 
strength and competitiveness it's
looking<00:01:27.840> at<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.110> fact<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:29.000> there's<00:01:30.000> one

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
looking at the fact that there's one

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.510 
looking at the fact that there's one
winner<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.869> one<00:01:31.290> loser<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.890> that's<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.400> way

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
winner and one loser and that's the way

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.300 
winner and one loser and that's the way
it<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.600> it's<00:01:33.960> kind<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.380> like<00:01:34.590> how

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
it is so it's kind of like how
