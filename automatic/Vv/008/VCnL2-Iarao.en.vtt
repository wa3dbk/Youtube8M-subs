I<00:01:09.150> think<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.350> organ<00:01:10.740> probably<00:01:11.700> more<00:01:12.090> than

I think this organ probably more than

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.070 
I think this organ probably more than
any<00:01:12.720> organ<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.650> Western<00:01:14.010> Hemisphere

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
sounds closer to the kind of instrument

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.649 
sounds closer to the kind of instrument
that<00:01:18.360> Bach<00:01:18.600> knew<00:01:19.440> so<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.460> recreated<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.360> lot<00:01:21.540> of
