00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:07.990
 hi mates and lumiere I am here 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:11.019
 to show you the real problem that 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:14.440
 we have with the touch with the new lumia 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:17.289
 the micro only mini to 535 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.300
 was updated and in theory should 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.870
 the tactile problem has been corrected 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.000
 As you can see, it's already cut 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.220
 to show you that this is 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.050
 updated 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.570
 and I'm going to show you an example of 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.579
 problem that we have with this terminal 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.940
 is not the only one all my friends what 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.710
 they have the inaccuracy is pretty 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.070
 notorious 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.030
 and let's go to 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.030
 an app 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.400
 to show you the real problem 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:55.980
 what we have 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.980
 I'm going to all of you for a little while 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:03.070
 you see it costs 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.070
 does illogical things 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.820
 tous test a solito 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.500
 ok we are here 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:21.570
 as you see 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.250
 a finger more or less takes it well already 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.770
 the problems come when we put two 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.770
 fingers suddenly appear 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.329
 book on all sides flashes as 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:38.890
 a Cossack and so we put three fingers this 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:41.890
 since it gets totally out of control and if 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.210
 We put four directly and not 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.610
 detects fingers 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.610
 let's go now to another application 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:56.390
 so you can see that it's not the problem 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.060
 of the application but the problem is 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.960
 directly from the terminal 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.960
 a kid 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.920
 this ticket 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.580
 is that I do not remember what his name was 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.580
 exactly the application 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.939
 here is hardware test 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.550
 it's hard to even see how it looks and I'm leaving 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.550
 to go to 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.860
 multi-touch 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.400
 you will see exactly the same problem already 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.950
 with two fingers directly 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.030
 it does not focus us well, fingers appear 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.189
 invisible 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.560
 if you put three directly nothing comes out 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.900
 if you put four the problem is enlarged 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.060
 clear and people say no yes sure yes 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.920
 we can use it very clearly is that with a 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.920
 finger there is no problem with two 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.030
 you see 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.320
 I want to tell you also that two friends 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.380
 My friends advised of grace 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.750
 ada delegation mind for me I told them 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.510
 was caught on this phone have the 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.840
 Exactly the same problem has been lowered 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.930
 the same applications to check 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.920
 how is the tactile going and what happens to them? 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.530
 exactly the same way the whatsapp 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.530
 many times when you want 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.530
 rectify 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.960
 let's see if casually now it gives us 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.960
 the problem when 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.480
 we want to rectify 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.610
 I'm trying to go backwards like 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.880
 you see and it goes crazy 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:03.420
 this is insufferable so that later they come 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:05.340
 and certain magazines and better said pages 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.130
 say this is a slight problem 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.830
 this is a critical problem and the 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.630
 problem still exists after the 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.269
 update and it does not happen to me it happens 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.549
 to all the world 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.160
 just who has this phone 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.319
 download some application to 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.930
 check the touch and you will see the 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:27.280
 good results this has been everything and 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.300
 draw your own conclusions 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.300
 see you later
