00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.100
 I was one of the official photographers of the men's fashion festival of 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.599
 sanremo what does it remember of those years what will happen at sanremo festival 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.799
 I would be very much a man of ideas in men's fashion 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:14.949
 enthusiasms 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.519
 of new things that were proposed every year for men's fashion 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.590
 indeed, male fashion was born, especially that of the accessory 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.029
 why the accessories to them were 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.599
 they were while the jumps did have their local schools in the big cities 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:33.560
 Naples 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.800
 it was one of the most important in Rome's certain sources of work 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.200
 milan with high venice but if they made them be models 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.330
 they have had 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.110
 lol the opportunity to see each other together to give birth to what is then 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.670
 become an Italian fashion 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.020
 which characters gravitated around the festival of sanremo in fashion one by 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.250
 all that was the creator of the modera festival michelangelo testa che era 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.420
 director 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.900
 in the sea you will return to yourself star 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.719
 and it was the one who had the patience, the capacity for intuition 

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:07.270
 to gather all the saints who 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.200

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.040

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.020

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.530

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.159
 every year they launch 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.440
 at least in renault models new fabrics are missing 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.829
 so the absolute name is michelangelo head or heart there are 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.310
 those of the various subheading Caracene schools 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.399
