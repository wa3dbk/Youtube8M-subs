00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.430
 good people like this I hope that 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.200
 are very good today this 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.570
 video for the reason that I am 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.120
 doing so it is not with another nor 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.660
 music or anything is for the simple fact of 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.750
 what 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.930
 is about the care of the beta fish 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.450
 as it is commonly good and I did it 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:26.950
 because I was watching some videos not 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:29.760
 I had nothing that was good to know if 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:34.269
 were the tips that gave iu they were good 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.300
 I said no because they gave everything 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:40.120
 contrary to how to take care of it they were not 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.120
 giving wrong explanation not then I go 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.030
 to tell them how to take good care of 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:50.230
 a beta fish okay okay starting from 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.870
 the simplest good that's a simple 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.760
 of caring does not require anything but 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.070
 still so if you want to have it 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.800
 I live for a long time you must have it 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.170
 with what you need not good we're going to 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.340
 start with the first your habitat is a 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.340
 fish 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.880
 that needs a fish tank a fish tank 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.310
 about 120 liters it's not good to have 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.740
 as seen on these things these 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.229
 mothers are useless the only thing that 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.930
 is going to be your beta fish is to go blind and 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.310
 is going to die in is not going to die so 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.540
 fast but the fish will go blind 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.170
 beta and he's going to die for that because 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.450
 from inside they see everything they do not see well neither 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.030
 even the view and apart has not 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.300
 oxygenation has no filtering does not have 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.270
 nothing pinche de agua pinche expedita de 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.300
 shit and good let's continue with another one that is 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.950
 the same have a gas tank and how 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.080
 is but a little bit one of a few 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.960
 20 liters, well, it does not cost them 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.470
 it's always a 20-liter tiny one and 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.450
 the following is a filtering 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.590
 and upload trailers oxygenation as a 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.810
 filter that has the like the one that we have 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.610
 here but a little bit smaller and not 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.970
 matter how you 're not going to do for the 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.470
 torque 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.730
 a small filter and an oxygenation 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:07.920
 chiquitano then this other is this 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.500
 your food or your diet is 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.650
 based on the little mothers that come 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.330
 here that is a fish habit like they are 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.590
 some balls 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.480
 the balls as you see are balls of 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.870
 circular but it is an omnivorous weight what 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.880
 you can give them flakes or pellets or what 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.530
 you want as long as this one 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.540
 accept not so you see that he does not accept you from 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.850
 I will try to give you something else 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.280
 until I eat that flat and 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.010
 get used to the diet in good otherwise 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.650
 what is important this is to have in 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.090
 realize that the psoe is a fish 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.220
 territorial that started a bit aggressive 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.590
 that has this is going to have some 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.360
 tendencies and this aggressive this that 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.190
 happens if I put a pc is here in my 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.010
 pc was that I do not have here is a fish tank 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.470
 of 40 liters this what will happen is 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.700
 that my Japanese weight of my Japanese feet 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.470
 or I argue that if you what are going 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.580
 to do is that they will start to bite 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.440
 and how is a pc is oscar territorial 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.440
 or the Japanese are going to start rallying 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.959
 of game your flight then your flight will 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.840
 it's going to wear out until it's gone 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.640
 see it and so automatically it is going to 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.260
 to die not if he always stays he dies 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.310
 the fish go obviously and it's going to be 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.040
 an ugly death 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.069
 will not be able to swim anymore then 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.360
 it is better to have it alone as long as 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.600
 this 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.070
 that is in a worthy aquarium but something else 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.200
 also important is that if you want it 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.410
 have in an aquarium with other fish 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:41.160
 before being here the 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:44.760
 I do not know neon is a lady 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.530
 I do not know small fish and quiet but 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.940
 as long as it is a large aquarium 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.100
 for example here I can not have a beta 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.710
 because here they will kill him the one of the 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.770
 Japanese cars and raise the moles 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:58.680
 the little nuns are going to kill him then 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.960
 what I tell them to have a minimum of one 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.240
 20-liter fish tank 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.250
 action option a good filtration 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.870
 heater is not necessary because it is a 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.180
 cold water fish 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.980
 and nothing is she is a lady if her 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.620
 feeding is omnivorous remember what 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.940
 you what is normally given 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.530
 to the fish and that would be all the guys 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.470
 I hope you liked the video that 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.390
 Has served them something this was what 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.490
 normal that should be done in a fish 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.590
 beta do not believe that in a sphere and that's not 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.690
 they are pulled I do not know what is due 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.890
 to do is to have a fish tank well if you 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.980
 you want that you can beta this video 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:37.180
 I should do it for a long time 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.770
 good guys I hope you liked it 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.259
 see you until the next video 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.020
 lessons all the same as you already 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:48.090
 they will know and well we will see nothing nothing until 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.090
 the next video bye
