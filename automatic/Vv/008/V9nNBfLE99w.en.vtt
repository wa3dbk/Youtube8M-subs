to be the being there the Kohi be in
there<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.700> done<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:47.910> being<00:00:48.809> there<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:49.289> that

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
there and done that being there on that

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.709 
there and done that being there on that
I<00:00:49.620> think<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.460> whole<00:00:50.610> idea<00:00:51.120> really<00:00:51.270> on<00:00:51.480> coffee

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
I think the whole idea really on coffee

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.330 
I think the whole idea really on coffee
with<00:00:51.960> current<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.350> actually<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.860> read<00:00:53.100> between

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
with current is actually to read between

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.459 
with current is actually to read between
the<00:00:53.550> lines<00:00:53.699> sometimes<00:00:54.629> it's<00:00:55.020> things<00:00:55.260> they

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
the lines sometimes it's things they

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.900 
the lines sometimes it's things they
don't<00:00:55.800> say<00:00:56.129> but<00:00:56.430> say<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.730> with<00:00:56.879> that

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
don't say but say it with that

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.939 
don't say but say it with that
expression<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:58.079> what<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.620> kind<00:00:58.829> of

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
expression is what you have to kind of

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.740 
expression is what you have to kind of
find<00:00:59.309> out<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.670> like<00:00:59.820> look<00:01:00.030> induce<00:01:00.329> up<00:01:00.510> stare

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
find out and like look induce up stare

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.299 
find out and like look induce up stare
out<00:01:00.780> you'll<00:01:01.379> just<00:01:01.500> scratch<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.859> surface<00:01:01.890> a

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
out you'll just scratch the surface a

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.650 
out you'll just scratch the surface a
little<00:01:02.430> bit<00:01:02.699> yeah<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.329> time<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.600> think

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
little bit yeah this time I think

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.539 
little bit yeah this time I think
everyone's<00:01:04.229> coming<00:01:04.559> really<00:01:04.860> guarded<00:01:05.430> by

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
everyone's coming really guarded by

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.980 
everyone's coming really guarded by

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270
