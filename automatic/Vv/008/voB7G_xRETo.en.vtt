00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.840
 and hi everyone 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.180
 for videos that's this time 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.580
 manufactured by 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.440
 sniper then this sniper rifle a 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.380
 particularity compared to all 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.000
 other jacobs weapons is that in fact the 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.950
 jacobs men originally do not need 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.090
 bequeath leman term and this one makes 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.270
 damage but it only damages 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.560
 explosive because actually red texting 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.169
 still means something in 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.260
 made to repercussions made on the 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.940
 characteristics of tears his 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.030
 characteristic of the red text passed 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.239
 that they add explosive delegate then 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.520
 this weapon to have it already will take you 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:49.210
 buy or if you already have the death 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.489
 bloody carnage of the organ and who gets 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.260
 means ah yes the army dropped by all 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.880
 the types of biker possible and those 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.290
 who are on the bikes here he is it's 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.210
 the flamboyant biker who want to taste 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.440
 good I will not see him directly who 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.910
 well said and I see him afterwards 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.960
 advancing a bit good I do not move too much 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.989
 because otherwise I will quickly make myself 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.670
 banging because bikers actually 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.930

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.830
 expect each time 24 hours they 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.360

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.530
