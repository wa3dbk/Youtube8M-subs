00:00:26.795 --> 00:00:29.755
 We are all human. 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.460
 Each of us is human. 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.620
 (Go live!) 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.360
 This can't go on. 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.720
 ENOUGH! 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.120
 No justice! 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.360
 A growing number of terrorist attacks emanate from altered citizens danger. 

00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.733
 Once I thought I could save the world ... 

00:00:52.288 --> 00:00:54.288
 And that's what came of it. 

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:56.388
 Tinker: - help me! 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.720
 Sometimes you need to let go of the past and accept those 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.300
 what have you become 

00:01:18.102 --> 00:01:21.802
 They worked in secret for years 

00:01:21.802 --> 00:01:23.802
 defining the future 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.500
 managing lives and managing information 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.780
 While they play their game, the innocent die. 

00:01:32.831 --> 00:01:36.731
 We will no longer sit back 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.891
 Don't let them keep us at bay 

00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:42.051
 and ignorance. 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.880
 We will not allow to drive ourselves to the bottom. 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.280
 And treat us like outcasts. 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.980
 We are ready to go to extreme measures. 

00:01:52.602 --> 00:01:54.602
 The world has changed ... 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.460
 the old rules no longer apply ... 

00:02:05.924 --> 00:02:07.924
 Too much pain ... 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.360
 Too many lies ... 

00:02:16.038 --> 00:02:19.218
 Their darkness is time to end! 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.360
 This is war and your brother too! 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.900
 The age of light will never come! 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.330
 DotA Ex Separation Mechanisms. 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.600
 I will not allow this ...
