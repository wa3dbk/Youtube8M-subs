00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:34.080
 have a customer scha 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.180
 as judges Alberto 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.580
 typical coulis 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.650
 third 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.730
 have our 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.200

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.900
 mega tv cbs 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.550
 percent 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.550
 this afternoon it is important to highlight 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.060
 this everything is real esteem necessary 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.850
 have a revolt and to be able to connect 10 through that hy hy power 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.910
 edit to be the permissions 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.910
 tents was a folder 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.220
 I think I should 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.390
 If we have a country with a box because we are not there, there are simply so many 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.950
 federal power gerardo knicks 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.920
 Our internal assets is positive 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.270
 then the simple reason for this 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.640
 piqué tunja is a voice oo 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.760
 5 alfons return uu any other works in the same way I dare to 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.380
 do 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.920
 they can not take until the permissions information of ap mendoza and 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.030
 that's why we need we can really connect through sch very well 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.720
 positive then I started 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.740
 as I had said interconnected master device 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.740
 belt came this in addition the computer 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.110
 2nd we will have jaeger vox 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.690
 European ce connected the device if the dgt 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.340
 Wolf 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.800
 ramón oaks gil 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.800
 we see an option that says it was headquarters 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.259
 photo to vs 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.319
 what this option does 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.419
 is that 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:14.399
 through 

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:15.829
 due to injury is not serious 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.239
 it creates us 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.659
 a tunnel that you want yes 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:22.549
 one year later country 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:23.729
 so 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:25.079
 we retain 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.539
 the possibility of 

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:31.309

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.969
 We do not remember the city very well 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:55.429

 on the server we are going to put this address 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:16.909
 in this case it is my choice 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.019
 the employer's car any other number 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.019
 in this case with onion 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:25.809
 the username 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:27.829

 5 have changed the one 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.199
 assumes by default when doing is break 

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:43.939

 let's read to allow 

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:57.269
 the automatic mind we are already inside 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.359

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.339
 besides replacement 

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:03.729
 I'm going to be an example 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:06.729
 so that you can change the permissions 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:10.819
