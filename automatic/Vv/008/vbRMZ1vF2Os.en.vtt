using<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.800> wire<00:00:25.980> wheel<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.609> use<00:00:27.599> my<00:00:27.840> bench<00:00:28.080> wheel

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
using a wire wheel I use my bench wheel

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.089 
using a wire wheel I use my bench wheel
my<00:00:29.970> bench<00:00:30.210> grinder<00:00:31.019> with<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.230> wire<00:00:31.500> wheel<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:31.949> it

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
my bench grinder with a wire wheel on it

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.220 
my bench grinder with a wire wheel on it
to<00:00:32.189> clean<00:00:32.399> up<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.880> two<00:00:33.540> valves

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.680 

that<00:00:40.230> feels<00:00:40.410> good<00:00:40.560> and<00:00:40.680> clean<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.760> then<00:00:42.660> I

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
that feels good and clean and then I

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.520 
that feels good and clean and then I
used<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.970> hand<00:00:44.970> drill<00:00:45.180> with<00:00:45.900> a<00:00:45.930> wire<00:00:46.290> wheel

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
used a hand drill with a wire wheel

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.070 
used a hand drill with a wire wheel
attachment<00:00:47.130> to<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:48.120> clean<00:00:48.630> the<00:00:48.750> top<00:00:48.960> of

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
attachment to it to clean the top of

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.470 
attachment to it to clean the top of
this<00:00:49.200> off<00:00:49.820> what<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.850> did<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:53.060> kept<00:00:54.060> the<00:00:54.150> piston

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
this off what I did is I kept the piston

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.760 
this off what I did is I kept the piston
at<00:00:54.570> up<00:00:54.750> good<00:00:54.960> Center<00:00:55.200> like<00:00:55.350> that

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
at up good Center like that

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.880 
at up good Center like that
and<00:00:56.310> I<00:00:57.060> used<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.960> wire<00:00:58.140> wheel<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.530> clean<00:00:58.739> this

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
and I used the wire wheel to clean this

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.740 
and I used the wire wheel to clean this
up<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.510> put<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.720> in<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.950> vise<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.570> pretty<00:01:03.570> much

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
up I put this in a vise and pretty much

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.020 
up I put this in a vise and pretty much
did<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:03.989> same<00:01:04.080> thing<00:01:04.470> he<00:01:04.620> had<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.860> plant<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.940> in

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
did the same thing he had to plant it in

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.760 
did the same thing he had to plant it in
the<00:01:06.090> vise<00:01:06.300> and<00:01:06.570> use<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.050> wire<00:01:07.200> wheel<00:01:07.440> to<00:01:07.590> clean

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
the vise and use the wire wheel to clean

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.980 
the vise and use the wire wheel to clean
that<00:01:07.920> if<00:01:08.040> as<00:01:08.160> good<00:01:08.310> as<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.520> could

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.190 

so<00:01:15.040> now<00:01:16.040> that<00:01:16.100> everything<00:01:16.490> is<00:01:16.520> all<00:01:16.670> cleaned<00:01:16.940> up

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
so now that everything is all cleaned up

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.380 
so now that everything is all cleaned up
the<00:01:18.200> next<00:01:18.470> set<00:01:18.650> next<00:01:19.640> thing<00:01:19.880> that<00:01:19.910> we<00:01:20.120> want<00:01:20.240> to

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
the next set next thing that we want to

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.310 
the next set next thing that we want to
do<00:01:20.540> is<00:01:20.750> to<00:01:21.160> lap<00:01:22.160> the<00:01:22.370> valves<00:01:22.790> this<00:01:23.780> is<00:01:23.960> the

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
do is to lap the valves this is the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.350 
do is to lap the valves this is the
intake<00:01:24.680> valve<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:27.790> we<00:01:28.790> are<00:01:28.880> going<00:01:29.030> to<00:01:29.150> take<00:01:29.330> a

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
intake valve and we are going to take a

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.640 
intake valve and we are going to take a
little<00:01:29.570> bit<00:01:29.720> of<00:01:30.100> valve<00:01:31.100> grinding<00:01:31.790> compound

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:48.390 

and<00:01:36.650> dab<00:01:37.070> it<00:01:37.100> here<00:01:38.770> on<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.950> seat<00:01:40.420> of<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.840> valve

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.950 

come<00:01:49.400> on

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.840 

here<00:01:54.740> we<00:01:54.830> go

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
here we go

00:01:56.850 --> 00:03:16.290 
here we go
and<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.450> get<00:01:57.600> my<00:01:57.690> tool<00:01:59.420> suction<00:02:00.420> cup

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.120 

that<00:03:16.900> looks<00:03:17.110> pretty<00:03:17.260> uniform<00:03:17.800> all<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:17.980> way

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
that looks pretty uniform all the way

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:45.640 
that looks pretty uniform all the way
around

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.410 

it<00:03:46.280> looks<00:03:46.430> pretty<00:03:46.519> good<00:03:46.760> now<00:03:46.970> what<00:03:47.090> we<00:03:47.180> do<00:03:47.299> the

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
it looks pretty good now what we do the

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.710 
it looks pretty good now what we do the
same<00:03:47.599> thing<00:03:48.849> for<00:03:49.849> the<00:03:49.970> exhaust<00:03:50.239> valve<00:03:52.390> so<00:03:53.390> a

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
same thing for the exhaust valve so a

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:07.120 
same thing for the exhaust valve so a
couple<00:03:53.959> of<00:03:54.140> day<00:03:54.290> abs<00:03:54.439> here

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:05:22.970 

let's<00:04:07.550> get

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.570 

that's<00:05:23.550> looking<00:05:23.970> good<00:05:24.980> now<00:05:25.980> we<00:05:26.040> got<00:05:26.280> our<00:05:26.400> valve

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
that's looking good now we got our valve

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:37.899 
that's looking good now we got our valve
left

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:37.909 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:43.629 

all<00:05:38.909> right<00:05:39.120> I<00:05:39.150> think<00:05:39.419> it's<00:05:39.569> time<00:05:39.780> now<00:05:39.810> to<00:05:41.180> put

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 
all right I think it's time now to put

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:51.050 
all right I think it's time now to put
the<00:05:44.639> valve<00:05:44.819> back<00:05:45.060> in<00:05:45.300> place<00:05:49.849> put<00:05:50.849> the<00:05:50.879> head

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
the valve back in place put the head

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.449 
the valve back in place put the head
back<00:05:51.090> on
