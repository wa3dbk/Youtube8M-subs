00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
fouls so yeah this is simple textures it

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.069 
fouls so yeah this is simple textures it
makes<00:00:57.989> my<00:00:58.199> game<00:00:58.760> run<00:00:59.760> just<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.329> bit<00:01:00.780> more

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
makes my game run just a bit more

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.820 
makes my game run just a bit more
smoother<00:01:01.680> since<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.250> does<00:01:02.399> not<00:01:02.430> really<00:01:02.940> need

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
smoother since it does not really need

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.770 
smoother since it does not really need
these<00:01:04.830> really<00:01:05.220> high<00:01:05.430> tech<00:01:05.760> shit<00:01:05.869> and<00:01:07.939> I<00:01:08.939> have<00:01:09.750> a

know good yeah that's my HUD and my
crosshair<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.369> pretty<00:01:45.240> much<00:01:45.390> one<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
crosshair is pretty much one of the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.580 
crosshair is pretty much one of the
original<00:01:46.950> file<00:01:47.280> crosshairs<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.420> didn't<00:01:49.320> change

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
original file crosshairs I didn't change

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.950 
original file crosshairs I didn't change
it<00:01:49.829> because<00:01:49.920> it's<00:01:50.159> not<00:01:50.280> necessary<00:01:50.880> since<00:01:51.299> all

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
it because it's not necessary since all

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.870 
it because it's not necessary since all
i<00:01:52.020> need<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.380> just<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.680> visible<00:01:53.280> crosshair

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
i need is just a visible crosshair

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.530 
i need is just a visible crosshair
overall<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.950> it's<00:01:55.950> not<00:01:56.100> really<00:01:56.159> needed<00:01:56.939> for<00:01:57.360> me

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
overall so it's not really needed for me

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.450 
overall so it's not really needed for me
to<00:01:57.719> our<00:01:57.750> get<00:01:58.409> one<00:01:59.450> and<00:02:00.450> yeah<00:02:01.200> that's<00:02:01.409> my<00:02:01.619> HUD<00:02:01.860> so
