different<00:01:58.570> one<00:01:59.380> order<00:01:59.680> might<00:01:59.890> be<00:02:00.100> just<00:02:00.340> 425

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
different one order might be just 425

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.510

10 different breeds so the orders can be
simple<00:02:07.330> or<00:02:07.390> complex<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.940> incubation<00:02:10.330> process

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
simple or complex the incubation process

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.170 
simple or complex the incubation process
really<00:02:11.440> requires<00:02:12.010> three<00:02:12.489> basic<00:02:12.910> things

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
really requires three basic things

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.729 
really requires three basic things
you've<00:02:13.510> got<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.750> have<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.930> right<00:02:14.110> temperature

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
you've got to have the right temperature

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.280 
you've got to have the right temperature
the<00:02:14.770> right<00:02:15.280> humidity<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.570> eggs<00:02:16.780> have<00:02:17.110> got

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
the right humidity and the eggs have got

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.920 
the right humidity and the eggs have got
to<00:02:17.410> be<00:02:17.530> turned<00:02:17.890> regularly<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:19.420> eggs<00:02:19.570> need<00:02:19.840> to

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
to be turned regularly the eggs need to

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.160 
to be turned regularly the eggs need to
be<00:02:20.020> turned<00:02:20.200> regularly<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:22.120> membrane<00:02:22.870> does

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
be turned regularly so the membrane does

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.949 
be turned regularly so the membrane does
not<00:02:23.320> stick<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:23.920> shell<00:02:24.190> so<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:25.060> embro<00:02:25.510> can

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
not stick to the shell so the embro can

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.790 
not stick to the shell so the embro can
develop<00:02:26.739> and<00:02:26.950> turn<00:02:27.580> in<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.150> egg<00:02:28.239> as<00:02:28.510> it<00:02:28.690> grows

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
develop and turn in the egg as it grows

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.070 
develop and turn in the egg as it grows
we<00:02:30.130> have<00:02:30.480> 1950<00:02:31.480> Robbins<00:02:32.080> incubators<00:02:32.800> we<00:02:33.100> have
