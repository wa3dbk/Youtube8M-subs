00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 welcome to the channel i recall about and 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.069
 i rigpa in games hello my dear 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.830
 viewers are the most advertising and now we will 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.410
 play Engry birds Minecraft angry birds 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.680
 yes this small card holds three 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.960
 buildings here are the first second and third these 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.900
 trolleys that move it like 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.570
 our little birds up who take off and 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.330
 begin to demolish this building 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.560
 three trolleys that are needed inside 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.399
 destroy in lava 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.010
 2, as it were necessary if we are lucky to 3 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.770
 but it doesn't always work because the map 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.320
 a little bit complicated not so yes i 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.440
 still thought it would be just like 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.730
 angry birds pulled and everything is not here 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.829
 harder 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.809
 Well, honestly it's pretty 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.850
 interesting because now we will 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.530
 sample 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.270
 come to our buttons and look to 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.910
 trolley go up as soon as she 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.039
 rises we press and here 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.289
 there is a movement everything starts 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.480
 crashing somehow move here is an example of how 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.790
 now well we will try them by 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.490
 maximum that it is possible to destroy it 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.320
 and we make a link to this card 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.950
 will be in the description because you can 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.990
 try this buzz means so look 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.619
 to the next cart as soon as she 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.200
 rises we press and happens 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.320
 movement occurs movement from 1 bug 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.840
 the thread is burnt here and super here and super 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.380
 at least something done and here already 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.610
 lucky 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.780
 so look we look we look 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.840
 lowered lowered lowered 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.840
 since the face and so only she 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.950
 rises we press look what's here 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.979
 may occur 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.100
 but unfortunately not everything is so simple not everything 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:52.229
 so easy but try what difference 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:57.240
 need to try so she goes down she 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.140
 falls and rises we press so 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.960
 so so so so 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:05.430

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.940
 quick quick quick 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.910
 run to 2 buildings 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.630
 here a little bit harder and harder but in 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.360
 the limits 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.940
 achievable here we have a lot of lava 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.130

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:20.190
 he is pretty good here I can not even 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:22.440
 understand why I do not know 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.450
 means the map generated means so 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:29.490

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:31.620
 everything acted when we played well 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.050
 as I said the card will be in the description 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.120
 then you can check everything yourself 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.729
 it works but I quickly say so 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:44.729
 I'll take a minute to literally show you 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:47.010
 how is it all built enough well how 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.349
 I just would not say that at all super 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:53.789
 just well, it can be possible 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:56.760
 it is so easy to build 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:59.580
 fell but alive everything is fine let's we 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.750

 for minecraft there is such a colorful 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.050
 the data somehow saw it complicated but 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.970
