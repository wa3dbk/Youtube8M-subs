button looking thing in the front but
what<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.200> really<00:02:26.470> like<00:02:26.650> is<00:02:26.920> that<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.430> tube<00:02:27.790> the

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
what I really like is that the tube the

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.660 
what I really like is that the tube the
cover<00:02:28.330> kind<00:02:28.930> of<00:02:29.110> they<00:02:29.590> must<00:02:29.800> have<00:02:29.950> magnets<00:02:30.550> in

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
cover kind of they must have magnets in

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.490 
cover kind of they must have magnets in
it<00:02:30.820> or<00:02:30.940> something<00:02:31.330> because<00:02:31.870> like<00:02:32.260> when<00:02:32.410> you

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
it or something because like when you

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.800 
it or something because like when you
get<00:02:32.680> it<00:02:32.800> close<00:02:33.100> to<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.370> bottom<00:02:33.580> it<00:02:33.940> just<00:02:34.209> snaps

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
get it close to the bottom it just snaps

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.680 
get it close to the bottom it just snaps
and<00:02:35.170> closes<00:02:35.800> don't<00:02:36.520> by<00:02:36.670> itself<00:02:37.000> okay<00:02:37.270> which

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
and closes don't by itself okay which

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.380 
and closes don't by itself okay which
and<00:02:37.930> then<00:02:38.020> it<00:02:38.140> locks<00:02:38.470> almost<00:02:39.130> so<00:02:40.030> it's<00:02:40.209> really

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
and then it locks almost so it's really

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.330 
and then it locks almost so it's really
really<00:02:40.570> good<00:02:40.959> when<00:02:41.740> you<00:02:41.890> have<00:02:42.070> it<00:02:42.160> in<00:02:42.250> your

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
really good when you have it in your

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.580 
really good when you have it in your
purse<00:02:42.550> because<00:02:42.970> then<00:02:43.120> it<00:02:43.240> won't<00:02:43.390> twist<00:02:43.959> off<00:02:44.320> or

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
purse because then it won't twist off or

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.229 
purse because then it won't twist off or
anything<00:02:44.770> so<00:02:45.190> I<00:02:45.220> think<00:02:45.490> that<00:02:45.640> was<00:02:45.760> just<00:02:45.790> really

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
anything so I think that was just really

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.990 
anything so I think that was just really
really<00:02:46.480> genius<00:02:47.020> as<00:02:48.010> far<00:02:48.250> as<00:02:48.340> whoever<00:02:48.610> designed

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
really genius as far as whoever designed

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.590 
really genius as far as whoever designed
it<00:02:49.180> okay<00:02:49.600> so<00:02:50.200> there's<00:02:50.440> that<00:02:50.560> then<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:52.480> know

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
it okay so there's that then you know

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.930 
it okay so there's that then you know
the<00:02:52.810> actual<00:02:53.350> packaging<00:02:54.100> as<00:02:54.370> far<00:02:54.550> as<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.790> tube

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
the actual packaging as far as the tube

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.310 
the actual packaging as far as the tube
I<00:02:55.150> think<00:02:55.360> that's<00:02:55.540> really<00:02:55.750> really<00:02:55.840> pretty

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
I think that's really really pretty

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.680 
I think that's really really pretty
along<00:02:56.950> with<00:02:57.070> that<00:02:57.220> there<00:02:57.519> you<00:02:57.610> go<00:02:57.760> then<00:02:58.450> the

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
along with that there you go then the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.610 
along with that there you go then the
actual<00:02:59.140> lipstick<00:03:00.040> itself<00:03:00.400> okay<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:00.790> have<00:03:01.180> the

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
actual lipstick itself okay I have the

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.750 
actual lipstick itself okay I have the
color<00:03:02.620> voila

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
color voila

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.380 
color voila
which<00:03:04.120> is<00:03:04.300> 1<00:03:04.570> 2<00:03:04.900> 0<00:03:05.290> 120<00:03:06.100> and<00:03:06.580> it<00:03:06.700> says<00:03:06.880> love<00:03:07.180> from

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
which is 1 2 0 120 and it says love from

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.420 
which is 1 2 0 120 and it says love from
our<00:03:07.540> lip<00:03:07.930> gel<00:03:08.170> okay<00:03:08.709> so<00:03:08.769> I<00:03:08.890> guess<00:03:09.070> that's<00:03:09.250> what

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
our lip gel okay so I guess that's what

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.210 
our lip gel okay so I guess that's what
they<00:03:09.610> call<00:03:09.880> it<00:03:09.910> and<00:03:10.269> it<00:03:11.110> is<00:03:11.410> just<00:03:11.440> such<00:03:11.980> a

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
they call it and it is just such a

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.840 
they call it and it is just such a
creamy<00:03:12.910> and<00:03:13.239> smooth<00:03:13.830> formula<00:03:14.830> it<00:03:15.040> is<00:03:15.220> really

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
creamy and smooth formula it is really

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.330 
creamy and smooth formula it is really
really<00:03:16.269> good<00:03:16.630> I<00:03:16.660> love<00:03:17.080> it<00:03:17.110> I<00:03:17.440> love<00:03:17.860> it

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
and what I really like about it is that

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.560 
and what I really like about it is that
especially<00:03:20.320> in<00:03:20.440> this<00:03:20.560> color<00:03:20.830> is<00:03:21.040> in<00:03:22.000> a<00:03:22.239> pinch
