00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.269
 hello beautiful today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.250
 make these two beautiful hairstyles that 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.889
 they are very practical for the school the 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.809
 work or to leave was a request 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.180
 by a subscriber and both contain 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:24.750
 braids and they are very easy and quick to 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:26.340
 do I hope you like beautiful with 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.650
 beautiful let's start with this 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.320
 first hairstyle I already have my hair 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.960
 divided to one side and let's leave 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.420
 little bit fringe and let's grab a good 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.850
 tuft and this we will separate it over 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.920
 of our head with some pins like that 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.670
 to better be able to make the braids for 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.670
 this hairstyle 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.230
 let's grab another good amount of 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:54.579
 hair behind our fringe 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.290
 an amount that is more or less like this and 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.200
 this mention of hair we 're going to 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.699
 divide into three equal parts to 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.699
 to be able to start our press 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.580
 let's start by taking the wick from 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.400
 outer side and we're going to go through 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.620
 under the middle wick and follow 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.500
 by crossing over the other wick 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.870
 outside which is going to be the same but 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.940
 in the opposite direction and so we continue 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.680
 crossing the hair from one side to another 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.680
 until we finish our braid 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.830
 ah 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.070
 let's do the braid since it's a 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.530
 little longer than the central part of 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.390
 our head and then without letting go 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.280
 where the braid ends by hand 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.020
 free let's go pulling hair from 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.020
 the sides to loosen it a bit 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.470
 when we have finished loosening 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.390
 the braid we let loose the lock 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.000
 we separate and comb our hair well 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.100
 back our hair after we go to 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.990
 join this braid with the braid of 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.120
 another side that is made of it 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.250
 way but how is this on the side 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.260
 divided with less hair was not 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.680
 It is necessary to remove a lock in the part 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.680
 over 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.099
 let's put the two wreathed in the middle 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.260
 from the back of our head and 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:46.090
 we are going to hold them with a clear rubber band 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.090
 dark or the color of your preference 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:58.060
 and ready already if you want to add a 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.890
 accessory can use bows flowers 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.439
 entrepreneurs with different designs 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.390
 to cover where we put the rubber or 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:06.629
 just to give it a touch more 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.629
 female 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.390
 for our second hairstyle too 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.330
 let's start with our hair 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.830
 divided to the side and we're going to take 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.960
 All our hair and we will 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.120
 gather towards the side of our fringe 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.290
 combing how well everything is in its 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.420
 place 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.000
 we will continue to divide our hair 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.489
 in three equal parts and we're going to 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.069
 start this braid by dividing one of 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.290
 the outer parts in half and 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:44.170
 we will pass the middle part between 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.329
 divided parts the parts that passed 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.340
 over the middle fuse we are going to 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.950
 put together so they can make a 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.500
 we're going to do the same thing with the 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.409
 outside but we're going to do it in 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.569
 the opposite direction in this case the 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:01.629
 It was the middle wick that we divided 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.549
 principle since the second wicks 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:06.010
 divided come to the middle and return to 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.470
 form a wick we will begin as 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.730
 principle and we will follow this pattern up 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.730
 finish our braid 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.890
 as we get along we go 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.810
 to love our braid we're going to 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.530
 secure with a meal of the color of 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.530
 our preference 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.700
 then while we lightly hold on 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.350
 where we tie our braid we go to 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.480
 loosen the hair from the parts 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.570
 outside of the braid to make it a 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.330
 little more loose and natural should be 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:16.160
 an untouchable part between the two parties 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.160
 exteriors that we are loosening 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.230
 and so is the result 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.729
