00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.770 
which I'm not a huge fan of that map
it's<00:01:34.799> got<00:01:34.979> multiple<00:01:35.340> levels<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.150> sometimes

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
it's got multiple levels and I sometimes

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.300 
it's got multiple levels and I sometimes
have<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.140> hard<00:01:37.170> time<00:01:37.470> figure<00:01:37.740> out<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.979> people

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
have a hard time figure out of people

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.130 
have a hard time figure out of people
are<00:01:38.400> below<00:01:38.670> me<00:01:38.850> or<00:01:39.299> they're<00:01:39.479> above<00:01:39.689> me<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:39.900> yes

I<00:01:40.259> know<00:01:40.290> there's<00:01:40.590> certain<00:01:40.890> ways<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.250> could

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
I know there's certain ways you could

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.380 
I know there's certain ways you could
look<00:01:41.460> at<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.640> red<00:01:41.759> but<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.030> heat<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.299> battle

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390

look at the red but in heat of battle
i'm<00:01:42.659> not<00:01:42.780> busy<00:01:42.930> looking<00:01:43.259> at<00:01:43.350> my<00:01:43.439> radar<00:01:43.710> i<00:01:43.740> just

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
i'm not busy looking at my radar i just

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.109 
i'm not busy looking at my radar i just
want<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.070> know<00:01:44.130> where<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.670> heck<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.909> guy<00:01:45.060> is

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
want to know where the heck the guy is

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.999 
want to know where the heck the guy is
but<00:01:45.450> yeah<00:01:45.899> there's<00:01:46.110> kind<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.320> multiple<00:01:46.740> levels

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
but yeah there's kind of multiple levels

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.440 
but yeah there's kind of multiple levels
here<00:01:47.130> most<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:47.970> going<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.210> be<00:01:48.240> like

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
here most of it is going to be like

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.850 
here most of it is going to be like
interior<00:01:48.869> like<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.530> where<00:01:49.680> you're<00:01:49.770> looking

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
interior like this where you're looking

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.399 
interior like this where you're looking
except<00:01:50.670> for<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.119> dom<00:01:51.479> flag<00:01:51.810> which<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.170> kind

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
except for the a dom flag which is kind

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.830 
except for the a dom flag which is kind
of<00:01:52.500> out<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.740> open<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.579> snipers<00:01:54.090> may<00:01:54.570> have<00:01:54.810> a

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
of out in the open so snipers may have a

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.600 
of out in the open so snipers may have a
little<00:01:55.110> bit<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.259> fun<00:01:55.470> time<00:01:55.710> with<00:01:56.189> some<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.549> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
little bit of fun time with some of the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.240 
little bit of fun time with some of the
corridors<00:01:57.030> for<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.840> most<00:01:58.020> part<00:01:58.229> i'd<00:01:58.590> say<00:01:58.950> no

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
corridors for the most part i'd say no

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.740 
corridors for the most part i'd say no
you<00:01:59.490> want<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.700> stick<00:01:59.850> with<00:01:59.880> like<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> shotgun<00:02:00.570> or

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
you want to stick with like a shotgun or

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.450 
you want to stick with like a shotgun or
a<00:02:00.810> fusion<00:02:01.140> rifle<00:02:01.409> for<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.649> matter<00:02:01.890> close

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
a fusion rifle for that matter close

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.550 
a fusion rifle for that matter close
quarters<00:02:02.850> but<00:02:03.000> we're<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.299> dumb<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:03.899> that's

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
quarters but we're a dumb is that's

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.780 
quarters but we're a dumb is that's
where<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.950> could<00:02:05.100> probably<00:02:05.250> pull<00:02:05.490> off<00:02:05.610> some

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
where you could probably pull off some

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.999 
where you could probably pull off some
cool<00:02:06.000> Snipes<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.630> another<00:02:07.469> thing<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.979> i

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
cool Snipes and another thing that i

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.559 
cool Snipes and another thing that i
think<00:02:08.160> they<00:02:08.520> knocked<00:02:08.819> out<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.179> park<00:02:09.420> again

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
think they knocked out of the park again

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.020 
think they knocked out of the park again
with<00:02:10.259> pretty<00:02:11.069> much<00:02:11.160> all<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.580> maps<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:11.910> i've

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
with pretty much all the maps that i've

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.309 
with pretty much all the maps that i've
reviewed<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.390> far<00:02:12.599> well<00:02:12.720> actually<00:02:12.840> all<00:02:12.989> four

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
reviewed so far well actually all four

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.930 
reviewed so far well actually all four
new<00:02:13.470> people<00:02:13.500> came

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
new people came

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.360 
new people came
they're<00:02:14.600> symmetrical<00:02:15.200> okay<00:02:15.530> in<00:02:15.950> my<00:02:16.130> opinion

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
they're symmetrical okay in my opinion

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.190 
they're symmetrical okay in my opinion
and<00:02:17.060> their<00:02:17.210> didn't<00:02:17.600> feel<00:02:17.750> like<00:02:17.780> there<00:02:18.020> was<00:02:18.080> one

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
and their didn't feel like there was one

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.860 
and their didn't feel like there was one
predominant<00:02:18.860> dominant<00:02:19.790> flip<00:02:20.060> he's<00:02:20.570> ever<00:02:20.690> done

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
predominant dominant flip he's ever done

predominant dominant flip he's ever done
a<00:02:20.930> dominant<00:02:21.800> flag<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:22.550> know<00:02:22.670> like<00:02:22.880> gonna<00:02:23.150> I

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
a dominant flag you know like gonna I

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.060 
a dominant flag you know like gonna I
always<00:02:23.810> say<00:02:23.900> blind<00:02:24.170> watch<00:02:24.350> it's<00:02:24.770> like<00:02:24.950> you

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
always say blind watch it's like you

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.860 
always say blind watch it's like you
gotta<00:02:25.220> get<00:02:25.370> see<00:02:25.550> or<00:02:25.670> be<00:02:25.820> sure<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.600> time

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
gotta get see or be sure the time

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.390 
gotta get see or be sure the time
usually<00:02:27.110> have<00:02:27.320> a<00:02:27.350> better<00:02:27.500> chance<00:02:27.590> with<00:02:28.010> C<00:02:28.160> or<00:02:28.250> B

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
usually have a better chance with C or B

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.400 
usually have a better chance with C or B
and<00:02:28.730> I<00:02:29.300> think<00:02:29.480> Twilight<00:02:29.780> gap<00:02:29.810> we<00:02:30.110> always<00:02:30.290> like

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
and I think Twilight gap we always like

and I think Twilight gap we always like
to<00:02:30.440> go<00:02:30.590> for<00:02:30.740> a<00:02:30.800> for<00:02:31.100> some<00:02:31.190> reason<00:02:31.430> but<00:02:31.580> it<00:02:31.970> felt

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
to go for a for some reason but it felt

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.940 
to go for a for some reason but it felt
like<00:02:32.300> just<00:02:32.870> like<00:02:32.960> thieves<00:02:33.230> dan<00:02:33.470> just<00:02:33.800> like
