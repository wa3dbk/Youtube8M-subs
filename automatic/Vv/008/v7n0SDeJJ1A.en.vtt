I like this bottle actually because it

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.640

does miss the product instead of spray
the<00:03:25.799> product<00:03:26.099> heavily<00:03:26.669> so<00:03:26.819> that<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.120> runs<00:03:27.389> off

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
the product heavily so that it runs off

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.670 
the product heavily so that it runs off
of<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.769> area<00:03:29.389> so<00:03:30.389> we've<00:03:30.510> missed<00:03:30.720> on<00:03:30.930> there<00:03:31.169> I'm
