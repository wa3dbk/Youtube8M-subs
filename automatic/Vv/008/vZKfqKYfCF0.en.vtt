00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
hundred LEDs in it this is also the I

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.780 
hundred LEDs in it this is also the I
actually<00:00:28.740> call<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:31.070> I<00:00:32.070> don't<00:00:32.399> know<00:00:32.489> what

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
actually call it the I don't know what

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.330 
actually call it the I don't know what
the<00:00:32.910> exact<00:00:33.210> ratio<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.780> but<00:00:34.380> off<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.130> side

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
the exact ratio is but off to the side

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.139 
the exact ratio is but off to the side
as<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.820> can<00:00:35.850> see<00:00:36.890> half<00:00:37.890> them<00:00:38.190> are<00:00:38.399> flood<00:00:38.760> so

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
as you can see half them are flood so

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.790 
as you can see half them are flood so
you<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.450> little<00:00:39.690> jagged<00:00:40.020> edges<00:00:40.230> inside

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
you have the little jagged edges inside

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.990 
you have the little jagged edges inside
and<00:00:41.040> then<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.460> middle<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:43.079> full<00:00:44.000> slot

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
and then the middle of it is a full slot

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.130 
and then the middle of it is a full slot
beam<00:00:45.590> and<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.800> kit<00:00:47.160> comes<00:00:47.489> with<00:00:47.670> all<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.140> the

beam and this kit comes with all of the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.170 
beam and this kit comes with all of the
wiring<00:00:49.530> harness<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.399> means<00:00:50.579> everything

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
wiring harness that means everything

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.880 
wiring harness that means everything
literally<00:00:51.899> connect<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> battery<00:00:52.530> and

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
literally connect to the battery and

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.540 
literally connect to the battery and
wire<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.399> up<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:54.079> let's<00:00:55.079> put<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.309> switch

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
wire it up to let's put it to the switch

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.790 
wire it up to let's put it to the switch
that<00:00:56.760> comes<00:00:57.000> with<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.570> then<00:00:58.079> hook<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.680> up

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
that comes with it and then hook it up

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.279 
that comes with it and then hook it up
to<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.070> light<00:00:59.219> bar<00:00:59.430> it's<00:00:59.940> super<00:01:00.600> easy<00:01:00.629> all

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
to the light bar it's super easy all

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.520 
to the light bar it's super easy all
quick<00:01:01.710> connects<00:01:02.010> no<00:01:03.350> other<00:01:04.350> wiring<00:01:04.710> needed<00:01:06.530> so

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
quick connects no other wiring needed so

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.940 
quick connects no other wiring needed so
now<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:07.920> nice<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.159> dark<00:01:08.580> out<00:01:09.560> I'll<00:01:10.560> show<00:01:10.650> you

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
now it's nice and dark out I'll show you

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.710 
now it's nice and dark out I'll show you
what<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.220> looks<00:01:11.369> like<00:01:11.520> with<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:12.119> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
what it looks like with just the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.130 
what it looks like with just the
headlights<00:01:13.409> on<00:01:13.619> now<00:01:14.600> should<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.720> turn<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:16.020> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
headlights on now should I turn on the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.610 
headlights on now should I turn on the
ignition<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.740> doesn't<00:01:17.040> annoy<00:01:17.220> me

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.690 

so<00:01:22.620> this<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.520> lothario<00:01:24.120> this<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.780> with<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.700> HID

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
so this is lothario this is with the HID

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.930 
so this is lothario this is with the HID
headlights<00:01:27.920> with<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.160> projector<00:01:31.490> well<00:01:32.490> house

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
headlights with the projector well house

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.870 
headlights with the projector well house
hanging<00:01:33.240> as<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.570> call<00:01:33.870> it

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
hanging as you call it

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.219 
hanging as you call it
leggo<00:01:35.880> fair<00:01:36.150> distance<00:01:36.510> they're<00:01:36.840> really<00:01:37.080> nice

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
leggo fair distance they're really nice

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.610 
leggo fair distance they're really nice
but<00:01:37.979> they<00:01:38.130> cut<00:01:38.370> off<00:01:38.550> this<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.750> now<00:01:39.930> with<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
but they cut off this is now with the

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.650 
but they cut off this is now with the
little<00:01:41.520> light<00:01:41.700> bar<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.450> on<00:01:42.570> the

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
little light bar that I have on the

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.100 
little light bar that I have on the
front<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.350> two<00:01:43.530> floods<00:01:44.840> gives<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.960> some

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
front and the two floods gives it some

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.640 
front and the two floods gives it some
good<00:01:46.260> throw<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.000> then<00:01:48.000> we'll<00:01:48.660> turn<00:01:48.900> those<00:01:49.200> off

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
good throw and then we'll turn those off

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.190 
good throw and then we'll turn those off
and<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.760> what<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.150> 50<00:01:51.479> inch<00:01:51.630> light<00:01:51.840> bar

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.830 

which<00:01:55.200> again<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.860> cameras<00:01:56.280> does<00:01:56.940> not<00:01:57.210> do<00:01:57.690> it

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
which again the cameras does not do it

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.520 
which again the cameras does not do it
justice<00:01:57.869> but<00:01:58.410> this<00:01:58.619> goes<00:01:58.920> very<00:01:59.880> far<00:02:00.410> so<00:02:01.410> that's

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
justice but this goes very far so that's

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.130 
justice but this goes very far so that's
what<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.830> light<00:02:02.009> bar<00:02:02.220> and<00:02:02.490> I'll<00:02:02.940> show<00:02:03.150> you<00:02:03.210> the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
what the light bar and I'll show you the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.680 
what the light bar and I'll show you the
difference<00:02:04.500> between<00:02:05.420> cameras<00:02:06.420> not<00:02:06.509> really

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
difference between cameras not really

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.280 
difference between cameras not really
focusing<00:02:07.200> but<00:02:08.420> I'll<00:02:09.420> show<00:02:09.570> you<00:02:09.600> now<00:02:09.810> light<00:02:10.080> bar

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
focusing but I'll show you now light bar

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:16.910 
focusing but I'll show you now light bar
off<00:02:11.959> these<00:02:12.959> are<00:02:13.230> high<00:02:13.410> beams<00:02:13.680> on<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:16.440> light

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
off these are high beams on the light

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:25.850 
off these are high beams on the light
bar<00:02:17.130> on<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:21.150> now<00:02:21.330> this<00:02:21.600> is<00:02:21.950> no<00:02:22.950> lights<00:02:24.739> just<00:02:25.739> a

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
bar on and now this is no lights just a

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.500 
bar on and now this is no lights just a
light<00:02:26.070> bar<00:02:26.989> so<00:02:27.989> that<00:02:28.049> finalizes<00:02:28.680> my<00:02:28.830> review

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
light bar so that finalizes my review

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.940
