00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:15.630
 then you want if I were you 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:19.619
 I made a total of 130 of our church for 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.060
 Because of the step size saw few 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.480
 ramon shames 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.480
 man that's why I think it's late 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.189
 I would have it there once more in the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.540
 song festival listen to songs 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:37.500
 madrid word is one of the songs 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:39.540
 this time I think it is a rival in all 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.640
 the history of ufpb and there has been 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.570
 least one song with the word way 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.510
 Yes, it is he who says that he speaks outside. 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.460
 like my heart is the sea that only I 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.250
 I did not realize that it was my life. 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.690
 tears marmara and moor sea the sea but 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:02.730
 sea ​​and sea ​​sea and sea 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:04.229
 I remember this goal is to conclude 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.570
 in the coming years as the song called 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:12.540
 of garbage in the sea both to the same famous sea 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.020
 with braga and juca both uses to make the 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.700
 The same things I do not want to talk about 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.700
 who is supposed to make money 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.580
 because one more animal even called today 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.790
 in a form for a pizza 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.340
 yesterday was because when it became synthetic 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.610
 explaining is singing the song yes about the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.210
 who wants the song being seen that is 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.369
 unlikely 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.520
 This shade savior I 'm not gay today . 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.710
 but it's about the marketing world 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.210
 I am considering this good hypothesis and 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.649
 this is already complicated because it is 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.539
 tolerated brought themes as much as 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.429
 and we have a lot of research on the 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.619
 I listened to him and that's why I'm going to do the thing. 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.509
 more discreetly with some 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.789
 verbal juggling I hope 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.020
 students perceive and the children what 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.319
 I say it's because they 're not in the 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.329
 school was never so lucky and I 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:04.549
 good this is about technological innovation in 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:07.700
 fund has just been released on the market 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.879
 America under the approaching device 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.000
 awa with gaga gaga 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.739
 yes it's a pillar the league hawks are not 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.620
 for this part of the body was not the father of 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.930
 baby is an American version is in part 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.959
 of that is a camera capable of transmitting 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.640
 image by bluetooh to a computer and 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.650
 to transmit the computer to whoever 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.959
 Wanna Skype, for example, you can do 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.269
 skype with this and so is this impacts 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.160
 a camera coast that is a camera of 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.019
 high quality high definition or other 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.120
 part the paraná faces consume as 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:44.120
 gaga is also a pleasure author appliance 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.760
 for the ladies for some of us 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.260
 but also is the kind of thing that not be 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.840
 more used by ladies so now 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.670
 joining the two things an object only 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.950
 video version what to do with the 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:01.819
 take self symptoms 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:04.579
 but very shaky and it's very much there 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:08.030
 and allow you to make calls from 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.470
 video that made us the call from 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.489
 hence he wants to make an incoming call 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.970
 it was not a flop 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.970
 yea 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:23.660
 I was not convinced of the advantages 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:26.720
 I stopped because I did not have our knots. 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.870
 which reflects the drug - reflects on 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.220
 technology with more points or send by 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.990
 that a part of the stylist uses a 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.820
 new technology to book the vote 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.370
 presented heavy but there is more 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:41.240
 You know the web forum in what already 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.890
 did not live 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.590
 Let's say youtube from the movies to 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.660
 creative people to focus can not 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.790
 rabieh malta to innovator and com 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.709
 ecological consciousness 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.120
 so the parents just threw in the 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.110
 market something called henrique 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.239
 band 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.160
 the objective of this for him which is a 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.530
 precious wrist a watch 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.190
 the goal is to save electricity 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.110
 for what to do is the following there is no 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.820
 very close to the panel video that does not 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.670
 is limited to seeing the videos of the rna 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.660
 raise some particular people 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.030
 type of activity 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.440
 the will to interact and they as this 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.030
 involves moving the hand with some speed 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.320
 deep down and let's now think about the 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.000
 families who listen to them in the 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.490
 a site of people who see it many 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.169
 Sometimes they like what they see so much 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.330
 clap hands 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.820
 I could not clap not 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.620
 import what you did then this is this 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.320
 invention of the panel in which basically 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.140
 You put on the wrist is not a book. 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.520
 that with the cable of four years for a 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.729
 mobile phone 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.580
 then come the video really start 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:47.759
 to the book the life of a movement of the current 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:51.210
 virus generates outgoing power including 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:54.300
 mobile phone having my see something has 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:57.059
 that being is at the time that today is already 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.699
 energy transmission and was the 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:05:01.589
 title can accumulate energy and then 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:05.819
 later when we can even 

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:09.870
 High altitude is at the time the days arrives 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:21.960
 late when I was a kid, I would have 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:23.939
 An absurd touch is just stadium 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:36.449
 goes towards the backyard of the property 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:38.009
 free and with that the plug just did not like 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.419
 to live alone but at the same time 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.249
 is being positive 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:43.409
 the lone pushing motion 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:45.270
 stage before any car and 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:48.060
 It's fascinating today, I think it's over. 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:52.289
 with some eventual position in Brazil 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:54.209
 this procedure only when 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.459
 made a promotional video of the church where 

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:58.050
 says anything like now if a 

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:59.370
 woman caught red-handed already has a 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.979
 explanation 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.189
 I'm here and to the cell phone this is to save 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:04.189
 the planet 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:11.520
 well this is enough this is in a way 

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:13.289
 Did you agree that there is a new 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.169
 man's arrival to the moon 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:18.990
 and it is this material worthy of beto novel 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:21.509
 you an eventual guilt give rise to a 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.759
 productive feeling is the manufacturers of 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:25.589
 cigarettes for men and women is 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:28.979
 generically for those who use their hands 

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:31.050
 a franzin which means that it does not 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:33.360
 it is a person well looked at things for 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.129
 if you have a mobile phone while the 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.830
 is to say goodbye should charge the mobile phone 

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:40.770
 and that immobile state estate is the same 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:43.259
 laptop computer striving to 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:47.009
 play all or nothing for progress 

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:48.710
 my friends do not even know their hands 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:51.740
 stay with mann 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.480
 of weird people there and will 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.900
 they saw clearly that I had been 

00:06:53.480 --> 00:07:00.530
 loaded with the magnet came in from the side 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:05.600
 wait this time in his career and Jose 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:07.340
 carlos soon won for an offer or the 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.410
 March month parents know the woman 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.930
 our offers to mother died 

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:16.250
 The dog is a good idea is to avoid a 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:18.730
 choice does not value baby is the touch 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.730
 gracie
