 how about german friend muscle to the cap 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.650
 no it is not the roll that there is gray is not what 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.379
 I 'm going but it's just that I want to 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.560

 you can buy in bad muscle dotcom 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.400
 but the reason for this video is not 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.880
 design a sweatshirt but that is 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.830
 teach us a way to make a meal 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.779
 that we will not call it trap food 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.539
 because in reality you will see that it is not 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.239
 but it is a rehash that is to say it is a 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:37.940
 calorie food more than usual you 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.449
 teach the main ingredients 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:45.220
 We are talking about pizza but this is 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:48.000
 a special pizza dough 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:52.450
 which is local very low in carbohydrates 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 130 granites are just each of the 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.850
 masses with which we are talking about 13 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.400
 grams of carbohydrates in addition to type 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.760
 fibrous by treats is made from 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.250
 soybean meal and gluten-based with 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.160
 which is high in protein and very low in 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.640
 carbohydrates and practically zero in 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.860
 fats well apart from this we have 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.650
 tomatoes that we're going to make it so natural 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.990
 that we're going to even grate the tomato 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.520
 so that it is not tomato bought in 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.210
 can but be totally tomato 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.479
 natural a little onion the salt that 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.790
 never remember must miss we are going to 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.340
 put some mushrooms 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.220
 one of tuna cans that also tuna 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.770
 natural could be the oil in this 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.340
 case will choose a natural because I have 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.010
 the whim of putting some anchovies in 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.320
 olive oil and degrade the touch 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.710
 exact and precise touch of acids 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.040
 essential fatty acids you need this rifi 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.260
 Well, these are the basic ingredients 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.670
 and with this we are going to get down to 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.670
 work we started 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:23.660
 and well, we already have the pizza 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.930
 prepared with all the ingredients or 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.600
 I remember the sublime pizza dough 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.210
 tomato at the end we have done more 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.700
 natural impossible grated tomato and 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.040
 titled ingredients as ones 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.560
 Laminated mushrooms and a little bit of 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.170
 onion the tuna obviously because it's a 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.590
 Tuna pizza and that caprichito of 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:49.160
 Anchovies that will give you that flavor 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:51.200
 that salty little dot but now if what 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.500
 so let's put 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:58.350
 a vigil of alkaline salt 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.770
 and the magic touch that the 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:05.160
 oregano like all pizza to control 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.140
 a little bit the quantities I prefer 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.930
 measure it because it would not be the first time 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:14.030
 that the boat was danced and I ate the 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.030
 whole pizza full of oregano 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.680
 that he would miss to be a piece 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.440
 complete good in this case could you 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.140
 missing cheese that we could use some 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.250
 type of cheese thinned but today since 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:37.810
 I made the trap food yesterday 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.970
 yesterday Saturday today as I was saying that 0 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.790
 it's just a rehash and I do not want 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.680
 that there are more ingredients or more kilo 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.650
 calories of the necessary with which 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.390
 they are just the ingredients and the 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.730
 nutritional values ​​that I need and the 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.040
 cheese in this particular case today there would be 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.750
 but I already tell you friends that does not take away 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.150
 you can put some cheese needs 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.630
 low fat cheese to give that touch 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:04.510
 we will prepare special and pizza 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.850
 We have the oven hot and using 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.530
 cupcake as always look that is going to 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.130
 charge to control so that it is 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.200
 all the point that I do not forget because 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.690
 for dessert 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.400
 I recommend casein casein with 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.980
 yogurt that you can buy in more muscle 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.260
 dotcom which in this case is of flavor 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.639
 lemon that I love and that's going to be my 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.340
 pole to complement 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:31.759
 repeat pizza with the ingredients 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.099
 natural so baked for 15 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:36.460
 minutes will be ready to eat what 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.460
 you are going to see 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.400
 while the pizza is being made in 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.200
 the casein is not prepared 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.529
 lemon that you can buy in more muscle 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:01.019
 dotcom and we are simply going to add 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:03.449
 water already depends and if we like more 

00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:05.369
 thick or less thick and let's go 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:08.099
 removing, I recommend you do it 

00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:10.559
 very carefully because 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:12.959
 raises a lot of dust and one ends with 

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:16.649
 the shirt in this case the sweatshirt 

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:19.409
 golding filled fills full of casein and 

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:20.939
 it's a can, so you have a click 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:24.649
 little patience but no matter 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:24.649
 because you have 12 minutes left 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:39.570
 and well, here we have prepared the 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.330
 casein with lemon flavor yogurt and I've 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:45.660
 added as you can see some 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.100
 nuts 15 grams completely only 15 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.190
 grams of nuts because they are the acids 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:53.250
 essential fatty acids that you need for 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.590
 the dinner is complete in all 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.930
 macronutrients so now we have 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.260
 prepared and to take a little bit of 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:03.560
 posture we're just going to leave inside 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.560
 of the refrigerator 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.969
 limit is just laughing to achieve them 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:29.300
 the pizzas that are dotted but not 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:29.300
 very hot 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.740
 and now we have 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:43.740
 we have my two nutritious pizzas 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:51.300

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.520
