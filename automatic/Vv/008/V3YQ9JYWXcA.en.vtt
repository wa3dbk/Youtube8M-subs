00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.810 
will be in the down bar I was looking on
the<00:00:26.289> web<00:00:26.440> sounds<00:00:26.650> like<00:00:27.010> nothing<00:00:27.610> on<00:00:27.700> this

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
the web sounds like nothing on this

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.000 
the web sounds like nothing on this
website<00:00:27.880> is<00:00:28.240> ever<00:00:28.600> gonna<00:00:28.780> fit<00:00:29.020> me<00:00:29.200> so<00:00:29.380> I<00:00:29.800> don't

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
website is ever gonna fit me so I don't

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.450 
website is ever gonna fit me so I don't
know<00:00:30.070> why<00:00:30.220> I'm<00:00:30.340> looking<00:00:30.730> um<00:00:31.320> but<00:00:32.320> then<00:00:32.619> I<00:00:32.860> saw

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
know why I'm looking um but then I saw

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.279 
know why I'm looking um but then I saw
this<00:00:33.699> and<00:00:33.910> thought<00:00:34.000> there's<00:00:34.809> a<00:00:34.960> slight<00:00:35.260> chance

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:35.289 
this and thought there's a slight chance

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:37.260 
this and thought there's a slight chance
that<00:00:35.770> might<00:00:36.039> fit<00:00:36.309> because<00:00:36.820> it<00:00:36.910> looked<00:00:37.090> quite

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
that might fit because it looked quite

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.930 
that might fit because it looked quite
baggy<00:00:37.480> and<00:00:37.809> I<00:00:37.989> thought<00:00:38.199> I<00:00:38.579> don't<00:00:39.579> supposed<00:00:39.850> to

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
baggy and I thought I don't supposed to

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.360 
baggy and I thought I don't supposed to
be<00:00:40.030> way<00:00:40.180> over<00:00:40.480> sized<00:00:40.690> and<00:00:41.020> is<00:00:41.440> even<00:00:41.800> oversized

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
be way over sized and is even oversized

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.729 
be way over sized and is even oversized
on<00:00:42.550> me<00:00:42.700> which<00:00:42.880> is<00:00:42.910> a<00:00:43.180> bit<00:00:43.390> weird<00:00:43.420> so<00:00:44.290> if<00:00:44.500> you<00:00:44.590> are

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
on me which is a bit weird so if you are

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.810 
on me which is a bit weird so if you are
a<00:00:44.770> plus-size<00:00:45.160> girl<00:00:45.430> and<00:00:46.800> one<00:00:47.800> this<00:00:48.010> it<00:00:48.610> will

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
a plus-size girl and one this it will

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.880 
a plus-size girl and one this it will
probably<00:00:49.059> fit<00:00:49.329> you<00:00:49.360> because<00:00:49.870> you<00:00:50.559> know<00:00:50.680> it's

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
probably fit you because you know it's

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.910 
probably fit you because you know it's
really<00:00:51.040> buggy<00:00:51.340> and<00:00:52.120> it<00:00:53.079> is<00:00:53.260> this<00:00:53.590> I've<00:00:53.800> been

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.020 
really buggy and it is this I've been
wanting<00:00:54.190> something<00:00:54.340> like<00:00:54.550> this<00:00:54.700> for<00:00:54.820> so<00:00:55.000> long

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030
