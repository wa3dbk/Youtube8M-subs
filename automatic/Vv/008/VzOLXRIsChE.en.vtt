00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
is serious amounts of damage so to

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.510 
is serious amounts of damage so to
balance<00:01:07.170> out<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.409> damage<00:01:07.860> they<00:01:08.189> give<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.460> a

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
balance out the damage they give it a

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.490 
balance out the damage they give it a
slower<00:01:08.850> rate<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.150> fire<00:01:09.360> there<00:01:10.200> isn't<00:01:10.470> that

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
slower rate of fire there isn't that

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.469 
slower rate of fire there isn't that
much<00:01:10.830> difference<00:01:10.890> between<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.909> pea<00:01:12.119> shooter

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
much difference between this pea shooter

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.780 
much difference between this pea shooter
and<00:01:12.659> previous<00:01:13.439> pea<00:01:13.650> shooters<00:01:14.070> but<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.549> can

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
and previous pea shooters but you can

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.219 
and previous pea shooters but you can
tell<00:01:15.090> there<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.450> slower<00:01:15.780> rate<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.049> fire

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
tell there is a slower rate of fire

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.350 
tell there is a slower rate of fire
because<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.280> has<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.700> great<00:01:18.000> amount<00:01:18.240> of

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
because this has a great amount of

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.539 
because this has a great amount of
damage<00:01:18.540> for<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.170> splash<00:01:19.560> attack<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:20.130> would

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
damage for the splash attack I would

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.030 
damage for the splash attack I would
suggest<00:01:20.759> using<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.509> on<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.780> game<00:01:22.229> mode<00:01:22.500> where

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
suggest using this on a game mode where

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.200 
suggest using this on a game mode where
there<00:01:23.220> are<00:01:23.340> gonna<00:01:23.460> be<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.640> lot<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.030> zombies

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
there are gonna be a lot of zombies

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.600 
there are gonna be a lot of zombies
grouped<00:01:24.810> together<00:01:24.990> such<00:01:25.740> as<00:01:25.950> gardens<00:01:26.430> and

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
grouped together such as gardens and

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.090 
grouped together such as gardens and
graveyards<00:01:26.820> or<00:01:27.270> norm<00:01:27.930> bomb<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.680> reason<00:01:28.979> for

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
graveyards or norm bomb the reason for

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.859 
graveyards or norm bomb the reason for
this<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.790> closer<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.329> zombies<00:01:30.689> are

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
this is the closer the zombies are

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.870 
this is the closer the zombies are
together<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.740> more<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.040> Splash<00:01:32.340> Damage<00:01:32.369> is

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
together the more the Splash Damage is

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.700 
together the more the Splash Damage is
spread<00:01:33.180> out<00:01:33.329> throughout<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.720> zombies<00:01:34.229> so

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
spread out throughout the zombies so

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.499 
spread out throughout the zombies so
that<00:01:34.920> means<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.579> if<00:01:35.729> there<00:01:35.970> are<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> couple<00:01:36.329> of

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
that means that if there are a couple of

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.390 
that means that if there are a couple of
zombies<00:01:36.689> together<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.710> fire<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.310> you

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
zombies together and you fire and you

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.859 
zombies together and you fire and you
get<00:01:38.520> Splash<00:01:38.820> Damage<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.479> have<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> higher

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
get Splash Damage you have a higher

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.050 
get Splash Damage you have a higher
chance<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.350> getting<00:01:40.560> multiple<00:01:41.189> kills<00:01:41.460> which

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
chance of getting multiple kills which

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.240 
chance of getting multiple kills which
therefore<00:01:42.329> can<00:01:42.570> earn<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.020> more<00:01:43.229> coins<00:01:43.590> we've

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
therefore can earn you more coins we've

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.160 
therefore can earn you more coins we've
now<00:01:44.460> taken<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.880> look<00:01:45.030> at<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.329> firepower<00:01:45.780> that

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
now taken a look at the firepower that

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.870 
now taken a look at the firepower that
the<00:01:46.320> berry<00:01:46.530> shooter<00:01:46.920> kangi<00:01:47.310> boats<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.729> the

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
the berry shooter kangi boats in the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.940 
the berry shooter kangi boats in the
game<00:01:48.090> now<00:01:48.750> let's<00:01:48.960> take<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> look<00:01:49.409> at<00:01:49.560> some<00:01:49.770> other

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
game now let's take a look at some other

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.340 
game now let's take a look at some other
things<00:01:50.040> such<00:01:50.729> as<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.030> ammo<00:01:51.329> capacity<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:52.049> the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
things such as the ammo capacity and the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.139 
things such as the ammo capacity and the
reloading<00:01:52.740> time<00:01:53.100> but<00:01:53.520> before<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.820> get<00:01:54.030> into

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
reloading time but before I get into

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.120 
reloading time but before I get into
them<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.570> just<00:01:54.689> want<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.200> say<00:01:55.350> when<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.950> won't

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
them I just want to say when you won't

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.410 
them I just want to say when you won't
want<00:01:56.250> these<00:01:56.340> characters<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.210> free

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
want these characters in the free

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.149 
want these characters in the free
sticker<00:01:57.689> packs<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.290> were<00:01:58.409> given<00:01:58.770> they

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
sticker packs that you were given they

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.219 
sticker packs that you were given they
already<00:01:59.549> come<00:01:59.880> with<00:02:00.060> every<00:02:00.450> single<00:02:00.630> upgrade

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
already come with every single upgrade

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.139 
already come with every single upgrade
so<00:02:01.680> there<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:01.979> no<00:02:02.159> chance<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.640> being<00:02:02.850> able<00:02:03.000> to

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
so there is no chance of being able to

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.480 
so there is no chance of being able to
get<00:02:03.299> an<00:02:03.450> increased<00:02:03.930> amount<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.290> damage<00:02:04.649> faster

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
get an increased amount of damage faster

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.399 
get an increased amount of damage faster
reloading<00:02:05.880> time<00:02:06.149> or<00:02:06.420> extra<00:02:06.899> ammo<00:02:07.140> everything

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
reloading time or extra ammo everything

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.889 
reloading time or extra ammo everything
is<00:02:08.220> already<00:02:08.610> maxed<00:02:08.910> out<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.300> these<00:02:09.479> are<00:02:09.780> the

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
is already maxed out so these are the

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.150 
is already maxed out so these are the
maximum<00:02:10.349> damage<00:02:10.560> reloading<00:02:11.430> time<00:02:11.610> and

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
maximum damage reloading time and

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.820 
maximum damage reloading time and
capacity<00:02:12.760> that<00:02:13.240> you<00:02:13.360> can<00:02:13.570> get<00:02:13.780> in<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.170> game<00:02:14.410> if

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
capacity that you can get in the game if

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.070 
capacity that you can get in the game if
you<00:02:15.040> take<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.280> look<00:02:15.490> at<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.850> ammo<00:02:16.060> capacity<00:02:16.360> you

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
you take a look at the ammo capacity you

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.870 
you take a look at the ammo capacity you
are<00:02:17.230> only<00:02:17.410> able<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.980> shoot<00:02:18.190> eight<00:02:18.520> times

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
are only able to shoot eight times

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.940 
are only able to shoot eight times
before<00:02:19.090> you<00:02:19.390> need<00:02:19.600> to<00:02:19.750> reload<00:02:20.200> whereas<00:02:20.830> the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
before you need to reload whereas the

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.070 
before you need to reload whereas the
normal<00:02:21.100> piece<00:02:21.490> user<00:02:21.910> with<00:02:22.240> the<00:02:22.420> upgrade<00:02:22.780> you

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
normal piece user with the upgrade you

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.590 
normal piece user with the upgrade you
can<00:02:23.410> shoot<00:02:23.590> 12<00:02:24.010> times<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.910> reason<00:02:25.090> they<00:02:25.390> have

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
can shoot 12 times the reason they have

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.510 
can shoot 12 times the reason they have
less<00:02:25.810> bullets<00:02:26.170> is<00:02:26.350> because<00:02:26.830> of<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.160> extra

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
less bullets is because of the extra

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.920 
less bullets is because of the extra
damage<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:28.030> very<00:02:28.210> shooter<00:02:28.480> does<00:02:28.780> actually

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
damage the very shooter does actually

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.350 
damage the very shooter does actually
give<00:02:29.320> out<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:30.100> they<00:02:30.250> want<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:30.490> to<00:02:30.640> reload<00:02:31.060> more

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
give out so they want you to reload more

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.720 
give out so they want you to reload more
times<00:02:31.690> now<00:02:32.440> take<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.680> look<00:02:32.920> at<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.310> reloading

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
times now take a look at the reloading

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.090 
times now take a look at the reloading
time<00:02:34.030> in<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.750> actual<00:02:35.050> sticker<00:02:35.290> book<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:35.830> says

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
time in the actual sticker book it says

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.370 
time in the actual sticker book it says
the<00:02:36.250> reloading<00:02:36.640> time<00:02:36.760> is<00:02:37.120> medium<00:02:37.660> compared<00:02:38.290> to

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
the reloading time is medium compared to

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.620 
the reloading time is medium compared to
the<00:02:38.500> normal<00:02:38.830> piece<00:02:39.010> user<00:02:39.340> which<00:02:39.760> is<00:02:40.060> faster

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
the normal piece user which is faster

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.270 
the normal piece user which is faster
but<00:02:41.050> a<00:02:41.110> take<00:02:41.350> a<00:02:41.470> look<00:02:41.500> at<00:02:41.710> both<00:02:41.860> these<00:02:42.040> P

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
but a take a look at both these P

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.250 
but a take a look at both these P
shooters<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:42.820> the<00:02:43.180> normal<00:02:43.510> peashooter<00:02:44.050> takes

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
shooters and the normal peashooter takes

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.680 
shooters and the normal peashooter takes
1.1<00:02:44.950> seconds<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.490> reload<00:02:45.820> and<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.450> berry

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
1.1 seconds to reload and the berry

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.530 
1.1 seconds to reload and the berry
shooter<00:02:47.080> takes<00:02:47.410> 1.2<00:02:48.130> seconds<00:02:48.550> to<00:02:48.700> reload<00:02:49.060> so

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
shooter takes 1.2 seconds to reload so

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.030 
shooter takes 1.2 seconds to reload so
there<00:02:49.660> isn't<00:02:49.840> much<00:02:50.020> difference<00:02:50.590> between<00:02:50.710> the

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
there isn't much difference between the

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.190 
there isn't much difference between the
reloading<00:02:51.520> times<00:02:51.790> so<00:02:52.330> even<00:02:52.750> though<00:02:52.900> there<00:02:53.080> is

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
reloading times so even though there is

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.140 
reloading times so even though there is
less<00:02:53.350> ammo<00:02:53.620> when<00:02:53.860> it's<00:02:53.980> clip<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.640> reloading

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
less ammo when it's clip the reloading

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.390 
less ammo when it's clip the reloading
times<00:02:55.390> are<00:02:55.660> roughly<00:02:55.990> the<00:02:56.110> same<00:02:56.260> we<00:02:57.130> have<00:02:57.250> now

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
times are roughly the same we have now

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.190 
times are roughly the same we have now
taken<00:02:57.460> a<00:02:57.910> look<00:02:58.060> at<00:02:58.240> all<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.780> important

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
taken a look at all the important

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.440 
taken a look at all the important
factors<00:02:59.590> for<00:02:59.740> the<00:03:00.130> very<00:03:00.340> piece<00:03:00.610> shooter<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.180> I

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
factors for the very piece shooter and I

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.270 
factors for the very piece shooter and I
honestly<00:03:01.840> think<00:03:02.110> this<00:03:02.380> piece<00:03:02.620> shooter<00:03:02.980> will

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
honestly think this piece shooter will

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.730 
honestly think this piece shooter will
get<00:03:03.460> a<00:03:03.490> nerf<00:03:03.760> in<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.300> near<00:03:04.480> future<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:05.440> reason

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
get a nerf in the near future the reason

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.350 
get a nerf in the near future the reason
for<00:03:05.860> this<00:03:05.980> is<00:03:06.250> because<00:03:06.370> if<00:03:06.730> you<00:03:06.940> can<00:03:07.120> hit<00:03:07.210> your

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
for this is because if you can hit your

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.980 
for this is because if you can hit your
target

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
target

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.140 
target
neela<00:03:08.320> every<00:03:08.740> single<00:03:09.040> time<00:03:09.250> you<00:03:09.490> are<00:03:09.910> going<00:03:10.060> to

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150

this pea shooter is a very good piece
shooter<00:03:31.120> and<00:03:31.300> probably<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:31.990> most<00:03:32.170> powerful
