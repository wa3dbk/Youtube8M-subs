00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
have Samsung or HTC you probably have

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.660

those<00:03:25.440> weather<00:03:25.770> widget<00:03:26.070> with<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.310> clock<00:03:26.490> in

those weather widget with the clock in

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.400 
those weather widget with the clock in
them<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:27.720> don't<00:03:27.840> have<00:03:27.960> the<00:03:28.110> ability<00:03:28.350> to

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
them you don't have the ability to

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.350 
them you don't have the ability to
customize<00:03:28.590> them<00:03:28.980> that<00:03:29.160> much<00:03:29.340> as<00:03:29.790> far<00:03:30.090> as<00:03:30.210> the

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
customize them that much as far as the

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.940 
customize them that much as far as the
stock<00:03:30.570> Android<00:03:30.870> device<00:03:31.170> you<00:03:31.200> probably<00:03:31.560> have

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
stock Android device you probably have

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.350 
stock Android device you probably have
just<00:03:32.160> a<00:03:32.250> clock<00:03:32.460> and<00:03:32.670> then<00:03:32.730> you're<00:03:33.030> able<00:03:33.150> to

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
just a clock and then you're able to

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.580 
just a clock and then you're able to
basically<00:03:33.570> add<00:03:33.900> that<00:03:34.050> to<00:03:34.200> your<00:03:34.230> home<00:03:34.440> screen

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
basically add that to your home screen

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.950 
basically add that to your home screen
so<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.940> way<00:03:36.060> it's<00:03:36.300> a<00:03:36.390> very<00:03:36.570> nice<00:03:36.750> application

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
so the way it's a very nice application

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.810 
so the way it's a very nice application
from<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.620> sense<00:03:37.830> of<00:03:37.980> just<00:03:38.160> aesthetics<00:03:38.610> as

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
from the sense of just aesthetics as

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.520 
from the sense of just aesthetics as
well<00:03:39.000> as<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.210> ability<00:03:39.330> to<00:03:39.570> customize<00:03:39.990> the

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
well as the ability to customize the

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.500 
well as the ability to customize the
locker<00:03:40.770> application<00:03:41.460> is<00:03:41.580> I<00:03:41.730> think<00:03:41.790> shines<00:03:42.270> out

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
locker application is I think shines out

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.180 
locker application is I think shines out
of<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.750> -<00:03:42.930> in<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.560> sense<00:03:43.770> that<00:03:43.860> you're<00:03:44.070> able

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
of the - in the sense that you're able

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.190 
of the - in the sense that you're able
to<00:03:44.370> have<00:03:44.550> so<00:03:44.790> many<00:03:44.880> more<00:03:45.180> options<00:03:45.420> outside<00:03:46.080> of

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
to have so many more options outside of

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.440 
to have so many more options outside of
just<00:03:46.350> your<00:03:46.500> standard<00:03:46.950> lockscreen<00:03:47.430> now<00:03:48.090> this
