come that we're going to convert our
flex<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.820> application<00:00:15.509> into<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.929> flex<00:00:16.470> 3

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
flex to application into a flex 3

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.700 
flex to application into a flex 3
application<00:00:17.820> flex<00:00:18.779> 3<00:00:19.020> was<00:00:19.170> released<00:00:19.560> on

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
application flex 3 was released on

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.300 
application flex 3 was released on
Monday<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.390> we're<00:00:21.390> very<00:00:21.630> excited<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:22.320> move

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
Monday and we're very excited to move

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.750 
Monday and we're very excited to move
this<00:00:23.580> application<00:00:24.240> on<00:00:25.310> now<00:00:26.310> let<00:00:26.460> me<00:00:26.519> just<00:00:26.640> say

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
this application on now let me just say

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.000 
this application on now let me just say
a<00:00:26.789> few<00:00:26.849> things<00:00:27.210> for<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.260> most<00:00:28.410> part<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.949> would

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
a few things for the most part I would

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.220 
a few things for the most part I would
say<00:00:29.279> 90%<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.910> applications<00:00:30.510> are<00:00:30.660> very<00:00:30.689> easily

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
say 90% of applications are very easily

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.010 
say 90% of applications are very easily
transported<00:00:32.160> from<00:00:32.309> flex<00:00:32.700> 2<00:00:32.940> into<00:00:33.390> flex<00:00:33.660> 3

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
transported from flex 2 into flex 3

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.470 
transported from flex 2 into flex 3
though<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:34.980> have<00:00:35.190> had<00:00:35.430> some<00:00:35.820> applications<00:00:36.360> I've

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
though I have had some applications I've

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.850 
though I have had some applications I've
worked<00:00:36.690> with<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.140> it's<00:00:37.320> become<00:00:37.680> very

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
worked with that it's become very

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.619 
worked with that it's become very
difficult<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.610> there's<00:00:38.850> some<00:00:39.000> reprogramming

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
difficult and there's some reprogramming

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.049 
difficult and there's some reprogramming
that<00:00:39.719> has<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.170> occur<00:00:40.460> we<00:00:41.460> won't<00:00:41.670> find<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:41.969> in

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
that has to occur we won't find that in

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.150 
that has to occur we won't find that in
this<00:00:42.300> case<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.230> let's<00:00:43.440> go<00:00:43.559> ahead<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.860> do

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
this case and so let's go ahead and do

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.889 
this case and so let's go ahead and do
that<00:00:44.190> now<00:00:44.969> it's<00:00:45.149> really<00:00:45.300> great<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.780> way<00:00:45.870> you

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
that now it's really great the way you

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.139 
that now it's really great the way you
can<00:00:46.110> work<00:00:46.230> between<00:00:46.379> flex<00:00:46.980> as<00:00:47.550> far<00:00:47.820> as<00:00:47.940> cutting

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
can work between flex as far as cutting

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.880 
can work between flex as far as cutting
and<00:00:48.390> pasting<00:00:48.600> we're<00:00:48.989> gonna<00:00:49.110> bring<00:00:49.289> up<00:00:49.410> flex<00:00:49.680> 2

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
and pasting we're gonna bring up flex 2

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.740 
and pasting we're gonna bring up flex 2
right<00:00:50.129> here<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.610> actually<00:00:51.090> just<00:00:51.210> cut<00:00:51.539> and

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
right here and actually just cut and

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.590 
right here and actually just cut and
paste<00:00:52.050> our<00:00:52.579> iMix<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.820> application<00:00:54.360> into

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
paste our iMix in the application into

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.110 
paste our iMix in the application into
flex<00:00:55.289> 3<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:55.890> first<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.250> all<00:00:56.309> let's<00:00:56.550> create<00:00:56.940> our

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
flex 3 so first of all let's create our

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.049 
flex 3 so first of all let's create our
flex<00:00:57.780> 3<00:00:58.399> over-the-rhine<00:00:59.399> project<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.000> I'm

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
flex 3 over-the-rhine project so I'm

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.070 
flex 3 over-the-rhine project so I'm
gonna<00:01:00.329> right<00:01:00.510> click<00:01:00.539> new<00:01:01.520> flex<00:01:02.520> project<00:01:03.080> I'm

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
gonna right click new flex project I'm

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.450 
gonna right click new flex project I'm
gonna<00:01:04.229> type<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.710> over-the-rhine<00:01:05.780> and<00:01:07.460> hit

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
gonna type in over-the-rhine and hit

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.310 
gonna type in over-the-rhine and hit
finish<00:01:11.090> if<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.150> notice<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.689> flex<00:01:12.930> 3<00:01:13.170> we<00:01:13.290> also

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
finish if you notice in flex 3 we also

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.710 
finish if you notice in flex 3 we also
have<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.210> ability<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.240> create<00:01:15.420> an<00:01:15.600> air

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
have the ability to create an air

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.810 
have the ability to create an air
application<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.500> we'll<00:01:16.650> have<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> tutorial<00:01:17.580> on

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
application and we'll have a tutorial on

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.749 
application and we'll have a tutorial on
that<00:01:17.880> later<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.600> our<00:01:18.750> series<00:01:19.430> so<00:01:20.430> here's<00:01:20.610> my

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
that later on in our series so here's my

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.820 
that later on in our series so here's my
override<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.750> immediately<00:01:22.530> you're<00:01:22.650> going<00:01:22.740> to

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
override and immediately you're going to

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.260 
override and immediately you're going to
notice<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.220> difference<00:01:23.520> between<00:01:23.580> flex<00:01:24.090> 2

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
notice is the difference between flex 2

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.350 
notice is the difference between flex 2
and<00:01:24.390> flex<00:01:24.570> 3<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.500> see<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.770> SRC<00:01:26.759> folder<00:01:29.360> and

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
and flex 3 you see this SRC folder and

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.539 
and flex 3 you see this SRC folder and
our<00:01:30.600> application<00:01:31.200> actually<00:01:31.380> lives<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:31.920> an<00:01:32.159> SRC

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
our application actually lives in an SRC

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.210 
our application actually lives in an SRC
folder<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.390> we<00:01:33.540> create<00:01:33.869> image<00:01:34.590> folders<00:01:35.070> or

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
folder and we create image folders or

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.679 
folder and we create image folders or
asset<00:01:35.549> folders<00:01:35.880> we<00:01:36.000> want<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.270> put<00:01:36.420> them<00:01:36.570> in

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
asset folders we want to put them in

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.530 
asset folders we want to put them in
that<00:01:36.720> SRC<00:01:37.409> or<00:01:37.560> source<00:01:37.829> folder<00:01:38.310> okay<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.299> let's

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
that SRC or source folder okay so let's

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.590 
that SRC or source folder okay so let's
move<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:39.780> from<00:01:39.810> here<00:01:41.119> and<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.240> we<00:01:42.329> do<00:01:42.450> have

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
move on from here and so we do have

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.789 
move on from here and so we do have
basically<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.530> know<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.979> typical<00:01:44.189> Flex

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
basically you know the typical Flex

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.469 
basically you know the typical Flex
blank<00:01:46.799> application<00:01:47.549> let's<00:01:48.090> bring<00:01:48.240> up<00:01:48.360> our

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
blank application let's bring up our

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.840 
blank application let's bring up our
flex<00:01:48.720> 2<00:01:48.869> project<00:01:50.090> we<00:01:51.090> are<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.329> flex<00:01:51.600> 2<00:01:51.840> now<00:01:52.020> and
