00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.379
 to decorate what we decorate of course 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.019
 with the papers that I told them and the 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:09.999
 we will go 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:13.539
 and decorating with different compositions 

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:17.020
 For example, I'm going to take the 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:20.619
 measure and what I do is take it look 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:24.969
 so without measuring we will go taking the 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:27.610
 limit and pressing me there I already have the 

00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:30.129
 measure that I will need for the sheet 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.349
 of the lapel and then I'm going to go 

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:34.239
 forming different combinations that 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.940
 you what's important when you put together a 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:40.060
 Design with cuts is that they dare 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.880
 that they cut that they go thinking that they go 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.650
 mounting different scenes so that 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.140
 then before you paste it you know 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.030
 more or less how do they have to make a 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.420
 time they did that what we're going to 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.460
 use is a cut template or 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.800
 well a cutter a scissor what you 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.110
 have important that is well linear 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.510
 so that they have very 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.989
 couples that you can use 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.850
 also different ways to cut 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.000
 this is the beauty of these 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.189
 cutting sheets or cutting scissors 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.210
 in this case it has a termination 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.670
 circle 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.520
 and can be incorporating different with 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.909
 different cuts that are going to have many 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:26.439
 completions then what they do 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:30.240
 there is to take the cardboard and paste it 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:32.380
 course with a vinyl adhesive they go to 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.210
 open it 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:39.060
 go placing all over the surface as 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:45.530
 we always do 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:51.010
 and then they're going to go very well 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:53.900
 we let it dry and then here they have 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.640
 two decorated surfaces I tell you that 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.190
 in this case for the recipes this 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:02.630
 stamping comes in handy because it's like 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:05.060
 those typical tablecloths to decorate the 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.899
 table then what do we do for later 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:12.240
 place the chips with the recipes we're going 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.780
 to stick on this surface 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.780
 there 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.010
 let's paste 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.250
 and we will match where we 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.800
 pierce masters before decorating let's 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.680
 make the holes in the cartons and 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.090
 after we paste the image 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.160
 we will also do it so that 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.920
 let's have the piercing to pass 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:41.200
 the hooks so then what we do is 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.450
 place ribbons place details to go 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.330
 decorating look in this case have 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.250
 different accessories to decorate this 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.560
 is one that puts cellophane here 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.170
 to look like a candy and then 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.800
 We are going to use ribbons and wool too 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.440
 to decorate everything that are the hooks 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:04.990
 how are we going to do with the wool we are going to 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:08.050
 screw it to one side and to another there 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:11.320
 and then we let go and they see they are doing 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:15.010
 a few stretches of wool for you 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:18.010
 can go decorating as we decorate 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.370
 look, I'm going to show you here 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:24.010
 I have the finished many accessories 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.100
 when we do everything that is the 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:31.450
 scrapbooking-style albums what 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.160
 we do is place letters put all 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.750
 those that are stickers in reliefs that 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.510
 you know what they can do you can 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:41.260
 stamp the inscription and they can place 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.870
 two layers of paper and place it on the 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.820
 inside tape abi face then they give 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.040
 volume saw as French art that 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.210
 two papers were generated with volume of 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.940
 the same way 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.850
 here they see how are the tapes have the 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.310
 wool a lot of color for these hooks 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.830
 now I have the recipe of much prized 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.070
 of course I'm going to keep it here in the 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.960
 lapel here we put another one here have 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:10.070
 this candy as I taught them to do 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:12.200
 with cellophane and we're going through 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.060
 the different pages 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.710
 look here I have a blank recipe 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.560
 I still did not write anything so I 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.660
 could pass one to go scoring and what 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.130
 what I like about making these albums is 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.410
 that we can have many but many 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.110
 different applications look here 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:33.340
 I'm going to show how we're going to put a 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:36.400
 to go decorating yes and more pages yes and 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.500
 of course what is important the 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.390
 back cover also look how pretty with 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.490
 all that are the moles and the 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.590
 quadricep to decorate with this image 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.380
 that fascinates me that it is the final image 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.930
 What do you think if I tell you the 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:55.100
 list of materials to make them 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:58.699
 cantons of 20 x 25 and one millimeter and 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:03.130
 medium thickness from 18 x 25 and 1 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:05.740
 millimeters printed papers stickers 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:09.190
 smooth quadri 6 ribbons 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:13.560
 vinyl tail cÃºtar 3 behaves before 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.560
 the folder hooks and the tabs 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.790
 I'm ready with a pen in my hand 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.820
 because I'm going to write another recipe in a 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:24.820
 poster and they know what recipe can not 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.860
 missing a recipe in my favorite album 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.380
 of choly berreteaga of course they are 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.540
 which I always do at home and you 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.790
 girls who recipe never after missing 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.530
 in this something obvious that the recipes of 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.050
 shock will never be missing in our 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.360
 album so good is a typical is a 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.190
 white of all the squares are in 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.140
 all the houses sometimes described 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:49.060
 matched and sometimes like what is another 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:52.030
 idea that is no longer needed is cloth 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:55.200
 surely cloth when we join the 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.200
 cells we can achieve 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.490
 we can have the bedroom of the 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.110
 guys or also when the guys 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.710
 bring their toys and there are always some 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.240
 let's say some speakers against clothes 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.500
 and a little pile for the boys of 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.730
 support in the head 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.320
 but none of us because the 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:20.650
 great so much that we know where to support 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:22.750
 the head when I'm driving to 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.180
 I can long the rest is comfortable and 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.250
