00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
super clever um so one thing's a couple

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.939 
super clever um so one thing's a couple
things<00:03:00.989> I<00:03:01.079> really<00:03:01.290> liked<00:03:01.439> about<00:03:01.530> this<00:03:01.739> it's

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:01.949 
things I really liked about this it's

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.879 
things I really liked about this it's
not<00:03:02.129> anything<00:03:02.699> overly<00:03:03.500> drastic<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:04.560> like<00:03:04.739> the

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
not anything overly drastic I like the

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.309 
not anything overly drastic I like the
fact<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.189> they<00:03:05.760> did<00:03:05.939> the<00:03:06.449> main<00:03:06.750> silhouette

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
fact that they did the main silhouette

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.259 
fact that they did the main silhouette
on<00:03:07.409> the<00:03:07.469> back<00:03:07.650> is<00:03:07.919> white<00:03:08.219> I<00:03:08.459> thought<00:03:08.939> that<00:03:09.000> made

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
on the back is white I thought that made

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.330 
on the back is white I thought that made
it<00:03:09.389> really<00:03:09.419> easy<00:03:09.689> because<00:03:10.199> she<00:03:10.590> added<00:03:10.829> accents

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
it really easy because she added accents

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
you can't see really well but the

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.740 
you can't see really well but the
visible<00:03:22.409> zoom<00:03:22.560> air<00:03:22.769> is<00:03:22.949> blue<00:03:23.430> as<00:03:23.549> well<00:03:23.579> so<00:03:24.269> the

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
visible zoom air is blue as well so the

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.149 
visible zoom air is blue as well so the
combination<00:03:25.019> of<00:03:25.379> those<00:03:25.500> two<00:03:25.560> being<00:03:25.979> blue

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
combination of those two being blue

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.939 
combination of those two being blue
worked<00:03:26.970> really<00:03:27.329> well<00:03:27.449> in<00:03:27.720> my<00:03:27.840> opinion<00:03:27.959> you

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:28.949 
worked really well in my opinion you

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:30.409 
worked really well in my opinion you
could<00:03:29.069> see<00:03:29.189> the<00:03:29.340> blue<00:03:29.489> speckles<00:03:29.939> on<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.269> the

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
could see the blue speckles on the the

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:31.999 
could see the blue speckles on the the
midsole<00:03:30.750> here<00:03:31.049> as<00:03:31.199> well<00:03:31.439> and<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:31.769> thought<00:03:31.949> that

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:32.009 
midsole here as well and I thought that

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:34.699 
midsole here as well and I thought that
was<00:03:32.280> awesome<00:03:33.290> obviously<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.379> pink<00:03:34.560> for<00:03:34.680> the

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
was awesome obviously the pink for the

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.319 
was awesome obviously the pink for the
bubble<00:03:34.979> gum<00:03:35.099> and<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.370> know<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.549> inside<00:03:36.060> liner

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
bubble gum and you know the inside liner

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.270 
bubble gum and you know the inside liner
for<00:03:36.810> pink<00:03:37.049> and<00:03:37.650> I<00:03:37.680> thought<00:03:37.829> it<00:03:37.949> was<00:03:38.040> a<00:03:38.069> great

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
for pink and I thought it was a great

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.499 
for pink and I thought it was a great
combination<00:03:38.519> between<00:03:38.879> the<00:03:39.060> pink<00:03:39.269> in<00:03:39.419> the

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:39.509 
combination between the pink in the

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:42.679 
combination between the pink in the
inside<00:03:39.750> liar<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.560> swoosh<00:03:40.859> and<00:03:41.389> the<00:03:42.389> midsole

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:42.689 
inside liar the swoosh and the midsole

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:46.309 
inside liar the swoosh and the midsole
as<00:03:42.900> pink<00:03:43.579> and<00:03:44.579> then<00:03:45.389> I<00:03:45.599> like<00:03:45.810> how<00:03:45.959> instead<00:03:46.229> of

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
as pink and then I like how instead of

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.640 
as pink and then I like how instead of
putting<00:03:46.530> you<00:03:46.680> know<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.979> this<00:03:47.579> tongue<00:03:48.569> area<00:03:49.379> as

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
putting you know the this tongue area as

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.469 
putting you know the this tongue area as
pink<00:03:50.129> or<00:03:50.400> blue<00:03:50.609> or<00:03:50.639> whatever<00:03:50.970> she<00:03:51.030> did<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.359> is

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:51.479 
pink or blue or whatever she did it is

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:53.420 
pink or blue or whatever she did it is
yellow<00:03:51.810> obviously<00:03:52.290> is<00:03:52.409> the<00:03:52.530> yellow<00:03:52.650> is<00:03:52.769> part

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
yellow obviously is the yellow is part

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.449 
yellow obviously is the yellow is part
of<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.549> main<00:03:53.939> color<00:03:54.509> of<00:03:54.689> the<00:03:54.810> wrapper<00:03:55.470> did<00:03:56.430> a

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
of the main color of the wrapper did a

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:57.800 
of the main color of the wrapper did a
little<00:03:56.609> action<00:03:56.909> a<00:03:57.000> yellow<00:03:57.239> around<00:03:57.479> the<00:03:57.540> swoosh

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
little action a yellow around the swoosh

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.339 
little action a yellow around the swoosh
and<00:03:58.189> did<00:03:59.189> the<00:03:59.280> soul<00:03:59.879> in<00:04:00.120> yellow<00:04:00.389> as<00:04:00.540> well<00:04:00.689> again

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
and did the soul in yellow as well again

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.499 
and did the soul in yellow as well again
I<00:04:01.379> thought<00:04:01.620> that<00:04:01.739> was<00:04:01.829> a<00:04:01.889> clever<00:04:02.509> construction

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:03.509 
I thought that was a clever construction

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:05.990 
I thought that was a clever construction
all<00:04:03.959> in<00:04:04.139> all<00:04:04.259> the<00:04:04.439> these<00:04:05.189> to<00:04:05.370> me<00:04:05.489> I<00:04:05.519> mean<00:04:05.759> I<00:04:05.819> I

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
all in all the these to me I mean I I

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.729 
all in all the these to me I mean I I
feel<00:04:06.599> like<00:04:06.719> these<00:04:06.900> could<00:04:07.049> actually<00:04:07.199> release<00:04:07.590> I

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
feel like these could actually release I

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.469 
feel like these could actually release I
think<00:04:07.919> that<00:04:08.009> would<00:04:08.069> be<00:04:08.129> rad<00:04:08.370> boy<00:04:08.939> or<00:04:09.180> girl<00:04:09.209> I

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:09.479 
think that would be rad boy or girl I

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:12.520 
think that would be rad boy or girl I
mean<00:04:09.629> I<00:04:09.780> thought<00:04:10.079> they<00:04:10.199> were<00:04:10.289> boys<00:04:10.500> shoes<00:04:11.099> when

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
mean I thought they were boys shoes when

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.499 
mean I thought they were boys shoes when
when<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.620> winner<00:04:13.799> was<00:04:13.949> selected<00:04:14.519> and<00:04:14.669> and<00:04:14.849> it

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:15.509 
when the winner was selected and and it

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:17.629 
when the winner was selected and and it
makes<00:04:15.659> sense<00:04:15.780> it<00:04:15.989> as<00:04:16.109> a<00:04:16.139> girl<00:04:16.380> she<00:04:16.590> also<00:04:16.799> or<00:04:17.370> not

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
makes sense it as a girl she also or not

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.939 
makes sense it as a girl she also or not
now<00:04:17.820> but<00:04:18.120> I<00:04:18.329> mean<00:04:18.599> I<00:04:18.989> think<00:04:19.380> that<00:04:19.769> obviously

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
now but I mean I think that obviously

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:22.820 
now but I mean I think that obviously
like<00:04:20.909> a<00:04:20.940> lot<00:04:21.120> of<00:04:21.209> dudes<00:04:21.329> can<00:04:22.169> rock<00:04:22.349> pink<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:22.800> I

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
like a lot of dudes can rock pink and I

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.200 
like a lot of dudes can rock pink and I
feel<00:04:23.010> I<00:04:23.190> would<00:04:23.250> feel<00:04:23.460> comfortable<00:04:23.610> rocketing

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
feel I would feel comfortable rocketing

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.909 
feel I would feel comfortable rocketing
is<00:04:24.270> I<00:04:24.330> think<00:04:24.389> the<00:04:24.539> dope<00:04:24.770> just<00:04:25.770> a<00:04:25.830> little

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
know it looks cool regardless and you

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.939 
know it looks cool regardless and you
can<00:06:06.360> see<00:06:06.659> their<00:06:06.810> number<00:06:07.080> is<00:06:07.110> 30<00:06:07.530> right<00:06:07.770> here

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:07.949 
can see their number is 30 right here

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:10.159 
can see their number is 30 right here
and<00:06:08.150> it's<00:06:09.150> settled<00:06:09.449> the<00:06:09.630> only<00:06:09.810> thing<00:06:09.930> i<00:06:09.990> think

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
and it's settled the only thing i think

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.930 
and it's settled the only thing i think
i<00:06:10.259> might<00:06:10.440> look<00:06:10.830> at<00:06:11.009> maybe<00:06:11.219> changing<00:06:11.669> about<00:06:11.849> the

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
i might look at maybe changing about the

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.060 
i might look at maybe changing about the
shoe<00:06:12.120> personally<00:06:13.080> is<00:06:13.229> because<00:06:13.800> there's<00:06:13.949> not

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
shoe personally is because there's not

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.870 
shoe personally is because there's not
very<00:06:14.130> much<00:06:14.550> black<00:06:14.880> on<00:06:15.180> the<00:06:15.210> tissue<00:06:16.880> or

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
very much black on the tissue or

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.430 
very much black on the tissue or
wondering<00:06:18.240> what<00:06:18.360> what<00:06:18.750> her<00:06:18.840> reason<00:06:19.110> was<00:06:19.289> but

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
wondering what what her reason was but

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.290 
wondering what what her reason was but
it<00:06:19.530> was<00:06:19.620> the<00:06:19.800> black<00:06:20.009> on<00:06:20.250> the<00:06:20.280> the<00:06:20.849> 30<00:06:21.060> number

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
it was the black on the the 30 number

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.870 
it was the black on the the 30 number
and<00:06:21.419> then<00:06:21.509> on<00:06:21.719> the<00:06:21.900> eyelids<00:06:22.680> here<00:06:22.919> and<00:06:23.789> I

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
and then on the eyelids here and I

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.430 
and then on the eyelids here and I
thought<00:06:24.060> maybe<00:06:24.270> those<00:06:24.509> these<00:06:24.900> islets<00:06:25.259> could

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
thought maybe those these islets could

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.670 
thought maybe those these islets could
