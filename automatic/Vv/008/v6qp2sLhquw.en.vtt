00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 and what's up everybody talks to them mark mex 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.429
 and good guys, as it already comes 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.920
 announcing them for several weeks 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.380
 was going to bring good today these days 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.230
 let's say a couple of pretty little things 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.439
 good and good then the first time 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.779
 it was clear that it was the scoop control of 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.460
 scoop gaming with the levers and everything 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.849
 back but I told them that I was also going 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.279
 to bring something else to improve enough 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.800
 gaming especially in hitler games 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.890
 or also in racing games like 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.870
 need for speed etcetera and well it is 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.390
 just this what has come to me today 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.590
 just and good let's see them to see 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.710
 waths up 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.780
 unfortunately this shipment firecrackers 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.390
 good usually takes from 3 to 5 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.850
 weeks and good in my case it takes me three 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.010
 weeks but let's say it's a lousy 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.540
 service and the trace let's say you do not 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.430
 is behind but good and finally it arrived 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.680
 here and good is something that they also have 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.980
 to consider so to see guys what 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.980
 it is this 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.630
 let's see what else is in the bag 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:14.329
 the guarantee 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.799
 and good the bill so let's leave 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:19.610
 this aside that no longer has here 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:22.159
 too much and good guys because this is 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.450
 call control fix and good in my case 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:29.149
 I bought a game called gamer 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:32.240
 control freaks being true it's called 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.920
 gamer pack with being freak and good either 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.079
 in their weird names that put them in 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.079
 the gringos but good and some guys 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.750
 what is it for, let's say 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:45.500
 first to remove this that the most 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.850
 important this part to see this continue 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.990
 A) Yes 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.990
 and let's get it out 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.980
 good guys how can you see is a 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.870
 little ball here and see this for 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.970
 what the hell does not work is not that cochinaditas 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.040
 what do you bring there brand next good guys 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.530
 well this turns out to be put here 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.570
 we have the command and this is put to 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.119
 this part of the control 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.849
 it has been chosen well 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.860
 so that we should pretty much fix 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.489
 well fixed and good guys this for what 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.120
 it serves 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:21.220
 I'll ask you what you put him 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.530
 an extension there is next good mark 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.630
 guys, you do not have to fix this well 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.840
 that seems to have fixed us here 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.090
 watch 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.900
 coins I learned the control 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.900
 to see and see 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.760
 well everything is missing fix it a little more 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.099
 but, well, let's say that for what 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.390
 I need is fine so well I made a 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.980
 little bit of boy but it's basically 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:50.890
 because I have not fixed it well and it shows already 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.000
 sergio or well with guys this what you 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.860
 help is for 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.940
 move with a much greater agility this 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.710
 small good this is the joystick and 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.990
 good that's what it's for, if you're 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.700
 sniper with this let's say that being 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.160
 us humans and have this finger more 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.900
 shorter than others because there's good 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.570
 explanation of Darwin's theory and 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.060
 all good to be us humans 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:20.209
 obviously we have this smaller finger 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.400
 and it costs us more work to move this 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.680
 part of him I say that this joystick 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.110
 that in specific and good this what 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.239
 allows us to aim if they play games 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.989
 of shooter what will allow them is 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:35.030
 point a lot easier I've heard more 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.980
 well and read comments that this 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.950
 It even makes you play a lot 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.530
 much better and obviously you upload 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:46.730
 your ratio of casualties and deaths to kill 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:50.480
 the trade and so on but this because 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.640
 and it's basically for you to write a lot 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.980
 better with greater precision equally 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.409
 if you are sniper, this is spectacular 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.170
 and good guys how can you see in this 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:02.629
 part comes another little thing that 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.790
 let's take it out right now and good 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:09.060
 this because I bought it kid knowing 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:13.879
 but over here these gentlemen are put in 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.879
 the other joystick we are going to put it here 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.590
 to see 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.479
 to see good a little 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.900
 this is basically for games of 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.520
 careers like need for speed 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.570
 and it can even serve you a lot in grand 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.490
 theft auto 'I really bought it 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.920
 because he thought I'm buying the 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.840
 grand theft auto so the guys do not 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.520
 it's a question here to fix it with more 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.770
 calm but let's say that what helps you 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.730
 is to put your finger here and move it a lot 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:47.460
 easier or with greater precision 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:49.890
 with let's say more subtlety and at the same 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.190
 precision time so good the one that I 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.590
 I bought called is the gamer pack of 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.270
 feet break and by guys then I'll leave 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.220
 all the links in the description them 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.820
 I recommend you buy this gamer pack 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.740
 that comes the little things you're together with 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.110
 those of the east 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.590
 joystick and good this what allows us 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.830
 is whether you're playing games of 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.500
 shooter or you play racing games 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.419
 with this gamer pack, let's say that the 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.370
 most complete combination because there 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.440
 some who just sell you this and 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.030
 others that nothing sell this but 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.950
 let's say the parquet gamer when 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.780
 come these together so let's say that 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.220
 that's why I chose it I tell you guys 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.860
 in the description I will leave you 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.180
 where I bought the model that I bought and 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.090
 good is nothing more than something that has to 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:39.520
 Consider is the shipping that is good 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.830
 pretty bad they send it through 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.979
 to see so I do not lie to you I 'm feet 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:48.159
 firm classes international male 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:50.229
 with the lunar states postal service that 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:53.879
 elaborate is a crap it does not compare 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:56.530
 with fedex or with any other with a ps 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:58.599
 It takes 3 to 5 weeks and I tell them a 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.580
 Normal shipping of this weight can you 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:01.810
 take much less than a week this does not 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.560
 it's something that they have to consider and 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.069
 Boys 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.659
 Well, I hope you liked it and 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:09.759
 if you would like some other blond from 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:11.379
 anything else so alone 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:13.599
 say it in the comments has written 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:18.930
