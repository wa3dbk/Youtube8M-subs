sure<00:04:22.280> it<00:04:23.280> says<00:04:23.550> it's<00:04:24.000> actually<00:04:24.450> oh<00:04:24.750> no<00:04:25.380> yeah

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
sure it says it's actually oh no yeah

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.850 
sure it says it's actually oh no yeah
yeah<00:04:26.100> I<00:04:26.130> don't<00:04:26.280> know<00:04:26.520> so<00:04:27.360> um<00:04:27.720> if<00:04:28.290> you<00:04:28.440> guys<00:04:28.590> want

yeah I don't know so um if you guys want

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.150 
yeah I don't know so um if you guys want
a<00:04:28.919> science<00:04:29.310> lesson<00:04:29.520> I<00:04:29.910> could<00:04:30.419> explain<00:04:31.160> what

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
a science lesson I could explain what

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.520 
a science lesson I could explain what
happens<00:04:32.520> in<00:04:32.669> it<00:04:32.790> that<00:04:33.240> looks<00:04:33.389> like<00:04:33.570> you<00:04:33.780> yeah

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
happens in it that looks like you yeah

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.740 
happens in it that looks like you yeah
that'll<00:04:34.800> take<00:04:34.950> you<00:04:35.100> on<00:04:35.280> so<00:04:35.520> but<00:04:35.880> if<00:04:36.419> you<00:04:36.630> guys

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
that'll take you on so but if you guys

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.770 
that'll take you on so but if you guys
do<00:04:37.200> want<00:04:37.440> it<00:04:37.620> I<00:04:37.800> can<00:04:38.250> put<00:04:38.520> it<00:04:38.639> on<00:04:38.790> another<00:04:39.570> video

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
do want it I can put it on another video

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.020 
do want it I can put it on another video
up<00:04:40.340> so<00:04:41.690> that<00:04:42.690> was<00:04:42.870> it<00:04:43.050> and<00:04:43.260> guess<00:04:43.919> what<00:04:44.040> nerve

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
up so that was it and guess what nerve

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.740 
up so that was it and guess what nerve
vs.<00:04:45.810> exploders<00:04:46.380> I<00:04:46.620> think<00:04:47.090> splutters<00:04:48.090> one<00:04:48.300> yeah

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
vs. exploders I think splutters one yeah

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.020 
vs. exploders I think splutters one yeah
I<00:04:48.780> think<00:04:48.900> next<00:04:49.470> shot<00:04:49.740> in<00:04:49.919> a<00:04:49.980> headshot<00:04:50.490> look<00:04:50.940> at

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
I think next shot in a headshot look at

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.560 
I think next shot in a headshot look at
that<00:04:51.180> accuracy<00:04:51.600> suppose<00:04:52.560> one<00:04:52.800> definitely

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
that accuracy suppose one definitely

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.460 
that accuracy suppose one definitely
Spitfire<00:04:54.570> bids<00:04:54.810> out<00:04:55.460> out
