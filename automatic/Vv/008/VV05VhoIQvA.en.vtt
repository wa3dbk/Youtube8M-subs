00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.869
 or the one that has everyone welcome to the 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.049
 second part in the guide for all 

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:15.600
 booklets left obstacles in the video 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.359
 past we found the first 11 like this 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.300
 that here we are left with the number 12 and 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.970
 13 that are in this area is 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.250
 in the square of 2 as you can appreciate 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.260
 the altar that is seen there in front we are going to 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.190
 go for a lizard but before going 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.810
 for her 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.690
 let's go a little to the left 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.109
 here you will find in this dark bit 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.909
 there is a hidden lizard and a 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:41.280
 which I forgot to mention in the video 

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:43.319
 past is that if the lizard does not 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.719
 kill only let's say when you 

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:49.019
 they shoot the arrow and its tail is cut off 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.879
 do not go eat it the tail until 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.559
 the lizard is dead until it 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.929
 realize that the lizard is dead 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.329
 because the trophy that's what it says 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:59.940
 that you do kill the lizards so 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.069
 to get the trophy you have to 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.170
 kill the lizards so be sure 

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:05.970
 that remain dead here is the altar 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.960
 that I mentioned to them for the lizard 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.950
 number 13 on this graph is found 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.229
 in the back 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.390
 as you can appreciate here a way 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.280
 easy to kill them because in the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.960
 past video I mentioned to them that sometimes 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.909
 those found on the altars are 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.890
 difficult to kill is to arrive and 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.079
 find them right where the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.970
 Lizard appears without letting them 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:30.720
 move and run around and get lost 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.259
 good we passed the lizard number 14 and 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.990
 15 since this altar is another of those that 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.789
 has two lizards on it in this one that 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.810
 I'm showing at this time that it 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:46.590
 located in square 3 in 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.560
 the east map is one of the ones that contains 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.619
 two lizards on it so remember 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.599
 after eating the lizard this 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.630
 is here I 'm going to show you have to 

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:59.340
 get away a little nothing I know a little bit of 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.890
 jump away a little on the map 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.299
 come back again so they find the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.700
 lizard number 15 since then in this 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.220
 altar is going to be 14 and 15 let's go to the 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.700
 number 16 that is located in 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.100
 square 4 this is on another altar that 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.260
 is here as in a small 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.860
 one level above the map so it's 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.190
 very easy to see this altar of the 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.280
 lizard number 16 easy easy to 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.780
 find you simply have to go by 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.780
 her and eat you 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:49.250
 in the same square is the lizard 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.920
 number 17 is on the 4th of that is found 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.980
 a little further down the altar we grab the 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.560
 earlier this is right on this stone 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.070
 that you see that it comes up and by 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:06.020
 Manu easy to find also to 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:08.030
 lizard number 17 the number 18 is 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:12.170
 located a little below the same 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.730
 square is 4 on the bottom 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.209
 as you can see here this is 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.890
 in a green grass that is around here in 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.530
 the area right now I give them a turn 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.660
 around with the camera so they can see 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.560
 more or less where it is but 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.120
 there is an area with a lot of green 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.959
 a lot of green grass that can be appreciated 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.570
 here 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.060
 that's where they found the lizard 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.610
 walking through that green area to the number 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.520
 19 is a bit more towards the 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.910
 right of the map is in the square 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:47.180
 number 4 also if I'm not wrong between 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.489
 4 and 5 in that those over there is the 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.310
 stone that we came to where I was pointing 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.019
 over there we 'll go to number 20 this 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.510
 we will not go back a little more 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:04:00.260
 the left of the map is in the square 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:03.230
 of 4 and it is as you can see here I am 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.730
 in the fruit trees 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.700
 you have to go up here 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.769
 you go up this mountain that is here and 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.680
 there you can appreciate the lizard 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:15.290
 I do not know if you can see it yet but there it is 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.810
 look at her that is here above 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.299
 where they will need the area is with the 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:25.370
 fruit trees that you climb through this but 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:28.040
 look here is a perfect one exam one 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.200
 perfect sample of what happens when 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.639
 I tell them that if you shoot them with the bow 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.499
 on the arrow 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.900
 lizard did not die but you are already 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:38.360
 started the tail you have to make sure 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.120
 that the lizard dies that the lizard 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.699
 is dead to get the trophy 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.349
 to find all the lizards before 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.360
 that you eat your tail because if you 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:49.909
 they eat the cola the reappears the 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.949
 good lizard we went to number 21 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:54.319
 which is located to the side 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:57.169
 left of four and so good 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:59.509
 this is also around here in about 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:02.150
 trees as you can appreciate I put this 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:04.520
 more or less tree to serve them 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.259
 of guide and it's right in front of me them 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.930
 the graph I do not know if they could see it 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:12.050
 but that's where they end up walking around 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:15.770
 this area is lizard and well 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:18.229
 an app is not that hard to find 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.990
 but it was not easy either because it cost me 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:24.259
 I a little bit of work if not if not bad 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:27.500
 I remember you will find that lizard the 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:29.900
 number 22 is a little more up in 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.260
 the map a little more to the left and 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.960
 good 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:37.050
 this is on another altar as they can 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:40.380
 appreciate here is located is already 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.870
 the letter to c4 also up to the part of 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.520
 up and well then that's here in the 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.070
 altar there he brought me with a bit of 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.590
 careful to try not to scare the 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:53.220
 because if your backs do 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:55.980
 run and it's already very difficult for those who 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.990
 find them later so 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:03.080
 well there is this lizard this was 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.080
 the lizard number 22 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.500
 and we return many thanks for watching this 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:11.000
 second part I wait for you in the third 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.000
 have a happy day
