00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.060 
what depends what forks running on one
in<00:00:36.989> district<00:00:37.290> fortune<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.770> spaces<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.570> spaces

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
in district fortune in spaces so spaces

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.160 
in district fortune in spaces so spaces
axle<00:00:41.070> peg<00:00:42.290> and<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.770> same<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.250> back<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:44.760> I

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
axle peg and the same on the back so I

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.350 
axle peg and the same on the back so I
got<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.230> smaller<00:00:46.530> back<00:00:46.829> peg<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.340> yeah<00:00:47.969> just<00:00:48.270> an

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
got a smaller back peg and yeah just an

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.840 
got a smaller back peg and yeah just an
axle<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.440> pretty<00:00:50.100> much<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.489> do<00:00:50.610> what<00:00:50.730> you

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
axle so pretty much you do what you

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.459 
axle so pretty much you do what you
normally<00:00:51.030> do<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.629> take<00:00:51.809> off<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> wheel<00:00:52.260> just

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
normally do to take off a wheel just

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.380 
normally do to take off a wheel just
unloosen<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.280> axle<00:00:53.640> taking<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.030> wheel<00:00:54.180> out

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
unloosen the axle taking the wheel out

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.650 
unloosen the axle taking the wheel out
spaces<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.199> etc<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.210> it's<00:00:57.210> pretty<00:00:57.390> much<00:00:57.510> just

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
spaces and etc so it's pretty much just

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.069 
spaces and etc so it's pretty much just
the<00:00:57.840> same<00:00:58.079> principle<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:58.829> what<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.489> do<00:01:00.079> you

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
the same principle but what you do you

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.670 
the same principle but what you do you
get<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> axle<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.239> then<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.359> just<00:01:03.570> put<00:01:04.530> it

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
get the axle and then you just put it

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.280 
get the axle and then you just put it
through<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.369> peg<00:01:05.549> right<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:07.080> it's<00:01:07.229> just

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
through the peg right so it's just

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.149 
through the peg right so it's just
sitting<00:01:07.619> like<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:08.240> you<00:01:09.240> get<00:01:09.390> your<00:01:10.640> fork<00:01:13.159> make

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
sitting like this you get your fork make

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.499 
sitting like this you get your fork make
sure<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.460> put<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> side<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.240> grind

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
sure you put it on the side you grind

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.120 
sure you put it on the side you grind
with<00:01:15.720> otherwise<00:01:16.080> there'll<00:01:16.439> be<00:01:16.470> no<00:01:16.710> point<00:01:16.979> in

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
with otherwise there'll be no point in

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.410 
with otherwise there'll be no point in
