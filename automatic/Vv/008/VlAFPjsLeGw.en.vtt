where<00:04:43.880> you<00:04:43.940> could<00:04:44.150> kind<00:04:44.300> of<00:04:44.420> set<00:04:44.600> the<00:04:44.720> weapons

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
where you could kind of set the weapons

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.380 
where you could kind of set the weapons
in<00:04:45.260> there<00:04:45.470> in<00:04:45.560> a<00:04:45.650> certain<00:04:45.920> way<00:04:46.040> in<00:04:46.850> fact<00:04:47.090> I<00:04:47.210> kind

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
in there in a certain way in fact I kind

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.750 
in there in a certain way in fact I kind
of<00:04:47.510> remember<00:04:47.930> it<00:04:47.960> being<00:04:48.260> like<00:04:48.830> maybe<00:04:49.610> a<00:04:49.700> little

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
of remember it being like maybe a little

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.690 
of remember it being like maybe a little
bit<00:04:50.030> there<00:04:50.900> being<00:04:51.110> nervous

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
bit there being nervous

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.420 
bit there being nervous
here<00:04:52.000> in<00:04:52.060> the<00:04:52.180> shell<00:04:52.530> a<00:04:53.530> little<00:04:53.620> bit<00:04:54.190> more

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
here in the shell a little bit more

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.760 
here in the shell a little bit more
overall<00:04:54.850> space<00:04:55.300> and<00:04:55.900> you<00:04:56.140> basically<00:04:56.500> just

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
overall space and you basically just

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.190 
overall space and you basically just
threw<00:04:57.160> the<00:04:57.310> weapons<00:04:57.610> in<00:04:57.790> there<00:04:57.960> again<00:04:58.960> I<00:04:58.990> could

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
threw the weapons in there again I could

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.360 
threw the weapons in there again I could
be<00:04:59.290> wrong<00:04:59.440> but<00:04:59.500> that's<00:04:59.680> kind<00:04:59.980> of<00:05:00.070> the<00:05:00.130> way<00:05:00.280> I'm

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
be wrong but that's kind of the way I'm

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.000 
be wrong but that's kind of the way I'm
remembering<00:05:00.910> it<00:05:01.290> maybe<00:05:02.290> somebody<00:05:02.710> that<00:05:02.860> knows

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
remembering it maybe somebody that knows

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.250 
remembering it maybe somebody that knows
for<00:05:03.220> sure<00:05:03.250> can<00:05:03.550> leave<00:05:03.760> me<00:05:03.850> a<00:05:03.880> comment<00:05:04.260> it's

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
for sure can leave me a comment it's

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.750 
for sure can leave me a comment it's
been<00:05:05.410> a<00:05:05.440> long<00:05:05.650> time<00:05:05.830> so<00:05:06.840> but<00:05:07.840> anyhow<00:05:08.580> you<00:05:09.580> can

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
been a long time so but anyhow you can

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.510 
been a long time so but anyhow you can
kind<00:05:09.940> of<00:05:10.000> make<00:05:10.150> out<00:05:10.330> there<00:05:10.660> in<00:05:10.750> the<00:05:10.840> show<00:05:11.050> the

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
kind of make out there in the show the

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.980 
kind of make out there in the show the
the<00:05:12.520> pattern<00:05:12.910> for<00:05:13.090> the<00:05:13.180> shirtkin<00:05:13.480> it's<00:05:13.780> kind

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
the pattern for the shirtkin it's kind

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.710 
the pattern for the shirtkin it's kind
of<00:05:14.080> a<00:05:14.410> star<00:05:14.920> shape<00:05:15.390> right<00:05:16.390> there<00:05:16.420> what<00:05:16.690> you

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
of a star shape right there what you

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.660 
of a star shape right there what you
want<00:05:16.930> to<00:05:17.020> do<00:05:17.170> is<00:05:17.500> make<00:05:17.830> sure<00:05:17.860> you<00:05:18.070> put<00:05:18.280> in<00:05:18.370> there

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 
want to do is make sure you put in there

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.310 
want to do is make sure you put in there
just<00:05:19.570> like<00:05:19.720> that<00:05:21.330> because<00:05:22.330> if<00:05:22.540> you<00:05:22.630> don't<00:05:22.840> the

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
just like that because if you don't the

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.360 
just like that because if you don't the
shell<00:05:23.530> actually<00:05:23.830> won't<00:05:23.950> close<00:05:25.890> there<00:05:26.890> you<00:05:27.040> go

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
shell actually won't close there you go

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.330 
shell actually won't close there you go
and<00:05:27.730> then<00:05:27.910> the<00:05:28.120> half<00:05:28.300> sigh<00:05:28.690> this<00:05:29.650> one<00:05:29.860> goes<00:05:30.070> in

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
and then the half sigh this one goes in

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.620 
and then the half sigh this one goes in
first

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:41.160 

just<00:05:34.630> like<00:05:37.020> my<00:05:38.020> brush<00:05:38.230> Aikens<00:05:38.650> is<00:05:38.830> falling<00:05:40.170> you

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.170 
just like my brush Aikens is falling you

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.530 
just like my brush Aikens is falling you
put<00:05:41.350> it<00:05:41.470> in<00:05:41.560> like<00:05:41.710> that<00:05:41.740> and<00:05:42.580> just<00:05:43.470> push<00:05:44.470> it<00:05:44.680> in

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.540 
put it in like that and just push it in

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.300 
put it in like that and just push it in
and<00:05:46.540> then<00:05:46.810> follow<00:05:47.230> it<00:05:47.410> up<00:05:47.530> with<00:05:47.560> the<00:05:47.770> other<00:05:48.100> one

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
and then follow it up with the other one

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.160 
and then follow it up with the other one
I<00:05:48.520> have<00:05:49.090> found<00:05:49.330> this<00:05:49.450> is<00:05:49.600> the<00:05:49.720> only<00:05:49.870> pattern

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.170 
I have found this is the only pattern

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:51.450 
I have found this is the only pattern
that<00:05:50.500> works<00:05:50.680> and<00:05:50.860> that's<00:05:50.950> actually<00:05:51.130> the<00:05:51.370> way

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
that works and that's actually the way

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.630 
that works and that's actually the way
they<00:05:51.670> came<00:05:51.820> in<00:05:52.000> the<00:05:52.090> packaging<00:05:52.570> I<00:05:53.490> tried<00:05:54.490> it

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
they came in the packaging I tried it

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.130 
they came in the packaging I tried it
where<00:05:54.850> the<00:05:54.970> other<00:05:55.090> side<00:05:55.330> was<00:05:55.570> like<00:05:55.600> that<00:05:55.930> but<00:05:56.110> I

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
where the other side was like that but I

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
where the other side was like that but I
couldn't<00:05:56.410> get<00:05:56.500> the<00:05:56.590> shell<00:05:56.740> out<00:05:56.800> of<00:05:56.860> clothes<00:05:57.160> so

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
couldn't get the shell out of clothes so

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.440 
couldn't get the shell out of clothes so
snap<00:06:00.160> it<00:06:00.310> in<00:06:00.400> place<00:06:00.430> and<00:06:00.640> it<00:06:01.180> closes<00:06:01.390> very<00:06:02.110> easy

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 
snap it in place and it closes very easy

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:08.690 
snap it in place and it closes very easy
cool<00:06:05.220> and<00:06:06.220> of<00:06:06.700> course<00:06:06.940> Raphael<00:06:07.600> has<00:06:07.930> his

Turtle from the Nickelodeon planets line
and<00:06:26.470> then<00:06:27.130> this<00:06:27.310> is<00:06:27.490> the<00:06:27.760> current<00:06:28.450> version

with the battle shell all things

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.010 
with the battle shell all things
considered<00:06:33.700> I<00:06:33.880> prefer<00:06:34.240> the<00:06:34.390> original<00:06:34.480> one

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.020 
considered I prefer the original one

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.370 
considered I prefer the original one
only<00:06:35.680> because<00:06:36.010> it<00:06:36.310> doesn't<00:06:36.910> look<00:06:37.150> like<00:06:37.570> it's

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.380 
only because it doesn't look like it's

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.240 
only because it doesn't look like it's
strictly<00:06:39.100> from<00:06:39.220> the<00:06:39.280> show<00:06:39.580> and<00:06:40.980> you<00:06:41.980> know<00:06:42.010> the

strictly from the show and you know the
show<00:06:42.400> itself<00:06:42.790> I<00:06:43.060> don't<00:06:43.240> watch<00:06:43.420> it

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
show itself I don't watch it

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.880 
show itself I don't watch it
I<00:06:44.020> only<00:06:44.830> bought<00:06:45.070> the<00:06:46.320> the<00:06:47.320> turtle<00:06:47.620> figures

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:47.890 
I only bought the the turtle figures

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.970
