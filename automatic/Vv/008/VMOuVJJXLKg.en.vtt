00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.860
 at peugeot we do not overdo it 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.730
 lion builder launched since 2012 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:19.720
 the 108 the 208 the 2008 the 308 the 308 sw 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.430
 the 4008 she also removed the rcz the 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.320
 3008 on May 5th and it's now at 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.920
 turn of the 508 to be entitled to his 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.600
 makeup 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.920
 what does the top of 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.390
 peugeot brand range this is what 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.770
 we came to discover in london 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.059
 for his official presentation the 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.260
 trend in recent years no longer fits 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:36.400
 towards the form sedans let's say 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.710
 classic but rather towards the 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.450
 MPVs and other suv does not prevent 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.310
 the 508 2 seconds and even sells rather 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.600
 well since rinck last year she 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.610
 has passed 22 thousand copies 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.560
 that is to say more than citroën c5 and 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.030
 the renault laguna met this day the 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.670
 pampered so and offers him today 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.350
 a mid-career restyling for 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.210
 him a blown the new identity of 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.579
 the brand that was still at its 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.930
 Peugeot infancy in 2011 and there is 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.420
 not the strengths of the student mark in 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.860
 first fires that are 100% help 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.390
 and who with now this little 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.719
 notch that now sting of 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.420
 peugeot 

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:09.070
 below we have the flashing shaped 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.930
 of boomerang and all this makes it does not 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.659
 let's finish bright particular close 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.930
 but the jewel of fact of this restyling 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:21.130
 it is without a doubt the calender that 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.549
 now integrates the Peugeot lion into his 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.290
 center 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.360
 that we now place at the back not 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.619
 worth talking about which side is left 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.930
 overall identical 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.320
 by cons there are things to say about this 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.320
 level there 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.990
 the aifa the effort the taillights that have 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.310
 now three soul claws a part 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.110
 a little clearer the lower part 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.390
 bumper and also restyled one can 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.480
 really say that the sedan was 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.250
 deeply redesigned and it's not a 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.660
 little restyling actually there is 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.730
 obviously not that the sedan that was 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.450
 restyled there is also the break and the 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.960
 h personalities 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.960
 follow me 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.980
 here we have the list that share 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.720
 obviously the headlights and the grille 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.440
 but which keeps its specificity 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.820
 say daytime running lights on three columns 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.340
 rxh that means it's the version 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.570
 black does not bring back and maybe there is little 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.990
 day broke down inspiration 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.790
 since the flowers esteem m 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.830
 updates is also under 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.330
 the hood with engines well 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.400
 upset then if we had to remember 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.940
 three engines on the gasoline side 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.400
 we have the 1.6 thp 155 horses stop and 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.280

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.950
