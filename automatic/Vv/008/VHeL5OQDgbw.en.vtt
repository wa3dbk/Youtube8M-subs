this<00:00:01.949> is<00:00:02.100> a<00:00:02.540> robotic<00:00:03.540> arm<00:00:03.890> operated<00:00:04.890> by

00:00:05.499 --> 00:00:05.509 
this is a robotic arm operated by

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.180 
this is a robotic arm operated by
Mitsubishi<00:00:06.509> PLC<00:00:08.750> there<00:00:09.750> is<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:09.990> Mitsubishi<00:00:10.349> PLC

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
Mitsubishi PLC there is a Mitsubishi PLC

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.050 
Mitsubishi PLC there is a Mitsubishi PLC
you<00:00:12.030> can<00:00:12.240> see<00:00:12.509> here<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.590> this<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.429> driver<00:00:15.470> for

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
you can see here and this is driver for

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:26.029 
you can see here and this is driver for
robotic<00:00:18.060> arm

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.350 

stop<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.849> clock

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.800 

our<00:00:29.900> Bakugan<00:00:30.910> start<00:00:32.080> going<00:00:33.080> to<00:00:34.810> nesting

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:35.810 
our Bakugan start going to nesting

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.360 
our Bakugan start going to nesting
position<00:00:37.330> it<00:00:38.330> after<00:00:39.110> it<00:00:39.200> find<00:00:39.530> nesting

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
position it after it find nesting

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.580 
position it after it find nesting
position<00:00:41.559> it<00:00:42.559> will<00:00:42.970> turn<00:00:43.970> back<00:00:44.440> to<00:00:45.440> the

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
position it will turn back to the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.229 
position it will turn back to the
composition<00:00:47.080> which<00:00:48.080> is<00:00:49.150> position<00:00:50.150> rates

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
composition which is position rates

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.619 
composition which is position rates
normally<00:00:53.260> well<00:00:54.260> start<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:54.739> process<00:00:55.309> so<00:00:56.090> after

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
normally well start the process so after

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.960 
normally well start the process so after
it<00:00:56.720> going<00:00:57.050> to<00:00:57.230> the<00:00:57.350> home<00:00:57.530> position<00:00:57.820> it<00:00:58.820> will

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
it going to the home position it will

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.149 
it going to the home position it will
send<00:00:59.269> a<00:00:59.390> signal<00:00:59.570> to<00:00:59.809> plc<00:01:00.610> that<00:01:01.780> arm<00:01:02.780> is<00:01:03.379> ready

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
send a signal to plc that arm is ready

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:11.990 
send a signal to plc that arm is ready
for<00:01:04.909> operating<00:01:06.760> so<00:01:07.760> now<00:01:07.940> we<00:01:08.000> have

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.460 

metal<00:01:12.780> kilt<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:14.250> put<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.700> loading<00:01:15.060> station

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
metal kilt to put on a loading station

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.930 
metal kilt to put on a loading station
is<00:01:16.470> detected<00:01:17.160> by<00:01:17.240> proximity<00:01:18.240> sensor<00:01:18.960> and

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
is detected by proximity sensor and

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.810 
is detected by proximity sensor and
moving<00:01:20.940> down<00:01:21.660> the<00:01:22.050> conveyor<00:01:22.440> line<00:01:25.729> after<00:01:26.729> it

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
moving down the conveyor line after it

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:34.280 
moving down the conveyor line after it
reach<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:28.130> eye<00:01:29.130> sensor<00:01:31.340> it<00:01:32.340> will<00:01:32.400> tell<00:01:33.290> Robert

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
reach the eye sensor it will tell Robert

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.840 
reach the eye sensor it will tell Robert
to<00:01:34.560> go<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:34.979> pick<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.520> up<00:01:38.420> start<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:40.640> picked<00:01:41.640> up

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
to go to pick it up start it picked up

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.850 
to go to pick it up start it picked up
by<00:01:42.030> robot<00:01:43.100> it<00:01:44.100> will<00:01:44.340> go<00:01:44.550> to<00:01:45.860> unloading

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
by robot it will go to unloading

00:01:46.860 --> 00:02:07.770 
by robot it will go to unloading
position

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.730 

at<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.350> same<00:02:08.649> time<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:10.810> is<00:02:11.040> plastics<00:02:12.040> clocks

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
at the same time this is plastics clocks

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.360 
at the same time this is plastics clocks
and<00:02:14.740> it's<00:02:15.550> come<00:02:15.850> to<00:02:16.350> unloading<00:02:17.350> station<00:02:18.100> for

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
and it's come to unloading station for

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.190 
and it's come to unloading station for
the<00:02:18.490> plastic<00:02:18.940> it<00:02:20.550> grabbed<00:02:21.550> by<00:02:21.910> a<00:02:22.240> robotic<00:02:22.870> arm

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
the plastic it grabbed by a robotic arm

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.960 
the plastic it grabbed by a robotic arm
and<00:02:23.760> Gaston<00:02:24.930> unloading<00:02:25.930> station<00:02:26.850> for<00:02:27.850> the

and Gaston unloading station for the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.800 
and Gaston unloading station for the
plastic

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.420
