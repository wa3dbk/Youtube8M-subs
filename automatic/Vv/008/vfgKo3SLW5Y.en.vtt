exposing<00:03:48.790> themselves<00:03:49.120> I<00:03:49.569> think<00:03:49.870> that's<00:03:50.049> a

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
exposing themselves I think that's a

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.039 
exposing themselves I think that's a
great<00:03:50.349> start<00:03:50.650> for<00:03:51.030> for<00:03:52.030> all<00:03:52.269> types<00:03:52.540> of<00:03:52.690> medical
