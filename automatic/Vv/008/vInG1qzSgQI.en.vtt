that<00:00:14.509> all<00:00:15.509> these<00:00:15.929> little<00:00:16.139> screws<00:00:16.410> actually<00:00:16.890> do

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
that all these little screws actually do

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.910 
that all these little screws actually do
play<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.250> purpose<00:00:17.760> but<00:00:18.359> these<00:00:18.630> like<00:00:19.439> six<00:00:19.830> of

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
play a purpose but these like six of

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.880 
play a purpose but these like six of
these<00:00:20.039> springs<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.869> mean<00:00:22.380> like<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.680> can't

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
these springs that I mean like you can't

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.220 
these springs that I mean like you can't
put<00:00:23.100> them<00:00:23.220> all<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.689> don't<00:00:24.869> have<00:00:24.990> enough

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
put them all in so I don't have enough

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.540 
put them all in so I don't have enough
so<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.650> don't<00:00:25.830> know<00:00:25.980> what<00:00:26.189> those<00:00:26.340> are<00:00:26.490> for

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
so I don't know what those are for

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.950 
so I don't know what those are for
exactly<00:00:27.240> but<00:00:27.420> we're<00:00:27.539> not<00:00:27.630> gonna<00:00:27.750> be<00:00:27.840> using

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
exactly but we're not gonna be using

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.919 
exactly but we're not gonna be using
them<00:00:28.279> side<00:00:29.279> note<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.670> do<00:00:29.970> have<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.449> like

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
them side note you do have this like

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.020 
them side note you do have this like
horseshoe<00:00:31.500> thing<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:32.480> will<00:00:33.480> actually<00:00:33.719> just

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
horseshoe thing that will actually just

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.479 
horseshoe thing that will actually just
pop<00:00:36.030> off<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.739> center<00:00:37.739> caps<00:00:37.920> which<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.190> pretty

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
pop off the center caps which is pretty

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.410 
pop off the center caps which is pretty
cool<00:00:38.670> um<00:00:40.190> so<00:00:41.190> yeah<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.790> should<00:00:41.940> have<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.239> those

cool um so yeah you should have to those
anyway<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.739> start<00:00:44.040> assembling<00:00:44.730> your<00:00:44.789> edge

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
anyway to start assembling your edge

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.779 
anyway to start assembling your edge
fully<00:00:45.750> auto<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:46.770> not<00:00:46.980> liberating<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.610> key

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
fully auto just not liberating the key

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.850 
fully auto just not liberating the key
look<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.120> did<00:00:48.360> but<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.870> already<00:00:49.050> did<00:00:49.289> tenant<00:00:49.739> now

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
look I did but I already did tenant now

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.650 
look I did but I already did tenant now
you're<00:00:50.520> going<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.879> pull<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.329> piece

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
you're going to have to pull this piece

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.170 
you're going to have to pull this piece
apart<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.440> grab<00:00:52.890> inside<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.370> hollow<00:00:53.520> part<00:00:53.910> and

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
apart so grab inside the hollow part and

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.930 
apart so grab inside the hollow part and
just<00:00:54.440> pop<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.649> half<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.039> amnelis<00:00:56.550> came<00:00:56.820> in

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
just pop it in half I amnelis came in

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.000 
just pop it in half I amnelis came in
half<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.079> put<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.410> sticker<00:00:58.710> half

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
half so I just put the sticker half

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.410 
half so I just put the sticker half
aside<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.760> just<00:01:00.690> put<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.230> lubricated<00:01:01.920> part

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
aside and just put the lubricated part

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.299 
aside and just put the lubricated part
somewhere<00:01:03.530> and<00:01:04.530> now<00:01:04.680> we're<00:01:04.979> going<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.129> grab

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
somewhere and now we're going to grab

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.320 
somewhere and now we're going to grab
one<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.489> these<00:01:05.700> little<00:01:07.340> like<00:01:08.340> arrow<00:01:08.640> pieces

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
one of these little like arrow pieces

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.870 
one of these little like arrow pieces
i'll<00:01:09.510> call<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.930> then<00:01:10.680> actually<00:01:11.340> fills<00:01:11.729> up<00:01:11.850> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
i'll call it then actually fills up the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.289 
i'll call it then actually fills up the
edge<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.420> which<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.520> do<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:15.000> there's

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
edge and which you can do is there's

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.999 
edge and which you can do is there's
actually<00:01:15.420> two<00:01:15.780> slots<00:01:16.170> for<00:01:16.380> screws<00:01:16.799> there's

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
actually two slots for screws there's

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.460 
actually two slots for screws there's
one<00:01:17.189> there<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.759> there's<00:01:18.420> one<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:19.080> can't<00:01:19.320> see

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
one there and there's one you can't see

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.260 
one there and there's one you can't see
the<00:01:19.740> light<00:01:19.920> but<00:01:20.130> there's<00:01:20.280> one<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:21.409> in<00:01:22.409> there

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
the light but there's one and in there

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.870 
the light but there's one and in there
so<00:01:24.270> if<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.590> want<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.979> maximum<00:01:26.460> weight<00:01:26.670> on

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
so if you want the maximum weight on

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.789 
so if you want the maximum weight on
your<00:01:27.299> cube<00:01:27.570> like<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.900> would<00:01:28.140> you're<00:01:28.409> adding

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
your cube like I would you're adding

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.160 
your cube like I would you're adding
both<00:01:28.950> screws<00:01:29.340> if<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.820> want<00:01:30.030> only<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.990> better

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
both screws if you want only the better

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.510 
both screws if you want only the better
edge<00:01:31.409> performance<00:01:31.650> if<00:01:32.100> you'd<00:01:32.250> like<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
edge performance if you'd like the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.240 
edge performance if you'd like the
lightweight<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.030> can<00:01:33.060> only<00:01:33.240> add<00:01:33.509> one<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.860> if

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
lightweight you can only add one so if

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.830 
lightweight you can only add one so if
you<00:01:35.400> want<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.610> maximum<00:01:36.030> weight<00:01:36.240> go<00:01:36.479> ahead<00:01:36.689> and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
you want the maximum weight go ahead and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.330 
you want the maximum weight go ahead and
get<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.049> screw<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.579> drop<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.850> right<00:01:39.950> back<00:01:40.950> in

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
get a screw and drop it right back in

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.210 
get a screw and drop it right back in
there

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.890 

and<00:01:45.760> then<00:01:46.330> what<00:01:46.720> you're<00:01:46.870> going<00:01:46.990> to<00:01:47.050> do<00:01:48.900> let's

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
and then what you're going to do let's

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.020 
and then what you're going to do let's
just<00:01:50.110> screw<00:01:50.530> it<00:01:50.680> in<00:01:50.860> and<00:01:53.820> you're<00:01:54.820> going<00:01:54.970> to

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
just screw it in and you're going to

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.460 
just screw it in and you're going to
stop<00:01:55.330> screwing<00:01:55.870> because<00:01:56.050> you<00:01:56.110> want<00:01:56.320> to<00:01:56.350> break

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
stop screwing because you want to break

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.500 
stop screwing because you want to break
the<00:01:56.590> plastic<00:01:56.740> my<00:01:57.130> screen<00:01:57.490> too<00:01:57.640> tightly<00:01:57.880> you're

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
the plastic my screen too tightly you're

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.110 
the plastic my screen too tightly you're
going<00:01:58.570> to<00:01:58.780> stop<00:01:59.110> like<00:01:59.680> screw<00:02:00.250> it<00:02:00.280> lightly<00:02:00.610> and

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
going to stop like screw it lightly and

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.220 
going to stop like screw it lightly and
the<00:02:01.450> second<00:02:02.050> that<00:02:02.410> you<00:02:02.560> start<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:03.070> like<00:02:04.230> feel

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
the second that you start to like feel

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.870 
the second that you start to like feel
okay<00:02:05.650> like<00:02:05.830> right<00:02:05.980> there<00:02:06.160> it<00:02:06.400> stopped<00:02:06.610> turning

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
okay like right there it stopped turning

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.400 
okay like right there it stopped turning
with<00:02:07.060> these<00:02:07.210> so<00:02:07.480> I'm<00:02:07.540> gonna<00:02:07.660> stop<00:02:07.960> right<00:02:08.170> there

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
with these so I'm gonna stop right there

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.260 
with these so I'm gonna stop right there
and<00:02:08.649> it's<00:02:09.310> okay<00:02:09.399> if<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.759> scooter<00:02:10.030> is<00:02:10.090> still

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
and it's okay if the scooter is still

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.820 
and it's okay if the scooter is still
showing<00:02:10.479> a<00:02:10.660> little<00:02:10.750> bit<00:02:11.020> like<00:02:11.170> that<00:02:11.410> that's

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
showing a little bit like that that's

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.230 
showing a little bit like that that's
fine<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:13.330> next<00:02:13.450> what<00:02:13.600> you're<00:02:13.750> going<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:13.930> do<00:02:14.080> is

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
fine so next what you're going to do is

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.880 
fine so next what you're going to do is
you<00:02:16.240> cease<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.690> make<00:02:16.810> little<00:02:17.080> latches<00:02:17.290> here

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
you cease to make little latches here

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.840 
you cease to make little latches here
and<00:02:18.040> here<00:02:20.700> those<00:02:21.700> are<00:02:22.240> going<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.540> connect<00:02:23.850> into

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
and here those are going to connect into

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.580 
and here those are going to connect into
this<00:02:25.780> piece<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:28.090> if<00:02:28.990> you<00:02:29.080> notice<00:02:29.230> there's<00:02:29.470> two

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
this piece so if you notice there's two

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.890 
this piece so if you notice there's two
little<00:02:29.680> slits<00:02:30.130> there<00:02:30.490> that's<00:02:31.330> where<00:02:31.600> these

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
little slits there that's where these

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.620 
little slits there that's where these
are<00:02:32.230> going<00:02:32.380> to<00:02:32.440> match<00:02:32.530> up<00:02:32.800> into<00:02:33.130> so<00:02:34.090> I<00:02:34.120> have<00:02:34.450> the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
are going to match up into so I have the

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.080 
are going to match up into so I have the
slits<00:02:34.870> on<00:02:34.990> the<00:02:35.020> bottom<00:02:35.410> remember<00:02:35.800> and<00:02:36.090> I'm

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
slits on the bottom remember and I'm

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.290 
slits on the bottom remember and I'm
gonna<00:02:37.390> line<00:02:38.260> them<00:02:38.440> up<00:02:38.560> like<00:02:38.709> this<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:40.090> just

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
gonna line them up like this so just

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.810 
gonna line them up like this so just
whoops<00:02:43.300> sorry<00:02:43.390> wrong<00:02:43.600> side<00:02:44.070> so<00:02:45.070> with<00:02:45.790> this

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
little outer edge you line them up like

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.350 
little outer edge you line them up like
that<00:02:51.250> actually<00:02:52.120> it<00:02:52.720> is<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.930> other<00:02:53.019> way<00:02:53.110> sorry

yeah so you line them up like this so

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.550 
yeah so you line them up like this so
that<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:57.850> latches<00:02:58.239> are<00:02:58.360> going<00:02:58.540> up<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.200> into

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
that the latches are going up and into

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.600 
that the latches are going up and into
them<00:03:00.300> and<00:03:01.890> then<00:03:02.890> you're<00:03:03.070> gonna<00:03:03.160> have<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.370> kind

them and then you're gonna have to kind

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.520 
them and then you're gonna have to kind
of<00:03:03.700> put<00:03:04.000> some<00:03:04.239> force<00:03:04.810> but<00:03:05.110> make<00:03:05.230> sure<00:03:05.260> they're

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
of put some force but make sure they're

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.710 
of put some force but make sure they're
actually<00:03:05.800> in<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.070> slot<00:03:06.340> until<00:03:06.610> you<00:03:07.510> hear<00:03:07.630> that

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
actually in the slot until you hear that

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.390 
actually in the slot until you hear that
little<00:03:07.870> pop<00:03:08.170> into<00:03:08.500> place<00:03:08.530> and<00:03:09.040> then<00:03:09.160> you<00:03:09.280> can

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
little pop into place and then you can

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.180 
little pop into place and then you can
see<00:03:09.989> but<00:03:10.989> that's<00:03:11.140> how<00:03:11.470> it<00:03:11.860> will<00:03:11.980> look<00:03:12.040> when

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
see but that's how it will look when

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.420 
see but that's how it will look when
it's<00:03:12.340> completely<00:03:12.850> done<00:03:13.090> next<00:03:14.340> there's<00:03:15.340> one

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
it's completely done next there's one

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.770 
it's completely done next there's one
more<00:03:15.760> hole<00:03:16.030> for<00:03:16.239> a<00:03:16.269> screw<00:03:16.980> that's<00:03:17.980> right<00:03:18.780> back

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
more hole for a screw that's right back

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.820 
more hole for a screw that's right back
in<00:03:20.880> here<00:03:21.880> through<00:03:22.239> this<00:03:22.330> opening<00:03:22.600> right<00:03:23.110> in

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
in here through this opening right in

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.490 
in here through this opening right in
that<00:03:24.010> so<00:03:24.810> you're<00:03:25.810> going<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:25.959> drop<00:03:26.260> in<00:03:26.440> the

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
that so you're going to drop in the

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.240 
that so you're going to drop in the
screw<00:03:27.269> you<00:03:28.269> need<00:03:28.959> to<00:03:29.049> do<00:03:29.140> this<00:03:29.290> regardless<00:03:29.470> if

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
screw you need to do this regardless if

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.640 
screw you need to do this regardless if
you<00:03:30.400> want<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.880> weight<00:03:31.239> or<00:03:31.450> not<00:03:31.600> at<00:03:32.320> least<00:03:32.470> if

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
you want the weight or not at least if

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.070 
you want the weight or not at least if
you<00:03:32.769> want<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.010> QD<00:03:33.370> better<00:03:33.610> and<00:03:33.880> keep<00:03:34.870> on

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
you want the QD better and keep on

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.920 
you want the QD better and keep on
screwing<00:03:35.500> it<00:03:35.860> make<00:03:36.220> sure<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:36.820> edge<00:03:37.000> little

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
screwing it make sure the edge little

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.050 
screwing it make sure the edge little
piece<00:03:38.350> is<00:03:38.650> pushed<00:03:39.070> in<00:03:39.310> so<00:03:39.549> it<00:03:39.730> doesn't<00:03:40.000> get

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
piece is pushed in so it doesn't get

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.789 
piece is pushed in so it doesn't get
unscrewed<00:03:40.769> just<00:03:41.769> keep<00:03:42.010> on<00:03:42.250> screwing<00:03:42.730> it<00:03:43.000> and

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
unscrewed just keep on screwing it and

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.280 
unscrewed just keep on screwing it and
until<00:03:44.799> you<00:03:45.549> get<00:03:45.760> that<00:03:45.970> resistance<00:03:46.690> point<00:03:47.049> that

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
until you get that resistance point that

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.920 
until you get that resistance point that
i<00:03:47.320> talked<00:03:47.620> about<00:03:47.769> you<00:03:48.540> don't<00:03:49.540> want<00:03:49.660> to<00:03:49.750> break

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
i talked about you don't want to break

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.410 
i talked about you don't want to break
the<00:03:50.110> plastics<00:03:50.590> it<00:03:50.739> is<00:03:50.890> fairly<00:03:51.400> soft<00:03:51.730> plastic

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
the plastics it is fairly soft plastic

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.920 
the plastics it is fairly soft plastic
and<00:03:53.430> my<00:03:54.430> Spears<00:03:54.790> got<00:03:54.849> stripped

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:05.819 

so<00:03:58.930> I<00:04:03.359> popped<00:04:04.359> in<00:04:04.629> a<00:04:04.659> little<00:04:04.959> bit<00:04:05.049> more<00:04:05.260> looks

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
so I popped in a little bit more looks

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.610 
so I popped in a little bit more looks
like<00:04:06.040> that<00:04:06.359> try<00:04:07.359> to<00:04:07.390> screw<00:04:07.900> it<00:04:07.989> in<00:04:08.049> one<00:04:08.409> more

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
like that try to screw it in one more

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.610 
like that try to screw it in one more
time<00:04:08.890> and<00:04:09.750> yes<00:04:10.750> locking<00:04:11.170> and<00:04:11.260> going<00:04:11.439> any

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
time and yes locking and going any

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.429 
time and yes locking and going any
further<00:04:11.859> that<00:04:12.670> should<00:04:12.849> be<00:04:12.970> a<00:04:13.000> pretty<00:04:13.209> firm<00:04:13.659> fit

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:14.439 
further that should be a pretty firm fit

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:16.590 
further that should be a pretty firm fit
and<00:04:14.650> last<00:04:15.609> these<00:04:15.909> want<00:04:16.150> to<00:04:16.209> make<00:04:16.329> sure<00:04:16.359> it's

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
and last these want to make sure it's

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.529 
and last these want to make sure it's
lined<00:04:16.989> up<00:04:17.199> evenly<00:04:17.530> and<00:04:18.100> then<00:04:18.880> you<00:04:19.269> can<00:04:19.389> go

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
lined up evenly and then you can go

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:22.610 
lined up evenly and then you can go
ahead<00:04:19.660> and<00:04:19.870> reassemble<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:21.280> edge<00:04:21.400> piece<00:04:21.729> and

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
ahead and reassemble the edge piece and

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.439 
ahead and reassemble the edge piece and
these<00:04:23.620> may<00:04:23.919> or<00:04:24.310> may<00:04:24.490> not<00:04:24.520> need<00:04:24.940> to<00:04:25.120> be<00:04:25.150> glued
