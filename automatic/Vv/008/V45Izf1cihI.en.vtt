stressed<00:03:50.920> and<00:03:51.190> very<00:03:51.400> nervous<00:03:51.880> and<00:03:52.090> and

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
stressed and very nervous and and

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.300 
stressed and very nervous and and
couldn't<00:03:52.780> couldn't<00:03:53.470> bring<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:53.800> performance

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
that I would have liked to and so I

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.990 
that I would have liked to and so I

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
think in general my game is there and I

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.960 
think in general my game is there and I
just<00:03:58.240> need<00:03:58.420> to<00:03:58.600> be<00:03:58.750> able<00:03:59.500> to<00:03:59.860> relax<00:04:00.190> and<00:04:00.610> and

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
just need to be able to relax and and

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.060 
just need to be able to relax and and
and<00:04:01.330> put<00:04:01.540> it<00:04:01.630> out<00:04:01.780> there<00:04:02.050> and<00:04:02.230> Charleston<00:04:02.710> last

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
and put it out there and Charleston last

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.890 
and put it out there and Charleston last
year<00:04:03.310> relaxed<00:04:03.850> me<00:04:04.000> and<00:04:04.120> that's<00:04:04.300> why<00:04:04.480> I<00:04:04.510> could

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
year relaxed me and that's why I could

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.960 
year relaxed me and that's why I could
play<00:04:05.110> my<00:04:05.350> best<00:04:05.560> tennis<00:04:05.950> and<00:04:06.160> so<00:04:06.280> hopefully<00:04:06.760> I

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
play my best tennis and so hopefully I

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:17.130 
play my best tennis and so hopefully I
can<00:04:07.510> I<00:04:07.540> can<00:04:07.900> merge<00:04:08.080> that<00:04:08.320> again<00:04:08.650> here<00:04:15.900> it<00:04:16.900> does

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
can I can merge that again here it does

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.440 
can I can merge that again here it does
definitely<00:04:17.410> after<00:04:18.280> all<00:04:18.459> my<00:04:18.640> injuries<00:04:18.970> and
