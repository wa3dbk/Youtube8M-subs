just said yes but the first base is

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.950 
just said yes but the first base is
great<00:01:23.070> genetics<00:01:23.250> built<00:01:24.090> on<00:01:24.270> top<00:01:24.479> then<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.900> that

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
great genetics built on top then is that

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.990 
great genetics built on top then is that
hard<00:01:25.350> work<00:01:25.530> consistency<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.340> dedication
