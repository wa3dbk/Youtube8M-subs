because<00:00:13.820> they've<00:00:13.940> got<00:00:14.059> this<00:00:14.180> new<00:00:14.290> antenna

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:15.290 
because they've got this new antenna

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.170 
because they've got this new antenna
design<00:00:15.530> that's<00:00:15.920> similar<00:00:16.160> to<00:00:16.700> the<00:00:16.880> Verizon

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
design that's similar to the Verizon

both the bottom and the top of both
sides<00:00:22.970> and<00:00:23.689> they<00:00:24.320> say<00:00:24.500> also<00:00:24.680> that<00:00:25.040> this<00:00:25.220> new

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
sides and they say also that this new

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.339 
sides and they say also that this new
system<00:00:25.790> has<00:00:26.029> got<00:00:26.300> like<00:00:26.419> a<00:00:26.450> new<00:00:26.660> dual<00:00:26.900> antenna

system has got like a new dual antenna

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.880 
system has got like a new dual antenna
type<00:00:27.590> system<00:00:29.290> so<00:00:30.290> we're<00:00:30.410> going<00:00:30.500> to<00:00:30.560> see<00:00:30.770> if

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
type system so we're going to see if

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.830 
type system so we're going to see if
that's<00:00:31.040> actually<00:00:31.399> changed<00:00:31.849> if<00:00:32.090> in<00:00:32.570> fact

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
that's actually changed if in fact

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.600 
that's actually changed if in fact
you'll<00:00:33.050> still<00:00:33.290> lose<00:00:33.500> signal<00:00:33.770> if<00:00:34.040> I'd<00:00:34.190> give<00:00:34.489> it

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
you'll still lose signal if I'd give it

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.970 
you'll still lose signal if I'd give it
the<00:00:34.730> death<00:00:34.940> grip<00:00:35.149> with<00:00:35.329> my<00:00:35.360> left<00:00:35.690> hand<00:00:35.920> so<00:00:36.920> I'm

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
the death grip with my left hand so I'm

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.250 
the death grip with my left hand so I'm
just<00:00:37.130> going<00:00:37.280> to<00:00:37.310> do<00:00:37.490> that<00:00:37.730> now<00:00:38.140> and<00:00:39.140> we'll

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
just going to do that now and we'll

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.960 
just going to do that now and we'll
watch<00:00:39.500> and<00:00:39.740> see<00:00:39.920> if<00:00:40.070> the<00:00:40.250> signals<00:00:40.730> going<00:00:40.910> to

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
watch and see if the signals going to

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.420 
watch and see if the signals going to
drop<00:00:41.090> and<00:00:41.240> I<00:00:41.300> do<00:00:41.560> every<00:00:42.560> now<00:00:42.650> and<00:00:42.800> then<00:00:42.890> I<00:00:42.950> do

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
drop and I do every now and then I do

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.220 
drop and I do every now and then I do
kind<00:00:43.910> of<00:00:43.970> go<00:00:44.120> between<00:00:44.300> three<00:00:44.660> and<00:00:44.690> four<00:00:44.960> bars

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
kind of go between three and four bars

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.100 
kind of go between three and four bars
generally<00:00:45.880> where<00:00:46.880> I<00:00:46.910> am<00:00:47.270> so<00:00:47.630> I<00:00:47.660> wouldn't<00:00:48.020> be

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
generally where I am so I wouldn't be

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.720 
generally where I am so I wouldn't be
too<00:00:48.260> concerned<00:00:48.440> about<00:00:48.830> that<00:00:49.190> first<00:00:49.460> one

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
too concerned about that first one

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.310 
too concerned about that first one
dropping<00:00:52.420> I'm<00:00:53.420> just<00:00:53.570> going<00:00:53.690> to<00:00:53.720> watch<00:00:53.930> and<00:00:54.140> see

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
dropping I'm just going to watch and see

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.180 
dropping I'm just going to watch and see
for<00:00:54.530> a<00:00:54.590> few<00:00:54.770> minutes

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
for a few minutes

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.800 
for a few minutes
wrong<00:00:55.580> maybe<00:00:55.730> not<00:00:55.940> a<00:00:55.970> few<00:00:56.240> minutes<00:00:56.570> but<00:00:56.780> just

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
wrong maybe not a few minutes but just

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.380 
wrong maybe not a few minutes but just
for<00:00:57.079> a<00:00:57.140> little<00:00:57.260> while<00:00:57.470> to<00:00:57.650> see<00:00:58.060> if<00:00:59.060> I'm<00:00:59.270> going

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
for a little while to see if I'm going

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:07.600 
for a little while to see if I'm going
to<00:00:59.510> lose<00:00:59.690> any<00:00:59.900> more<00:01:06.189> there's<00:01:07.189> not<00:01:07.340> a<00:01:07.369> lot<00:01:07.579> of

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
to lose any more there's not a lot of

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.399 
to lose any more there's not a lot of
movement<00:01:07.880> there<00:01:08.119> so<00:01:08.509> it<00:01:08.630> is<00:01:08.720> kind<00:01:08.990> of<00:01:09.079> it's

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
movement there so it is kind of it's

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:18.850 
movement there so it is kind of it's
kind<00:01:09.619> of<00:01:09.649> staying<00:01:09.920> stable<00:01:10.600> around<00:01:11.600> three<00:01:11.990> bars

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.100 

it's<00:01:19.520> even<00:01:19.790> just<00:01:19.820> increased<00:01:20.480> back<00:01:20.690> to<00:01:20.870> four

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
it's even just increased back to four

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.860 
it's even just increased back to four
again<00:01:21.440> so<00:01:21.970> not<00:01:22.970> worried<00:01:23.300> at<00:01:23.390> all<00:01:23.540> about<00:01:23.600> that

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
again so not worried at all about that

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.630 
again so not worried at all about that
antenna<00:01:24.260> it<00:01:24.470> looks<00:01:24.650> like<00:01:24.830> that<00:01:24.950> problems<00:01:25.430> been

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
antenna it looks like that problems been

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.970 
antenna it looks like that problems been
fixed

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 
fixed

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.490 
fixed
just<00:01:27.980> compare<00:01:28.340> that<00:01:28.460> to<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.730> iPhone<00:01:29.120> 4<00:01:29.540> you

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
just compare that to the iPhone 4 you

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.500 
just compare that to the iPhone 4 you
can<00:01:30.560> see<00:01:30.770> it<00:01:31.220> is<00:01:31.370> the<00:01:31.550> iPhone<00:01:31.820> 4<00:01:32.030> it<00:01:32.120> hasn't<00:01:32.420> got

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
can see it is the iPhone 4 it hasn't got

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.870 
can see it is the iPhone 4 it hasn't got
the<00:01:32.540> break<00:01:32.870> at<00:01:33.050> the<00:01:33.140> top<00:01:33.290> it's<00:01:33.560> got<00:01:33.680> it<00:01:33.860> on<00:01:34.580> that

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
the break at the top it's got it on that

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.570 
the break at the top it's got it on that
side<00:01:35.210> near<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.600> headset<00:01:36.200> jack<00:01:36.410> if<00:01:37.250> I<00:01:37.370> give

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
side near the headset jack if I give

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.910 
side near the headset jack if I give
that<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:37.880> same<00:01:38.120> treatment<00:01:41.410> we<00:01:42.410> should<00:01:42.680> see

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
that the same treatment we should see

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.220 
that the same treatment we should see
that<00:01:42.950> it<00:01:43.190> drops<00:01:43.540> sometimes<00:01:44.540> takes<00:01:44.960> a<00:01:45.080> little

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
that it drops sometimes takes a little

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.260 
that it drops sometimes takes a little
while<00:01:45.470> to<00:01:45.530> get<00:01:45.740> going<00:01:46.070> but<00:01:46.940> it<00:01:47.030> does

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
while to get going but it does

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.600 
while to get going but it does
eventually<00:01:47.570> drop<00:01:48.080> I<00:01:48.350> have<00:01:49.070> done<00:01:49.250> this<00:01:49.340> test

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
eventually drop I have done this test

00:01:49.610 --> 00:02:04.300 
eventually drop I have done this test
previously

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:12.040 

okay<00:02:05.090> drop<00:02:05.510> down<00:02:05.720> to<00:02:05.900> two

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.170 

but<00:02:12.920> when<00:02:13.070> I<00:02:13.100> was<00:02:13.250> testing<00:02:13.640> it's<00:02:13.790> just<00:02:14.000> now<00:02:14.150> I

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
but when I was testing it's just now I

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.530 
but when I was testing it's just now I
lost<00:02:14.450> 3G<00:02:15.050> entirely<00:02:15.470> that<00:02:16.460> 3G<00:02:16.910> logo<00:02:17.240> didn't

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
lost 3G entirely that 3G logo didn't

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.410 
lost 3G entirely that 3G logo didn't
even<00:02:17.630> show<00:02:17.960> up<00:02:17.990> so<00:02:18.940> it's<00:02:19.940> definitely

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
even show up so it's definitely

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.370 
even show up so it's definitely
affecting<00:02:20.990> this<00:02:21.170> phone<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:23.870> I<00:02:23.960> let<00:02:24.110> go

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
affecting this phone and I let go

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.770 
affecting this phone and I let go
notice<00:02:25.340> that<00:02:25.460> the<00:02:25.580> bars<00:02:25.790> go<00:02:26.000> back<00:02:26.180> up<00:02:26.330> again

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
notice that the bars go back up again
