00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 over x 8 w has been a great drone a 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.049
 drone that we liked a lot in the 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.269
 channel except that little thing that I call 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.940
 we have said before that problem with the 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.009
 fpv I had but good except the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.250
 I am without using that option because this is 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.380
 ima x8 w is wonderful is personally 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.400
 I loved it and what today we are going to 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.160
 analyze is this command of the x8 w a command 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.320
 that does not mean big problems do not 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.880
 it supposes great novelties within 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.859
 this drone but it is true that 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.540
 functions like the gel to remove then 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.190
 may pose some problems for 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.140
 many who are starting inside 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.629
 this world then we are going to 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.210
 take command and let's start the two 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.430
 to the mind to be able to tell us right now 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.500
 what can you do with each button and not 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.149
 you can do so that nothing we go to the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.770
 workshop table and by the way you have to 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.020
 thank the company of arbes for 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.030
 have brought us this product very many 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.450
 thank you and nothing we are going to go to the table 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.110
 of the workshop and we go direct 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.630
 of this control of the gap x 8 w 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.110
 hi guys welcome here right now 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:09.080
 to the analysis of sigma x 8 w control 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.790
 great drone best person friends of mine so 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.520
 nothing let's take a look one 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.700
 little here to the control of this 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.610
 gap x 8 w a control knob very 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.850
 Very nice indeed has whitey 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.910
 here four precious batteries also worth 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.770
 of course of course ikea brand 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.670
 Swedish batteries Swedish hard batteries more 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.670
 Sirs 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:39.920
 that will sponsor drone videos not like that 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.650
 very random everybody crazy in the end the 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.750
 case here we have control of the gap x8 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.180
 w and let's take a look for 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.310
 above 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.800
 I have to admit that the controls do not 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.210
 we are surprised nothing is more if we could 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.190
 say a comparison 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.110
 this would be practically the same 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.690
 practically has differences with the 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.280
 AMIS command x 5 c is more than you are 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.900
 seeing that it is practically the same 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.910
 it's just black and it's more 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.010
 big this command is quite bigger 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.039
 possibly a third larger 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.959
 that the sender over x 5 c ok let's go 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.910
 to start with the fast things that are going 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.310
 to be this analysis is going to be quite 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.600
 quickie because above all it is very 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.700
 similar to all other controls 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.830
 well we have it if we turn it on 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.190
 we found with the lcd screen that we 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.180
 says how much battery of how many 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.640
 batteries we have in our 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.840
 and in the control stacks tells us here 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.250
 the power you are testing for here 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.049
 the inclination I was giving for 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.019
 there in the end things that in the end I think 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.790
 that many times because we do not even not 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.099
 we stop to see her here we are seeing 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.329
 also if we have it in mode 1 mode 2 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.099
 that can be changed well in the 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.659
 instructions 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.409
 we are flying right now in 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:53.060
 the way we have here and nothing 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.650
 well let's take a look I'm going to 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:00.049
 turn it off so that that light is not 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.819
 bothering sir it's good to turn on the 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.069
 command later we would understand the drone that 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.710
 has an off button below by 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.840
 course the battery is hooked 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.820
 and once done then we give up 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.980
 down and already synchronize I do not know if 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.060
 is going to be able to do now perfect would be 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.520
 something like that 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.530
 no problem no problem ever 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.690
 there are problems here the disqualifications 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.180
 typical of the controls and more and there not 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.400
 there is no kind of history well with 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.680
 this command with this control is worth 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.080
 this style what we would do would be to do 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.490
 two very fast concepts the gas is worth 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.470
 to give it power and this to turn 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.390
 on its own axis one has more 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.070
 stories about their own axis by 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:43.190
 course it is well worth 360 degree turn 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:46.460
 so it would be on its own axis 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.840
 gentlemen is worth it this more would not be 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.490
 left to right to front to 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.890
 back has no more stories this is 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.930
 for trimmer let's imagine that we're going 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.570
 very up we would have to 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.520
 pull down giving you this down 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.680
 is to balance the drone if we are 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.660
 turns too much for one side or another 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.370
 We do not know why, since you already know 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.230
 control with these if you're going to 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.860
 go ahead with this one if you're going for the 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.740
 left right 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.290
 with these two controls I tell you this is already 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.790
 more or less the normal yes no 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.950
 It is very clear, well, I recommend you 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.389
 take a look at the other videos that 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.250
 we have controls because always 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.079
 it's the same and many times what 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.720
 I explain good normally for example the 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.250
 10th x 50 explained a lot more lentito 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.440
 but good as always is the same for 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.479
 Do not bore the regulars and those who do not 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.370
 be regular because you know you are going to 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.250
 the other videos of other controls 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:37.330
 drones and to see us not to say 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39.690
 good interesting things here we have the 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.520
 control to be able to do the different 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.349
 pirouettes if we press this button and you 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.570
 We give to go up by down 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:48.220
 the drone would do a pirouette and as you know 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.970
 that I like to represent in the 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.370
 real world would be piracy like that 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.750
 ok if this does not fit on the screen anymore 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.400
 what madness of more or less would that be 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.370
 then it has already become clear this way 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.110
 in the flight of this drone since I already 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.090
 you're going to see what we're going to publish is 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.240
 very brief in very short 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.610
 well, we have more things with this 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.680
 ok here here is the key here is 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.870
 The key to the market is certainly true 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.930
 press once the button quickies 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.990
 we simply change from quick mode to 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:24.760
 slow mode there is no more history but 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:27.100
 but but that's not interesting or 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:30.340
 joke or joke how interesting is the 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.630
 so they're worth the headless mode that 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.790
 you know that I do not like it 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.199
 this mode for any type of drone 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.050
 I think that for this drone it is very good 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:40.150
 we would have to leave it depressed well no 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.040
 I know if synchronizing the drone is going to 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.990
 leave but well let's try 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.570
 we will have to leave this boston pressed 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.889
 twice of two seconds forgiveness and already 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.610
 we would go to the headless mode of what 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.610
 happens if you enter 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.810
 right now what happens is that you are 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.610
 coming back a bit because he does not have any 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.410
 synchronized drone to see 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.020
 expelling the two seconds that we 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.910
 we want to go out in this way without a head 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.910
 we press again two seconds very easy 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:12.400
 very simple and very comfortable and good 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.920
 nice for all the good it is 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.410
 bursting is also rujano his side 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.880
 Sevillian so nothing I hope that you 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.980
 I liked it, I hope you have been 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.590
 I hope this serves good 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.900
 to decide your purchase or not of the 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.670
 gap x8 w at least the characteristic 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.010
 as you have noticed, there are quite a few 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.320
 basic but very interesting too 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:35.320
 we can add in the analysis of the 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:38.350
 control the top application for the 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.570
 fpv but between that has no history 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.480
 it's worth it because it's simply connecting the 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:46.840
 mobile we put it here to mobile we connect 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:49.930
 to our woman our wifi to the wifi 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.160
 drone and there is no more we open the 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.820
 application and it 's working 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.380
 there's nothing really to analyze there 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.300
 but good to just tell you that 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.920
 that through the application we can 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.570
 record the drone we can do the 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.500
 little things we can do recording and 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:07.900
 so and that 6 if you already know the problems 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.880
 they have and well I do not want to bore yet 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.280
 more with it because I've already talked so much 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.680
 of the problems of the chasm x8 w with its 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.880
 bmw that you are going to hit me for being so 

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.220
 tired 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.710
 finally we go directly to the 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:22.570
 farewell as you have seen is not a 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.340
 drone that has big problems is not 

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.740
 a drone that has large 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.330
 complications of control through 

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.910
 your control command the truth is that it is 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:33.130
 very simple a very intuitive command and 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.690
 what good except the headless mode 

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.820
 that we have it here by pressing two 

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.350
 seconds, well, it's not that the 

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.630
 of command could have taken a little 

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:42.880
 I sincerely liked intuition 

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:44.110
 This command much by the way I have been 

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.530
 It also seemed very interesting 

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:50.410
 clamp to put the to put the mobile 

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:52.930
 and make the fpv a pity that it does not work 

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:54.670
 at least in my case you already know good 

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:57.190
