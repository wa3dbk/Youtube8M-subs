of that change what if we asked

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.430 
of that change what if we asked
ourselves<00:00:42.520> we<00:00:43.450> could<00:00:43.600> give<00:00:43.780> people<00:00:44.020> a<00:00:44.230> chance

from<00:00:47.860> public<00:00:48.550> space<00:00:48.790> but<00:00:49.210> to<00:00:49.270> realize<00:00:49.809> those

from public space but to realize those
designs<00:00:50.500> to<00:00:50.680> make<00:00:50.710> those<00:00:51.550> designs<00:00:52.140> out<00:00:53.140> in

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
designs to make those designs out in

you're<00:01:08.009> the<00:01:08.130> museum<00:01:08.549> we<00:01:08.869> see<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.830> city<00:01:11.130> as<00:01:11.430> an

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
you're the museum we see the city as an

you're the museum we see the city as an
artifact<00:01:12.689> which<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.229> not<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.500> say<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.640> city<00:01:14.850> is

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
artifact which is not to say the city is

artifact which is not to say the city is
something<00:01:15.090> static<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.960> dull<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.170> boring<00:01:16.680> but

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
something static and dull and boring but

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.460 
something static and dull and boring but
we're<00:01:17.939> interested<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.869> city<00:01:19.080> just<00:01:19.350> like

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
we're interested in the city just like

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.779 
we're interested in the city just like
we're<00:01:19.619> interested<00:01:20.039> in<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.250> objects<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.729> our

last<00:01:23.490> summer<00:01:23.729> we<00:01:24.000> met<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.539> the<00:01:25.289> museum<00:01:25.740> had<00:01:25.920> an

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
last summer we met and the museum had an

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.669 
last summer we met and the museum had an
idea<00:01:26.399> to<00:01:26.700> use<00:01:26.880> recycled<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:28.049> expanded

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:28.679 
idea to use recycled I expanded

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.330 
idea to use recycled I expanded

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
space build project all the information

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.779 
space build project all the information
you're<00:01:36.360> given<00:01:36.720> was<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:38.159> would<00:01:38.340> be<00:01:38.369> out<00:01:38.670> of

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
you're given was that it would be out of

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.999 
you're given was that it would be out of
styrofoam<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.720> we<00:01:39.780> had<00:01:39.929> to<00:01:40.049> design<00:01:40.200> one

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
styrofoam and that we had to design one

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.340 
styrofoam and that we had to design one
module<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:42.119> connected<00:01:42.690> and<00:01:42.899> could<00:01:43.049> be<00:01:43.170> used

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
module that connected and could be used

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.960 
module that connected and could be used
in<00:01:43.440> different<00:01:43.500> ways<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.069> that<00:01:44.159> was<00:01:44.399> about<00:01:44.610> it

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
in different ways and that was about it

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.870 
in different ways and that was about it
and<00:01:45.409> soon<00:01:46.409> after<00:01:46.679> that<00:01:46.709> we<00:01:46.979> went<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
and soon after that we went to the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.630 
and soon after that we went to the
Madisonville<00:01:48.390> Factory

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.210 

out<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.900> yard<00:01:54.930> our<00:01:55.470> friend<00:01:55.800> Jackie<00:01:56.040> who

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
out in the yard our friend Jackie who

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.440 
out in the yard our friend Jackie who
showed<00:01:56.550> us<00:01:57.150> these<00:01:57.720> huge<00:01:58.409> mounds<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.450> material

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
showed us these huge mounds of material

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.070 
showed us these huge mounds of material
old<00:02:01.080> used<00:02:01.710> blocks<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.760> polystyrene<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.990> were

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
old used blocks of polystyrene that were

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.200 
old used blocks of polystyrene that were
bound<00:02:04.440> for<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.800> landfill<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.550> that<00:02:05.970> had<00:02:06.060> been

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
bound for the landfill and that had been

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.050 
bound for the landfill and that had been
rescued<00:02:06.659> by<00:02:06.810> Madisonville<00:02:07.290> plastics<00:02:07.819> he<00:02:08.819> told

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
rescued by Madisonville plastics he told

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.580 
rescued by Madisonville plastics he told
us<00:02:09.179> we<00:02:09.420> could<00:02:09.569> use<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:09.899> material<00:02:10.380> we<00:02:10.470> could

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
us we could use this material we could

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.590 
us we could use this material we could
make<00:02:10.890> our<00:02:11.070> own<00:02:11.280> new<00:02:11.550> blocks<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.270> build

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
make our own new blocks and build

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.780 
make our own new blocks and build
whatever<00:02:12.810> we<00:02:13.110> wanted<00:02:13.380> with<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:16.459> thing<00:02:17.459> that<00:02:17.760> I

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
whatever we wanted with it thing that I

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.760 
whatever we wanted with it thing that I
think<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.209> what<00:02:18.360> really<00:02:18.630> informed<00:02:19.050> my<00:02:19.140> design

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
think is what really informed my design

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.320 
think is what really informed my design
so<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.010> wanted<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.520> create<00:02:20.820> a<00:02:20.850> unit<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.209> was

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
so I wanted to create a unit that was

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.540 
so I wanted to create a unit that was
easy<00:02:21.600> for<00:02:21.840> them<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:21.989> manufacture<00:02:22.739> and<00:02:23.010> didn't

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
easy for them to manufacture and didn't

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.780 
easy for them to manufacture and didn't
have<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.730> lot<00:02:23.910> of<00:02:23.940> waste<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.860> yet<00:02:25.860> connected<00:02:26.670> in

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
have a lot of waste and yet connected in

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.949 
have a lot of waste and yet connected in
an<00:02:26.880> interesting<00:02:27.209> way<00:02:29.209> so<00:02:30.209> I<00:02:30.239> started<00:02:30.600> thinking

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
an interesting way so I started thinking

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.460 
an interesting way so I started thinking
about<00:02:31.080> using<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.370> leftovers<00:02:33.030> as<00:02:33.470> something

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
about using the leftovers as something

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.770 
about using the leftovers as something
that<00:02:34.500> interacted<00:02:35.130> with<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.370> block<00:02:35.550> as<00:02:35.730> well
