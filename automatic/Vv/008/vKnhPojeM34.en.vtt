00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.780
 yes that actually came through 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.910
 some water bit in my in one 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.550
 family is one 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.560
 yes so I said well I want 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.150
 economically get you back and do it for 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.920
 children who have a hard time and who 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.710
 who are also not reimbursed by the 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.930
 insurance and well the week of the one 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.820
 actually a foundation on the other day 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.100
 started with a number of people and those 5 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.840
 involved and then you need one that 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.940
 runs very well we even get there 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.290
 so a second pond is on it 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.210
 We also have a new one 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.979
 foundation new foundation with you 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.990
 children of the forest i roll and 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.670
 you are really really expanding 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.830
 sign about the fox pit team 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.770
 so the team of plants giant the 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.630
 foundation of ronald waterreus 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.340
 we are a foundation that works 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.260
 or who is committed to him with 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.630
 extinction endangered cats and then 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.270
 cats in the wild of course 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.110
 and we have existed for almost 10 years now 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.240
 happen to me later and yes we work 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.490
 with the two WWF largely with WWF 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.990
 together on different projects and it 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.420
 major project that we have been doing for years 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.490
 that is concerned with maintaining 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.160
 the iberian lynx in spain 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.500
 yes, a very different project 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.789
 initiative than that project of theo and 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.380
 yet that comes together here how is that 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.000
 initiative ever came about me 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.610
 should only give theo credits for it 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.810
 idea he came up with an idea 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.100
 in all honesty it must be even better known 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.410
 I was pretty skeptical 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.580
 but I have to say was last 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.890
 done the first time the 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.200
 this you about second time and it is it 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.020
 also a very nice one 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.969
 happening and it is 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.500
 hopefully it will be tonight too 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.319
 cozy and it is still often the case that 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.450
 people remember at the foundation 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.290
 by nice evening and then always look 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.640
 with a lot of pleasure 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.940
 or think you will be very happy 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.140
 to back and that I deliver that of course 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.580
 To apply to the we must be honest 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.680
 but that also often produces a kind 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.120
 of consciousness on the one hand for the 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.430
 foundation of theo on the other hand for mine 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.500
 foundation so that's how you should actually do it 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.489
 day like today it is now resting in it 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.590

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.440

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.530
