00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
really comes into play there because

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.600 
really comes into play there because
there's<00:00:29.140> primary<00:00:29.619> ability<00:00:30.070> is<00:00:30.279> basically

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
there's primary ability is basically

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.000 
there's primary ability is basically
deploying<00:00:31.119> spawn<00:00:31.600> points<00:00:32.020> anywhere<00:00:32.800> in<00:00:32.890> the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
deploying spawn points anywhere in the

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.070 
deploying spawn points anywhere in the
level<00:00:33.280> you<00:00:33.670> can<00:00:33.820> throw<00:00:34.030> this<00:00:34.210> this<00:00:34.720> marker

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.080 
level you can throw this this marker

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.229 
level you can throw this this marker
anywhere<00:00:35.440> and<00:00:35.650> all<00:00:36.309> your<00:00:36.520> friends<00:00:36.670> can<00:00:37.059> then

spawn<00:00:37.600> at<00:00:37.780> that<00:00:37.930> point<00:00:38.230> so<00:00:38.830> you<00:00:38.890> can<00:00:39.070> really

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
spawn at that point so you can really

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.030 
spawn at that point so you can really
use<00:00:39.309> that<00:00:39.550> as<00:00:39.790> like<00:00:40.180> a<00:00:40.470> tactical<00:00:41.470> entry<00:00:41.590> point

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
use that as like a tactical entry point

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.330 
use that as like a tactical entry point
during<00:00:42.700> missions<00:00:43.090> or<00:00:43.360> just<00:00:44.080> a<00:00:44.140> place<00:00:44.350> to<00:00:44.590> meet

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
as a person sensitive because the bots

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.160 
as a person sensitive because the bots
will<00:01:14.430> start<00:01:14.640> attacking<00:01:14.729> any<00:01:15.330> enemy<00:01:15.660> where<00:01:15.930> it

like<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.440> that<00:01:31.520> deployables<00:01:32.520> spawn<00:01:32.850> areas<00:01:33.210> can

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
like is that deployables spawn areas can

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.360 
like is that deployables spawn areas can
