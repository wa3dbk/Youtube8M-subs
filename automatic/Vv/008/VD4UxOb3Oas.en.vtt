00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 we 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.090
 I will show you how to turn over one cut. 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.130
 reception using a special foot with her 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.900
 help can be turned over easily 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.939
 as a finished bake due to ironing them 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.860
 slices and a simple oblique strip 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.200
 fabrics 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:31.180
 take the ready tape cut the end under 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.180
 angle and fill foot 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.879
 taxes east wind it allows 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.129
 adjust the foot so that the needle 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.610
 was one millimeter away from the folds 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.920
 the braid then put the foot in place and 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.329
 we stretch the end of the tape so that it 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.329
 performed behind the foot 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:02.850
 we enclose a cut of fabric in a snail so 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.850
 so that it fits snugly 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.540
 so we can turn over the tape 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.790
 you are extremely independent 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.520
 how to do it I told you in 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.120
 previous master class need to stretch 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.190
 bake 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.290
 through the center hole of the cochlea and 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.990
 stick and just like us 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.790
 showed earlier so we can 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.030
 turn over the slice as straight 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.050
 so and rounded everything except cutting off 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.110
 right angles 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.030
 either tears in a vicious circle like 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.370
 process closed loop slices 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.770
 I show manually in the previous one 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:42.910
 master class and so handle the corners 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.550
 I will show you the outer corner of the antto now 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.240
 youth is so necessary that the line reached 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.240
 fabric edges 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.780
 then you need to go back a little 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.780
 leave the needle in the fabric and and raise the foot 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.190
 then shape the corner to lower the foot 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.190
 and stitch to the corner 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.510
 grab the bend in the corner leave the needle 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.110
 in the fabric and and raise the foot 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:31.690
 power detail around the needle to lower the foot 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.690
 and continue the line with up to what and bake 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:38.500
 the inner corner needs to be spread 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.500
 in one line and turn over 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.080
 then write a letter in the corner like 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.080
 little tuck 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.050
 to turn over the means using the paws a 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.300
 tilter and very just need 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.510
 insert a slanting inlay snail foot 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:17.990
 put fabric in the groove and stitch line 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.090
 it turns out perfectly smooth but the angles are better 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:23.120
 handle manually for edging 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.270
 the outer corner you need will give rachev to the end 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.080
 go back a little and leaving the fabric 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:32.180
 needle to raise the foot to form an angle and 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:35.690
 stitch inner corner 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:40.940
 need to trim straighten to turn over 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:43.580
 cut emit a corner well when there is 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.140
 extra pads and accessories but 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.070
 There are such operations that can 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.070
 do it manually
