00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.500
 what is the compact are the great 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.440
 requested to our cities with the 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.639
 slower traffic, there is no 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.769
 lot to discuss 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.320
 and if accompanied by the transmission 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.779
 automatic is better still want a 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.340
 example 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.830
 after a year of its launch here 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.470
 208 has already achieved a good 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.250
 space and even considerable respect 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.560
 for that 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.199
 but still looks far from what the p &amp; g o 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.780
 designed for him and that in fact this 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.230
 model deserves here so nothing like a 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.540
 line-up from 2014 to 2015 to 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.820
 create a new version where one of the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.870
 attractive is the price more in mind as 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.870
 You'll see with me. 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.850
 Well, we're not talking about a 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.850
 super bold action of the brand with 208 with 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.250
 really appealing price but yes it is a 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.199
 price version created for 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.149
 meet anyone looking for a compact 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.260
 packed with equipment and with 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:10.680
 automatic transmission so the 208 1.6 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.799
 flex won this active version pec that 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.000
 brings the automatic exchange and costs 52 thousand 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.000
 three hundred and ninety reais 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.220
 are six thousand and six hundred reais less 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.470
 in relation to the top version and that until 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.120
 was the only option on the line with 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.820
 automatic transmission 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.460
 now beyond the price basically the 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.490
 difference between the versions is the ceiling 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:49.590
 the traditional native pec and panoramic 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:52.470
 label 208 follows with the transmission 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.050
 automatic four - speed reason 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.390
 criticism for the lack of a march 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.510
 to give that relief to the good 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.150
 engine 1.6 flex of 122 horsepower 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.880
 especially when the 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.250
 is a very different road from the anti 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.480
 of the city where the whole is efficient 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.300
 does not bother 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.850
 even with four gears 208 maintains 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.140
 agility and can be more challenging 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.600
 in sports mode 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.720
 simply press the s key next to the 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.720
 lever 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.739
 and here in 208 you remember we have 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.139
 this condition is different from what people 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.790
 is accustomed the steering wheel is smaller has 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:36.040
 to be positioned lower more 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.439
 near the legs and look at me this 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.420
 proposal is very cool because it gives more 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:42.159
 provides more flexibility in 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.680
 driving a car and a little more 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:46.900
 comfort also now in this case here 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.689
 which will have automatic transmission help 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.700
 much in this the option switches of march 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.700
 here by the letters behind the wheel 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.310
 how pj informs the system of 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.590
 automatically adjusts the 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.500
 schedule of exchanges according to the 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.840
 style and who has devices 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.170
 which adapts the operation according to 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.720
 the floor conditions at the most by 208 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.420
 follows with the well-known attractions 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.780
 more careful finishing and good supply 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.450
 the multimedia center in 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.209
 touchscreen and gathers commands 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.220
 many system resources available 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.890
 with auxiliary inputs and 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.030
 computer connections smartphone 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.030
 board and navigation system 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:49.310
 208 follows with a three- year warranty and 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:53.390
 for a review plan with fixed values 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.250
 including labor 208 is a car 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.100
 differentiated and became more interesting 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.320
 Yes as we saw there with this option this 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.210
 new option with automatic transmission 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.370
 now his life is not easy because 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.590
 competition in the most popular segment 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.490
 here in Brazil that is exactly the 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.410
 compact 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.870
 now you can not forget that he is a 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.490
 of those responsible for this turn 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.890
 in this segment here in Brazil that today 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.169
 with much more modern cars and 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.739
 with a lot of technology exactly as it is 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.739
 if his
