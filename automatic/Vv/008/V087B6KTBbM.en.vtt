00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
little by little how do you explain that

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.590 
little by little how do you explain that
it<00:00:34.770> doesn't<00:00:35.130> click<00:00:35.370> when<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:35.969> want<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.360> this

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
it doesn't click when you want to this

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.950

week<00:00:36.870> or<00:00:37.820> this<00:00:38.820> week<00:00:41.329> yeah<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.360> definitely<00:00:42.480> felt

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
week or this week yeah I definitely felt

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.500 
week or this week yeah I definitely felt
a<00:00:43.110> bit<00:00:43.260> better<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.710> Rome<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:45.059> think<00:00:45.239> that

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
a bit better in Rome so I think that

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.540 
a bit better in Rome so I think that
just<00:00:45.660> makes<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.899> more<00:00:46.050> disappointing<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.860> have

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
just makes it more disappointing to have

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.290 
just makes it more disappointing to have
a<00:00:47.610> performance<00:00:48.090> like<00:00:48.300> today<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:49.910> so<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:50.940> just

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
a performance like today and so I just

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.639 
a performance like today and so I just
feel<00:00:51.449> like<00:00:51.570> it's<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:51.930> been<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> while<00:00:52.350> that

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
feel like it's it's been a while that

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.979 
feel like it's it's been a while that
this<00:00:52.739> has<00:00:52.890> been<00:00:53.010> happening<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.870> you<00:00:54.870> know
