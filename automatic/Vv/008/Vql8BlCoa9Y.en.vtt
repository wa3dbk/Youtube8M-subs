00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
all-stars battle royale and I could just

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.839 
all-stars battle royale and I could just
simplify<00:00:10.500> things<00:00:10.559> by<00:00:11.070> saying<00:00:11.460> that<00:00:11.670> this<00:00:11.820> is

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
simplify things by saying that this is

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.720 
simplify things by saying that this is
Sony's<00:00:12.420> super<00:00:12.840> smash<00:00:13.080> brothers<00:00:13.320> but<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.519> is

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
Sony's super smash brothers but it is

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
Sony's super smash brothers but it is
not<00:00:15.109> for<00:00:16.109> how<00:00:16.980> similar<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.789> game<00:00:18.000> may<00:00:18.270> seem

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
not for how similar the game may seem

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.410 
not for how similar the game may seem
and<00:00:19.080> even<00:00:20.039> though<00:00:20.189> everyone<00:00:20.699> seems<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.330> be

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
and even though everyone seems to be

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.570 
and even though everyone seems to be
comparing<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.140> game<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.769> they're<00:00:23.279> not

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
comparing the game to it they're not

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.410 
comparing the game to it they're not
that<00:00:24.269> much<00:00:24.539> alike<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.230> mainly<00:00:26.160> because<00:00:26.420> even

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
that much alike and mainly because even

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.009 
that much alike and mainly because even
though<00:00:27.539> all<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.840> similarities<00:00:28.050> on<00:00:28.800> the

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
though all the similarities on the

roaster<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.340> the<00:00:32.450> concept<00:00:33.450> behind<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:34.410> game

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
roaster the the concept behind the game

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.440 
roaster the the concept behind the game
mechanics<00:00:35.160> themselves<00:00:35.640> are<00:00:35.790> completely

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
mechanics themselves are completely

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.110 
mechanics themselves are completely
different<00:00:36.870> what<00:00:37.170> makes<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.950> really<00:00:38.520> really

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
different what makes it a really really

different what makes it a really really
different<00:00:39.480> game<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:40.440> for<00:00:40.710> instance<00:00:40.800> on<00:00:41.280> super

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
different game so for instance on super

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.639 
different game so for instance on super
smash<00:00:41.940> brothers<00:00:42.120> you'll<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.600> trying<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.170> push

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
smash brothers you'll be trying to push

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.700

your open opponents to the borders of
the<00:00:46.860> screen<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.820> will<00:00:47.850> be<00:00:48.120> scoring

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
the screen and you will be scoring

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.950 
the screen and you will be scoring
off-screen<00:00:49.289> kills<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:50.430> will<00:00:50.610> have<00:00:50.879> a

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
off-screen kills you will have a

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.040 
off-screen kills you will have a
percentage<00:00:51.960> bar<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:53.600> that<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.780> actually

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
percentage bar to that that actually

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.279 
percentage bar to that that actually
relates<00:00:55.680> damage<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.930> higher<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
relates damage and the higher the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.290 
relates damage and the higher the
percentage<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.520> more<00:00:59.760> time<00:01:00.000> they<00:01:00.180> will

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
percentage that the more time they will

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.750 
percentage that the more time they will
be<00:01:00.449> flying<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.379> up<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.340> air<00:01:02.489> and

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
be flying in the up in the air and

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.969 
be flying in the up in the air and
that's<00:01:03.690> completely<00:01:04.229> different<00:01:04.680> with<00:01:04.830> this

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
that's completely different with this

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.219 
that's completely different with this
game<00:01:05.250> over<00:01:05.489> here<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.360> won't<00:01:06.570> be<00:01:06.750> explaining

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
game over here and I won't be explaining

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.780 
game over here and I won't be explaining
it<00:01:07.320> too<00:01:07.500> much<00:01:07.680> you'll<00:01:07.860> be<00:01:07.979> able<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.250> see

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
it too much you'll be able to see

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.719 
it too much you'll be able to see
ourselves<00:01:09.030> but<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.110> thing<00:01:10.140> here<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:11.010> will<00:01:11.549> be

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
ourselves but the thing here is will be

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.100 
ourselves but the thing here is will be
just<00:01:12.229> growing<00:01:13.229> up<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.680> bar<00:01:13.950> let's<00:01:14.369> say<00:01:14.640> a

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
just growing up a bar let's say a

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.530 
just growing up a bar let's say a
whatever<00:01:16.110> bar<00:01:16.619> I'd<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.159> really<00:01:17.970> don't<00:01:18.180> know<00:01:18.270> how

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
whatever bar I'd I really don't know how

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.690 
whatever bar I'd I really don't know how
they<00:01:18.720> call<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.229> I'll<00:01:19.770> probably<00:01:20.100> know<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.580> a

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
they call it I'll probably know in a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.960 
they call it I'll probably know in a
while<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:22.020> moment<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.409> get<00:01:22.560> those<00:01:22.970> combo

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
while and the moment you get those combo

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.120 
while and the moment you get those combo
bars<00:01:24.180> were<00:01:24.450> ever<00:01:24.630> filled<00:01:25.140> you'll<00:01:25.770> have<00:01:25.950> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
bars were ever filled you'll have the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.999 
bars were ever filled you'll have the
chance<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.490> kill<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.360> actually<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.170> only<00:01:28.380> way

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
chance to kill so actually the only way

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.760 
chance to kill so actually the only way
you<00:01:29.070> have<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.640> kill<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.090> perform<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
you have to kill is to perform the the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.200 
you have to kill is to perform the the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
more attacks as possible and then you

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.350 
more attacks as possible and then you
can<00:01:36.450> strike<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.229> try<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.680> perform<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.909> score

some points but even so it's not a
hundred<00:01:42.960> percent<00:01:43.110> sure<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.860> you'll<00:01:44.070> be<00:01:44.220> able
