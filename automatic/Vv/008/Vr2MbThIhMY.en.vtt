over but now I know he doesn't have aqua
jet<00:05:00.120> and<00:05:00.330> I<00:05:00.570> thought<00:05:00.979> I'd<00:05:01.979> be<00:05:02.040> faster<00:05:02.610> which

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
jet and I thought I'd be faster which

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.490 
jet and I thought I'd be faster which
normally<00:05:03.150> I<00:05:03.210> would<00:05:03.450> but<00:05:03.630> he<00:05:03.720> actually<00:05:03.870> has<00:05:04.140> max

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
normally I would but he actually has max

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.870 
normally I would but he actually has max
speed<00:05:05.030> jolly<00:05:06.050> hun<00:05:07.050> Carcosa<00:05:08.040> so<00:05:08.460> it's<00:05:08.580> actually

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
speed jolly hun Carcosa so it's actually

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.960 
speed jolly hun Carcosa so it's actually
faster<00:05:09.120> than<00:05:09.530> then<00:05:10.530> him<00:05:10.740> on<00:05:10.890> Lee<00:05:11.070> and<00:05:11.310> I<00:05:11.550> pretty

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
faster than then him on Lee and I pretty

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.850 
faster than then him on Lee and I pretty
much<00:05:12.090> get<00:05:12.360> my<00:05:12.570> shit<00:05:12.630> wrecked<00:05:13.169> because<00:05:13.500> I
