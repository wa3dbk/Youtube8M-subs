 it is from all of us who are in minecraft 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.759
 1.7 point two let's see a mod 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.170
 that as you see list adds animations already 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.480
 we saw smoke from animations but other 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.300
 these balls a lot more is that look here 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.520
 happy to the one I write the a lot like 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.980
 jumps the video but it's cool a lot 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.890
 the animations of today when bending over 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.199
 and esque 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.500
 like it costs a little bit is not 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.500
 knock 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.930
 the chickens do not have I think this is 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.590
 other 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.380
 look at finger 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.380
 is that we fly everything is super 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.600
 I'm hitting or I do not support total that 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.940
 I do not do it to the end it ends with a rose 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.980
 in your hand but you're super cool 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.450
 the animations especially when running me 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.150
 love to run and jump seems super 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.470
 happy but good let's see let's see 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.629
 some animations I said yes 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.910
 they have some super saiyan so flying and 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.690
 It's cool a lot of time but let's see 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.440
 spiders spiders give a bad roll 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.640
 my mother 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.590
 look at it 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.310
 is that the bad news is already going 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.620
 to get us right now so that 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.580
 come for I'm going to beat him 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.150
 and see what more ticket 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.909
 what good is it or not 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:30.260
 how it moves the legs does not cool anything 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:32.510
 the spider gives me very bad roll so you die 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.600
 the zombies the one who just did me 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.860
 here the super sand of always looking 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.860
 the combis that is like half crouched 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.990
 He gets very bad roll up as a walker 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.990
 or 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.159
 and if they raise their hands, nothing is cool 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.790
 you see 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.979
 it seems like a scary movie , you have to 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.900
 it's called lifting the handles that 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.900
 team as not 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:09.540
 if projecting that I'm prepared 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.540
 Take, take 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.580
 as to the punches also time 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.520
 my mother what monkey the zombie so little 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.900
 more badly that is supposed to 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.720
 I say is supposed because I have not seen 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.180
 but well that the squids also 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.330
 they have that in the legs they should not be 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.740
 straight but as circular as it is 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.290
 they drive but I do not see it 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.290
 and now I'm in to 1.7 points 2 also 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.780
 is for 1.7 point 10 then I do not know if 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.440
 will be just that version or that zombies 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.570
 pigments the zombies pigs 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.900
 that is very cool but it takes away the 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.900
 sword 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.890
 wow that gets angry 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.280
 after running 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.350
 [Music] 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.700
 if you see it as an arm it does not move it 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.060
 I suppose that 's where the 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.060
 sword 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.190
 the clippers 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.340
 As you can see, it looks so weird 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.260
 uncle 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.879
 It's not that it's weird, it's like I have 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.629
 joints there is grace 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:19.260
 I really do not know how he persecutes me 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:23.050
 promote the paticas and there is no 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.900
 how not how the supermoor explodes then 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.610
 another little thing is what you are seeing and 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.629
 is that when they take away life goes 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.950
 Bleeding that I thought was super cool dude 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.390
 let's exploit it to see again the 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.080
 animation is to your why exploiting the 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.440
 endorsements uy 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.880
 first we can also give it to lage and 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.490
 if you open the menu to us I do not know why 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.320
 these animations does not let me touch them is 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.570
 a little weird but good the player does 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.690
 then we can choose with this or great 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.510
 head highlights the zombie like we can 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.270
 put giant heads then this if 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.620
 do you think the head is giant at 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.890
 walk or not when you put it here in 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:05.240
 head in big head you get everything 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:08.110
 automatic so let's see 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.110
 good mother 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.610
 I'm not cool I look very weird and then they 're 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.680
 the spiders are the poisonous ones that are 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.850
 same as the others really, but not 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.350
 I know we go to many of the animations 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.380
 good god 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.820
 ok and let's see if when riding in 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.540
 true there is animation or not because in the 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.440
 that way that we saw yes we had go 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.540
 Let's see 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:36.280
 because here 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:39.289
 that does not treat the head 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.800
 let's put it normal 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:45.490
 that we're going to put on how was that 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.490
 here 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.120
 yes man seems like he's hunched 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.310
 do not 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.740
 well better than nothing for me to do 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.580
 a little weird and I want and like that lifts 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.610
 a little the little head 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.889
 it's a little bit weird the truth this 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.830
 It is the appearance with two clear hearts 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.539
 that is all destroyed I do not know but I 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.490
 it has seemed very curious telmo but good 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.199
 you have in the description as I say that 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.669
 is 1.7 points but it is also 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:17.310
 for 1.7 point 10 1.6 point 2 and 1 point 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:19.650
 5.2 I do not know why the 1.6 point 4 is not 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.870
 but good but good is the 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.969
 agree as I always hope that 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:29.120
 you liked it and it was made 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:29.120
 that's all hunter chao 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.110
 ah
