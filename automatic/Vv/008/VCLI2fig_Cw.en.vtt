so<00:00:54.580> that<00:00:54.760> needs<00:00:54.970> more<00:00:55.450> light<00:00:56.130> this<00:00:57.130> one's

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
so that needs more light this one's

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.160 
so that needs more light this one's
sitting<00:00:57.580> basically<00:00:58.360> almost<00:00:58.570> immediately

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
sitting basically almost immediately

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.240 
sitting basically almost immediately
underneath<00:00:59.710> the<00:01:00.900> light<00:01:01.950> looks<00:01:02.950> to<00:01:03.100> me<00:01:03.220> like

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
underneath the light looks to me like

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.470 
underneath the light looks to me like
this<00:01:03.900> okay<00:01:04.900> here<00:01:05.140> are<00:01:05.260> starting<00:01:05.410> to<00:01:06.360> check<00:01:07.360> on

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
this okay here are starting to check on

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.470 
this okay here are starting to check on
the<00:01:07.540> bolt<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:09.010> is<00:01:09.190> getting<00:01:09.490> pretty<00:01:09.640> tall<00:01:12.480> so

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
the bolt this is getting pretty tall so

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.660 
the bolt this is getting pretty tall so
that's<00:01:13.660> it<00:01:13.870> for<00:01:13.930> these<00:01:14.380> two<00:01:15.040> little<00:01:15.310> pots

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
that's it for these two little pots

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.070 
that's it for these two little pots
should<00:01:16.060> see<00:01:17.050> that<00:01:19.740> now<00:01:20.740> you<00:01:20.770> can't<00:01:21.190> see<00:01:21.340> that

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
should see that now you can't see that

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.750 
should see that now you can't see that
you<00:01:23.080> can't<00:01:23.110> see<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.650> roots<00:01:24.010> then<00:01:24.580> I've<00:01:24.729> got

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
you can't see the roots then I've got

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:31.760 
you can't see the roots then I've got
these<00:01:25.150> two<00:01:26.910> this<00:01:27.910> is<00:01:27.970> my<00:01:29.100> experiment<00:01:30.450> between

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
these two this is my experiment between

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.070 
these two this is my experiment between
just<00:01:32.770> straight<00:01:33.250> grow<00:01:33.550> media<00:01:34.000> aquarium<00:01:34.900> gravel

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
just straight grow media aquarium gravel

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.550 
just straight grow media aquarium gravel
and<00:01:37.470> aquarium<00:01:38.470> gravel<00:01:38.619> mixed<00:01:39.250> with<00:01:40.560> activated

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
and aquarium gravel mixed with activated

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.080 
and aquarium gravel mixed with activated
charcoal<00:01:41.950> no<00:01:42.369> one<00:01:42.970> does<00:01:43.150> this<00:01:43.390> yeah<00:01:44.880> see<00:01:45.880> the

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
charcoal no one does this yeah see the

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:55.260 
charcoal no one does this yeah see the
roots<00:01:46.630> growing<00:01:47.170> in<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:50.100> pots<00:01:52.470> but<00:01:53.470> uh<00:01:53.500> I<00:01:54.270> think

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
roots growing in the pots but uh I think

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.620 
roots growing in the pots but uh I think
it<00:01:55.420> looks<00:01:55.450> really<00:01:56.670> really<00:01:57.670> good<00:02:00.390> nice<00:02:01.390> big

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
it looks really really good nice big

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.830 
it looks really really good nice big
leaves<00:02:04.230> the<00:02:05.230> plants<00:02:05.650> are<00:02:05.830> a<00:02:05.890> little<00:02:06.190> bit<00:02:06.840> limp

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
leaves the plants are a little bit limp

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.640 
leaves the plants are a little bit limp
but<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:10.149> could<00:02:10.360> be<00:02:10.390> because<00:02:10.510> air<00:02:11.230> so

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
but that could be because air so

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.710 
but that could be because air so
perfectly<00:02:12.190> still<00:02:12.610> that<00:02:12.790> they<00:02:12.940> don't<00:02:13.150> grow

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
perfectly still that they don't grow

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.310 
perfectly still that they don't grow
strong<00:02:14.320> you<00:02:14.650> know<00:02:14.739> what<00:02:14.830> I<00:02:14.860> mean<00:02:16.080> so<00:02:17.080> I<00:02:17.110> think

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
strong you know what I mean so I think

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.470 
strong you know what I mean so I think
it's<00:02:17.560> time<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:17.860> trim<00:02:18.580> this<00:02:18.730> mess<00:02:18.970> up<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.390> make

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480
