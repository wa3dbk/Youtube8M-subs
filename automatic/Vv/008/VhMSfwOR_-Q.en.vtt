00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
I underestimate that burst power you can

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.550 
I underestimate that burst power you can
get<00:01:23.000> out<00:01:23.119> from<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.330> park<00:01:23.570> down<00:01:23.720> silent<00:01:24.229> he

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
get out from the park down silent he

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.870 
get out from the park down silent he
does<00:01:24.770> have<00:01:24.920> these<00:01:25.070> girl<00:01:25.250> that<00:01:25.430> still<00:01:25.640> wasn't

does have these girl that still wasn't
enough<00:01:26.149> damage<00:01:26.780> well<00:01:27.259> actually<00:01:27.409> I<00:01:27.680> think<00:01:27.860> if

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
enough damage well actually I think if

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.380 
enough damage well actually I think if
he<00:01:28.250> gets<00:01:28.430> free<00:01:28.610> our<00:01:28.729> money<00:01:28.970> that's<00:01:29.210> called

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
he gets free our money that's called

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.300 
he gets free our money that's called
eventual<00:01:29.840> he<00:01:30.200> was<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.439> body's<00:01:30.770> elusive<00:01:31.159> in

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
eventual he was the body's elusive in

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.490 
eventual he was the body's elusive in
but<00:01:31.580> then<00:01:31.700> he<00:01:31.790> died<00:01:31.970> before<00:01:32.170> no<00:01:33.170> our<00:01:33.320> voice
