00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
slid clean up the leader about a meter

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.080 
slid clean up the leader about a meter
away<00:02:01.409> from<00:02:01.679> the<00:02:01.770> fish<00:02:01.979> oh<00:02:02.310> that's<00:02:02.849> a<00:02:02.939> great

now<00:02:29.730> how<00:02:29.910> we<00:02:29.970> actually<00:02:30.180> fish<00:02:30.510> these<00:02:30.810> plastics

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
now how we actually fish these plastics

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.960 
now how we actually fish these plastics
as<00:02:31.410> we<00:02:31.560> throw<00:02:31.739> them<00:02:31.920> as<00:02:32.010> close<00:02:32.280> as<00:02:32.489> we<00:02:32.640> can<00:02:32.819> to

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
as we throw them as close as we can to

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.400 
as we throw them as close as we can to
the<00:02:33.000> bank<00:02:33.269> or<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.450> structure<00:02:33.930> we're<00:02:34.049> fishing

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
the bank or the structure we're fishing

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.020 
the bank or the structure we're fishing
and<00:02:34.769> actually<00:02:35.190> flick<00:02:35.519> them<00:02:35.609> across<00:02:35.790> the

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
and actually flick them across the

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.119 
and actually flick them across the
surface<00:02:36.269> it's<00:02:36.690> quite<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.930> fast<00:02:37.260> action<00:02:37.560> rod<00:02:37.739> tip

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
surface it's quite a fast action rod tip

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.800 
surface it's quite a fast action rod tip
in<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.370> air<00:02:38.519> and<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:39.120> actually<00:02:39.239> work<00:02:39.599> them

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
in the air and you actually work them

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.839 
in the air and you actually work them
across<00:02:40.079> like<00:02:40.319> a<00:02:40.349> skipping<00:02:40.650> or<00:02:41.069> fleeing<00:02:41.459> prawn

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
across like a skipping or fleeing prawn

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.670 
across like a skipping or fleeing prawn
and<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.599> brim<00:02:42.780> come<00:02:43.019> up<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.260> in<00:02:43.349> goal<00:02:43.530> from

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
and the brim come up and in goal from

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.120 
and the brim come up and in goal from
really<00:02:44.489> really<00:02:44.519> good<00:02:44.910> technique<00:02:45.299> to<00:02:45.329> use<00:02:46.130> so

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
really really good technique to use so

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.440 
really really good technique to use so
that's<00:02:47.280> what<00:02:47.519> you<00:02:47.609> want<00:02:47.730> with<00:02:47.910> your<00:02:47.940> plastic

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
that's what you want with your plastic

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.879 
that's what you want with your plastic
so<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.750> can<00:02:48.900> sit<00:02:49.079> on<00:02:49.139> the<00:02:49.319> surface<00:02:49.500> like<00:02:49.859> that

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
so it can sit on the surface like that

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.270 
so it can sit on the surface like that
and<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:51.090> doesn't<00:02:51.269> sink<00:02:51.769> so<00:02:52.769> like<00:02:52.950> that's<00:02:53.069> got

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
and it doesn't sink so like that's got

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.650 
and it doesn't sink so like that's got
the<00:02:53.370> light<00:02:53.549> gauge<00:02:53.790> where<00:02:54.060> I'm<00:02:54.150> hooking<00:02:54.389> it<00:02:54.480> if

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
the light gauge where I'm hooking it if

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.900 
the light gauge where I'm hooking it if
I<00:02:54.780> had<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.079> deeper<00:02:55.950> one<00:02:56.099> as<00:02:56.579> soon<00:02:56.730> as<00:02:56.819> you

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
I had the deeper one as soon as you

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.490 
I had the deeper one as soon as you
break<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.090> water<00:02:57.329> surface<00:02:57.810> she<00:02:58.109> starts<00:02:58.410> to

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
break the water surface she starts to

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.420 
break the water surface she starts to
sink<00:02:58.880> there<00:02:59.880> to<00:03:00.000> get<00:03:00.120> him<00:03:01.040> so<00:03:02.040> when<00:03:02.190> you<00:03:02.280> come

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
sink there to get him so when you come

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.759 
sink there to get him so when you come
up<00:03:02.549> to<00:03:02.579> a<00:03:02.730> pontoon<00:03:03.180> like<00:03:03.419> this<00:03:03.569> basically<00:03:04.200> you

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
up to a pontoon like this basically you

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.650 
up to a pontoon like this basically you
want<00:03:04.919> to<00:03:04.980> put<00:03:05.099> a<00:03:05.130> cast<00:03:05.400> in<00:03:05.669> either<00:03:05.910> end<00:03:06.359> and

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
want to put a cast in either end and

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.990 
want to put a cast in either end and
along<00:03:07.079> the<00:03:07.230> face<00:03:07.410> so<00:03:07.680> we'll<00:03:08.370> put<00:03:08.549> a<00:03:08.579> cast<00:03:08.790> in

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
along the face so we'll put a cast in

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.849 
along the face so we'll put a cast in
this<00:03:09.120> ends<00:03:09.359> here<00:03:09.540> we<00:03:09.810> go<00:03:09.989> we<00:03:10.560> don't<00:03:10.650> get

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
this ends here we go we don't get

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:26.130 
this ends here we go we don't get
anything<00:03:11.010> will<00:03:11.910> move<00:03:12.090> along<00:03:12.329> the<00:03:12.510> pontoon

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.449 

come<00:03:26.740> on

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
come on

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:37.500 
come on
yeah<00:03:29.420> god<00:03:29.689> that's<00:03:30.590> that's<00:03:31.040> good<00:03:31.459> bitch<00:03:31.700> hold

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510
