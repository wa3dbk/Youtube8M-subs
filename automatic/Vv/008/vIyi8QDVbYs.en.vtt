00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:20.760
 so now our advantage is ours 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:31.140
 Frank touched and there we give now 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:34.279
 another 500 km and a pinch and then 500 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.279
 take a gram 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.030
 So keeps closing the thermomix 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.890
 and now comes something new tour with the 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.810
 Putty stage work that is called that 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.090
 knife turns once around around 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.880
 right around and always in change 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.690
 Keep the life super airy yeast dough 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.440
 driving the track was all three 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.619
 minutes 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.020
 that is, three minutes to do it again 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:25.039
 to adjust 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:30.110
 Now we're down here just because of that 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:45.710
 cover intrude and now just stop 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:49.390
 then just see the kernel function 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.390
 one that also that the fair stop just 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.100
 that is actually Berlin 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.470
 a bit super written or too 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.470
 in the big ones 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:34.340
 there are now and he just stops 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:39.700
 really all super declared a 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.700
 processed faster and faster 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:49.870
 now as well that shows half an hour 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:52.400
 long in the pot in the meeting or 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.180
 also out and then it would be synonymous 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.180
 later then
