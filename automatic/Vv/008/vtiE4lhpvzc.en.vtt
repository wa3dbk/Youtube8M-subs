00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
down here so I'm going to place my

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.069 
down here so I'm going to place my
iphone<00:01:53.729> 5<00:01:53.970> inside<00:01:55.040> to<00:01:56.040> turn<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.490> on<00:01:57.079> although

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
iphone 5 inside to turn that on although

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.590 
iphone 5 inside to turn that on although
some<00:01:58.259> notifications<00:01:58.890> our<00:01:59.009> Instagram<00:01:59.490> so<00:02:00.390> yeah

the car for the apple logo it's slightly

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.630 
the car for the apple logo it's slightly
I'm<00:02:45.409> not<00:02:45.650> sure<00:02:45.859> if<00:02:45.950> it's<00:02:46.010> slightly<00:02:46.340> off-center

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
I'm not sure if it's slightly off-center

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.380 
I'm not sure if it's slightly off-center
but<00:02:47.420> uh<00:02:47.750> it<00:02:48.620> may<00:02:48.890> need<00:02:49.190> a<00:02:49.220> bit<00:02:49.489> more<00:02:49.519> massaging

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
but uh it may need a bit more massaging

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.080 
but uh it may need a bit more massaging
but<00:02:51.319> really<00:02:51.889> cool<00:02:52.069> the<00:02:52.220> car<00:02:52.430> is<00:02:52.700> slightly

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
but really cool the car is slightly

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.690 
but really cool the car is slightly
thick<00:02:53.659> so<00:02:54.079> do<00:02:54.590> beware<00:02:54.889> when<00:02:55.010> placing<00:02:55.459> it<00:02:55.519> down

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
thick so do beware when placing it down

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.699 
thick so do beware when placing it down
it<00:02:56.030> is<00:02:56.780> going<00:02:56.959> to<00:02:57.049> be<00:02:57.079> slightly<00:02:57.440> off<00:02:57.680> the

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
it is going to be slightly off the

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.140 
it is going to be slightly off the
ground<00:02:58.010> but<00:02:58.159> that<00:02:58.280> makes<00:02:58.400> it<00:02:58.519> easier<00:02:58.849> to<00:02:58.909> pick

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
ground but that makes it easier to pick

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.210 
ground but that makes it easier to pick
up<00:02:59.359> you've<00:02:59.870> got<00:02:59.989> a<00:03:00.019> black<00:03:00.290> cut<00:03:00.620> out<00:03:00.769> there<00:03:00.980> for

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
up you've got a black cut out there for

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.190 
up you've got a black cut out there for
your<00:03:01.280> camera<00:03:02.209> so<00:03:02.450> you're<00:03:02.659> not<00:03:02.870> going<00:03:03.049> to<00:03:03.139> get

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
your camera so you're not going to get

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.750 
your camera so you're not going to get
any<00:03:03.349> flashbacks<00:03:03.620> I<00:03:04.010> didn't<00:03:04.190> have<00:03:04.310> any<00:03:04.459> at<00:03:04.549> all

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
any flashbacks I didn't have any at all

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.640 
any flashbacks I didn't have any at all
and<00:03:05.180> then<00:03:05.299> on<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.540> top<00:03:05.720> you've<00:03:06.049> got<00:03:06.079> cutouts

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
and then on the top you've got cutouts

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.550 
and then on the top you've got cutouts
around<00:03:07.069> the<00:03:07.159> side<00:03:07.400> for<00:03:08.209> your<00:03:08.420> you<00:03:08.959> know<00:03:09.109> ports

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
around the side for your you know ports

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.140 
around the side for your you know ports
and<00:03:09.769> that<00:03:09.859> and<00:03:10.040> they<00:03:10.099> all<00:03:10.220> become<00:03:10.519> really

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
and that and they all become really

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.670 
and that and they all become really
really<00:03:11.180> flexible<00:03:11.750> so<00:03:11.930> that's<00:03:12.109> easy<00:03:12.319> to<00:03:12.530> turn

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
really flexible so that's easy to turn

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.789 
really flexible so that's easy to turn
on<00:03:12.859> and<00:03:13.010> off<00:03:13.099> you<00:03:13.700> can<00:03:13.730> hear<00:03:14.000> it<00:03:14.090> bounced<00:03:14.299> and

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
on and off you can hear it bounced and

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.319 
on and off you can hear it bounced and
then<00:03:15.799> on<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.010> side<00:03:16.220> here<00:03:16.639> this<00:03:16.849> is<00:03:16.970> really

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
then on the side here this is really

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:18.879 
then on the side here this is really
cool<00:03:17.449> it's<00:03:17.750> got<00:03:17.780> like<00:03:18.019> a<00:03:18.049> little<00:03:18.139> flap<00:03:18.620> if<00:03:18.799> I

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
cool it's got like a little flap if I

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:21.099 
cool it's got like a little flap if I
can<00:03:19.010> get<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:19.549> show<00:03:19.760> you<00:03:20.030> it's<00:03:20.840> got<00:03:20.959> like<00:03:21.079> a
