00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:14.730
 well it him everyone is 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:16.830
 sir you 17.7 you for a small glitch 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.599
 is also the 2nd glitch on my series of 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.189
 gta 5 bugs W2A consisted how 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.560
 repair his car for free I 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.630
 had said it in the first episode for 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.289
 duplicate this car if we are who is 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.520
 pass to see it 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.130
 it will be in the description 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.990
 So 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.990
 I told you that I will do 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.800
 but who - you saw 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:43.710
 dreamy is doing everything like one of my 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.630
 subscribers see sic I think of all 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:51.500
 doors 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:51.500
 so here is the low bug 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.450
 to say that he spent 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.020
 who smashed it 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.500
 all this 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.500
 and after 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.580
 here 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.070
 that's it for me it's him 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.070
 and 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.220
 it's life that's not at all 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.920
 in truth he will already have that 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.740
 well we would be a little left for after 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.899
 r 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.900
 I 'll be going there you have one that will 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:32.180
 It's not like that 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.180
 in this game you have to 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.640
 jobs 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.610
 2 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.610
 cavaye to yield 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.130
 of the 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.840
 so 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.259
 walfoot 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.259
 we will do 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.590
 go spend enough 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.770
 let's go switcher on franklin I 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.270
 you still take unlocked tremor I 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.310
 know then that's logical then I had a 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.660
 character in multi see below 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.849
 normally I like I have a 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.660
 character in multiplayer but weird 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.610
 weird yes it's not here I hope that 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.500
 there has not been a bug yet and there is 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.239
 a lot of bugs there I find on gta 5 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.090
 there the multiplayer we hope that 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:33.569
 beit mourning 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:37.620
 so I logically drive then 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.480
 is a neighbor state is well repaired 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.980
 you see that it was well smashed 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.780
 thaler and there she is separate I have 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.370
 not 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.590
 it's real it's real and it 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.980
 forgetfulness is repaired 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.980
 so 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.569
 I wanted 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.150
 you speak before for this title 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.989
 you talk about a little thing then 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.989
 already 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.090
 so 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.800
 2 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.970
 for skins episodes on the harbor 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.970
 will be almost railway 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.959
 for the church of Gta 5 I will see after 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.959
 we will prove 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.900
 rozier 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.890
 wwa is also from you 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.380
 you talk about killing 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.650
 France 2 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.650
 free practice 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.250
 slow down the mini cars so I 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.780
 wanted to talk to you about a few days 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:40.890
 his lawyer 5 so then 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.890
 and do something 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.020
 so the principle is actually to 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.940
 send videos 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.310
 so it's not a community channel 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.340
 it's just unlocking that I would like 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.340
 make 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.900
 so actually make falls by 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.900
 dead marc 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.900
 and 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:07.020
 cap of vehicles enough 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:10.350
 spectacular can put that in 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.120
 make top 5 top 10 so we would 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.040
 the waters 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.090
 or I'll do it myself 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.980
 some 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.980
 true myself other times the child 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.270
 to be exiled 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.930
 see how I chose the feet 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.610
 the 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.480
 when you 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.230
 that's it for those who took them 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.740
 after what will leave the pen to which 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:36.120
 first 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.120
 gibert pouting rankings and rank 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.540
 ah yes also another thing another one 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.910
 times here I am aboard an elegy 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.560
 then the cottages a rare car on the 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.400
 crowd who would like 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.400
 drink it 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:55.279
 may be able to do a little 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.889
 here 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.290

 am goals and I agree with you I 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:22.810
