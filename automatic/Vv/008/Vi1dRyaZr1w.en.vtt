of it just plug in zero simple for
advantage<00:01:10.200> let's<00:01:10.920> move<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.900> this<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.020> how<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
advantage let's move it this is how the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.620 
advantage let's move it this is how the
exterior<00:01:14.130> looks<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:15.240> can<00:01:15.479> see<00:01:16.250> it<00:01:17.250> is

40<00:01:25.250> packing<00:01:26.250> seems<00:01:26.750> quite<00:01:27.860> good<00:01:30.320> and<00:01:31.320> say<00:01:32.030> okay

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:53.749 

let's<00:01:49.079> just<00:01:49.439> play<00:01:49.680> with<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.950> out<00:01:52.460> all<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.490> its

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
let's just play with it out all of its

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.950 
let's just play with it out all of its
case<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.899> one<00:01:55.110> out<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.680> out<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.960> this

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
case this is one out of out of it this

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.420 
case this is one out of out of it this
is<00:01:58.250> next<00:01:59.250> year<00:02:00.469> awkward<00:02:01.469> which<00:02:01.649> day's<00:02:04.430> thang

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
is next year awkward which day's thang

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.139 
is next year awkward which day's thang
like<00:02:05.759> an<00:02:06.119> s7<00:02:06.600> power<00:02:07.020> production<00:02:07.409> field<00:02:08.149> over

50<00:02:22.390> flights<00:02:22.720> auto<00:02:23.200> shutdown<00:02:23.909> so<00:02:24.909> it<00:02:25.030> has<00:02:25.150> one

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
50 flights auto shutdown so it has one

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.330 
50 flights auto shutdown so it has one

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.059 
two three four five six seven eight
pieces<00:02:27.909> of<00:02:28.120> safety<00:02:28.629> the<00:02:28.950> left<00:02:29.950> side<00:02:30.099> as<00:02:30.250> well

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
pieces of safety the left side as well

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.360 
pieces of safety the left side as well
ok<00:02:33.069> so<00:02:33.129> let's<00:02:33.519> the<00:02:33.700> main<00:02:33.879> thing<00:02:34.120> come<00:02:34.299> out<00:02:35.370> okay

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
ok so let's the main thing come out okay

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.990 
ok so let's the main thing come out okay
so<00:02:36.730> this<00:02:37.090> is<00:02:37.299> a<00:02:37.410> debug<00:02:38.410> this<00:02:38.799> example<00:02:39.129> move<00:02:39.849> it

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
so this is a debug this example move it

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.270 
so this is a debug this example move it
off<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:41.250> power<00:02:42.250> bank<00:02:42.489> i<00:02:42.790> use<00:02:43.239> a<00:02:43.269> normal<00:02:44.280> course

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
off the power bank i use a normal course

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.960 
off the power bank i use a normal course
of<00:02:45.489> things<00:02:45.989> to<00:02:46.989> do<00:02:47.140> and<00:02:47.170> not<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.530> do<00:02:47.769> so<00:02:48.160> this<00:02:48.730> is

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
of things to do and not to do so this is

of things to do and not to do so this is
basically<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:49.959> inside<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.769> box<00:02:51.569> let<00:02:52.569> go

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
basically it inside the box let go

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:00.960 
basically it inside the box let go
quitting<00:02:54.459> time<00:02:54.790> Gus<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:55.840> may<00:02:56.109> be<00:02:56.170> out<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:59.970> it

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
quitting time Gus it may be out so it

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.089 
quitting time Gus it may be out so it
feels<00:03:01.209> really<00:03:01.959> amazing<00:03:03.359> and<00:03:04.359> the<00:03:05.230> body<00:03:05.470> is<00:03:05.680> 3d
