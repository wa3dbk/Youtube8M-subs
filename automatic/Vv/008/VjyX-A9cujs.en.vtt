the<00:00:33.060> truck<00:00:33.300> over<00:00:33.630> here<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.870> like<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.560> main

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
the truck over here I like the main

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.220 
the truck over here I like the main
concern<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.760> find<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.210> right<00:00:36.600> angle<00:00:36.870> of

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
concern is to find the right angle of

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.940 
concern is to find the right angle of
the<00:00:37.469> truck

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
the truck

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.650 
the truck
is<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.280> possible<00:00:38.700> head<00:00:38.910> like<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.210> turn<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
is it possible head like to turn the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.959 
is it possible head like to turn the
back<00:00:39.870> when<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.100> done<00:00:41.280> there<00:00:41.579> will<00:00:41.699> be<00:00:41.730> no

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
back when that is done there will be no

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.340 
back when that is done there will be no
motion<00:00:42.329> at<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.570> camera<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.199> key

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
motion at the camera that is the key

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.069 
motion at the camera that is the key
element<00:00:43.500> as<00:00:43.829> well<00:00:44.010> no<00:00:44.699> motion<00:00:45.239> at<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.660> camera

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
element as well no motion at the camera

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.139 
element as well no motion at the camera
so<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.739> will<00:00:46.980> do<00:00:47.160> all<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.489> features<00:00:47.789> from<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
so I will do all the features from the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.060 
so I will do all the features from the
computer<00:00:48.690> with<00:00:48.870> gay<00:00:49.109> capture<00:00:49.559> one<00:00:49.820> and<00:00:50.820> stop

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.369 

when<00:00:55.670> I<00:00:55.699> showed<00:00:55.969> the<00:00:56.120> agency<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:56.899> location

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
when I showed the agency the location

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.380 
when I showed the agency the location
image<00:00:57.800> that<00:00:58.309> was<00:00:58.429> water<00:00:58.699> all<00:00:58.969> over<00:00:59.000> the

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
image that was water all over the

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.840 
image that was water all over the
asphalt<00:00:59.839> so<00:01:00.440> they<00:01:00.710> prove<00:01:01.010> that<00:01:01.039> kind<00:01:01.489> of<00:01:01.609> image

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
asphalt so they prove that kind of image

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.970 
asphalt so they prove that kind of image
with<00:01:02.149> lots<00:01:02.480> of<00:01:02.600> water<00:01:02.809> so<00:01:02.929> it's<00:01:03.230> lots<00:01:03.559> of<00:01:03.710> shine

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
with lots of water so it's lots of shine

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.010 
with lots of water so it's lots of shine
on<00:01:04.220> the<00:01:04.460> asphalt<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:07.420> final<00:01:08.420> image<00:01:08.689> of<00:01:08.869> the

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
on the asphalt the final image of the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.160 
on the asphalt the final image of the
truck<00:01:09.320> will<00:01:09.590> be<00:01:09.619> made<00:01:10.490> of<00:01:10.670> several<00:01:11.270> exposures

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
truck will be made of several exposures

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.800 
truck will be made of several exposures
I<00:01:12.649> would<00:01:12.830> guess<00:01:13.100> around<00:01:13.369> maybe<00:01:14.299> thirty<00:01:14.720> or

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
I would guess around maybe thirty or

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.529 
I would guess around maybe thirty or
forty<00:01:15.200> different<00:01:15.350> images<00:01:16.220> so<00:01:17.000> we<00:01:17.149> start<00:01:17.390> from

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
forty different images so we start from

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.990 
forty different images so we start from
the<00:01:17.750> back<00:01:17.869> and<00:01:18.049> then<00:01:18.140> we<00:01:18.289> go<00:01:18.470> out<00:01:18.789> along<00:01:19.789> the

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
the back and then we go out along the

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.180 
the back and then we go out along the
side<00:01:20.210> and<00:01:20.479> then<00:01:20.869> we<00:01:21.140> is<00:01:21.259> ending<00:01:21.799> in<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:21.920> front

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
side and then we is ending in the front

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.680 
side and then we is ending in the front
and<00:01:22.369> then<00:01:22.490> I<00:01:22.520> have<00:01:22.670> to<00:01:22.789> put<00:01:22.909> light<00:01:23.119> underneath

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
and then I have to put light underneath

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.570 
and then I have to put light underneath
the<00:01:23.930> wheels<00:01:24.200> as<00:01:24.350> well<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:24.830> we're<00:01:25.310> gonna<00:01:25.460> be

here<00:01:45.170> to<00:01:45.679> get<00:01:45.830> a<00:01:45.860> feeling<00:01:46.190> out<00:01:46.310> of<00:01:46.549> the<00:01:46.850> light

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
here to get a feeling out of the light

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.180 
here to get a feeling out of the light
and<00:01:47.179> the<00:01:47.750> reflection<00:01:48.229> of<00:01:48.319> the<00:01:48.500> chrome<00:01:48.979> and

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
and the reflection of the chrome and

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.760 
and the reflection of the chrome and
stuff<00:01:49.369> we<00:01:49.610> just<00:01:49.640> noticed<00:01:50.119> that<00:01:50.179> we<00:01:50.509> need<00:01:50.770> more

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
stuff we just noticed that we need more

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.550 
stuff we just noticed that we need more
power<00:01:51.979> in<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.369> lamp<00:01:52.580> so<00:01:53.330> with<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.140> Profoto

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
power in the lamp so with the Profoto

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.410 
power in the lamp so with the Profoto
duty<00:01:55.039> a<00:01:55.069> plugin<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:55.549> capture<00:01:55.850> one<00:01:56.000> is<00:01:56.119> pretty

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
duty a plugin to capture one is pretty

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.270 
duty a plugin to capture one is pretty
easy<00:01:56.479> just<00:01:56.720> to<00:01:57.020> turn<00:01:57.259> off<00:01:57.409> the<00:01:57.530> light<00:01:57.740> directly

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
easy just to turn off the light directly

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.609 
easy just to turn off the light directly
in<00:01:58.549> the<00:01:58.789> software<00:01:59.179> five<00:01:59.899> years<00:02:00.080> ago<00:02:00.259> we<00:02:00.470> would

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
in the software five years ago we would

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:01.990 
in the software five years ago we would
have<00:02:00.649> chosen<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.160> use<00:02:01.190> maybe<00:02:01.580> two<00:02:01.819> or<00:02:01.970> three

I<00:02:42.560> can<00:02:42.890> control<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.580> contrast<00:02:44.209> by<00:02:44.540> moving<00:02:44.989> the

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
I can control the contrast by moving the

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.059 
I can control the contrast by moving the
buges<00:02:45.709> closer<00:02:46.220> or<00:02:46.550> away<00:02:47.150> from<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.510> truck<00:02:48.069> we
