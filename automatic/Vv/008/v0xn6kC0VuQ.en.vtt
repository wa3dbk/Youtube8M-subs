these billy cans are pretty famous and

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.880 
these billy cans are pretty famous and
for<00:00:36.720> good<00:00:36.840> reason<00:00:37.200> they're<00:00:37.380> they're<00:00:37.710> awesome

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
for good reason they're they're awesome

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.580 
for good reason they're they're awesome
pots<00:00:38.250> until<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.760> use<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.150> one<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.360> lot<00:00:39.590> there's

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
pots until I use this one a lot there's

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.040 
pots until I use this one a lot there's
always<00:00:40.770> one<00:00:41.100> big<00:00:41.370> complaint<00:00:41.880> about<00:00:42.239> these<00:00:42.780> and

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
always one big complaint about these and

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.660 
always one big complaint about these and
that<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.920> poor<00:00:44.160> inaudible

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
that is that is poor inaudible

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.160 
that is that is poor inaudible
especially<00:00:45.300> when<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.540> got<00:00:46.040> boiling<00:00:47.040> liquids

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
especially when you got boiling liquids

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.720 
especially when you got boiling liquids
as<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.470> can<00:00:49.620> see<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.129> bail<00:00:50.340> swings

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
as you can see that the bail swings

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.270 
as you can see that the bail swings
freely<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:52.290> can't<00:00:52.559> just<00:00:52.739> pour<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.100> way

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
freely and you can't just pour this way

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.820 
freely and you can't just pour this way
and<00:00:53.960> usually<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.140> can't<00:00:55.379> really<00:00:55.559> touch<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
and usually you can't really touch the

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.010 
and usually you can't really touch the
bottom<00:00:56.340> here<00:00:56.550> because<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:57.360> always<00:00:57.809> full<00:00:57.960> of

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
bottom here because it's always full of

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.270 
bottom here because it's always full of
something<00:00:58.440> hot<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.830> other<00:00:58.949> other

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
something hot and the other other

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.890 
something hot and the other other
problem<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.790> is<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.180> ends<00:01:00.420> up<00:01:00.480> putting

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
problem is is that it ends up putting

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.650 
problem is is that it ends up putting
your<00:01:01.019> hand<00:01:01.290> directly<00:01:02.010> over<00:01:02.460> all<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.970> water

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
your hand directly over all the water

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.450 
your hand directly over all the water
vapor<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.170> rising<00:01:04.500> which<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.739> very<00:01:04.979> hot

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
vapor is rising which is very hot

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.370 
vapor is rising which is very hot
I<00:01:05.489> was<00:01:05.910> thinking<00:01:06.500> from<00:01:07.500> Patrick<00:01:08.009> clip<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.910> here

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
I was thinking from Patrick clip on here

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.660 
I was thinking from Patrick clip on here
that<00:01:10.380> we're<00:01:10.500> stuck<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.950> side<00:01:11.160> I<00:01:11.399> had

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
that we're stuck on the side I had

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.190 
that we're stuck on the side I had
honestly<00:01:11.850> have<00:01:12.270> no<00:01:12.479> idea<00:01:12.810> what<00:01:12.960> they're<00:01:13.110> all

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
honestly have no idea what they're all

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.490 
honestly have no idea what they're all
about<00:01:13.229> oh<00:01:14.000> my<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.270> popped<00:01:15.600> mine<00:01:15.869> off<00:01:16.080> before

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
about oh my I popped mine off before

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.590 
about oh my I popped mine off before
they<00:01:16.680> before<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.759> even<00:01:17.880> wash<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.420> thing

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
they before I even wash the thing

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.660 
they before I even wash the thing
because<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.960> just<00:01:19.140> knew<00:01:19.290> as<00:01:19.440> clumsy<00:01:19.979> as<00:01:20.160> I<00:01:20.340> am<00:01:20.520> I

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
because I just knew as clumsy as I am I

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.980 
because I just knew as clumsy as I am I
would<00:01:20.700> melt<00:01:20.910> those<00:01:21.060> things<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.509> my<00:01:21.600> electric

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
would melt those things in my electric

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.810 
would melt those things in my electric
stovetop<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.710> there's<00:01:23.070> no<00:01:23.310> way<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.670> was

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
stovetop so there's no way that I was

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.639 
stovetop so there's no way that I was
going<00:01:23.910> to<00:01:23.970> keep<00:01:24.119> those<00:01:24.300> things<00:01:24.539> safe<00:01:25.380> from<00:01:25.530> a

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
going to keep those things safe from a

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.320 
going to keep those things safe from a
campfire<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.340> popped<00:01:26.610> those<00:01:26.789> things<00:01:27.119> off

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
campfire so I popped those things off

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.200 
campfire so I popped those things off
and<00:01:27.780> I've<00:01:28.500> seen<00:01:28.649> other<00:01:28.800> people<00:01:28.890> make<00:01:29.310> little

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
and I've seen other people make little

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.880 
and I've seen other people make little
fancy<00:01:30.630> metal<00:01:30.780> clips<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.350> some<00:01:31.500> other<00:01:31.649> things

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
the easy ways I found a pour out of

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.520 
the easy ways I found a pour out of
these<00:01:57.240> was<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.630> watching<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.050> Ramirez

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
these was just watching the Ramirez

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.740 
these was just watching the Ramirez
video<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.179> often<00:02:00.179> when<00:02:00.300> you<00:02:00.360> watch<00:02:00.509> his

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750

video and often when you watch his
videos<00:02:01.080> one<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.619> interesting<00:02:01.979> things<00:02:02.220> is

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
videos one of the interesting things is

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:04.249 
videos one of the interesting things is
is<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.880> see<00:02:03.209> him<00:02:03.300> do<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.539> lot<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.899> stuff<00:02:04.080> but

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
is you see him do a lot of stuff but

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.150 
is you see him do a lot of stuff but
you're<00:02:04.380> never<00:02:04.500> really<00:02:04.709> going<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:04.979> get

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
you're never really going to get

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.969 
you're never really going to get
in-depth<00:02:06.030> explanation<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.709> ended<00:02:07.860> up

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
in-depth explanation so so I ended up

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.380 
in-depth explanation so so I ended up
seeing<00:02:08.160> them<00:02:08.340> doing<00:02:08.490> those<00:02:08.729> four<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.119> out<00:02:09.240> of

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
seeing them doing those four and out of

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.530 
seeing them doing those four and out of
the<00:02:09.450> pot<00:02:09.709> like<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:11.240> and<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:13.790> so<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:15.090> looks

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
the pot like this and and so it looks

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.750 
the pot like this and and so it looks
rather<00:02:15.660> easy<00:02:16.020> seems<00:02:16.500> seems<00:02:16.920> pretty<00:02:17.220> pretty

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
rather easy seems seems pretty pretty

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.240 
rather easy seems seems pretty pretty
simple<00:02:18.060> pretty<00:02:18.510> obvious<00:02:19.050> even<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:20.069> maybe

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
simple pretty obvious even and it maybe

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.530 
simple pretty obvious even and it maybe
isn't<00:02:20.459> something<00:02:20.670> everybody<00:02:21.120> knows<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.450> I'm

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
isn't something everybody knows and I'm

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.910 
isn't something everybody knows and I'm
just<00:02:21.660> slow<00:02:21.870> which<00:02:22.020> is<00:02:22.200> which<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.800> quite

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
just slow which is which is quite

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.740 
just slow which is which is quite
possible<00:02:23.489> but<00:02:23.550> it's<00:02:24.060> what<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.239> did<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:24.480> after

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
possible but it's what I did is after

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.360 
possible but it's what I did is after
seeing<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:25.080> video<00:02:25.200> as<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.620> went<00:02:25.770> back<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.099> just

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
seeing that video as I went back to just

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.280 
seeing that video as I went back to just
at<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.730> kitchen<00:02:26.880> sink<00:02:27.239> play<00:02:27.510> around<00:02:27.750> with<00:02:27.930> 15

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
at the kitchen sink play around with 15

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.339 
at the kitchen sink play around with 15
20<00:02:28.709> minutes<00:02:29.010> trying<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.310> do<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:30.349> after

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
20 minutes trying to do it and after

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.960 
20 minutes trying to do it and after
about<00:02:31.590> 20<00:02:31.890> minutes<00:02:31.920> my<00:02:32.250> wife<00:02:32.400> comes<00:02:32.610> over<00:02:32.880> is

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
about 20 minutes my wife comes over is

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:33.950 
about 20 minutes my wife comes over is
like<00:02:33.150> yes

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
like yes

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.750 
like yes
it's<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.110> pot<00:02:34.350> what<00:02:34.620> are<00:02:34.710> you<00:02:34.770> doing<00:02:35.130> you<00:02:35.640> know

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
it's a pot what are you doing you know

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.660 
it's a pot what are you doing you know
so<00:02:36.090> kind<00:02:36.660> of<00:02:36.750> silly<00:02:36.930> but<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:38.040> concept<00:02:38.490> is

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
so kind of silly but it the concept is

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.340 
so kind of silly but it the concept is
you<00:02:38.880> know<00:02:39.210> instead<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.510> trying<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.810> pour<00:02:40.110> in

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
you know instead of trying to pour in

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.900 
you know instead of trying to pour in
the<00:02:40.770> direction<00:02:41.040> where<00:02:41.250> this<00:02:41.430> thing<00:02:41.610> swings

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
the direction where this thing swings

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.080 
the direction where this thing swings
freely<00:02:42.180> if<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.020> tip<00:02:43.200> this<00:02:43.350> thing<00:02:43.410> up<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.880> bail

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
freely if you tip this thing up the bail

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.470 
freely if you tip this thing up the bail
is<00:02:45.120> is<00:02:45.690> supporting<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.610> Billy<00:02:47.610> now<00:02:48.180> if<00:02:48.360> I

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
is is supporting the Billy now if I

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.750 
is is supporting the Billy now if I
rotate<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.170> handle<00:02:49.470> counterclockwise<00:02:49.760> the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
rotate the handle counterclockwise the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.000 
rotate the handle counterclockwise the
tips<00:02:50.970> that<00:02:51.150> way<00:02:51.300> I<00:02:51.540> rotate<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:52.410> clockwise<00:02:52.560> the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
tips that way I rotate it clockwise the

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.170 
tips that way I rotate it clockwise the
tips<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.280> way<00:02:54.260> so<00:02:55.260> so<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.250> can<00:02:56.520> both<00:02:56.670> pick

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
tips that way so so you can both pick

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.960 
tips that way so so you can both pick
the<00:02:57.360> can<00:02:57.570> up<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:58.020> by<00:02:58.890> rotating<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.550> bail<00:02:59.730> you

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
the can up and by rotating the bail you

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.380 
the can up and by rotating the bail you
can<00:03:00.150> control<00:03:00.510> which<00:03:00.690> way<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:00.930> swings<00:03:03.590> so<00:03:05.390> if

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
can control which way it swings so if

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.640 
can control which way it swings so if
I'm<00:03:06.540> going<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:06.750> pour<00:03:06.930> out<00:03:07.050> of<00:03:07.080> this<00:03:07.260> instead<00:03:07.590> of

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
I'm going to pour out of this instead of

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.640 
I'm going to pour out of this instead of
trying<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.130> do<00:03:08.360> like<00:03:09.360> this<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:09.960> deal<00:03:10.440> with<00:03:10.530> the

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
trying to do like this and deal with the

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.960 
trying to do like this and deal with the
hot<00:03:10.800> steam<00:03:11.040> my<00:03:11.220> hand<00:03:11.490> and<00:03:11.610> playing<00:03:11.790> at<00:03:11.880> the

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
hot steam my hand and playing at the

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.200 
hot steam my hand and playing at the
bottom<00:03:12.300> I'm<00:03:12.870> going<00:03:13.020> to<00:03:13.080> stick<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.320> up<00:03:14.210> rotate

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
bottom I'm going to stick it up rotate

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.120 
bottom I'm going to stick it up rotate
it<00:03:15.330> a<00:03:15.360> little<00:03:15.390> bit<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.780> get<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.990> tilt<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.470> pour

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
it a little bit to get the tilt and pour

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.150 
it a little bit to get the tilt and pour
right<00:03:17.310> over<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.640> handle<00:03:18.000> I<00:03:18.920> can<00:03:19.920> show<00:03:20.100> you

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
right over the handle I can show you

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.900 
right over the handle I can show you
that<00:03:20.340> on<00:03:20.580> foot<00:03:21.200> so<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.290> just<00:03:22.380> pick<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:22.590> up<00:03:22.910> get

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
that on foot so you just pick it up get

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:24.860 
that on foot so you just pick it up get
it<00:03:23.940> about<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.300> where<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.510> water<00:03:24.630> is<00:03:24.720> coming

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
it about to where the water is coming

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.240 
it about to where the water is coming
out<00:03:25.050> give<00:03:25.320> a<00:03:25.350> little<00:03:25.500> bit<00:03:25.620> of<00:03:25.680> twist<00:03:25.920> to<00:03:26.070> get<00:03:26.190> it

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
out give a little bit of twist to get it

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
out give a little bit of twist to get it
the<00:03:26.340> way<00:03:26.430> you<00:03:26.460> want<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:29.060> pour<00:03:30.060> it<00:03:30.120> right<00:03:30.210> over

the way you want it pour it right over
the<00:03:30.570> handle<00:03:31.550> now<00:03:32.550> if<00:03:33.330> you<00:03:33.450> want<00:03:33.630> a<00:03:33.690> little<00:03:33.870> bit

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
the handle now if you want a little bit

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.860 
the handle now if you want a little bit
more<00:03:34.170> control<00:03:35.180> and<00:03:36.180> what<00:03:36.360> that<00:03:36.540> has<00:03:36.690> I

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
more control and what that has I

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.070 
more control and what that has I
mentioned<00:03:37.230> when<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:38.250> pour<00:03:38.550> this<00:03:38.700> way<00:03:39.080> you

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
mentioned when you pour this way you

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.470 
mentioned when you pour this way you
know<00:03:40.220> trying<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.250> deal<00:03:41.940> with<00:03:42.060> this<00:03:42.210> with<00:03:42.390> the

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
know trying to deal with this with the

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.270 
know trying to deal with this with the
stick<00:03:42.720> is<00:03:42.870> way<00:03:43.290> too<00:03:43.350> heavy<00:03:43.680> there's<00:03:43.950> just<00:03:44.160> too

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
stick is way too heavy there's just too

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.470 
stick is way too heavy there's just too
much<00:03:44.400> volume<00:03:44.670> and<00:03:44.910> they're<00:03:45.000> trying<00:03:45.240> to<00:03:45.270> poke<00:03:45.450> a

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
much volume and they're trying to poke a

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.210 
much volume and they're trying to poke a
stick<00:03:45.750> at<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.960> bottom<00:03:46.020> but<00:03:46.740> when<00:03:46.860> you<00:03:46.950> have<00:03:47.100> it

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
stick at the bottom but when you have it

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.650 
stick at the bottom but when you have it
up<00:03:47.310> this<00:03:47.490> way<00:03:47.700> you<00:03:48.210> really<00:03:48.390> don't<00:03:48.540> need<00:03:48.600> to

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
up this way you really don't need to

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.520 
up this way you really don't need to
support<00:03:48.990> the<00:03:49.140> weight<00:03:49.260> you're<00:03:49.380> already

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
support the weight you're already

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.630 
support the weight you're already
holding<00:03:49.740> the<00:03:49.890> weight<00:03:50.040> so<00:03:50.190> if<00:03:50.280> you<00:03:50.370> do<00:03:50.490> happen

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
holding the weight so if you do happen

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.980 
holding the weight so if you do happen
to<00:03:50.760> have<00:03:50.820> a<00:03:50.970> stick<00:03:51.150> you<00:03:51.180> can<00:03:51.330> stabilize<00:03:51.810> it

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
to have a stick you can stabilize it

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.050 
to have a stick you can stabilize it
