in the back not that far field but this

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.539 
in the back not that far field but this
this<00:03:52.290> hump<00:03:52.560> on<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.830> other<00:03:52.980> side<00:03:53.160> of<00:03:53.190> this<00:03:53.280> hump

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
this hump on the other side of this hump

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.850 
this hump on the other side of this hump
there's<00:03:54.209> a<00:03:54.330> fence<00:03:54.540> there<00:03:54.810> goes<00:03:55.320> along<00:03:55.590> and

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
there's a fence there goes along and

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.340 
there's a fence there goes along and
then<00:03:56.549> there's<00:03:56.760> a<00:03:56.820> mode<00:03:57.030> spot<00:03:57.390> here<00:03:57.720> and<00:03:58.230> then

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
then there's a mode spot here and then

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.750 
then there's a mode spot here and then
it<00:03:58.470> goes<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:58.830> it<00:03:58.920> cuts<00:03:59.100> in<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.340> front<00:03:59.580> there

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
it goes and it cuts in the front there

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.420 
it goes and it cuts in the front there
so<00:04:00.180> you<00:04:00.239> have<00:04:00.269> you<00:04:00.989> have<00:04:01.170> just<00:04:01.920> 40<00:04:02.190> foot<00:04:02.340> of

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
so you have you have just 40 foot of

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.880 
so you have you have just 40 foot of
frontage<00:04:02.730> in<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:02.940> front<00:04:03.230> this<00:04:04.230> long<00:04:04.500> driveway
