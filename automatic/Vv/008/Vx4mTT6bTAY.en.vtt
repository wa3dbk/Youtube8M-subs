i<00:02:38.400> have<00:02:38.519> to<00:02:38.610> say<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.760> these<00:02:39.000> buttons<00:02:39.269> are

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360

think this speaker is really good for

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.949 
think this speaker is really good for
the<00:02:47.459> 40-pound<00:02:47.849> price<00:02:48.090> tag<00:02:48.329> it<00:02:48.540> definitely

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
the 40-pound price tag it definitely

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.860 
the 40-pound price tag it definitely
packs<00:02:49.379> a<00:02:49.620> lot<00:02:49.709> of<00:02:50.129> sound<00:02:50.400> for<00:02:50.700> its<00:02:50.879> price<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.629> is

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
packs a lot of sound for its price it is

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.020 
packs a lot of sound for its price it is
a<00:02:51.900> very<00:02:52.230> very<00:02:52.500> loud<00:02:52.680> speaker<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:53.519> does<00:02:53.790> have

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
a very very loud speaker it does have

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.970 
a very very loud speaker it does have
quite<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.659> nice<00:02:54.870> base<00:02:55.139> but<00:02:55.440> obviously<00:02:55.709> with<00:02:55.920> a

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
quite a nice base but obviously with a

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.009 
quite a nice base but obviously with a
base<00:02:56.159> head<00:02:56.370> like<00:02:56.639> myself<00:02:56.879> I<00:02:57.239> would<00:02:57.629> like<00:02:57.810> that

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
base head like myself I would like that

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.809 
base head like myself I would like that
a<00:02:58.200> little<00:02:58.349> bit<00:02:58.590> more<00:02:58.799> and<00:02:59.040> I<00:02:59.250> think<00:02:59.280> elevate

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
a little bit more and I think elevate

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.550 
a little bit more and I think elevate
could<00:03:00.030> do<00:03:00.180> that<00:03:00.359> or<00:03:00.569> maybe<00:03:00.959> their<00:03:01.230> next

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
could do that or maybe their next

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.289 
could do that or maybe their next

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
really nice i like how there is the kind

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.430 
really nice i like how there is the kind
of<00:03:05.609> corrugated<00:03:05.940> metal<00:03:06.299> mesh<00:03:06.840> across<00:03:07.290> the
