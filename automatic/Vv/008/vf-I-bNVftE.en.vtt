00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.230
 I would like to tell them what 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.890
 martelly in other words grant human resources did not mean 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.760
 since it immediately took place hat low back hat at the time 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.160
 the passport and his colleagues from the ump al 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.650
 according to the spokesperson the city of dieppe 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.720
 certainly part of an observation remains to protect themselves while they try to you 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.609
 to say is that he will dismiss massively 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.140
 at the arrival 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.409
 halak 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.270
 it's like that since May 6 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.190
 his humor 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.190
 m 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.240
 or not 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.370
 the euro 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.429
 these three weeks 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:56.760
 Furthermore 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.970
 tonio what are you doing here no it's not just physical 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.600
 one of the stones in the public square 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.310
 however with his rates I am rather by his colleagues our 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.190
 goal to all 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.410
 their know-how coderre all the other kilometers with her it's 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.040
 inaction 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.160
 a victory the office door couple i can tell 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.700
 it's actually a normal draw 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.500
 a boy like in the beginning 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.830
 indeed it is what he did 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.290
 and what do you want 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.160
 we must be in solidarity with the past half of his sentence 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.070
 crisis you have to know how to make sacrifices 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.070
 so you can also put an end to the longest conflict 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.040
 otherwise it's an aggression 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.630
 otherwise why m 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.090
 we see the unfortunate obligations 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.090
 have to put an end to your own 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.980
 especially see 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.980
 there was something meaningful that I do not know 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.110
 yet it's because I want I think it's a plus 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.160
 is that we start playing you're there for the ps he's called plans are 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.490
 not at all 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.490
 did not want us to do that, I invite you 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.239
 hello german 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.609
 and I beg that we get to know a little less formal way 

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:21.879
 the number of accidents 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.779
 it does it you were or then implement the global published in the 

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:28.779
 cloud 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.420
 for him there is no longer a single solution to follow renault he is well 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.059
 sure j 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:38.709

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.379
 well nan 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.339
 he case anyway if we manage to reconcile work and good humor 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.659
 delicious little bit for something 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.659
 but that's part of the little job in 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:59.619
 the goal is to reconcile precarious conditions of synergies 

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:00.499
 costs and gains 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:03.319
 question of doing studies made from time to time 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.200
 per month 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.200
 he responds I could not see the beauty look baba 

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:13.199
 orange from around the world 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.019
 we are preparing for everything I am super proud 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.059
 the mother 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:26.709
 this is the message that a call for precarious young people has made, because in fact 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:27.739
 at the water's edge 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.359
 Yes this 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.149
 it's starting from you 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:34.219

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:35.059

 before leaving from the moment when it's grazing it's my first day of the week to 

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:41.909
 the mosque of orange mosque in the country 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.879
 the sector is that you are well and that's why this system the middle 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.879
 alain the date of the fight not the time to get to know 

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:52.529
 smoke daaf

 investigation
