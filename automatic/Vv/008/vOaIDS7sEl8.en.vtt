[Music]

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.120 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.390 

we're<00:00:09.120> going<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.480> complete<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.559> measured

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
we're going to complete a measured

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.999 
we're going to complete a measured
perspective<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.300> this<00:00:12.719> simple<00:00:13.530> height<00:00:13.710> shape

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
perspective of this simple height shape

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.180 
perspective of this simple height shape
now<00:00:15.000> first<00:00:15.330> thing<00:00:15.540> we<00:00:15.660> want<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.929> do<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.500> draw<00:00:16.920> in

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
now first thing we want to do is draw in

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.390 
now first thing we want to do is draw in
the<00:00:17.609> ground<00:00:17.850> line<00:00:18.680> that's<00:00:19.680> going<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:19.949> be<00:00:20.070> the

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
the ground line that's going to be the

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.450 
the ground line that's going to be the
basis<00:00:21.029> for<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.840> elevation<00:00:22.380> views<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:23.100> ground

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
basis for the elevation views so ground

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.029 
basis for the elevation views so ground
line<00:00:23.640> goes<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:24.029> first<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.830> after<00:00:25.830> we've<00:00:26.010> done

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
line goes on first and after we've done

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.450 
line goes on first and after we've done
the<00:00:26.490> ground<00:00:26.730> line<00:00:26.939> we're<00:00:27.689> going<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.840> put<00:00:28.050> on

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
the ground line we're going to put on

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:36.860 
the ground line we're going to put on
the<00:00:29.460> picture<00:00:29.789> plane<00:00:30.000> line

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.780 

now<00:00:37.440> once<00:00:37.650> we've<00:00:37.770> got<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:37.950> pitch<00:00:38.250> plane<00:00:38.550> line

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
now once we've got that pitch plane line

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.000 
now once we've got that pitch plane line
in<00:00:39.000> what<00:00:39.270> we<00:00:39.450> want<00:00:39.630> to<00:00:39.720> do<00:00:39.840> then<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.320> think

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
in what we want to do then is think

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.840 
in what we want to do then is think
about<00:00:41.580> the<00:00:42.030> horizon<00:00:42.600> line<00:00:42.810> now<00:00:43.560> we've<00:00:44.220> got<00:00:44.460> a

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
about the horizon line now we've got a

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.700 
about the horizon line now we've got a
horizon<00:00:45.480> line<00:00:45.510> above<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.050> head<00:00:46.350> ship<00:00:46.559> which

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
horizon line above the head ship which

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.400 
horizon line above the head ship which
means<00:00:46.950> we're<00:00:47.100> looking<00:00:47.130> down<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.790> it<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.720> from

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
means we're looking down on it so from

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.799 
means we're looking down on it so from
the<00:00:49.680> eye<00:00:49.890> level<00:00:50.190> line<00:00:50.550> we're<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:51.660> going<00:00:51.780> to

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
the eye level line we're just going to

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.070 
the eye level line we're just going to
draw<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.200> line<00:00:52.500> straight<00:00:53.370> across<00:00:53.960> with<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
draw a line straight across with the

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.530 
draw a line straight across with the
horizon<00:00:55.350> line<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.640> our<00:00:56.850> vanishing<00:00:57.180> points

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
horizon line that our vanishing points

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.080 
horizon line that our vanishing points
will<00:00:57.660> be<00:00:57.720> placed<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.440> that's<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:59.090> horizon

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
will be placed on so that's the horizon

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.350 
will be placed on so that's the horizon
line

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.730 

once<00:01:06.360> we've<00:01:06.510> completed<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:07.140> we're<00:01:07.500> going<00:01:07.680> to

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
once we've completed that we're going to

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.260 
once we've completed that we're going to
draw<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.950> plan<00:01:08.280> which<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.700> we'll<00:01:08.909> be<00:01:08.940> touching

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
draw the plan which is we'll be touching

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.780 
draw the plan which is we'll be touching
the<00:01:09.780> picture<00:01:10.110> plane<00:01:10.350> now<00:01:11.130> we<00:01:11.190> can<00:01:11.370> do<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.640> at

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
the picture plane now we can do that at

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.320 
the picture plane now we can do that at
60<00:01:12.300> degrees<00:01:12.770> 30<00:01:13.770> degrees<00:01:13.920> or<00:01:14.580> we're<00:01:15.210> actually

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
60 degrees 30 degrees or we're actually

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.090 
60 degrees 30 degrees or we're actually
going<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.600> be<00:01:15.690> doing<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.080> for<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.860> particular

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
going to be doing it for this particular

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.120 
going to be doing it for this particular
drawing<00:01:17.610> at<00:01:17.940> 45<00:01:18.720> degrees<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.680> we've<00:01:19.860> got<00:01:20.010> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
drawing at 45 degrees so we've got the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.150 
drawing at 45 degrees so we've got the
plan<00:01:20.369> drawn<00:01:20.700> there<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.710> that's<00:01:22.710> where<00:01:23.010> we

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
plan drawn there and that's where we

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.290 
plan drawn there and that's where we
start<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.580> drawing<00:01:23.790> with<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.479> plan<00:01:26.060> now<00:01:27.060> next

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
start the drawing with the plan now next

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.520 
start the drawing with the plan now next
thing<00:01:27.420> we<00:01:27.600> need<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.780> do<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.110> we<00:01:28.229> need<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.380> get

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
thing we need to do is we need to get

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.260 
thing we need to do is we need to get
some<00:01:28.710> Heights<00:01:28.950> on<00:01:29.190> for<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.850> we're<00:01:30.030> going<00:01:30.180> to

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
some Heights on for that we're going to

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.800 
some Heights on for that we're going to
draw<00:01:30.570> an<00:01:30.810> elevation<00:01:31.729> now<00:01:32.729> I'll<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:32.910> put<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
draw an elevation now I'll just put the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.070 
draw an elevation now I'll just put the
block<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.440> end<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:35.160> here<00:01:35.580> and<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:36.020> will<00:01:37.020> give

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
block on end on here and that will give

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.139 
block on end on here and that will give
us<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.530> Heights<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.979> we<00:01:38.130> need<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.640> there

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
us the Heights that we need and there

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.600 
us the Heights that we need and there
we've<00:01:39.360> got<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:40.560> elevation

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.760 

their<00:01:45.240> next<00:01:45.630> step<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:46.050> to<00:01:46.200> think<00:01:46.380> about<00:01:46.590> where

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
their next step is to think about where

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.040 
their next step is to think about where
the<00:01:46.860> station<00:01:47.130> point<00:01:47.580> is<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.420> station<00:01:48.840> point

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
the station point is the station point

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.770 
the station point is the station point
is<00:01:49.200> where<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> observer<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.250> positioned<00:01:51.120> when

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
is where the observer is positioned when

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.050 
is where the observer is positioned when
they're<00:01:52.200> looking<00:01:52.620> at<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:53.070> view<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.790> block

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
they're looking at the view of the block

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.660 
they're looking at the view of the block
so<00:01:54.750> I'm<00:01:55.080> going<00:01:55.230> to<00:01:55.260> position<00:01:55.650> the<00:01:56.280> station

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
so I'm going to position the station

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.500 
so I'm going to position the station
point<00:01:56.910> here<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:58.250> for<00:01:59.250> accuracy<00:01:59.730> we<00:02:00.330> need<00:02:00.420> to

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
point here and for accuracy we need to

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.380 
point here and for accuracy we need to
markets<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.200> we'll<00:02:01.800> mark<00:02:02.010> it<00:02:02.190> with<00:02:02.400> an<00:02:03.030> exact

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
markets and we'll mark it with an exact

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.620 
markets and we'll mark it with an exact
point<00:02:03.720> with<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.350> cross<00:02:06.350> now<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.410> station<00:02:08.070> point

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
point with a cross now the station point

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.990 
point with a cross now the station point
we<00:02:09.630> draw<00:02:09.960> parallel<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.190> block<00:02:11.430> this<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:11.850> a

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
we draw parallel to the block this is a

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.320 
we draw parallel to the block this is a
45<00:02:12.540> degrees<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:13.700> then<00:02:14.700> what<00:02:14.880> we<00:02:14.970> can<00:02:15.090> do<00:02:15.209> is

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
45 degrees and then what we can do is

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.820 
45 degrees and then what we can do is
project<00:02:15.720> down<00:02:15.900> where<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.380> touches<00:02:16.709> the

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
project down where that touches the

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.220 
project down where that touches the
picture<00:02:17.160> plane<00:02:17.400> onto<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:18.540> horizon<00:02:18.690> line

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
picture plane onto the horizon line

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.490

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
picture plane because what we're

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.259 
picture plane because what we're
actually<00:02:53.700> doing<00:02:53.880> is<00:02:55.160> we're<00:02:56.160> drawing<00:02:56.549> the<00:02:56.880> view

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
actually doing is we're drawing the view

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.050 
actually doing is we're drawing the view
that<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.200> observer<00:02:58.560> sees<00:02:58.950> on<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.370> picture

now<00:03:04.019> what<00:03:04.860> we're<00:03:04.980> going<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.190> do<00:03:05.340> now<00:03:05.549> is<00:03:05.730> going

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
now what we're going to do now is going

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.150 
now what we're going to do now is going
to<00:03:06.000> project<00:03:06.150> down<00:03:06.690> from<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.440> first<00:03:07.680> part

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
to project down from the first part

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.830 
to project down from the first part
block<00:03:08.549> the<00:03:08.730> leading<00:03:09.090> edge<00:03:09.239> which<00:03:09.269> is<00:03:09.660> touching

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
block the leading edge which is touching

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.720 
block the leading edge which is touching
the<00:03:10.110> picture<00:03:10.410> plane<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.890> we<00:03:11.280> can<00:03:11.430> get<00:03:11.610> the

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
the picture plane and we can get the

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.330 
the picture plane and we can get the
Heights<00:03:11.940> off<00:03:12.180> that<00:03:12.480> so<00:03:13.380> I'm<00:03:13.530> just<00:03:13.560> projecting

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
Heights off that so I'm just projecting

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.729 
Heights off that so I'm just projecting
across<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:15.480> height<00:03:15.720> of<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:15.989> building<00:03:16.380> or<00:03:16.620> the

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
across the height of the building or the

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:17.710 
across the height of the building or the
block

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
block

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.810 
block
and<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:18.110> height<00:03:18.350> where<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.280> wall<00:03:19.460> starts

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
and the height where the wall starts

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.300 
and the height where the wall starts
touching<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.660> roof<00:03:20.840> then<00:03:21.710> from<00:03:22.010> there<00:03:22.190> I'm

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
touching the roof then from there I'm

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.550 
touching the roof then from there I'm
going<00:03:22.460> to<00:03:22.520> draw<00:03:22.850> from<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.810> vanishing<00:03:24.020> point

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
going to draw from the vanishing point

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.010 
going to draw from the vanishing point
those<00:03:25.400> are<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:25.730> heights<00:03:26.030> of<00:03:26.270> that<00:03:26.780> wall

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
those are the heights of that wall

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.820 
those are the heights of that wall
leading<00:03:27.950> off<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.250> left<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:29.360> heights

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
leading off to the left and the heights

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.660 
leading off to the left and the heights
leading<00:03:30.830> off<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.280> right<00:03:31.490> as<00:03:31.820> well<00:03:33.670> okay

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
leading off to the right as well okay

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.820 
leading off to the right as well okay
next<00:03:34.910> thing<00:03:35.120> to<00:03:35.240> do<00:03:35.360> I'm<00:03:35.600> going<00:03:35.990> to<00:03:36.140> project

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
next thing to do I'm going to project

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.940 
next thing to do I'm going to project
down<00:03:37.340> from<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.030> picture<00:03:38.330> plane<00:03:38.590> where<00:03:39.590> the

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
down from the picture plane where the

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.700 
down from the picture plane where the
back<00:03:40.160> wall<00:03:40.460> is<00:03:40.760> located<00:03:41.360> then<00:03:42.170> what<00:03:42.380> I'm<00:03:42.470> going

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
back wall is located then what I'm going

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.770 
back wall is located then what I'm going
to<00:03:42.770> do<00:03:42.950> after<00:03:43.160> that<00:03:43.310> is<00:03:43.670> project<00:03:44.120> the<00:03:44.480> height

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
to do after that is project the height

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.600 
to do after that is project the height
over<00:03:45.020> to<00:03:45.350> the<00:03:45.440> right<00:03:45.620> and<00:03:45.860> then<00:03:46.130> I<00:03:46.160> can<00:03:46.460> get

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
over to the right and then I can get

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.100 
over to the right and then I can get
with<00:03:46.850> a<00:03:46.880> point<00:03:47.180> on<00:03:47.300> the<00:03:47.420> roof<00:03:47.600> is<00:03:47.780> again

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
with a point on the roof is again

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.810 
with a point on the roof is again
projecting<00:03:48.740> down<00:03:48.860> from<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.250> picture<00:03:49.610> plane

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
projecting down from the picture plane

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.730 
projecting down from the picture plane
not<00:03:50.810> from<00:03:51.110> the<00:03:51.290> actual<00:03:51.670> plan<00:03:53.230> so<00:03:54.230> what<00:03:54.620> I<00:03:54.650> can

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
not from the actual plan so what I can

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.600 
not from the actual plan so what I can
do<00:03:54.950> now<00:03:55.160> is<00:03:55.190> I<00:03:55.430> can<00:03:55.640> darken<00:03:56.180> in<00:03:56.330> that<00:03:57.200> end<00:03:58.130> of

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
do now is I can darken in that end of

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.400 
do now is I can darken in that end of
the<00:03:58.670> house<00:03:58.910> that<00:03:59.270> gives<00:03:59.390> us<00:03:59.570> that<00:03:59.720> detail<00:04:00.200> so

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
the house that gives us that detail so

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.770 
the house that gives us that detail so
again<00:04:01.340> we've<00:04:01.520> got<00:04:01.550> the<00:04:01.790> heights<00:04:02.090> that<00:04:02.660> are

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
again we've got the heights that are

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.520 
again we've got the heights that are
being<00:04:03.170> projected<00:04:03.350> back

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
being projected back

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.780 
being projected back
and<00:04:06.530> then<00:04:06.770> I<00:04:06.830> can<00:04:06.980> just<00:04:07.160> finish<00:04:07.310> off<00:04:07.610> that

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
and then I can just finish off that

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.510 
and then I can just finish off that
detail<00:04:08.210> with<00:04:08.570> the<00:04:08.810> slope<00:04:09.320> of<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.560> roof<00:04:09.680> now

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
detail with the slope of the roof now

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.630 
detail with the slope of the roof now
projecting<00:04:11.270> back<00:04:11.480> we've<00:04:11.780> got<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:12.080> point<00:04:12.640> now

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
projecting back we've got the point now

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.820 
projecting back we've got the point now
so<00:04:13.910> we<00:04:14.000> can<00:04:14.180> project<00:04:14.300> that<00:04:14.540> back<00:04:14.900> and<00:04:15.140> then<00:04:15.710> we

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
so we can project that back and then we

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.370 
so we can project that back and then we
can<00:04:16.010> take<00:04:16.239> the<00:04:17.239> point<00:04:17.540> at<00:04:17.720> the<00:04:17.840> very<00:04:18.109> back<00:04:18.350> of

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
can take the point at the very back of

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.140 
can take the point at the very back of
the<00:04:18.650> roof<00:04:18.799> there<00:04:19.070> as<00:04:19.250> well<00:04:19.430> projecting<00:04:19.970> down

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
the roof there as well projecting down

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.530 
the roof there as well projecting down
again<00:04:20.690> from<00:04:21.380> where<00:04:21.640> detail<00:04:22.640> is<00:04:22.910> on<00:04:22.940> the

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
again from where detail is on the

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.220 
again from where detail is on the
picture<00:04:23.840> plane<00:04:24.050> and<00:04:24.670> finally<00:04:26.110> finishing<00:04:27.110> off

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
picture plane and finally finishing off

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.110 
picture plane and finally finishing off
the<00:04:27.380> detail<00:04:27.710> just<00:04:28.070> and<00:04:28.250> darker<00:04:28.580> pen<00:04:28.820> so<00:04:29.090> that

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
the detail just and darker pen so that

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.850 
the detail just and darker pen so that
it's<00:04:29.960> easier<00:04:30.590> to<00:04:30.620> see<00:04:30.950> on<00:04:31.160> screen<00:04:31.910> and<00:04:32.860> that's

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
it's easier to see on screen and that's

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.180 
it's easier to see on screen and that's
pretty<00:04:34.250> much<00:04:34.520> it<00:04:34.820> for<00:04:35.830> completing<00:04:36.830> if<00:04:37.070> you

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
pretty much it for completing if you

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.040 
pretty much it for completing if you
like<00:04:37.370> this<00:04:38.050> this<00:04:39.050> of<00:04:39.350> course<00:04:39.410> is<00:04:39.860> called<00:04:40.310> a

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
like this this of course is called a

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.090 
like this this of course is called a
prospective<00:04:42.050> elevation<00:04:44.590> right<00:04:45.590> just<00:04:45.919> to

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
prospective elevation right just to

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.450 
prospective elevation right just to
recap<00:04:46.610> what<00:04:47.330> we've<00:04:47.480> been<00:04:47.570> doing<00:04:47.990> and<00:04:48.250> let's<00:04:49.250> go

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
recap what we've been doing and let's go

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.850 
recap what we've been doing and let's go
back<00:04:49.669> and<00:04:49.940> look<00:04:50.210> at<00:04:50.390> the<00:04:51.169> observer<00:04:51.500> looking

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
back and look at the observer looking

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.010 
back and look at the observer looking
from<00:04:52.010> a<00:04:52.100> station<00:04:52.550> point<00:04:52.820> and<00:04:53.060> what<00:04:53.900> the

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
from a station point and what the

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.650 
from a station point and what the
observer<00:04:54.350> is<00:04:54.560> doing<00:04:54.890> is<00:04:55.070> looking<00:04:55.700> at<00:04:56.480> this

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
observer is doing is looking at this

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.930 
observer is doing is looking at this
block<00:04:56.900> here<00:04:57.260> and<00:04:57.440> it<00:04:58.220> just<00:04:58.250> want<00:04:58.580> to<00:04:58.640> go<00:04:58.820> over

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
block here and it just want to go over

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.970 
block here and it just want to go over
the<00:04:59.120> fact<00:04:59.419> that<00:04:59.720> the<00:05:00.350> picture<00:05:00.740> plane

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
the fact that the picture plane

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.260 
the fact that the picture plane
imaginary<00:05:01.760> plane<00:05:02.110> sits<00:05:03.520> vertically<00:05:04.520> in<00:05:04.820> front

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
imaginary plane sits vertically in front

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.260 
imaginary plane sits vertically in front
of<00:05:05.840> the<00:05:06.020> plan<00:05:06.260> like<00:05:06.530> that<00:05:06.560> and<00:05:07.130> the<00:05:07.940> observer

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
of the plan like that and the observer

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.060 
of the plan like that and the observer
looking<00:05:08.690> at<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.140> picture<00:05:09.470> plane<00:05:09.680> what<00:05:09.919> he

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
looking at the picture plane what he

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.580 
looking at the picture plane what he
sees<00:05:10.340> is<00:05:10.910> what<00:05:10.970> we've<00:05:11.270> just<00:05:11.479> drawn<00:05:11.810> which<00:05:12.350> is

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
sees is what we've just drawn which is

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:30.470 
sees is what we've just drawn which is
that<00:05:13.120> prospective<00:05:14.440> elevation<00:05:15.440> of<00:05:15.650> the<00:05:16.520> block
