00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
last week I said that I'm still young

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.559 
last week I said that I'm still young
enough<00:00:04.620> that<00:00:04.920> if<00:00:05.160> I<00:00:05.250> wanted<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:05.850> I<00:00:05.879> could<00:00:06.330> climb

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
enough that if I wanted to I could climb

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:07.639 
enough that if I wanted to I could climb
Mount<00:00:06.930> Everest

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
Mount Everest

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.620 
Mount Everest
obviously<00:00:08.220> not<00:00:08.309> tomorrow<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:09.059> have<00:00:09.360> nothing

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
obviously not tomorrow I have nothing

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.180 
obviously not tomorrow I have nothing
like<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.900> skills<00:00:10.200> or<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.530> fitness<00:00:10.889> and

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
like the skills or the fitness and

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.740 
like the skills or the fitness and
anywhere<00:00:11.519> but<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.730> drinks<00:00:12.059> due<00:00:12.210> in<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.450> evening

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
anywhere but a drinks due in the evening

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.660 
anywhere but a drinks due in the evening
I<00:00:12.900> mean<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.590> could<00:00:13.740> probably<00:00:13.860> push<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.400> back<00:00:14.639> a

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
I mean I could probably push it back a

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.400 
I mean I could probably push it back a
bit<00:00:14.969> but<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.330> gather<00:00:15.509> climbing<00:00:16.109> Mount<00:00:16.289> Everest

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
bit but I gather climbing Mount Everest

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.980 
bit but I gather climbing Mount Everest
is<00:00:16.770> generally<00:00:17.130> an<00:00:17.220> all-day<00:00:17.609> thing<00:00:17.840> but<00:00:18.840> my

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
is generally an all-day thing but my

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.320 
is generally an all-day thing but my
point<00:00:19.380> was<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:20.100> if<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.310> had<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.550> certain<00:00:20.910> sort

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
point was that if I had a certain sort

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.359 
point was that if I had a certain sort
of<00:00:21.449> midlife<00:00:21.810> crisis<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.500> reckon<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:22.949> could<00:00:23.100> still

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
of midlife crisis I reckon I could still

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.310 
of midlife crisis I reckon I could still
acquire<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.880> skills<00:00:24.180> do<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.720> training<00:00:24.990> and

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
acquire the skills do the training and

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.040 
acquire the skills do the training and
climb<00:00:25.830> Mount<00:00:26.189> Everest<00:00:26.539> after<00:00:27.539> all<00:00:27.660> anyone

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
climb Mount Everest after all anyone

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.359 
climb Mount Everest after all anyone
seems<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.380> be<00:00:28.439> able<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.619> climb<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:28.920> these<00:00:29.099> days

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
seems to be able to climb in these days

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.060 
seems to be able to climb in these days

toddlers<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.120> can<00:00:33.660> only<00:00:33.780> put<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.110> fact<00:00:34.290> that

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
toddlers I can only put the fact that

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.979 
toddlers I can only put the fact that
Everest<00:00:34.770> was<00:00:34.890> not<00:00:35.040> climbed<00:00:35.340> until<00:00:35.610> 1953<00:00:36.270> down

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
Everest was not climbed until 1953 down

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.470 
Everest was not climbed until 1953 down
to<00:00:37.290> rightful<00:00:37.800> indifference<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.550> mean<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.149> can't

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
to rightful indifference I mean I can't

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.660 
to rightful indifference I mean I can't
see<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.780> point<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.260> it's<00:00:41.040> shrouded<00:00:41.340> in

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
see the point of it it's shrouded in

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.970 
see the point of it it's shrouded in
cloud<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.780> suppose<00:00:43.050> that's<00:00:43.320> why<00:00:43.620> people<00:00:43.829> are

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
cloud so I suppose that's why people are

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.020 
cloud so I suppose that's why people are
interested<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.399> climb<00:00:44.700> it

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
interested to climb it

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.970 
interested to climb it
there's<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.719> tallest<00:00:46.170> thing<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.500> world<00:00:46.710> I

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
there's the tallest thing in the world I

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.440 
there's the tallest thing in the world I
wonder<00:00:47.309> if<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.489> can<00:00:47.610> get<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.910> top<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.329> not

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
wonder if I can get to the top and not

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.299 
wonder if I can get to the top and not
die<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.320> bet<00:00:49.590> there's<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.890> hell<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.280> view

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
die and I bet there's a hell of a view

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.400 
die and I bet there's a hell of a view
of<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:51.329> other<00:00:51.480> side<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:51.989> cloud<00:00:52.170> that's

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
of the other side of the cloud that's

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.830 
of the other side of the cloud that's
obscuring<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.039> summit<00:00:53.340> it's<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.420> natural

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
obscuring the summit it's a natural

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.540 
obscuring the summit it's a natural
human<00:00:55.050> impulse<00:00:55.199> though<00:00:55.739> not<00:00:55.949> one<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.160> share

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
human impulse though not one I share

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.240 
human impulse though not one I share
what<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.180> cannot<00:00:57.780> understand<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.559> why<00:00:58.800> people

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
what I cannot understand is why people

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.209 
what I cannot understand is why people
run<00:00:59.489> marathons<00:00:59.960> why<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.350> difficult<00:01:01.890> but

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
run marathons why is the difficult but

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.910 
run marathons why is the difficult but
unnecessary<00:01:02.699> act<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.510> jogging<00:01:03.870> 26<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> bit

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
unnecessary act of jogging 26 and a bit

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.940 
unnecessary act of jogging 26 and a bit
miles<00:01:05.159> accorded<00:01:06.060> special<00:01:06.180> reverence<00:01:06.720> why<00:01:07.619> if

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
miles accorded special reverence why if

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.980 
miles accorded special reverence why if
you<00:01:08.250> wanted<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.850> whatever<00:01:09.119> personal<00:01:09.600> reasons

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
you wanted for whatever personal reasons

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.120 
you wanted for whatever personal reasons
to<00:01:10.140> prove<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.500> yourself<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.860> can<00:01:10.979> do

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
to prove to yourself you can do

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.890 
to prove to yourself you can do
something<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.610> difficult<00:01:11.850> would<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.600> choose

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
something so difficult would you choose

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.660 
something so difficult would you choose
to<00:01:13.110> do<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.770> midst<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.100> tens<00:01:14.430> of

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
to do it in the midst of tens of

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.550 
to do it in the midst of tens of
thousands<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.150> others<00:01:15.450> doing<00:01:15.900> exactly<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
thousands of others doing exactly the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.410 
thousands of others doing exactly the
same<00:01:16.770> thing<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.220> thus<00:01:17.700> graphically

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
same thing and thus graphically

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.359 
same thing and thus graphically
demonstrating<00:01:19.020> how<00:01:19.170> unremarkable<00:01:19.890> you're

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
demonstrating how unremarkable you're

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.210 
demonstrating how unremarkable you're
nonetheless<00:01:20.640> exhausting<00:01:21.540> feat<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.350> what

nonetheless exhausting feat is and what

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.219 
nonetheless exhausting feat is and what
is<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.580> connection<00:01:23.850> between<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.420> deciding

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
is the connection between you deciding

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.600 
is the connection between you deciding
you<00:01:25.320> want<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.590> get<00:01:25.710> fit<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.310> particular

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
you want to get fit in this particular

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.929 
you want to get fit in this particular
way<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.150> me<00:01:27.750> giving<00:01:28.290> money<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.619> charity<00:01:28.939> let

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
way and me giving money to charity let

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.969 
way and me giving money to charity let
me<00:01:30.060> make<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.420> clear<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.720> getting<00:01:31.470> fit<00:01:31.770> is

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
me make it clear that getting fit is

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.460 
me make it clear that getting fit is
basically<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.030> good<00:01:33.360> thing<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.840> suppose<00:01:33.900> and

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
basically a good thing I suppose and

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.440 
basically a good thing I suppose and
giving<00:01:34.829> money<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.070> charity<00:01:35.189> certainly<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.240> I

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
giving money to charity certainly is I

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.749 
giving money to charity certainly is I
just<00:01:36.930> don't<00:01:37.290> see<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> connection<00:01:38.070> if<00:01:38.280> you're

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
just don't see the connection if you're
