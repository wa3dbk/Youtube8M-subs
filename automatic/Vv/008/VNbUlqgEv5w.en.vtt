rings<00:01:26.640> which<00:01:27.030> basically<00:01:27.630> increase<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.409> size

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
rings which basically increase the size

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.039 
rings which basically increase the size
of<00:01:28.920> your<00:01:29.009> lens<00:01:29.520> through<00:01:29.729> fish<00:01:30.240> eyes<00:01:30.450> also<00:01:30.810> come

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
of your lens through fish eyes also come

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.719 
of your lens through fish eyes also come
with<00:01:31.080> different<00:01:31.350> levels<00:01:31.830> of<00:01:31.920> distortion<00:01:32.580> and

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
with different levels of distortion and

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.789 
with different levels of distortion and
this<00:01:33.060> will<00:01:33.240> be<00:01:33.299> determined<00:01:33.690> by<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.869> X<00:01:34.259> so

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
this will be determined by the X so

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.100 
this will be determined by the X so
let's<00:01:35.189> say<00:01:35.340> 36<00:01:35.939> x<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.570> would<00:01:36.690> be<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.869> level

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
let's say 36 x that would be the level

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.469 
let's say 36 x that would be the level
of<00:01:37.170> distortion<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.950> gone<00:01:38.190> by<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> fisheye<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.149> have

of distortion I gone by a fisheye I have
