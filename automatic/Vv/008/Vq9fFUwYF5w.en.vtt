 the great musician Wasserturm 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.579
 you have a career 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:19.579
 started 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.490
 yes that already belongs but 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.080
 but I remember exactly 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.080
 that was evening on Thursday 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.650

 they interpret 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.560
 Percent 42 on Thursday but what exactly happened to the day 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.330
 on this day 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.360
 everything is small 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.040
 I have a child for the first time 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.500
 an instrument in the foreign 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.520
 there come 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.020
 pained 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.549
 It is the story is already very exciting in the hands face 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.509
 Instrument that speaks of Needham Percent Cook's father 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.450
 a great musician 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.640
 However, it is not difficult for them, but led percent covered 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.180
 Cornelia the festivities 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.230
 I also big times but also the first communion or was that perhaps 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.569
 her father 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.019
 no lesser 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.710
 as a percent as his father himself 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.700
 also a musician of course 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.700
 Percent in a church played 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:29.979
 who has this instrument in your hands? 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.799
 successful 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.829
 No, nobody was 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.059
 I have this wonderful troop »part 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:40.459
 in the barn that takes time 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.309
 found by Rolf Birkholz 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:45.729
 my god eat-kettwig stories 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:46.459
 there are 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.669
 that's crap DIHK 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.989
 Year of service continues Zepf Anja only 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.400
 Let me think for a moment 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.729
 four years old 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:56.809
 or almost 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:59.809
 four years old the em-second 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.079
 more precisely, Adrian Pracon reports 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.389
 yes I found this troupe and immediately I started to play 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.349
 Unfortunately, I did not know how to do that 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:13.959
 I belonged to it 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.959
 made these noises 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.109
 for three years 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.709
 thanks to percent I have either provided one 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.339
 100 percent 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:32.889
 a volunteer fire department walls Dr Dr has played a similar instrument 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.489
 and percent I tried to take care of the almost Prödl percent 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.699
 yes that took Apple for several years 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:49.699
 when I realized that I was so understaffed 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:55.430
 the exact one in our instrument you have to actually bubbles and not percent 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.289
 her eyes 

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:57.169
 around 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:00.809
 but if I honestly have little idea of ​​music you could hear scraper if I did 

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:02.249
 Here she reports here 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:05.359
 There is a little something missing a dinner trumpet 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:09.719
 her rump percent Philipp Prang mouthpiece 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:11.559
 around 

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:13.899
 because Tom Pettifer is not complete 

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:16.899
 I knew that not all 3 and Ralf Kilgus King 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:20.340
 Percent heard that 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.939
 because trend half-year Schempp 

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:27.499
 but I later bought percent of a mouthpiece percent in the IOC 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.490
 the web is a proof 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.150
 Unfortunately, I was so indulged in Weldon without playing a mouthpiece 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.439
 that with the mouthpiece 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:41.559
 hardly one 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:45.029
 Klaus Kliem 

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:47.110
 but the Irish hardly believe that 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.710
 maybe they can test if the story really is true 7 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:51.939
 with a new piece 

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:56.069
 who can not play because it's probably who out for the music world 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:59.080
 is incredibly unbelievable and credible already fits 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.240
 a 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.690
 smaller medium or maybe a very big sensation 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.819
 of course 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:09.819
 no problem 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:16.949
 not for the APA 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.439
 the 70th 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:21.439
 That really was a sensation because how come you to her 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:25.039
 Beni is a bit modest 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.129
 but these numbers can also 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:32.539
 otherwise trumpets promised no one else to imitate the one in the world 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:34.589
 can 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:36.439
 Well, sometimes with my train 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:38.240
 has adapted 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.460
 and are about like this 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.569
 that really 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:46.649
 it really unbelievable but percent on the ass Thomas Wagner times with me as a guest 

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:50.919
 Percentage of the leading Polish Gersag Percent also heard then 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.479
 even if it is a little euro 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.479
 Blue also determines I have found an instrument 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.330
 also when about three was four 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.570
 I can also and I happen to have it here too 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.570
 APA he answers Duisburg 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:12.819
 what that meant to paint 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:17.829
 more that's just the percent it could turn into the bitter one ahead 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.629
 but why did not you become known 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:24.089
 Reports Michelle 

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:29.000
 I've always tried to get those years with a mouthpiece though 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.860
 I really learned something today and when I learned something 

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:36.990
 an international career is just on the moon piece 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.449
 that's why I think so 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:42.229
 stock market 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:43.469
 much better 

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:46.469
 Lasso play together my composition 

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:50.889
 Percent Samantha 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:52.949
 No, I did not meet 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:55.279
 Percent with them and with animals 

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:57.889
 Online poses 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:01.499
 good reachable from when I'm already with percent of my viewers 

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:04.540
 Wellmann including "Nell" thank you very much for being there 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.840
 Percent turn them back on again next week 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.180
 Hopefully, talking to an interesting person is just as interesting 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.659
 which could be after now we get 

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:16.189
 the Apple COO 

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:18.439
 what does that mean 

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:20.279
 but we can do everything differently
