set up my whole ones week

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.479 
set up my whole ones week
percentage-wise<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:33.030> take<00:00:33.180> 75%<00:00:33.680> 85%<00:00:34.680> 95%

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
percentage-wise is you take 75% 85% 95%

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.130 
percentage-wise is you take 75% 85% 95%
of<00:00:35.550> your<00:00:35.640> training<00:00:35.880> max<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.420> that'll<00:00:36.719> be<00:00:36.840> your
