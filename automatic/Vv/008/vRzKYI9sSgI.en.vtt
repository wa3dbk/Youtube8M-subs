to think this comic was never released
at<00:01:43.979> all<00:01:44.130> maybe<00:01:44.790> what<00:01:45.000> I've<00:01:45.090> got<00:01:45.240> here<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.479> a

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
at all maybe what I've got here is a

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.530 
at all maybe what I've got here is a
