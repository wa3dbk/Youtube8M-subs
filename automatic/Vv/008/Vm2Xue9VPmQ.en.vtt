00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.850
 well today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.430
 new video 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.840
 the first episode of the series on ps2 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.750
 half time I just got it so I have 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.840
 one can camp his camp to get 15 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.660
 euros if you're interested in dso not 15 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.250
 euros so we end up for a small 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.829
 to a small career simply 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.800
 a masters league on ps2 I'm going 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.290
 choose ace monaco or damage 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.079
 serious for tonight and those playing 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.219
 against the EU so go tonight if you 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.500
 see the video pile hair when it comes out 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.789
 you will see that it is directly this 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.050
 evening so you can see that already I 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.649
 will put on the list of transfers 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.350
 you never carvalho I'll put too 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.489
 well city boat we are here I am 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.050
 will put a lot of players after 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.100
 it's true that I do not necessarily have all 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.070
 sales these stories to see 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.010
 maybe the proposals of some 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.229
 clubs to see if if clubs me 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.299
 offers good little history checks 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.250
 to not just see 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.210
 so here I go out a few days 5 g 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.159
 looking for a player but I do not have 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.790
 found unfortunately so I voice 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.320
 still wanted to let go is the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.520
 beginning of the year that this is my 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.170
 first career on psp so I hope 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.939
 than that in this past so to the program 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.110
 of this episode of the show that will have 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.009
 four games so here we go 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.770
 start two sets with a friendly match 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.210
 so just count the benfica 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.159
 so it's going to be a pretty complicated game 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.200
 we start in the 64th minute 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.250
 really illuminates no opportunities this 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.649
 will be simply the one and only 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.509
 occasion of lima who will shoot next 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.689
 it was really the only one 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.450
 wins this match way in this series I 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.369
 you would put almost the goals 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.600
 matches there are still four 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.030
 matches for not his vast role 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.600
 So here's a strong 0-0 match against 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.670
 the benfica 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.649
 here we are going to say that it is because 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.329
 it's the first game of the year 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.850
 teams need it all heats 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.500
 simply no here is a little bird 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.690
 you can see that there has been very little 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.489
 shots in fights that I put 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.440
 pretty little time the match and five 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.970
 minutes it seems to me so you go 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.900
 you can see that siemens joined 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.970
 the team simply so I have 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.680
 recruited the small nugget band of a layman 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.099
 the midfielder even for the 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.140
 genres were afif a career mode 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.310
 barrels be well it's known our 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.079
 ancestor the first day of league 1 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.390
 facing the Bordeaux girondins 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.980
 So here you have to win 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.340
 story to make a good start in 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.440
 this league years so our goal 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.340
 it's to arrive in the first three 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.590
 history of playing the league of champions 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.170
 even if that year we play it already 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.819
 with the monaco ace in the career mode 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.319
 knowing that the first group match 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.870
 you'll have it in the next episode 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.670
 so it starts at the 34th minute 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.310
 levin 15 succeed in staggering motillon 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.079
 mutinho for berbatov berbatov who will 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.389
 to make a little fan of tiric who sees 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.590
 gets into position that will roll and 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.410
 it's just a loaf 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.340
 perfectly curled berbatov who I 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.100
 tell you right now 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.139
 marc his last goal with ace monaco 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.250
 because he's going to see me very soon 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:13.170
 seems like it's at the end of this match 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.910
 precisely who will leave the club 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.739
 it's a step to tell you in which club he 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.139
 will leave because I remember more 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.760
 at all excuse me it's been two days 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.950
 that I shot gameplay shot I got 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.920
 remember more term years but hey we're 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.440
 a little bit we can see the 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.799
 nice enough goal I so you find 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.720
 then in the 67th minute so mauritius 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.280
 belay who will shift czech drama 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.430
 sacd built dribbling a little 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.739
 guardian who shoot on pole and 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.599
 wahbi khazri without these webisodes 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.840
 wahbi khazri who comes to put a small 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:47.750
 flat foot well so it was not very 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.349
 complicated either so that's it's a 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.439
 all over 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.480
 this is the game that is not nothing 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:55.329
 that's one everywhere 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.549
 it's going to be complicated but that and we 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:02.569
 see one everywhere it's not necessarily the 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.680
 ideal score for the first for the 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.230
 first league match 1 so that's it 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.609
 it's on this score that will end this 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.959
 first league match 1 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:11.299
 we are everywhere it is not either 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.040
 a defeat so it stays drinkable I 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:14.150
 want to say 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.009
 we are going to see the statistics 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.430
 in a few moments of this match 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:21.049
 to send still very little pulls three 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.389
 shots everywhere we had possession 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.800
 so here is a man of the match berbatov he 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.630
 I think you can see the results that 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.610
 are just a microphone and for 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.509
 the moment we are tenths but six 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.070
 the start then the second match 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:37.789
 second day of league 1 so that's 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:40.490
 against evian thonon gaillard you class 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:43.070
 it should be years is true enough match 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.050
 easy to predict in so beware 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.760
 just happy to keep the 25th 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.960
 minute that will shift for three months 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.539
 if they will have morning run 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.430
 hawaiki carrasco which is pretty good 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.740
 done on pes besides that will shift 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.970
 so 15 awa and germany valent who 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.620
 replaces vrbata precisely who had 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.830
 left club that just register a 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.020
 beautiful magnificent plated head 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.849
 against the ground a little it was really 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.599
 a head stung a little so it was 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:07.909
 really nice 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:09.349
 the good work of two coaches who 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:11.300
 perfectly shifts kurzawa and who 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:13.729
 returns that really makes a very beautiful 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:17.870
 center and Germanic valency that makes a 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:19.310
 head smatchÃ©e waller then to the 92nd 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.419
 minute bercy the end of the match in a 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.490
 1-0 win 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.440
 yes it is fast are linked 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.010
 really quickly go to the match but 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.330
 we see it's going pretty fast so there is little 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.520
 still so many opportunities 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.630
 sykes tell you again it's because 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.950
 I really put the match time 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.800
 quite short even though I did it anyway 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.760
 eight shots but it was not really 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.660
 disturbing shots 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.430
 I did not dare me so here is a small 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.560
 easy victory frankly it was a 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.560
 controlled match and so sees the money 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.750
 makeup man of the match 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.910
 you can see both presidents at 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.770
 the screen it goes up 6th so for 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.570
 the moment we are in europa league 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.850
 but even if it is that the second 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.320
 day we are at least in europa 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.960
 league 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.940
 So here it is not bad and therefore 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.020
 berbatov leaving the club 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.120
 ai when I told you before, and 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.600
 so danny welbeck who comes on 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.650
 replace 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.750
 so here is a player that 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.730
 I particularly appreciate in the 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.890
 real life you can see the draw at 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.330
 fate of the group stages we 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.980
 are in a group h of the League of 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.990
 champions in photo in a group enough 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.510
 surveyed with bayern munich porto and 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.670
 iceman blah we see it's going to be pretty 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.350
 complicated especially ex bayern and porto 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.610
 in the room is really very 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.470
 complicated so then we go 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.560
 directly chained in front of the 3rd 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:35.650
 league day 1 so this will be against 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:39.080
 the rc lens 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:41.210
 so that's really pretty good with 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.530
 a pretty good goal you'll see so 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.520
 that's right now so who said 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.370
 do bodywork that will shift 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.290
 houellebecq in the 24th minute danny 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.480
 welbeck who goes who wants to do some 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.680
 dribbling really nice enough then he 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.350
 will just get a bow in 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.240
 sky and who will finish at the bottom of the nets 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.840
 a great goal for his first match of 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.250
 high level 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.350
 danny welbeck who is doing the direct 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.900
 difference is with berbatov 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.090
 it was good too but hey it's not 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.500
 everything even if he's two days here danny 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.300
 welbeck who will register his first goal 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.460
 in league 1 while facing the rc lens have 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.680
 believed see appendix and missed a trick is 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.190
 rather you actually in the process 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.540
 frankly 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.030
 his cut is really super well done 

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:20.720
 we can revisit the goal in enough 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:22.670
