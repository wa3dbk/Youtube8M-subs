00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
restore I don't think it did and I

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.990 
restore I don't think it did and I
believe<00:04:24.780> this<00:04:24.960> is<00:04:25.229> new<00:04:25.500> from<00:04:25.800> version<00:04:26.370> 4<00:04:26.639> but

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
believe this is new from version 4 but

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.840 
believe this is new from version 4 but
that's<00:04:27.660> why<00:04:27.900> we<00:04:28.110> downloaded<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.919> utility<00:04:29.550> rec

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
that's why we downloaded the utility rec

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.600 
that's why we downloaded the utility rec
boot<00:04:30.090> that<00:04:30.240> I<00:04:30.360> showed<00:04:30.570> you<00:04:30.600> a<00:04:30.750> few<00:04:30.930> minutes<00:04:31.080> ago

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
also as it was restoring I think you saw

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.370 
also as it was restoring I think you saw
that<00:04:35.280> it<00:04:35.520> showed<00:04:35.820> restoring<00:04:36.449> and<00:04:36.690> verify<00:04:37.169> and

it<00:05:18.240> takes<00:05:18.419> a<00:05:18.510> little<00:05:18.660> while<00:05:18.900> now<00:05:19.710> we<00:05:19.770> can<00:05:20.070> see

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
it takes a little while now we can see

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.420 
it takes a little while now we can see
the<00:05:21.360> phone<00:05:21.539> says<00:05:21.930> the<00:05:22.199> iphone<00:05:22.560> is<00:05:22.590> activated

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
the phone says the iphone is activated

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.279 
the phone says the iphone is activated
so<00:05:23.729> it<00:05:23.970> does<00:05:24.180> that<00:05:24.389> through<00:05:24.419> the<00:05:24.690> computer<00:05:25.020> so

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
so it does that through the computer so

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:26.180 
so it does that through the computer so
make<00:05:25.470> sure<00:05:25.500> you<00:05:25.710> have<00:05:25.860> an<00:05:25.949> internet

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349 
connection before you start all this

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:31.520 
connection before you start all this
process<00:05:28.889> and<00:05:29.449> we<00:05:30.449> can<00:05:30.630> try<00:05:30.840> to<00:05:30.900> do<00:05:31.229> a<00:05:31.260> restore

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
process and we can try to do a restore

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.529 
process and we can try to do a restore
which<00:05:32.310> I<00:05:32.460> don't<00:05:32.520> think<00:05:32.849> George<00:05:33.090> wants<00:05:33.449> to

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539
