one
so<00:02:05.560> let's<00:02:05.710> more<00:02:05.890> of<00:02:05.979> a<00:02:06.039> normal<00:02:06.340> and<00:02:06.460> here's<00:02:06.640> the

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
so let's more of a normal and here's the

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.020 
so let's more of a normal and here's the
heart's<00:02:07.000> not<00:02:07.090> so<00:02:07.360> big<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.860> trick<00:02:09.160> is<00:02:09.369> nice<00:02:09.670> and

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
heart's not so big the trick is nice and

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.330 
heart's not so big the trick is nice and
being<00:02:10.869> in<00:02:11.080> black<00:02:11.319> and<00:02:11.530> white<00:02:11.739> which<00:02:12.130> means

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
being in black and white which means

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.940 
being in black and white which means
it's<00:02:12.550> not<00:02:12.700> constricted<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:14.470> there's<00:02:14.769> less

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
it's not constricted and there's less

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.850 
it's not constricted and there's less
fluid<00:02:15.340> in<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.550> lungs<00:02:15.840> here's<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.930> heart<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.470> you

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
fluid in the lungs here's a heart to you

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.009 
fluid in the lungs here's a heart to you
that's<00:02:18.250> bigger<00:02:18.550> not<00:02:18.970> huge<00:02:19.300> I've<00:02:19.750> seen<00:02:19.959> a

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
that's bigger not huge I've seen a

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.020 
that's bigger not huge I've seen a
bigger<00:02:20.260> you<00:02:20.890> can't<00:02:21.130> see<00:02:21.280> as<00:02:21.340> much<00:02:21.489> black<00:02:21.730> in

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
bigger you can't see as much black in

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.600 
bigger you can't see as much black in
the<00:02:22.120> chest<00:02:22.360> solution<00:02:22.720> as<00:02:22.810> much<00:02:23.019> air<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.610> the

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
the chest solution as much air and the

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.360 
the chest solution as much air and the
trachea<00:02:25.120> is<00:02:25.180> very<00:02:25.900> small<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:26.830> ribbon<00:02:27.190> like

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
trachea is very small and ribbon like

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.320 
trachea is very small and ribbon like
compared<00:02:27.849> to<00:02:28.000> it

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
compared to it

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.830 
compared to it
nice<00:02:28.720> big<00:02:29.019> -<00:02:30.120> so<00:02:31.120> those<00:02:31.239> are<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.480> differences

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
nice big - so those are the differences

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.530 
nice big - so those are the differences
so<00:02:31.989> this<00:02:32.319> is<00:02:32.470> this<00:02:33.040> is<00:02:33.099> mariahs<00:02:33.519> who<00:02:34.120> had<00:02:34.299> the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
so this is this is mariahs who had the

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.750 
so this is this is mariahs who had the
breathing<00:02:34.930> problems<00:02:35.349> and<00:02:35.470> this<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.459> dog

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
breathing problems and this is a dog

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.059 
breathing problems and this is a dog
that's<00:02:37.060> sick<00:02:37.299> but<00:02:37.540> it's<00:02:37.690> lungs<00:02:37.930> are<00:02:38.140> okay<00:02:39.780> so

what's wrong with me I should breathe

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.930 
what's wrong with me I should breathe
like<00:02:43.480> that<00:02:43.720> we're<00:02:44.500> stuck<00:02:44.860> our<00:02:45.340> trachea<00:02:45.670> is

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
like that we're stuck our trachea is

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.319 
like that we're stuck our trachea is
narrow<00:02:46.709> it's<00:02:47.709> collapsing<00:02:48.340> she's<00:02:48.790> got<00:02:49.000> fluid

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
narrow it's collapsing she's got fluid

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.350 
narrow it's collapsing she's got fluid
in<00:02:49.540> her<00:02:50.250> water<00:02:51.250> that<00:02:51.640> shouldn't<00:02:52.000> be<00:02:52.120> in<00:02:52.239> her

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
in her water that shouldn't be in her

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.410 
in her water that shouldn't be in her
lungs<00:02:52.599> or<00:02:52.870> in<00:02:53.019> her<00:02:53.109> lungs<00:02:53.640> her<00:02:54.640> heart<00:02:54.910> might<00:02:55.180> be

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
lungs or in her lungs her heart might be

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.880 
lungs or in her lungs her heart might be
a<00:02:55.769> bit<00:02:56.769> big<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.400> tall<00:02:58.239> and<00:02:58.720> not<00:02:59.200> pumping<00:02:59.709> as

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
a bit big and tall and not pumping as

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.979 
a bit big and tall and not pumping as
well<00:03:00.100> so<00:03:00.430> she's<00:03:00.609> kind<00:03:00.850> of<00:03:00.910> her<00:03:01.540> heart<00:03:01.810> isn't

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
well so she's kind of her heart isn't

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.259 
well so she's kind of her heart isn't
working<00:03:02.440> as<00:03:02.530> well<00:03:02.790> she<00:03:03.790> probably<00:03:03.970> has<00:03:04.239> a

so that's Mariah's abdomen and there's

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.630 
so that's Mariah's abdomen and there's
Mariah's<00:03:36.269> liver<00:03:36.569> and<00:03:37.170> now<00:03:37.920> might<00:03:38.159> be<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.340> touch

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
Mariah's liver and now might be a touch

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.250 
Mariah's liver and now might be a touch
of<00:03:38.819> March<00:03:39.030> because<00:03:39.299> a<00:03:39.330> heart<00:03:39.659> isn't<00:03:39.930> working

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
of March because a heart isn't working

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.630 
of March because a heart isn't working
too<00:03:40.440> good<00:03:40.650> either<00:03:40.920> because<00:03:41.190> usually<00:03:41.370> the

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
too good either because usually the

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.470 
too good either because usually the
corner<00:03:42.000> of<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.209> liver<00:03:42.420> is<00:03:43.080> right<00:03:43.290> about<00:03:43.470> there
