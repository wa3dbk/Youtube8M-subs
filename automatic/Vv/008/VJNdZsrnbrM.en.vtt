the first part is to do the mummy
wrappings<00:00:20.490> which<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.510> decided<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.320> do<00:00:22.710> with<00:00:22.860> a

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
wrappings which I decided to do with a

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.990 
wrappings which I decided to do with a
striped<00:00:23.340> water<00:00:23.670> marble<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:25.279> it<00:00:26.279> took<00:00:26.520> me<00:00:26.730> a

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
striped water marble and it took me a

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.220 
striped water marble and it took me a
while<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.829> figure<00:00:28.829> out<00:00:29.099> what<00:00:29.730> order<00:00:30.239> to<00:00:30.509> drop

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
while to figure out what order to drop

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.030 
while to figure out what order to drop
the<00:00:31.290> polish<00:00:31.860> in<00:00:33.170> so<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.440> really<00:00:34.680> looked

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
the polish in so that it really looked

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.110 
the polish in so that it really looked
like<00:00:35.190> mummy<00:00:35.610> wrappings<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.440> you<00:00:37.440> know<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
like mummy wrappings and you know the

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.370 
like mummy wrappings and you know the
different<00:00:39.120> colors<00:00:39.480> were<00:00:39.720> showing<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
different colors were showing in the

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.850 
different colors were showing in the
amounts<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.130> I<00:00:41.160> wanted<00:00:41.520> them<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.730> show<00:00:41.850> and

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
amounts that I wanted them to show and

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.550 
amounts that I wanted them to show and
so<00:00:43.880> that's<00:00:44.880> why<00:00:45.210> I'm<00:00:45.420> doing<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:46.200> know<00:00:46.350> a

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.490 
so that's why I'm doing you know a
different<00:00:47.160> pattern<00:00:48.060> of<00:00:48.450> drops<00:00:48.810> than<00:00:49.230> just

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
different pattern of drops than just

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.500 
different pattern of drops than just
usual<00:00:50.300> one<00:00:51.300> drop<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.600> each<00:00:51.960> color<00:00:52.380> and<00:00:53.210> it<00:00:54.210> just

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
usual one drop of each color and it just

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.570 
usual one drop of each color and it just
it<00:00:54.810> took<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.080> lot<00:00:55.290> of<00:00:55.440> experimentation<00:00:56.070> each

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
it took a lot of experimentation each

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.300 
it took a lot of experimentation each
different<00:00:57.420> order<00:00:57.840> slightly<00:00:58.770> changed<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 
different order slightly changed the

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.940 
different order slightly changed the
design<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.480> finally<00:01:00.720> decided<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.350> go<00:01:01.770> with

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
design and I finally decided to go with

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.840 
design and I finally decided to go with
this<00:01:02.900> this<00:01:03.900> lightest<00:01:04.470> color<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:05.129> white<00:01:05.489> is

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
this this lightest color this white is

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.800 
this this lightest color this white is
OPI<00:01:06.570> calling<00:01:07.229> all<00:01:07.350> goddesses<00:01:08.329> this<00:01:09.329> kind<00:01:09.659> of

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
OPI calling all goddesses this kind of

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.580 
OPI calling all goddesses this kind of
darker<00:01:10.500> ivory<00:01:11.189> color<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.970> tighten<00:01:12.960> your<00:01:13.110> toga

that's<00:01:14.189> also<00:01:14.700> OPI<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.540> then<00:01:16.469> this<00:01:16.679> brown<00:01:17.100> is

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:17.609 
that's also OPI and then this brown is

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:19.669 
that's also OPI and then this brown is
China<00:01:18.420> Glaze<00:01:18.600> Ingrid

China Glaze Ingrid

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:23.590 
China Glaze Ingrid
and<00:01:20.149> I'm<00:01:21.149> not<00:01:21.329> sure<00:01:21.659> on<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.859> available

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
and I'm not sure on the available

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.059 
and I'm not sure on the available
availability<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.899> either<00:01:25.200> one<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.439> these<00:01:25.590> OPI

00:01:26.059 --> 00:01:26.069 
availability of either one of these OPI

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:28.910 
availability of either one of these OPI
is<00:01:26.189> they're<00:01:26.609> both<00:01:26.819> black<00:01:27.179> label<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:28.530> they<00:01:28.710> are

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
is they're both black label so they are

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.200 
is they're both black label so they are
older<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.079> I<00:01:31.079> think<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.530> either<00:01:31.679> got<00:01:31.950> them<00:01:32.219> as<00:01:32.609> a

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
older and I think I either got them as a

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.160 
older and I think I either got them as a
gift<00:01:33.719> or<00:01:34.020> from<00:01:34.859> like<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.039> nail<00:01:35.340> shop<00:01:35.929> so<00:01:36.929> I'm

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
gift or from like a nail shop so I'm

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.520 
gift or from like a nail shop so I'm
just<00:01:37.350> going<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.799> go<00:01:38.520> up<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.030> top<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.600> down

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
just going to go up to the top and down

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.340 
just going to go up to the top and down
to<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.859> bottom<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:42.139> then<00:01:43.139> I'm<00:01:43.319> just

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
to the bottom and then I'm just

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.989 
to the bottom and then I'm just
literally<00:01:44.130> going<00:01:44.429> to<00:01:44.899> crisscross<00:01:46.369> from<00:01:47.369> one

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:47.999 
literally going to crisscross from one

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:51.940 
literally going to crisscross from one
side<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.479> cup<00:01:48.749> to<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.469> other<00:01:50.030> and

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
side of the cup to the other and

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.239 
side of the cup to the other and
creating<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.219> striped<00:01:53.700> pattern<00:01:54.319> all<00:01:55.319> through

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:56.249 
creating a striped pattern all through

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:00.889 
creating a striped pattern all through
the<00:01:56.399> cup<00:01:56.609> and<00:01:57.799> if<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:59.340> want<00:01:59.549> wider<00:02:00.029> stripes

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
the cup and if you want wider stripes

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.440 
the cup and if you want wider stripes
you<00:02:01.200> basically<00:02:02.100> just<00:02:02.490> don't<00:02:02.939> go<00:02:03.090> as<00:02:03.209> close

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
you basically just don't go as close

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.840 
you basically just don't go as close
together<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:04.350> if<00:02:05.069> you<00:02:05.189> want<00:02:05.369> narrower

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
together and if you want narrower

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.350 
together and if you want narrower
stripes<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.719> go<00:02:07.170> closer<00:02:07.439> together<00:02:07.910> so<00:02:08.910> I've

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
stripes you go closer together so I've

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.330 
stripes you go closer together so I've
got<00:02:09.630> my<00:02:09.750> nails<00:02:09.929> prepped<00:02:10.440> with<00:02:10.590> calling<00:02:11.190> all

add<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.380> Mummy's<00:02:40.680> face<00:02:40.950> on<00:02:41.190> there<00:02:41.460> so<00:02:42.060> once

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
add the Mummy's face on there so once

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.360 
add the Mummy's face on there so once
you<00:02:42.720> have<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.080> surface<00:02:43.350> cleaned

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
you have the surface cleaned

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.150 
you have the surface cleaned
can<00:02:45.240> pull<00:02:45.750> your<00:02:45.990> finger<00:02:46.350> slowly<00:02:46.980> out<00:02:47.690> and

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
can pull your finger slowly out and

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.680 
can pull your finger slowly out and
there<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:50.190> can<00:02:50.460> see<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:51.210> water<00:02:51.390> marble

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
there you can see the water marble

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.930 
there you can see the water marble
design<00:02:52.080> that<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:53.040> know<00:02:53.160> looks<00:02:53.400> just<00:02:53.580> like<00:02:53.760> the

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
design that you know looks just like the

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.010 
design that you know looks just like the
Mummy's<00:02:54.240> wrappings<00:02:54.270> I<00:02:55.020> think<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:56.690> now<00:02:57.690> I'm

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
Mummy's wrappings I think and now I'm

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.590 
Mummy's wrappings I think and now I'm
going<00:02:58.380> to<00:02:58.650> change<00:02:59.550> up<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.820> camera<00:03:00.150> angle<00:03:00.510> a

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
going to change up the camera angle a

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.130 
going to change up the camera angle a
little<00:03:00.630> bit<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.490> I'm<00:03:02.490> going<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.880> show<00:03:03.870> you<00:03:03.900> how

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
little bit and I'm going to show you how

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.140 
little bit and I'm going to show you how
I<00:03:04.170> put<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.680> little<00:03:05.390> peeping<00:03:06.390> eyes<00:03:06.600> on<00:03:06.960> there

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
I put the little peeping eyes on there

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.510 
I put the little peeping eyes on there
alright<00:03:09.150> so<00:03:09.570> when<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:10.410> initially<00:03:10.890> got<00:03:11.160> this

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
alright so when I initially got this

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.030 
alright so when I initially got this
idea<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.240> realized<00:03:12.780> that<00:03:12.960> the<00:03:13.350> striped<00:03:13.710> water

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
idea and realized that the striped water

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.490 
idea and realized that the striped water
marble<00:03:14.490> would<00:03:14.940> really<00:03:15.870> work<00:03:16.140> well<00:03:16.470> for

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
marble would really work well for

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.070 
marble would really work well for
creating<00:03:17.220> like<00:03:17.370> mummy<00:03:17.730> wrappings<00:03:18.030> I<00:03:18.630> was<00:03:18.870> just

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
creating like mummy wrappings I was just

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.590 
creating like mummy wrappings I was just
going<00:03:19.320> to<00:03:19.350> leave<00:03:19.530> my<00:03:19.710> nails<00:03:19.920> plain<00:03:20.820> like<00:03:21.450> on

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
going to leave my nails plain like on

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.570 
going to leave my nails plain like on
this<00:03:21.810> hand<00:03:22.080> right<00:03:22.290> now

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
this hand right now

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.970 
this hand right now
but<00:03:23.580> then<00:03:23.880> I<00:03:23.910> saw<00:03:24.210> Julia's<00:03:24.960> mummy<00:03:25.350> tutorial

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
but then I saw Julia's mummy tutorial

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.180 
but then I saw Julia's mummy tutorial
which<00:03:26.370> was<00:03:26.730> freehand<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:28.080> she<00:03:28.800> painted

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
which was freehand and she painted

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.450 
which was freehand and she painted

on there you want to just make sure that

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.380 
on there you want to just make sure that
they<00:06:14.160> are<00:06:14.400> pressed<00:06:14.940> down<00:06:15.120> as<00:06:15.690> well<00:06:16.110> as<00:06:16.290> you<00:06:16.440> can

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
they are pressed down as well as you can

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.960 
they are pressed down as well as you can
so<00:06:18.390> that<00:06:18.420> they<00:06:19.020> don't<00:06:19.890> have<00:06:20.190> like<00:06:20.430> any<00:06:20.700> air

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
so that they don't have like any air

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.370 
so that they don't have like any air
underneath<00:06:21.780> them<00:06:22.290> and<00:06:23.390> then<00:06:24.390> the<00:06:24.540> final<00:06:24.570> step

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
underneath them and then the final step

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.730 
underneath them and then the final step
so<00:06:26.280> these<00:06:26.610> really<00:06:27.270> hopefully<00:06:28.170> don't<00:06:28.410> pop<00:06:28.710> off

to just do it with nail polish instead

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.490 
to just do it with nail polish instead
