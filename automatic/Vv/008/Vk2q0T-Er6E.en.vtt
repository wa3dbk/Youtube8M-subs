kuda<00:07:28.880> it's<00:07:29.880> like<00:07:30.060> we<00:07:30.450> didn't<00:07:30.750> take<00:07:30.900> out<00:07:31.110> Castro

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:31.500 
kuda it's like we didn't take out Castro

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.920 
kuda it's like we didn't take out Castro
after<00:07:31.620> all<00:07:31.920> he<00:07:32.010> was<00:07:32.100> fake<00:07:32.430> it's<00:07:33.390> total<00:07:33.750> bull

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:33.930 
after all he was fake it's total bull

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:37.130 
after all he was fake it's total bull
but<00:07:34.700> we<00:07:35.700> kind<00:07:35.910> of<00:07:35.970> had<00:07:36.090> to<00:07:36.180> figure<00:07:36.360> since<00:07:36.990> it

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:37.140 
but we kind of had to figure since it

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.810 
but we kind of had to figure since it
was<00:07:37.230> so<00:07:37.380> easy<00:07:37.410> to<00:07:37.770> get<00:07:37.920> to<00:07:38.070> him<00:07:38.220> I<00:07:38.370> wasn't<00:07:38.730> gonna

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:38.820 
was so easy to get to him I wasn't gonna

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.000 
was so easy to get to him I wasn't gonna
be<00:07:39.000> really<00:07:39.270> him

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.010 
be really him

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.430 
be really him
so<00:07:41.010> I<00:07:41.400> guess<00:07:41.760> we'll<00:07:42.510> just<00:07:42.540> see<00:07:42.900> if<00:07:42.930> we<00:07:43.200> escape

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 
so I guess we'll just see if we escape

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.680 
so I guess we'll just see if we escape
