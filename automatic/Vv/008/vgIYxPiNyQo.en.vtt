00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
and then basically what you have is you

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.189 
and then basically what you have is you
as<00:00:56.219> you'll<00:00:56.670> see<00:00:56.820> later<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:57.329> have<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.870> color

as you'll see later you have a color
binder<00:00:58.680> for<00:00:58.829> each<00:00:58.949> class<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.640> then<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.420> can

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
binder for each class and then you can

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.290 
binder for each class and then you can
get<00:01:00.750> coordinating<00:01:01.440> colored<00:01:01.890> folders<00:01:02.300> so

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
get coordinating colored folders so

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.149 
get coordinating colored folders so
whatever<00:01:04.049> your<00:01:04.379> teacher<00:01:04.559> gives<00:01:05.070> you

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
you have to do or just like some math

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.920 
you have to do or just like some math
problems<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.220> have<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.400> do<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:12.330> can<00:01:12.750> just

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
problems you have to do you can just

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.469 
problems you have to do you can just
take<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.450> put<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.750> your

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
take that and put it in your

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.850 
take that and put it in your
color-coordinated<00:01:18.479> folder<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.049> say<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.799> is

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
color-coordinated folder so say this is

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.840 
color-coordinated folder so say this is
my<00:01:20.159> math<00:01:20.430> color<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.150> red<00:01:21.330> one<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:22.610> just<00:01:23.610> put

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
my math color the red one and just put

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.249 
my math color the red one and just put
your<00:01:23.970> assignment<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.540> here<00:01:24.689> take<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:24.960> home

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
your assignment in here take it home

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.649 
your assignment in here take it home
instead<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.159> taking<00:01:26.520> home<00:01:26.670> an<00:01:26.909> entire<00:01:27.180> binder

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
instead of taking home an entire binder

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.649 
instead of taking home an entire binder
some<00:01:27.869> people<00:01:28.140> take<00:01:28.619> on<00:01:28.799> their<00:01:29.250> entire<00:01:29.820> binder

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
some people take on their entire binder

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.120 
some people take on their entire binder
and<00:01:30.780> then<00:01:31.020> they<00:01:31.140> have<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.350> take<00:01:31.470> home<00:01:31.680> three<00:01:32.040> or

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
and then they have to take home three or

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.770 
and then they have to take home three or
four<00:01:32.340> binders<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.729> night<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.329> just<00:01:33.570> so

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
four binders a night and that is just so

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.870 
four binders a night and that is just so
tedious

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
tedious

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.149 
tedious
so<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:36.299> goes<00:01:36.840> we<00:01:37.049> need<00:01:37.170> every<00:01:37.590> single<00:01:37.740> class

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
so this goes we need every single class

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.700 
so this goes we need every single class
and<00:01:38.579> this<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.720> what<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:39.930> do<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.170> thought<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.590> it

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
and this is what I do I thought of it

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.630 
and this is what I do I thought of it
myself<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.759> basically<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.689> just<00:01:42.720> put<00:01:43.640> your

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
myself so basically you just put your

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.100 
myself so basically you just put your
homework<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.270> stuff<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.630> here<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.049> need

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
homework and stuff in here that you need

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.510 
homework and stuff in here that you need
to<00:01:46.229> take<00:01:46.380> home<00:01:46.560> if<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.890> need<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.130> take<00:01:47.280> home<00:01:47.490> a

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
to take home if you need to take home a

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.219 
to take home if you need to take home a
notebook<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:48.210> just<00:01:48.450> stick<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:48.869> with<00:01:48.930> this

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
notebook you just stick it on with this

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.760 
notebook you just stick it on with this
or<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.950> book<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.570> lot<00:01:51.750> less<00:01:51.930> bulky<00:01:52.530> and

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
or a book and it's a lot less bulky and

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.370 
or a book and it's a lot less bulky and
then<00:01:52.920> taking<00:01:53.250> home<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:53.579> three<00:01:53.880> binders<00:01:54.380> so

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
then taking home like three binders so

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.530 
then taking home like three binders so
that's<00:01:55.740> my<00:01:55.979> quick<00:01:56.579> tip<00:01:56.640> for<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.119> guys<00:01:57.210> and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
that's my quick tip for you guys and

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.280 
that's my quick tip for you guys and
this<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.659> what<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:57.960> do

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
this is what I do

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.310 
this is what I do
and<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.950> reason<00:01:59.250> why<00:01:59.520> they're<00:01:59.729> not<00:01:59.759> in<00:01:59.969> there

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
and the reason why they're not in there

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.870 
and the reason why they're not in there
because<00:02:00.560> I<00:02:00.650> sort<00:02:00.860> them<00:02:01.100> by<00:02:01.250> order<00:02:01.550> of<00:02:01.580> class

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
because I sort them by order of class

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.760 
because I sort them by order of class
like<00:02:02.210> yeah<00:02:02.810> like<00:02:02.930> first<00:02:03.170> period<00:02:03.500> second

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
like yeah like first period second

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.800 
like yeah like first period second
period<00:02:03.800> third<00:02:04.130> period<00:02:04.490> and<00:02:04.790> I<00:02:05.150> don't<00:02:05.360> figured

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
period third period and I don't figured

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.390 
period third period and I don't figured
out<00:02:05.990> my<00:02:06.380> schedule<00:02:06.590> yet<00:02:06.920> because<00:02:07.220> they<00:02:07.370> haven't

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
out my schedule yet because they haven't

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.660

where I emptied out my binders since as
I<00:02:25.910> said<00:02:26.180> I'm<00:02:26.420> reusing<00:02:26.690> them<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.970> I'm<00:02:28.970> gonna

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
I said I'm reusing them and I'm gonna

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.430 
I said I'm reusing them and I'm gonna
show<00:02:29.630> you<00:02:29.690> just<00:02:30.370> how<00:02:31.370> I<00:02:31.459> did<00:02:31.760> that<00:02:32.000> okay<00:02:32.330> I<00:02:32.600> have

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
show you just how I did that okay I have

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.070 
show you just how I did that okay I have
all<00:02:33.620> my<00:02:33.800> work<00:02:34.010> in<00:02:34.190> here<00:02:34.489> so<00:02:35.120> this<00:02:35.750> was<00:02:35.930> like

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
all my work in here so this was like

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.840 
all my work in here so this was like
three<00:02:36.140> dollars<00:02:36.709> at<00:02:36.920> Target<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:37.489> it<00:02:37.640> fits

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
three dollars at Target and it fits

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.640 
three dollars at Target and it fits
everything<00:02:38.150> just<00:02:38.540> because<00:02:38.780> you<00:02:39.260> never<00:02:39.380> know

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
everything just because you never know

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.820 
everything just because you never know
when<00:02:39.860> you're<00:02:39.980> gonna<00:02:40.040> need<00:02:40.310> something<00:02:40.640> again

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
when you're gonna need something again

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.710 
when you're gonna need something again
so<00:02:42.830> basically<00:02:43.370> I<00:02:43.489> recommend<00:02:44.150> after<00:02:44.390> emptying

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
so basically I recommend after emptying

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.650 
so basically I recommend after emptying
out<00:02:44.959> your<00:02:45.110> binders<00:02:45.500> to<00:02:45.739> do<00:02:46.100> that<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:47.860> no<00:02:48.860> I

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
out your binders to do that and no I

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.820 
out your binders to do that and no I
basically<00:02:50.660> just<00:02:51.050> I'm<00:02:51.500> getting<00:02:51.739> out<00:02:51.800> my

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
basically just I'm getting out my

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.130 
basically just I'm getting out my
binders<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.459> kept<00:02:52.760> all<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.030> notebooks<00:02:53.420> so

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
binders I kept all the notebooks so

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.080 
binders I kept all the notebooks so
these<00:02:54.320> are<00:02:54.470> all<00:02:54.560> my<00:02:54.709> notes<00:02:54.950> from<00:02:55.790> the

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
these are all my notes from the

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.780 
these are all my notes from the

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
sophomore year but I threw out all the

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.100 
sophomore year but I threw out all the
folders<00:02:59.300> and<00:02:59.360> XS<00:03:00.040> like<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:01.880> know<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:02.269> like

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.250 
the labels and stuff so this is my extra
binder<00:03:07.090> but<00:03:08.090> this<00:03:08.269> is<00:03:08.420> how<00:03:08.570> I<00:03:08.630> organize<00:03:09.110> my

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
binder but this is how I organize my

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.199 
binder but this is how I organize my
binders<00:03:09.620> these<00:03:10.250> are<00:03:10.549> by<00:03:10.820> far<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.060> best

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
binders these are by far the best

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.300 
binders these are by far the best
binders<00:03:11.750> ever<00:03:11.930> they're<00:03:12.320> from<00:03:12.530> Staples<00:03:12.799> very

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
binders ever they're from Staples very

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.430 
binders ever they're from Staples very
durable<00:03:13.580> I<00:03:13.940> recommend<00:03:14.840> one<00:03:15.080> and<00:03:15.230> a<00:03:15.260> half

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
durable I recommend one and a half

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.620 
durable I recommend one and a half
inches<00:03:15.769> instead<00:03:15.980> of<00:03:16.190> one<00:03:16.430> because<00:03:17.150> one<00:03:17.450> you

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
inches instead of one because one you

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.449 
inches instead of one because one you
won't<00:03:17.840> be<00:03:17.989> able<00:03:18.110> to<00:03:18.230> fit<00:03:18.380> everything<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:19.010> two

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
won't be able to fit everything and two

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.199 
won't be able to fit everything and two
you<00:03:20.709> will<00:03:21.709> be<00:03:21.890> able<00:03:21.950> to<00:03:22.100> fit<00:03:22.310> more<00:03:22.640> but<00:03:23.030> it's

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
you will be able to fit more but it's

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.600 
you will be able to fit more but it's
kind<00:03:23.480> of<00:03:23.510> bulky<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.959> be<00:03:24.079> carrying<00:03:24.410> around<00:03:24.610> so

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
kind of bulky to be carrying around so

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.270 
kind of bulky to be carrying around so
what<00:03:25.820> I<00:03:25.850> do<00:03:25.970> is<00:03:26.360> I<00:03:26.630> label<00:03:27.079> the<00:03:27.200> side<00:03:27.410> so<00:03:28.010> this<00:03:28.160> is

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
what I do is I label the side so this is

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.410 
what I do is I label the side so this is
gonna<00:03:28.459> be<00:03:28.549> my<00:03:28.820> honest<00:03:29.150> physics<00:03:29.540> binder<00:03:30.130> and

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
gonna be my honest physics binder and

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.640 
gonna be my honest physics binder and
then<00:03:32.420> I<00:03:32.920> color<00:03:33.920> coordinate<00:03:34.430> inside<00:03:34.850> a<00:03:34.880> folder

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
then I color coordinate inside a folder

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.190 
then I color coordinate inside a folder
and<00:03:36.650> a<00:03:36.950> matching<00:03:37.310> notebook<00:03:37.700> and<00:03:38.000> then<00:03:38.690> here<00:03:39.019> is

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
and a matching notebook and then here is

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.990 
and a matching notebook and then here is
where<00:03:39.380> all<00:03:39.440> like<00:03:39.799> the<00:03:39.950> handouts<00:03:40.430> and<00:03:40.640> tests

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
where all like the handouts and tests

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.789 
where all like the handouts and tests
will<00:03:41.090> go<00:03:41.269> I've<00:03:41.900> never<00:03:42.110> been<00:03:42.290> much<00:03:42.440> of<00:03:42.500> a<00:03:44.799> tab

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
will go I've never been much of a tab

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.160 
will go I've never been much of a tab
divider<00:03:46.190> person<00:03:46.790> unless<00:03:47.299> a<00:03:47.540> class<00:03:47.780> requires

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
divider person unless a class requires

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.930 
divider person unless a class requires
it<00:03:48.470> I<00:03:48.620> usually<00:03:48.829> don't<00:03:49.100> use<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.519> tab<00:03:49.760> dividers

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
it I usually don't use the tab dividers

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.620 
it I usually don't use the tab dividers
so<00:03:51.340> basically<00:03:52.340> I<00:03:52.519> use<00:03:52.970> college<00:03:53.420> real

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
so basically I use college real

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.240 
so basically I use college real
notebooks<00:03:54.079> and<00:03:55.269> then<00:03:56.269> I<00:03:56.630> use<00:03:57.049> a<00:03:57.440> matching
