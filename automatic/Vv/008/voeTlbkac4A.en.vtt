00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 well the other day they talked about this 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.420
 distribution of tale that is the one 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.540
 appears here I'm going to change a couple of 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.030
 First you need the language and sven be a 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.969
 trick in the Spanish keyboard 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.500
 Spain and all the other time we gave him that 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.420
 not there we went into a normal test 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.270
 Now I'm going to say yes to the most 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.250
 soft where it puts more options not and here 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.390
 I give it forward and watching series of 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.740
 options well some a little 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.630
 complicated or some 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.010
 they are not other or complicated but good if 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.590
 we want an administrator password 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.050
 that you do not need to distort the address 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.360
 rather if we need to use a vpn 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.200
 but there is one that is very good that is 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.320
 activate camouflage windows xp and go to 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.559
 see what he does is I give him ok I'll see 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.430
 the normal start of the system but this 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.570
 time with the camouflage of windows xp 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.060
 'such as he commented the other day is a 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.030
 distribution securely or reasonably 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:01.840
 sure it works from a cd or from 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.880
 a usb key and let us see you here 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.890
 virtual machine warning detected 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.870
 has detected that it is true is sad the 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.990
 virtual machine and it 's synchronizing the 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.510
 system and you see we look like it seems that 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.970
 we are in a windows xp system more 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.130
 unsure of the world and it turns out that we're 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.380
 in the safest of the icons even 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.970
 keeps here the old icons of 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.910
 what are they but this is the one of the 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.670
 This is the club's vision and this is the 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:32.650
 of tintín 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:35.560
 even though the logos are from others of 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.750
 other things I give the menu to be and I 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.119
 leave the menus as usual but 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.820
 good is open office is the browsers 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.360
 is the things that you have to have, that is, 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.820
 it's a good camouflage for what 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.640
 so that people do not look at us with faces 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.380
 rare to see what we are using not the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.530
 people see this says another one that is with 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.440
 windows xp and they do not worry anymore but if 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.640
 you give to the browser then still tower 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.560
 is starting 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.790
 I will tell you 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.790
 have to start the browser 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.750
 only for the demonstration but in theory 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.480
 had to wait for everything to connect 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:18.560
 the rector calmly for anonymous 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.120
 that we did not have him even with the logo 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.370
 of the 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:27.879
 the windows trash and everything 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.760
 very curious very curious the idea of ​​this 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:33.069
 to make a system that looks like windows 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.250
 xp and it's really another thing very 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.250
 different 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:43.410
 and since the browser where we are 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.390
 in camouflage theory that nobody knows what 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.160
 what are we doing that seems like 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.350
 you see has the logo even of 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.250
 internet explorer and it seems that we are 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.870
 using internet explorer 6 the joker 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.820
 since here we are now is waiting 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.550
 it is slow because it has not yet started 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.960
 the rector but good but good 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.230
 just to see it is because 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:07.020
 I found it curious 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.390
 the camouflage system that uses 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.950
 so that was while waiting for 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.430
 connect 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.239
 I say goodbye to you 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:20.769
 from this camouflaged windows there is 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.769
 thor and here goes all starts 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.950
 'such 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.400
 to use it all run installed 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.640
 from a usb key that allows us that 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.260
 detect that we are here or hide what 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.930
 what we do on the internet but not 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.099
 trust the confines 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.099
 until the next video
