00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.850
 I chose geology because 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.170
 besides being a career that has a 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.840
 great work output 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.060
 I liked the wide field that you have for 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.930
 work be a geologist can work 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.780
 from a civil time with engineers 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.170
 work on glaciers in volcanoes in 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.170
 floors 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.200
 and I lost the revision because a new 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.450
 he's used to 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.160
 to be in school that world apart 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.160
 then come to the faculties as 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.120
 and then to feel bigger is 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.329
 grow somehow and start taking 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.280
 other responsibilities 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.840
 before alves at school 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.550
 I will get to study one day for a 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.949
 partial but you realize that the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.280
 university is no longer the same having that 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.280
 change 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:15.299
 it's usually getting up early is 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.299
 use all morning 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.920
 and drink mate a lot 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.079
 I thought that theology was maybe going to be 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.719
 much more study but one does not 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:32.619
 finds that geology is a career 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:34.549
 quite dynamic is the race where 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.069
 we have a lot of travel the field where 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.330
 we make where many friends make 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:41.490
 share a lot 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.840
 well I thought the truth that I thought 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.060
 feel much more about the faculty 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.020
 but no 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.140
 you are surrounded by many people 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.860
 and the field trips and I do not know 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.860
 and good 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.070
 as it said geology has a lot 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:04.820
 labor field the career is in a boom 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.280
 important and grabs me to my point 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.459
 a moment 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.530
 finishing studying and where the boom of 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.550
 mining and many give a lot of work 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.750
 to heaven but in reality 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.370
 be professional in my field I like 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.590
 have them on about the companies a 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.210
 private company but as I said the 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.090
 geologist can work from the 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.720
 research lasers volcanoes 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.720
 and civil engineering 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.620
 if you are interested in the land if you are interested 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.700
 study the interest to know how to 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.700
 if you are interested 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.080
 the minerals the rocks if you like the 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.170
 mountains study it you will realize 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.970
 that you will find many friends and you 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.240
 you are going to realize that 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.730
 it's good 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.310
 we wait for you in the faculty of sciences 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.250
 exact physical and natural 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:05.370
 National university at the university 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.370
