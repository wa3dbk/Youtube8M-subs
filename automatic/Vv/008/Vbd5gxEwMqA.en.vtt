00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.860
 today I show you the recipe for 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.139
 make a soup that he likes 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.350
 lot is a bit that we do it, and that 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.970
 love it so much and made soup with more 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.130
 which after perhaps more correctly call the 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:26.609
 velvety with leeks and potatoes you see 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.900
 with glasses because then 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:34.290
 The ingredients they serve are clearly 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:37.050
 potatoes indicatively two are left 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.840
 big each 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.309
 then the leek was big 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.070
 so we used it 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.000
 let's use it only if two are small 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:54.780
 a little less shiny butter than 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.940
 murro a little oil , salt and pepper afterwards 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.219
 we will use milk towards the end 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.980
 of cooking and a bit of vegetable broth 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.760
 or do the nut one now you do 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.520
 in short, carrot onion with 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.460
 present to you and let's see how 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.270
 then we must first of all 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.080
 cut the leek here wet it 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.080
 now 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.700
 cut all the venetian leek now 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.700
 left - handed butter in the pot 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.430
 the continuous the first several oil wants a 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.740
 taste a little more delicate than the oil and 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:43.140
 professional is clearly not on a 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:46.700
 little more than butter I put it on the fire 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.700
 to heat and fillet 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.680
 now while you can Rome starts at 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:02.940
 they could all be diced 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:06.570
 small was already you face before you can 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.750
 as stated part of waste are from 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.750
 to discard 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:25.549
 here we can answer more we have 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:27.560
 added another little bit of the brolo is 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:33.069
 at any point let's go and put the groups 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.069
 that potatoes and we cut 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.300
 the mountain all mixes dust 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.000
 in June 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.000
 well 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.290
 cheer on 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.350
 and this chance to provide even more than 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.220
 a couple of minutes 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:11.920
 in the meantime it rises to make water last year 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:14.280
 individual stock to cover all 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.280
 let's move on 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.590
 Pato also knows me a little bit more 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.510
 let go for one 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:41.780
 I look like because it is the recipe of 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:44.340
 usual to assago in less than 20 15 with the 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.720
 home then our salt inspiration 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.209
 word work colleague always does 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.970
 simone I'm doing 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:55.470
 according to his dictates but then appear 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:59.159
 on video, because this is it here 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.440
 the part of culture a little slower though 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.090
 you have no time you can do it with the 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.769
 pressure cooker instead yet another 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.139
 do up to here everything the same as then from 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.000
 whistle count 10 minutes according to me 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.920
 it gets more hand this way it does because 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.970
 everyone gets mixed up in temple 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.209
 the flavors with the pressure cooker 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:18.479
 in short, it is a little less good second 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:23.580
 me but nothing is thrown away and therefore there 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:25.740
 let's review between cable references ok then 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.190
 now the fries up are nice 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:33.470
 then flaked 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:35.780
 a moment and pass it to the blender 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.430
 to the inversion you repeat with new a 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:44.560
 we do little pieces of brown for a long time 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.560
 five with speed and let's see how it goes 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.830
 and we are then satisfied clearly 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.410
 if you like it you can also leave 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:02.170
 a few pieces of whole potato chips yes 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:05.750
 I hear only food on the fire I put 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:07.490
 ask us like so many but it is the face to go 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.569
 another little bit at this point you 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.789
 you can even hear if now 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:16.919
 the patina of saints are already beautiful things 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.919
 so we don't get into it 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.970
 here is the finished result 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.010
 eat that hot right away 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:36.390
 period that fascination is always nice but 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:38.710
 hot things you can eat it or with the 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.150
 bruscato bread or even with i 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:45.010
 courses like those of the san carlo che 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:48.540
 I hope the recipe is fine 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.540
 both liked it to the next
