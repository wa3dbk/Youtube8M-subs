is<00:05:09.349> not<00:05:09.530> a<00:05:09.560> mist<00:05:09.860> and<00:05:10.039> i<00:05:10.189> paid<00:05:10.430> forty<00:05:10.849> some

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
is not a mist and i paid forty some

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.869 
is not a mist and i paid forty some
dollars<00:05:11.680> when<00:05:12.680> i<00:05:12.710> first<00:05:13.039> started<00:05:13.189> for<00:05:13.729> this

00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:13.879 
dollars when i first started for this

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:16.719 
dollars when i first started for this
stain<00:05:14.210> I<00:05:14.479> don't<00:05:14.719> even<00:05:14.840> like<00:05:14.960> it<00:05:15.430> but<00:05:16.430> that<00:05:16.610> was

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
stain I don't even like it but that was

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:18.369 
stain I don't even like it but that was
before<00:05:16.849> I<00:05:17.090> knew<00:05:17.180> about<00:05:17.330> the<00:05:17.659> mist<00:05:17.870> and<00:05:18.080> stain

00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:18.379 
before I knew about the mist and stain

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:24.760 
before I knew about the mist and stain
so<00:05:19.509> that's<00:05:20.509> that<00:05:23.050> let's<00:05:24.050> see<00:05:24.229> what<00:05:24.409> else<00:05:24.439> can

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
so that's that let's see what else can

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.459 
so that's that let's see what else can
we<00:05:24.860> talk<00:05:25.099> about<00:05:25.250> I<00:05:25.819> got<00:05:26.659> the<00:05:26.810> board<00:05:27.050> and<00:05:27.289> batten

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:27.469 
we talk about I got the board and batten

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:29.409 
we talk about I got the board and batten
on<00:05:27.680> the<00:05:27.830> outside<00:05:28.250> just<00:05:28.550> to<00:05:28.639> keep<00:05:28.849> the<00:05:29.000> air<00:05:29.180> flow

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
on the outside just to keep the air flow

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:35.459 
on the outside just to keep the air flow
out<00:05:31.120> we<00:05:32.120> got<00:05:32.330> the<00:05:33.250> it's<00:05:34.250> a<00:05:34.430> corrugated<00:05:34.909> plastic

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:35.469 
out we got the it's a corrugated plastic

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:41.260 
out we got the it's a corrugated plastic
window<00:05:36.610> I<00:05:38.050> think<00:05:39.050> I<00:05:39.199> I<00:05:39.639> don't<00:05:40.639> think<00:05:40.909> I<00:05:41.029> talked

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
window I think I I don't think I talked

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.570 
window I think I I don't think I talked
about<00:05:41.360> that<00:05:41.750> i<00:05:41.930> paid<00:05:42.229> a<00:05:42.259> forty<00:05:42.919> five<00:05:43.039> dollars

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
about that i paid a forty five dollars

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.779 
about that i paid a forty five dollars
for<00:05:43.789> a<00:05:43.819> sheet<00:05:44.090> of<00:05:44.120> that<00:05:44.330> stuff<00:05:44.710> from<00:05:45.879> menards

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789 
for a sheet of that stuff from menards

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.369 
for a sheet of that stuff from menards
it<00:05:49.789> works<00:05:50.000> out<00:05:50.180> pretty<00:05:50.360> good<00:05:50.689> for<00:05:50.900> what<00:05:51.229> I

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:51.379 
it works out pretty good for what I

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:53.800 
it works out pretty good for what I
wanted<00:05:51.800> I'm<00:05:52.639> not<00:05:52.909> going<00:05:53.090> to<00:05:53.150> be<00:05:53.240> using<00:05:53.419> that<00:05:53.659> in

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
wanted I'm not going to be using that in

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.480 
wanted I'm not going to be using that in
the<00:05:53.870> house<00:05:54.020> obviously<00:05:54.319> but<00:05:55.150> it's<00:05:56.150> a<00:05:57.250> it<00:05:58.250> looks

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
the house obviously but it's a it looks

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:05.649 
the house obviously but it's a it looks
pretty<00:05:58.639> good<00:05:58.940> the<00:05:59.690> backs<00:05:59.990> all<00:06:00.259> done<00:06:03.190> yeah<00:06:04.659> the

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:05.659 
pretty good the backs all done yeah the

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:07.629 
pretty good the backs all done yeah the
one<00:06:05.810> thing<00:06:05.990> I<00:06:06.169> didn't<00:06:06.469> do<00:06:06.589> that<00:06:06.979> I<00:06:07.219> should<00:06:07.520> have

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 
one thing I didn't do that I should have

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:13.180 
one thing I didn't do that I should have
done<00:06:07.789> differently<00:06:08.440> was<00:06:09.440> these<00:06:10.719> posts<00:06:12.190> there

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
done differently was these posts there

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.860 
done differently was these posts there
four<00:06:13.460> by<00:06:13.610> fours<00:06:13.940> they<00:06:14.180> should<00:06:14.419> have<00:06:14.509> been<00:06:14.629> put

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
four by fours they should have been put

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:21.129 
four by fours they should have been put
in<00:06:16.419> with<00:06:17.419> the<00:06:17.569> more<00:06:18.159> rigid<00:06:19.159> I<00:06:20.080> don't<00:06:21.080> know

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:21.139 
in with the more rigid I don't know

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:23.290 
in with the more rigid I don't know
you'd<00:06:21.349> call<00:06:21.620> that<00:06:21.650> like<00:06:22.610> I<00:06:22.759> said<00:06:23.000> I<00:06:23.029> haven't

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
you'd call that like I said I haven't

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.570 
you'd call that like I said I haven't
had<00:06:23.449> my<00:06:23.509> coffee<00:06:23.629> this<00:06:24.050> morning<00:06:24.500> but<00:06:25.219> this

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
had my coffee this morning but this

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.890 
had my coffee this morning but this
should<00:06:25.789> be<00:06:25.879> they<00:06:26.029> should<00:06:26.060> be<00:06:26.300> anchored<00:06:26.689> better

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
should be they should be anchored better

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.990 
should be they should be anchored better
and<00:06:27.169> they<00:06:27.800> actually<00:06:28.039> when<00:06:28.909> I<00:06:28.939> designed<00:06:29.449> it<00:06:29.629> I

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
and they actually when I designed it I

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.179 
and they actually when I designed it I
should<00:06:32.000> have<00:06:32.089> ran<00:06:32.300> the<00:06:32.479> four<00:06:32.750> by<00:06:32.930> fours<00:06:33.259> all

00:06:34.179 --> 00:06:34.189 
should have ran the four by fours all

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:37.420 
should have ran the four by fours all
the<00:06:34.610> way<00:06:34.759> down<00:06:35.029> to<00:06:35.060> here<00:06:35.539> and<00:06:35.750> then<00:06:36.189> tied<00:06:37.189> into

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
the way down to here and then tied into

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.839 
the way down to here and then tied into
that<00:06:37.729> goes<00:06:38.330> right<00:06:38.539> now<00:06:39.250> that's<00:06:40.250> not<00:06:40.370> the<00:06:40.669> best

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:40.849 
that goes right now that's not the best

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:44.829 
that goes right now that's not the best
solution<00:06:41.089> for<00:06:42.729> rigidity<00:06:43.729> and<00:06:44.120> when<00:06:44.539> I<00:06:44.569> come

00:06:44.829 --> 00:06:44.839 
solution for rigidity and when I come

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:46.959 
solution for rigidity and when I come
inside<00:06:45.020> here<00:06:45.500> I'm<00:06:46.159> actually<00:06:46.400> thinking<00:06:46.729> about

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:46.969 
inside here I'm actually thinking about

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:52.300 
inside here I'm actually thinking about
putting<00:06:48.699> a<00:06:49.699> cross<00:06:50.000> bracer<00:06:50.539> in<00:06:50.740> the<00:06:51.740> top<00:06:52.009> there

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.310 
putting a cross bracer in the top there

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.640 
putting a cross bracer in the top there
to<00:06:53.240> go<00:06:53.419> like<00:06:53.659> this<00:06:54.370> because<00:06:55.370> with<00:06:56.210> the<00:06:56.360> doors

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:56.650 
to go like this because with the doors

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.839 
to go like this because with the doors
the<00:06:57.650> way<00:06:57.830> I<00:06:57.860> have<00:06:58.099> it<00:06:58.250> designed<00:06:58.669> with<00:06:58.819> the

00:06:58.839 --> 00:06:58.849 
the way I have it designed with the

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:01.809 
the way I have it designed with the
doors<00:06:59.180> like<00:06:59.479> this<00:06:59.750> there's<00:07:00.169> no<00:07:00.699> bracing<00:07:01.699> in

00:07:01.809 --> 00:07:01.819 
doors like this there's no bracing in

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:02.510 
doors like this there's no bracing in
the<00:07:01.940> front

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 
the front

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.760 
the front
the<00:07:03.060> back<00:07:03.300> is<00:07:03.330> obviously<00:07:03.900> braced<00:07:04.259> because<00:07:04.650> of

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:04.770 
the back is obviously braced because of

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:09.860 
the back is obviously braced because of
the<00:07:04.860> wall<00:07:05.069> but<00:07:05.720> the<00:07:06.720> front<00:07:07.080> there's<00:07:07.349> no<00:07:08.870> side

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:09.870 
the wall but the front there's no side

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.619 
the wall but the front there's no side
to<00:07:10.050> side<00:07:10.259> bracing<00:07:10.830> so<00:07:11.699> if<00:07:11.879> you<00:07:12.000> if<00:07:12.240> i<00:07:12.449> add<00:07:12.599> a

00:07:12.619 --> 00:07:12.629 
to side bracing so if you if i add a

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:14.869 
to side bracing so if you if i add a
diagonal<00:07:13.349> across<00:07:13.470> like<00:07:14.159> maybe<00:07:14.430> even<00:07:14.610> two

00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:14.879 
diagonal across like maybe even two

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:17.890 
diagonal across like maybe even two
diagonals<00:07:15.470> it'll<00:07:16.470> keep<00:07:16.680> the<00:07:16.949> building<00:07:17.400> from

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:17.900 
diagonals it'll keep the building from

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:24.589 
diagonals it'll keep the building from
moving<00:07:18.900> like<00:07:19.080> that<00:07:21.050> but<00:07:22.050> uh<00:07:22.080> I<00:07:22.500> think<00:07:23.599> for

00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:24.599 
moving like that but uh I think for

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:26.779 
moving like that but uh I think for
right<00:07:24.960> now<00:07:25.530> that's<00:07:26.039> probably<00:07:26.400> all<00:07:26.460> I<00:07:26.580> want<00:07:26.699> to

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:26.789 
right now that's probably all I want to

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:28.909 
right now that's probably all I want to
do<00:07:26.879> on<00:07:27.030> the<00:07:27.180> shed<00:07:27.389> build<00:07:27.629> I<00:07:27.810> need<00:07:27.930> to<00:07:28.020> go<00:07:28.110> get<00:07:28.710> my

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 
do on the shed build I need to go get my

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:31.339 
do on the shed build I need to go get my
get<00:07:29.849> my<00:07:29.909> coffee<00:07:30.240> on<00:07:30.539> me<00:07:30.690> so<00:07:30.840> I<00:07:30.870> can<00:07:31.110> think

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:31.349 
get my coffee on me so I can think

00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:34.279 
get my coffee on me so I can think
straight<00:07:31.590> but<00:07:32.490> uh<00:07:32.520> that's<00:07:33.360> that's<00:07:33.870> what<00:07:34.169> it's

00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:34.289 
straight but uh that's that's what it's
