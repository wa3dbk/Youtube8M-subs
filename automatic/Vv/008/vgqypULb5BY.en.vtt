00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:13.039
 hello how about you guys in this video I'm going to 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.990
 teach a super simple way to 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.760
 so to speak, we put the garage 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.410
 from the main character to the character 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.050
 secondary that there will be here the car 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.760
 by car we will go to the saints custom 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.050
 with the main character and a friend 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.210
 mounted on the car we want 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.619
 duplicate the session of course has 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.720
 that it belongs to our friend 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.340
 have created him once we are in the 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.230
 saints we will do the trick of getting ourselves 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.449
 inside with calling the mechanic so that 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.460
 do not activate the saints just us 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.530
 we will get off the vehicle and as soon as the 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.350
 partner is to move to drive it 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.130
 we will go to change character and 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.260
 we will go to the secondary character 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.180
 once we have reached the character 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.920
 secondary school we will have appeared in 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.080
 any random session out there 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.730
 then what we will have to do the 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.200
 next step that we will have to do 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.990
 will be to tell our friend that we 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.750
 invite your session once the friend we 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.030
 invite your session and we give you 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.280
 we'll see that we appear again 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.570
 to take by sac close depends where 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.130
 you have put in place of appearance 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.050
 it depends on where you were already 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.250
 you know it depends on many things but 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.050
 well that's the least 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.880
 appear is where it appears is you get a 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.070
 Council of the street and you go 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.440
 quietly to the custom saints where 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.510
 is your colleague and once you have 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.700
 come to the are the saints custom 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.460
 where you have your buddy what 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.150
 we will have to do will be get off the car 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.950
 and enter the custom saints walking one 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.990
 once we have entered the righteous saints 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.119
 sending and see our miguel already 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.650
 I have put with the car the only thing that 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.290
 we will have to do 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.450
 will be to enter the car and ask our 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.520
 friend to get off when entering us at 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.530
 drive us to drive it although the 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.810
 car does not mark us that is ours 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.270
 that leaves us to touch it and to 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.340
 enter touch not automatically the 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.930
 alone the locator will be 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.660
 we the only thing that we will have to pay 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.210
 so that the car is 100% and 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.520
 completely ours will be the insurance to 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.170
 all risk when you stop the insurance 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.270
 all risk you have to take care of 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.950
 one thing that is very important very 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.479
 important because you can that this is 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.980
 a trick to save money but that 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.190
 detail can be taken to the absolute 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.780
 ruin so please listen to me and 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.060
 keep it in mind 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.280
 when you do insurance to everything 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.290
 sometimes you will risk the simbolito 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.020
 like you bought it but other 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.510
 sometimes not and it will let you keep buying and 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.940
 spending money to death 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.830
 do not worry what you pay once and 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.750
 although the marquita da does not greet you 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.330
 exactly the same because when you go 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.819
 to the garage and you will see that you are 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.670
 insured is to say do not worry 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.950
 absolutely nothing for him by the vessel 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.750
 if you look now as I get 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.489
 he wants that I do not have it and I do not stop 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.709
 spend money so that you see it and 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.959
 how money is the same but it is a 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.030
 subject that you have to have it very much but that 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.410
 very much in mind and without counting that 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.030
 the rest is a true pass because 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.590
 you will not lose the car with the 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.030
 main character is to say that at 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.769
 final just paying the insurance to everything 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.810
 risk you just cloned the car for your 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.580
 two characters so nothing guys 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.920
 I hope you like it and that it helps you 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.580

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.580
