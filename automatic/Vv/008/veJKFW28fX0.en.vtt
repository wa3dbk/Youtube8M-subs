00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
guys check this theme out it is called a

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.399 
guys check this theme out it is called a
COS<00:01:37.860> 8<00:01:38.159> unfortunately<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.360> dollar<00:01:39.689> 99

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
COS 8 unfortunately it's a dollar 99

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.370 
COS 8 unfortunately it's a dollar 99
which<00:01:40.979> i<00:01:41.189> think<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> little<00:01:42.600> too<00:01:43.049> expensive

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
which i think is a little too expensive

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.280 
which i think is a little too expensive
for<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.070> kind<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.520> theme<00:01:44.759> just<00:01:45.360> because<00:01:45.810> not

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
for this kind of theme just because not

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.200 
for this kind of theme just because not
a<00:01:46.350> lot<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.649> icons<00:01:47.159> are<00:01:47.340> supported<00:01:47.850> even<00:01:48.000> though

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
a lot of icons are supported even though

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.600 
a lot of icons are supported even though
you<00:01:48.270> get<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.689> great<00:01:49.200> circular<00:01:49.829> look<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.310> just

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
you get that great circular look I just

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.010 
you get that great circular look I just
think<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.909> would<00:01:51.000> be<00:01:51.060> better<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.450> make<00:01:51.750> this

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
think it would be better to make this

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.760 
think it would be better to make this
