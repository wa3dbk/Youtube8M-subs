there's been speculation about two

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.080 
there's been speculation about two
explosives<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.340> so<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.369> just<00:00:17.670> want<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.940> talk

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
explosives and so I just want to talk

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.849 
explosives and so I just want to talk
you<00:00:18.119> about<00:00:18.510> these<00:00:19.199> sets<00:00:19.910> so<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.000> first<00:00:21.180> set<00:00:21.480> is

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
you about these sets so the first set is

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.730 
you about these sets so the first set is
the<00:00:22.859> corporate<00:00:23.340> alliance<00:00:23.519> tank<00:00:24.000> droid<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.779> is

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
the corporate alliance tank droid and is

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.670 
the corporate alliance tank droid and is
one<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.130> rather<00:00:26.250> ones<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:27.380> think<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.529> this

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
one of the rather ones I think that this

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.589 
one of the rather ones I think that this
will<00:00:28.830> be<00:00:28.890> about<00:00:29.340> like<00:00:29.550> thirty<00:00:29.939> dollars<00:00:30.359> maybe

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
will be about like thirty dollars maybe

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.850 
will be about like thirty dollars maybe
and<00:00:32.480> included<00:00:33.480> like<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.930> tank<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.649> maybe

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
and included like the tank and maybe

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.540 
and included like the tank and maybe
like<00:00:35.100> some<00:00:35.280> enjoyed<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.320> then<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.469> next<00:00:37.550> set

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
like some enjoyed and then the next set

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.840 
like some enjoyed and then the next set
is<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.300> homing<00:00:39.750> spider<00:00:40.079> droid<00:00:40.700> kind<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
is the homing spider droid kind of the

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.930 
is the homing spider droid kind of the
same<00:00:42.059> thing<00:00:42.600> it's<00:00:43.290> just<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:44.070> spider<00:00:44.309> droid<00:00:44.640> and

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
same thing it's just a spider droid and

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.670 
same thing it's just a spider droid and
droids<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.660> maybe<00:00:45.840> some<00:00:46.079> clones<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.559> know

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
clue what this is so I don't know what

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.270 
clue what this is so I don't know what
is<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.659> things<00:01:19.229> from<00:01:19.500> like<00:01:19.680> something<00:01:20.040> called

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
is I things from like something called

is I things from like something called
the<00:01:20.490> Yoda<00:01:20.729> carnivals<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.890> haven't<00:01:22.890> seen<00:01:23.100> that

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
the Yoda carnivals I haven't seen that

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.050 
the Yoda carnivals I haven't seen that
and<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.939> don't<00:01:24.119> really<00:01:24.600> know<00:01:25.200> what<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:26.060> but

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
and I don't really know what it is but

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.190 
and I don't really know what it is but
the<00:01:27.689> next<00:01:27.960> one<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.140> an<00:01:28.470> 80<00:01:28.710> te<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.930> I<00:01:30.930> think

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the next one is an 80 te and I think

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.580 
the next one is an 80 te and I think
this<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:31.650> will<00:01:32.159> be<00:01:32.400> around<00:01:33.170> maybe<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.350> hundred

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
this one will be around maybe a hundred

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.160 
this one will be around maybe a hundred
to<00:01:35.310> one<00:01:35.340> hundred<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.970> twenty<00:01:36.360> dollars<00:01:36.750> like

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
to one hundred and twenty dollars like

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.550 
to one hundred and twenty dollars like
the<00:01:37.350> last<00:01:37.560> one<00:01:38.090> maybe<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.240> seemed<00:01:39.479> kind<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
the last one maybe it seemed kind of the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.210 
the last one maybe it seemed kind of the
same<00:01:41.689> design<00:01:42.689> but<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.649> would<00:01:43.890> be<00:01:44.040> different

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
same design but it would be different

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.080 
same design but it would be different
and<00:01:44.549> new<00:01:45.240> may<00:01:45.450> fix<00:01:45.720> keza<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.460> from<00:01:47.460> episode<00:01:47.880> 2

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
and new may fix keza is from episode 2

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.499 
and new may fix keza is from episode 2
and<00:01:48.710> then<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.860> next<00:01:49.890> one<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.369> Jabba's<00:01:51.270> Sail

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
and then the next one is Jabba's Sail

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.410 
and then the next one is Jabba's Sail
Barge<00:01:51.950> so<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.579> containing<00:01:54.030> six

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
Barge so this is containing six

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.050 
Barge so this is containing six
minifigures<00:01:55.020> there's<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.100> perma<00:01:56.820> Larry

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
minifigures there's a perma Larry

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.130 
minifigures there's a perma Larry

figures

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
figures

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.719 
figures
and<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:08.149> next<00:02:08.360> one<00:02:08.599> is<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:09.470> republic<00:02:10.250> gunship

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
and the next one is a republic gunship

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.510 
and the next one is a republic gunship
and<00:02:11.050> I<00:02:12.050> think<00:02:12.290> this<00:02:12.380> will<00:02:12.560> be<00:02:12.620> around<00:02:12.980> same

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
and I think this will be around same

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.540 
and I think this will be around same
thing<00:02:13.700> as<00:02:13.819> the<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:13.970> été<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:15.099> hundred<00:02:16.099> to<00:02:16.310> one

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
thing as the a été a hundred to one

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.290 
thing as the a été a hundred to one
hundred<00:02:16.670> twenty<00:02:16.910> dollars<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:18.940> it's<00:02:19.940> kind<00:02:20.239> of

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
hundred twenty dollars and it's kind of
