00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.470
 valkyria chronicles one of the most striking and promising games 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.189
 developed by the sega company exclusively for playstation 3 is already 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:25.460
 the sale in Spain 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.679
 and here you have what our impressions of this peculiar rpg have been 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.679
 encompassed in the genre of such strategy 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.970
 the plot of the game are 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.990
 the fictional alternative world clearly inspired by the Europe of 1935 just at 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.530
 beginning of a world war that confronts the two most 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.690
 powerful nations of the continent to the east the imperial alliance and to the west the 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.240
 federation walking home 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.150
 but unfortunately I have all that conflict will be involved the 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.130
 principality of quality a country until now minister to which due to its 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.450
 pacifist policy does not even possess an army with which to defend 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.900
 Dublin 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.280
 but if there is something that characterizes the inhabitants of the Balearics 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.640
 for his great pride and courage 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.990
 We are not willing to sell their defeat so easily by organizing 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.760
 from that moment an armed resistance that in spite of its inexperience 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.369
 militant will be willing to do whatever is necessary to recover the 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.369
 freedom of his beloved homeland 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.530
 quito 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.530
 the whole story housing from the point of 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.500
 in the quindío of her friend 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.050
 from their homes through 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.050
 cgt something like that goes down 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:22.739
 and precisely entering and starting your 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.079
 the mechanics of the title is a very successful mix of styles 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:29.849
 furnaces and action in real time in the third person 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.849
 and more specifically the system 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:35.300
 it is a clear mission we will have 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.749
 the limited number of units which we can move one 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:41.749
 a free form on the stage 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.829
 your mobility is limited by a bar 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:47.139
 going against the nation 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:50.569
 so when exhausted we should wait until the next shift 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.659
 during the game we can develop the skills etc 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:03.849
 the protagonists 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.529
 take out your weapons 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:08.809
 our own combat section this generates 

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:10.689
 in account character 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.769
 them with their own personality and that 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:13.629
 inflation 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.629
 having five kinds of profession is possible 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.129
 a sniper 

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:28.869
 in this sense a very important fact to take into account 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:30.209
 special 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.219
 the three characters die he 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:35.749
 there is a mission we will have some land to cure it 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:38.749
 or else not lose 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.769
 something that will force us to 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:49.039
 and not risk 

00:03:57.869 --> 00:04:01.909
 but without a doubt it is the technical section where the game gets the most 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:03.409
 call our attention 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:06.409
 since everything is tied as if we were watching the matches 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:10.449
 and in the same way its graphics etc 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:14.529
 made as if they were the drawings of a story painted by hand with pencils 

00:04:14.529 --> 00:04:15.429
 colors 

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:19.699
 resulting in a truly moving appearance of watercolors 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.879
 novelty at the same time that full of romanticism st 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.960
 until now the crisis 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:38.400
 meanwhile both 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.379
 fires are of an excellent level 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:43.639
 while against the voices can only be 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:44.680
 it is the destruction 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.659
 between English or Japanese 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:51.150
 points that can take the most 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.380
 yakín explanably the screen texts have not been translated to the 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.279
 Spanish 

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:57.919
 what perhaps others 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.919
 problem for both 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.389
 the video game kennedy 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.050
 there the tactical rpg 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.169
 which for its great visual quality and 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.169
 it deserves to occupy a prominent place in the standing catalog 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.199
 and you what no fan should be sold despite the find 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:34.400
 at the end of last August 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.380
 at a recommended retail price of 69
