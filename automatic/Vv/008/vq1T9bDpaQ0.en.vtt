00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.559
 gardening 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:15.839
 we will plant mint I know that the seeds 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.270
 incomprehensible somewhere 100 parts from seeds 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.449
 it doesnâ€™t always work to grow good 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.510

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.050

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.689
 is that we just go on 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.989
 the market we find some good grandmother 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.390

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.940
 and then we come home and we trim 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.450
 tips and put mint 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.430
 water but here it should be poured a little 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.770
 so that it does not rot 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:55.890
 3-4 days in a few days 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.039

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.530
 such roots on mint and we just 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.710
 we can safely plant in the ground and she herself 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.479
 will grow like this we will do already 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:15.990
 poured earth into the pot do such 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:20.509
 deep holes and I will put there 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:24.540
 my mint, I use the already prepared mixture 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.710
 Soil universal can be bought or 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.030
 for seedlings 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.820
 or you can just dial somewhere in the ground 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.040
 forest then try to find the land 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.759
 which the mole lived 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.689
 it is on such a black top is very loose 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:46.590
 and the good is now ready to water 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.869
 it's all a little water and put on 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.990
 window sill 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:54.450
 but not in direct sunlight and 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.140
 then you can have a little tweaked 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.969
 currently leaves and they will grow new 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.640
 here we are in a magical way 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.820
