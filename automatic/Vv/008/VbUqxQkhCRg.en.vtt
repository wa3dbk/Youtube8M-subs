00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.410
 a huge number of devices equipped 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.279
 and synchronous motors 

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.439
 most often this frame machines or 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:15.959
 equipment is intended for 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.199
 work so important mains with a voltage of 380 volts 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.349
 at the same time such engines are connected more often 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.150
 just star 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.170
 although almost everyone is in sync with this 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.900
 dangerous engine count 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.599
 voltage alert reminders 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.500
 380 220 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.380
 222 27 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.380
 etc 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.300
 switching engine from one 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.640
 voltage up to a year 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.250
 produced and connected windings 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.330
 per star will be revealed in the 80s 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.230
 or at any time up to two hundred and twenty 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.130
 if the engine has a block for 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.970
 connect 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.320
 six years 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.160
 jumper side 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.320
 should pay attention to what 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.750
 alright the jumpers are installed and just 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.220
 change their location 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.560
 always remember that with any 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.010
 exception is important that the direction to 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.030
 swamps match 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.780
 so for example a star pain point can 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.240
 be so the beginning of the auto concern 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.600
 Anxiety Malkin must necessarily be 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.180
 strong will follow 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.480
 that is, the end of one of the beginning of the next 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.910
 so dangerous engine 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.920
 quite successfully can work and you 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.200
 in vain network 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.300
 what you need to add 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.790
 condensate mess 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.600
 but wait for full dedication 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.910
 condensate engines 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.960
 power at the best 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.990
 will be no more than 70 percent of par 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.149
 and the starting torque is highly dependent on 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.000
 pskov containers 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.360
 difficulties may also arise 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.870
 beat working containers 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.430
 I admit the load 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.740
 three phase motor in one danger and 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.290
 suffer one continuous compromise 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.180
 but in many cases he is 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.680
 the only way out 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.730
 if you need to urgently run for example 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.220
 circular saw besides a household outlet 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.620
 no power sources anymore 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.220
 foreseen
