00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.150
 All welcome to a new one 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.429
 video with me today again a hair 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.739
 tutorial i have you three hairstyle 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.210
 just picks it for everyday life 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.769
 you also assassinate quickly in the morning 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.790
 We can have overslept if 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:37.980
 I quickly as an office or in school 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.500
 mist or basically as well 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.730
 are just three beautiful hairstyles 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.379
 you also need to go fast 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.120
 no long hair as is perfect 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.620
 no matter if you have short hair with long or short hair 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.210
 very long hair if it succeeds 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.979
 actually always partly 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.390
 easier if the hair is a bit shorter 

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:52.260
 are 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.940
 otherwise it is synonymous with smooth or 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.629
 Curly hair is perfect 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.179
 no matter I wish you much fun 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.489
 copying me write the comments 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:04.559
 how you find the hairstyle and have fun 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.940
 when looking at it as a first step 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.560
 always very important that you yours 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.160
 combed hair well there are a few 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.750
 That's why the button in the han are too 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.310
 at the mergers where maybe somehow 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.659
 what is being shot on the hair that there 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.460
 also nothing reported or so straight on 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.020
 the places where the knots are as 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.330
 First you need a style came and 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.670
 the bombs are ready to attach and 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.920
 then you can start smiling already 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.310
 the top party of her head one 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.950
 slightly wider rove it all depends on 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.970
 how voluminous on the back of the head wanted to have 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.840
 I 'll do that in my case too 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.520
 Just a little bit 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.110
 looks more interesting because I yes 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.460
 has really smooth and long hair it 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.320
 but then it is a bit clumsy if 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.460
 you just put it back 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.049
 that is where by this partie 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.939
 not if they are just here 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.740
 easy on approach and then put it 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.810
 just how to fix 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.850
 to get that volume right and 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.560
 Once on the left I work at mine 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.280
 Do not use hair spray with hair 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.079
 dries up 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.130
 but if you use hairspray then 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.570
 can you just do that again? 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.610
 fix with hairspray before and then 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.020
 Next, I take it 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.210
 once from the right side one 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.770
 streak turn the slightly and put 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.250
 the back of the Schonfrist 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.539
 stake out party and the same 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.420
 I'll do it on the other 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.209
 turn and take side again 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.010
 stuck behind and yes that was it 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.989
 then you already have one 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.519
 bit pinned looks backwards 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.959
 from the side of beautiful because that's just how 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.220
 a bit twisted you can front 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.859
 also like to pull out a few strands 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:30.000
 and then her look is done right for 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:32.830
 Werth hd it's perfect the second one 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.690
 Hairstyle is very nice too 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.370
 simple but somehow for me too 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.660
 always a good alternative on days where 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.550
 I did not wash my hair 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.380
 you need a scrunchy takes the 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.630
 hair on one side that you can you 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.490
 choose right or left does not matter and 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.180
 just makes you the top throughout 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.000
 normal braid 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.590
 then you share the above the hail 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.240
 hair in two share us and me now 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.340
 just goes through the fingers behind 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.260
 and just turn it over once 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.150
 through the back and then you have so 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.230
 a backflip or whatever you call it 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.420
 I think it always looks quite 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.770
 interesting from more beautiful than just in sap 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.270
 to wear and it is really very 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.620
 fast 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.330
 the third hairstyle is a bit 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.010
 elaborate I have to have one 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.180
 she wanted to do a separate tutorial 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.350
 but now like to once again with pure 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.160
 because I'm just very 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.680
 think nice 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.270
 and yes, it looks very very noble 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.130
 for that you have to be at the side as well 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.709
 and braid and needs such a hair 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.390
 Donath and then I link this to you 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.730
 other video but synonymous again turns 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.430
 you just strive from the top 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.140
 over the resin to the very top 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.150
 fits that their machines the hair 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.290
 distributed and also still times 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.940
 so press down a bit 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.920
 It also wrapped nice hard around it 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.780
 and then you just turn that one 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:42.340
 100 to the very top and if you are completely 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.630
 You can do it all up again 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.950
 fix that means if you have one more 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.420
 stranded you can do that 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.980
 stuck with a mobile 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.300
 I personally like it in a bit 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.620
 rather if everything is a bit different 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.630
 that looks like I'm pulling 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:58.239
 sometimes just another one in front 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:01.350
 Streak out or on the side and already 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.350
 the hairstyle is ready 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.910
 so that 's it we were done that were 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.830
 the three professors 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.270
 I hope you enjoyed it a lot 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.020
 imitate and see you at 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.020
 next time bye
