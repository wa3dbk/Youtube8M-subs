I think both ego and big time and make
some<00:05:03.700> very<00:05:03.910> good<00:05:04.090> points<00:05:04.300> ego<00:05:05.050> kind<00:05:05.740> of

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
some very good points ego kind of

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.230 
some very good points ego kind of
dragged<00:05:06.160> it<00:05:06.310> a<00:05:06.370> little<00:05:06.520> bit<00:05:06.760> saying<00:05:07.060> that<00:05:07.210> I

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
all these other maps that you put in the

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.700 
all these other maps that you put in the
game<00:05:12.910> like<00:05:13.120> the<00:05:13.180> DLC<00:05:13.630> maps<00:05:13.870> yes<00:05:14.440> it's<00:05:14.620> a

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
game like the DLC maps yes it's a

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.560 
game like the DLC maps yes it's a
problem<00:05:15.160> but<00:05:15.400> for<00:05:16.150> the<00:05:16.210> amount<00:05:16.330> of<00:05:16.510> money

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
problem but for the amount of money

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.300 
problem but for the amount of money
that's<00:05:16.840> on<00:05:17.050> the<00:05:17.139> line<00:05:17.440> and<00:05:17.710> on<00:05:17.830> the<00:05:17.950> table

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
um it's definitely something worth doing

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.390 
um it's definitely something worth doing
if<00:05:23.169> you<00:05:23.320> really<00:05:23.590> like<00:05:23.740> the<00:05:23.860> game<00:05:24.040> you're<00:05:24.250> going

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
if you really like the game you're going

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.950 
if you really like the game you're going
to<00:05:24.460> adapt<00:05:25.000> and<00:05:25.270> you're<00:05:25.419> going<00:05:25.570> to<00:05:25.660> overcome

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
to adapt and you're going to overcome

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.469 
to adapt and you're going to overcome
any<00:05:26.380> rule<00:05:26.650> sets<00:05:26.950> exact<00:05:27.400> for<00:05:27.970> example<00:05:28.360> like

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
any rule sets exact for example like

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.600 
any rule sets exact for example like
scorestreaks<00:05:29.110> you<00:05:29.800> know<00:05:29.919> nobody<00:05:30.340> wanted

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
scorestreaks you know nobody wanted

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:31.680 
scorestreaks you know nobody wanted
scorestreaks<00:05:31.030> in<00:05:31.150> the<00:05:31.240> beginning<00:05:31.360> I

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
scorestreaks in the beginning I

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.150 
scorestreaks in the beginning I
definitely<00:05:32.110> didn't<00:05:32.380> want<00:05:32.470> scorestreaks<00:05:33.039> I

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
definitely didn't want scorestreaks I

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.260 
definitely didn't want scorestreaks I
thought<00:05:33.370> they<00:05:33.460> were<00:05:33.520> the<00:05:33.610> worst<00:05:33.850> thing<00:05:34.060> to<00:05:34.120> put

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
thought they were the worst thing to put

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.240 
thought they were the worst thing to put
in<00:05:34.300> the<00:05:34.419> game<00:05:34.600> but<00:05:35.200> I<00:05:35.260> really<00:05:35.650> did<00:05:35.800> adapt<00:05:36.070> to

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
in the game but I really did adapt to

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.940 
in the game but I really did adapt to
them<00:05:36.400> and<00:05:36.669> I<00:05:36.729> kind<00:05:37.419> of<00:05:37.570> adjusted<00:05:38.560> my<00:05:38.680> playing

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
them and I kind of adjusted my playing

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.620 
them and I kind of adjusted my playing
style<00:05:39.039> to<00:05:39.490> them<00:05:39.610> and<00:05:39.850> I<00:05:39.940> kind<00:05:40.180> of<00:05:40.240> liked<00:05:40.450> them

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
style to them and I kind of liked them

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.450 
style to them and I kind of liked them
now<00:05:40.810> you<00:05:41.350> know<00:05:41.470> it<00:05:41.740> just<00:05:41.770> took<00:05:42.070> some<00:05:42.250> time<00:05:42.430> to

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
now you know it just took some time to

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.400 
now you know it just took some time to
grow<00:05:42.729> on<00:05:42.910> me<00:05:43.090> and<00:05:43.300> who<00:05:43.630> knows<00:05:43.780> maybe<00:05:43.840> some<00:05:44.320> of

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
grow on me and who knows maybe some of

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.380 
grow on me and who knows maybe some of
these<00:05:44.500> DLC<00:05:44.979> maps<00:05:45.250> and<00:05:45.490> cat<00:05:45.640> 40s<00:05:46.060> and<00:05:46.180> fowl<00:05:46.360> and

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
these DLC maps and cat 40s and fowl and

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.940 
these DLC maps and cat 40s and fowl and
all<00:05:46.660> this<00:05:46.750> other<00:05:46.900> stuff<00:05:47.050> that's<00:05:47.500> in<00:05:47.680> the<00:05:47.770> game

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
all this other stuff that's in the game

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.110 
all this other stuff that's in the game
that<00:05:47.979> I<00:05:48.160> don't<00:05:48.400> think<00:05:48.580> should<00:05:48.700> be<00:05:48.789> in<00:05:48.880> the<00:05:48.910> game

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
that I don't think should be in the game

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.600 
that I don't think should be in the game
will<00:05:49.720> grow<00:05:49.900> on<00:05:50.080> me<00:05:50.229> but<00:05:50.530> for<00:05:51.039> the<00:05:51.130> most<00:05:51.280> part<00:05:51.400> I

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
will grow on me but for the most part I

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:52.890 
will grow on me but for the most part I
think<00:05:51.640> we<00:05:51.850> should<00:05:51.880> be<00:05:52.150> grateful<00:05:52.390> for<00:05:52.630> what

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900

Vaughn uh you know I think they could go

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:27.600 
Vaughn uh you know I think they could go
about

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
about

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.040 
about
they<00:06:27.729> do<00:06:27.789> a<00:06:27.909> little<00:06:28.180> bit<00:06:28.330> differently<00:06:28.689> like<00:06:28.900> I

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
they do a little bit differently like I

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.330 
they do a little bit differently like I
said<00:06:29.289> I'm<00:06:29.379> not<00:06:29.409> going<00:06:29.680> to<00:06:29.740> tell<00:06:29.860> them<00:06:30.069> what<00:06:30.189> to

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.340 
said I'm not going to tell them what to

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.980 
said I'm not going to tell them what to
do<00:06:30.490> their<00:06:30.669> own<00:06:30.849> persons<00:06:31.449> they<00:06:31.539> can<00:06:31.719> make<00:06:31.840> their

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
do their own persons they can make their

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.350 
do their own persons they can make their
own<00:06:32.020> decisions<00:06:32.110> but<00:06:32.650> just<00:06:33.430> my<00:06:33.580> opinion<00:06:34.120> I'm

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
own decisions but just my opinion I'm

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.999 
own decisions but just my opinion I'm
not<00:06:34.539> speaking<00:06:34.900> for<00:06:35.050> anyone<00:06:35.349> else<00:06:35.500> I<00:06:35.740> think

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:36.009 
not speaking for anyone else I think

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:37.619 
not speaking for anyone else I think
some<00:06:36.580> of<00:06:36.610> the<00:06:36.759> stuff<00:06:37.000> that's<00:06:37.180> in<00:06:37.300> the<00:06:37.449> game

00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:37.629 
some of the stuff that's in the game

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:39.990 
some of the stuff that's in the game
needs<00:06:37.870> to<00:06:38.050> go<00:06:38.229> and<00:06:38.560> I<00:06:38.979> think<00:06:39.340> somebody<00:06:39.819> needs

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 
needs to go and I think somebody needs

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.820 
needs to go and I think somebody needs
to<00:06:40.180> speak<00:06:40.449> up<00:06:40.659> and<00:06:40.930> needs<00:06:41.199> to<00:06:41.349> get<00:06:41.469> a<00:06:41.500> hold<00:06:41.740> of

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
to speak up and needs to get a hold of

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.850 
to speak up and needs to get a hold of
on<00:06:42.009> to<00:06:42.159> heart<00:06:42.340> before<00:06:43.500> competitive<00:06:44.500> call<00:06:44.740> of

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
on to heart before competitive call of

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.350 
on to heart before competitive call of
duty<00:06:45.099> gets<00:06:45.370> to<00:06:45.520> the<00:06:45.610> point<00:06:45.789> where<00:06:46.090> it's<00:06:46.210> not

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 
duty gets to the point where it's not

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.029 
duty gets to the point where it's not
even<00:06:46.599> competitive<00:06:46.870> anymore<00:06:47.439> I<00:06:47.469> feel<00:06:47.830> like

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:48.039 
even competitive anymore I feel like

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:50.700 
even competitive anymore I feel like
going<00:06:48.849> from<00:06:48.969> black<00:06:49.210> ops<00:06:49.509> 2<00:06:49.870> this<00:06:50.139> game<00:06:50.409> there's

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:50.710 
going from black ops 2 this game there's

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.439 
going from black ops 2 this game there's
so<00:06:50.889> much<00:06:51.009> more<00:06:51.280> extra<00:06:51.639> stuff<00:06:51.909> that<00:06:52.150> shouldn't

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:52.449 
so much more extra stuff that shouldn't

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:54.420 
so much more extra stuff that shouldn't
be<00:06:52.629> in<00:06:52.659> the<00:06:52.840> game<00:06:53.050> and<00:06:53.289> I<00:06:53.710> don't<00:06:53.889> think<00:06:54.099> it<00:06:54.219> does

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.430 
be in the game and I don't think it does

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.550 
be in the game and I don't think it does
make<00:06:54.669> it<00:06:54.819> entertaining<00:06:54.939> I<00:06:55.569> think<00:06:55.840> it<00:06:56.020> on<00:06:56.199> I

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 
make it entertaining I think it on I

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.740 
make it entertaining I think it on I
think<00:06:57.250> it's<00:06:57.400> an<00:06:57.490> excuse<00:06:57.909> that<00:06:58.150> people<00:06:58.419> use<00:06:58.719> to

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:58.750 
think it's an excuse that people use to

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.689 
think it's an excuse that people use to
make<00:06:59.050> the<00:06:59.169> game<00:06:59.319> more<00:06:59.349> entertaining<00:06:59.889> but<00:07:00.639> i

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:00.699 
make the game more entertaining but i

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:02.820 
make the game more entertaining but i
think<00:07:00.969> the<00:07:01.060> game<00:07:01.270> itself<00:07:01.740> just<00:07:02.740> the

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
think the game itself just the

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.409 
think the game itself just the
simplicity<00:07:03.219> of<00:07:03.520> the<00:07:03.669> game<00:07:03.849> can<00:07:04.389> be

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:04.419 
simplicity of the game can be

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:05.999 
simplicity of the game can be
entertaining<00:07:04.779> you<00:07:05.229> just<00:07:05.409> need<00:07:05.560> to<00:07:05.650> be<00:07:05.740> able<00:07:05.830> to

00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:06.009 
entertaining you just need to be able to

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:08.070 
entertaining you just need to be able to
market<00:07:06.370> it<00:07:06.490> well<00:07:06.699> and<00:07:06.939> I<00:07:07.539> think<00:07:07.569> that's<00:07:07.960> what

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 
market it well and I think that's what

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.969 
market it well and I think that's what
they<00:07:08.169> need<00:07:08.319> to<00:07:08.349> do<00:07:08.500> I<00:07:08.529> think<00:07:08.770> they<00:07:08.830> need<00:07:08.949> to

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:08.979 
they need to do I think they need to

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:10.559 
they need to do I think they need to
focus<00:07:09.159> more<00:07:09.490> marketing<00:07:10.000> the<00:07:10.090> game<00:07:10.270> and

00:07:10.559 --> 00:07:10.569 
focus more marketing the game and

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:12.899 
focus more marketing the game and
advertising<00:07:11.379> the<00:07:11.469> game<00:07:11.680> itself<00:07:12.039> then<00:07:12.490> adding

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:12.909 
advertising the game itself then adding

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:14.640 
advertising the game itself then adding
all<00:07:13.029> these<00:07:13.150> extra<00:07:13.509> perks<00:07:13.900> to<00:07:14.139> make<00:07:14.259> it<00:07:14.439> seem

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:14.650 
all these extra perks to make it seem

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.559 
all these extra perks to make it seem
like<00:07:14.830> it's<00:07:15.069> the<00:07:15.219> game<00:07:15.400> out<00:07:15.550> of<00:07:15.610> the<00:07:15.759> box<00:07:15.969> if

00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:16.569 
like it's the game out of the box if

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:18.809 
like it's the game out of the box if
that<00:07:16.810> makes<00:07:16.990> any<00:07:17.050> sense<00:07:17.199> so<00:07:17.680> anyways<00:07:18.610> it's

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:18.819 
that makes any sense so anyways it's

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:20.339
