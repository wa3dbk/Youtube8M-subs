 about sports topics very much 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:52.920
 130 fans retired to my cell with 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.780
 what is the connection of such a number of programs 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.859
 framed the beginning of the match is not tanos 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.859
 Until I think that everything is taught 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:16.170
 serious evil always restructure 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.250
 why did Malkin have an attack 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.810
 everything is fine problem advocates 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:49.810
 serious so with health don't know people 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:53.100
 i.e. an option for attacking 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.100
 from attackers go defense 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:30.380
 in the team ayfonchik little by little we 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:33.920
 we create a team that because 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:38.230
 when still an image though all of them for the first time without 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.230
 the creatures of hell cost and take away after 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.300
 cooling down pause unnecessarily 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.610
 noticed that 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.820
 frame orig tactics for which 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:03:00.160
 the spark is revealed once you can 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:02.660
 many will use memory cards 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:08.090
 a little listened to others you can 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.950
 play and left and right and center in 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.820
 first you need to call and agree 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.830
 already to this same thing that people use 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.200
 men everywhere 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:21.010
 i started stopping well here's just one 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.959
 the question is purely hypothetical 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.540
 refused Malkin you will be considered 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.180
 someone from the defenders who are now 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:33.170
 can finish this night or all the same 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.890
 he knows his chance is a chance Krishna 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.650
 of all 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.650
 I have high hopes 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:50.850
 collapsible conical prize psychological 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:54.900
 litter such an environment still can not be such 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.900
 2 no video lair 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:07.980
 the question is why not, here you are 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.540
 see problems should immediately 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.140
 absolutely no air for what he 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.140
 calmly 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:39.610
 then this is a must see and not a man 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:46.270
 really pay much attention or 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:48.780
