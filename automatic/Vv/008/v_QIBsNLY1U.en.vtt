have<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:16.440> make<00:02:16.560> your<00:02:16.740> own<00:02:16.860> conclusions<00:02:17.490> for

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
have to make your own conclusions for

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.830 
have to make your own conclusions for
that<00:02:19.069> so<00:02:20.069> this<00:02:20.760> is<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:21.030> packaging<00:02:21.510> this<00:02:21.660> is

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
that so this is the packaging this is

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.199 
that so this is the packaging this is
the<00:02:22.050> case<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:23.340> now<00:02:23.550> let's<00:02:23.700> see<00:02:23.819> if<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:23.970> can<00:02:24.120> do

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
the case and now let's see if I can do

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.540 
the case and now let's see if I can do
this<00:02:24.330> with<00:02:24.510> one<00:02:24.750> hand<00:02:26.000> it's<00:02:27.000> just<00:02:27.090> uh<00:02:28.459> it's<00:02:29.459> a

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
this with one hand it's just uh it's a

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.960 
this with one hand it's just uh it's a
latch<00:02:29.760> okay<00:02:30.360> here<00:02:30.750> we<00:02:30.840> go

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
latch okay here we go

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.809 
latch okay here we go
so<00:02:33.140> this<00:02:34.140> is<00:02:34.230> what<00:02:34.350> it<00:02:34.440> comes<00:02:34.560> with<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:35.100> if<00:02:35.700> you

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
so this is what it comes with and if you

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.360 
so this is what it comes with and if you
look<00:02:35.970> these<00:02:36.720> are<00:02:36.989> two<00:02:37.260> extra<00:02:37.680> nibs<00:02:37.920> it's<00:02:38.190> got

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
look these are two extra nibs it's got

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.330 
look these are two extra nibs it's got
space<00:02:38.819> for<00:02:39.260> three<00:02:40.260> others<00:02:40.620> this<00:02:41.459> is<00:02:41.700> where<00:02:41.940> the

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
space for three others this is where the

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.380 
space for three others this is where the
quadruple<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.520> battery<00:02:45.950> comes

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390

size<00:04:22.049> of<00:04:22.260> it<00:04:22.349> right<00:04:22.500> now

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.220 

so<00:04:26.490> there<00:04:26.730> it<00:04:26.820> is<00:04:27.200> and<00:04:28.200> let<00:04:28.410> me<00:04:28.530> just<00:04:28.560> grab<00:04:30.230> this

so there it is and let me just grab this
is<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:32.750> art<00:04:33.750> pin<00:04:34.110> that<00:04:34.350> this<00:04:34.470> is<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:35.280> art

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
is the art pin that this is the the art

is the art pin that this is the the art
pen<00:04:37.130> for<00:04:38.130> the<00:04:38.190> intros<00:04:38.670> tablets<00:04:39.920> so<00:04:40.920> you<00:04:41.010> can

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
pen for the intros tablets so you can

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.440 
pen for the intros tablets so you can
see<00:04:41.370> it's<00:04:41.550> it's<00:04:41.820> fairly<00:04:42.030> similar<00:04:43.610> I<00:04:44.610> have<00:04:45.120> the

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
see it's it's fairly similar I have the

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:53.560 
see it's it's fairly similar I have the
big<00:04:46.350> bamboo<00:04:49.670> that's<00:04:50.670> the<00:04:51.030> bamboo<00:04:51.540> duo<00:04:52.170> stylus

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
big bamboo that's the bamboo duo stylus

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.320 
big bamboo that's the bamboo duo stylus
so<00:04:54.570> let<00:04:54.990> me<00:04:55.080> just<00:04:55.610> switch<00:04:56.610> the<00:04:56.880> points<00:04:57.240> around

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
so let me just switch the points around

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.080 
so let me just switch the points around
and<00:04:57.690> line<00:04:57.810> it<00:04:57.840> up<00:04:58.050> for<00:04:58.350> you

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
and line it up for you

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.600 
and line it up for you
so<00:05:00.090> you<00:05:00.150> can<00:05:00.360> get<00:05:00.510> a<00:05:00.540> size<00:05:01.500> comparison<00:05:01.530> to<00:05:02.370> it

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
so you can get a size comparison to it

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.170 
so you can get a size comparison to it
very<00:05:03.450> nice<00:05:03.810> it's<00:05:04.200> very<00:05:04.290> similar<00:05:04.800> to<00:05:04.950> the<00:05:05.340> size

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
very nice it's very similar to the size

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.840 
very nice it's very similar to the size
you<00:05:08.060> can<00:05:09.060> see<00:05:09.090> that<00:05:09.600> that<00:05:10.230> looks<00:05:10.410> good<00:05:11.100> and

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
you can see that that looks good and

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.650 
you can see that that looks good and
just<00:05:12.330> for<00:05:12.570> another<00:05:12.840> comparison<00:05:13.350> I'll<00:05:13.560> put<00:05:13.770> a

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
just for another comparison I'll put a

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.280 
just for another comparison I'll put a
one<00:05:15.660> of<00:05:15.810> the<00:05:15.900> cheaper<00:05:16.230> ones<00:05:16.260> this<00:05:16.680> is<00:05:16.740> a<00:05:18.290> that's

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
one of the cheaper ones this is a that's

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.990 
one of the cheaper ones this is a that's
a<00:05:19.350> lot<00:05:19.410> it's<00:05:19.650> a<00:05:19.770> fifteen<00:05:20.280> dollar<00:05:20.490> one<00:05:20.820> that<00:05:20.970> I

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
a lot it's a fifteen dollar one that I

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.260 
a lot it's a fifteen dollar one that I
bought<00:05:21.270> somewhere<00:05:22.190> and<00:05:24.380> the<00:05:25.380> tip<00:05:25.740> size

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
bought somewhere and the tip size

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.240 
bought somewhere and the tip size
interestingly<00:05:27.270> I<00:05:27.870> I<00:05:28.110> thought<00:05:28.560> the<00:05:28.830> tip<00:05:29.010> size

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
interestingly I I thought the tip size

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.580 
interestingly I I thought the tip size
was<00:05:29.520> going<00:05:29.700> to<00:05:29.760> be<00:05:29.910> larger<00:05:30.450> but<00:05:31.080> they've<00:05:31.260> kept

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
was going to be larger but they've kept

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.110 
was going to be larger but they've kept
the<00:05:31.770> tip<00:05:31.950> size<00:05:33.380> the<00:05:34.380> same<00:05:34.710> size<00:05:35.190> if<00:05:35.580> not<00:05:35.610> it

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
the tip size the same size if not it

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.340 
the tip size the same size if not it
looks<00:05:36.300> like<00:05:36.540> it<00:05:36.690> may<00:05:36.900> be<00:05:36.960> a<00:05:37.080> tad<00:05:37.470> smaller<00:05:38.300> than

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
looks like it may be a tad smaller than

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:47.780 
looks like it may be a tad smaller than
the<00:05:42.590> bamboo<00:05:43.590> so<00:05:45.260> it's<00:05:46.260> uh<00:05:46.380> it's<00:05:47.370> just<00:05:47.640> as

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
the bamboo so it's uh it's just as

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.810 
the bamboo so it's uh it's just as
accurate<00:05:48.330> as<00:05:48.480> the<00:05:48.720> bamboo<00:05:49.110> it's<00:05:49.650> it's<00:05:50.490> it

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
accurate as the bamboo it's it's it

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.360 
accurate as the bamboo it's it's it
feels<00:05:51.120> really<00:05:51.510> great<00:05:51.840> to<00:05:52.050> draw<00:05:52.260> with<00:05:52.530> on<00:05:53.220> the

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
feels really great to draw with on the

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.580 
feels really great to draw with on the
iPad<00:05:55.340> it's<00:05:56.340> just<00:05:56.610> that<00:05:56.960> so<00:05:57.960> far<00:05:58.350> my

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
iPad it's just that so far my

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.159 
iPad it's just that so far my
impressions<00:05:59.190> are<00:05:59.400> are<00:05:59.669> really<00:06:00.480> really<00:06:01.020> good

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
impressions are are really really good

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:08.810 
impressions are are really really good
for<00:06:01.230> this<00:06:03.110> it's<00:06:04.110> not<00:06:04.350> bad<00:06:04.620> at<00:06:04.830> all<00:06:07.580> so<00:06:08.580> that's

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
for this it's not bad at all so that's

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.810 
for this it's not bad at all so that's
the<00:06:09.060> overall<00:06:09.270> design<00:06:09.570> of<00:06:09.960> it<00:06:10.370> in<00:06:11.370> the<00:06:11.490> second

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
the overall design of it in the second

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.640 
the overall design of it in the second
video<00:06:11.910> I'm<00:06:12.150> gonna<00:06:12.330> go<00:06:12.510> over<00:06:12.870> hooking<00:06:13.260> it<00:06:13.500> up

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650
