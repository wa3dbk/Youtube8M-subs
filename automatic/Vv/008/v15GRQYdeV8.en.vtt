00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.300
 Admit that coming forward to 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.950
 agreement that since the launch of the 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.689
 previous game have you had expansions 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.580
 to take you to the mouth but a new 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.310
 delivery of the sims is not any 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.430
 foolishness the opposite is all a 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.430
 event 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.180
 this time we have a release 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.250
 that tries to reproduce all the 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.990
 depth of the saga to date and 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.239
 that at the same time seeks to make it more 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:43.620
 accessible and comfortable for everyone 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.620
 a true challenge 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.990
 you know what this is about is not about 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.490
 directing the fate of normal people 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.920
 and currents in the adventures and 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.720
 misadventures that live in their day to day and 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.630
 everything as it is logical begins with the 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.220
 creation process of these creatures 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.530
 we can design physically and mentally to 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.510
 a family or independent individuals 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.400
 and even though the base comes to be what 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.390
 always the truth is that there are many 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.390
 small changes 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.100
 to start everything can be managed 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.780
 Now stretching and pushing the 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.570
 different parts of the body and 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.970
 face a longer nose a forehead 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.130
 prominent less marked lips 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.110
 whatever we decide is in 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.640
 our hands and although at the moment 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.380
 There are many options for hairstyles or 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.780
 accessories we trust that the 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.409
 future expansions expand significantly 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.409
 this part 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.630
 choose the clothes that will take our 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.789
 character in the different 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.070
 circumstances of his life will also be 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.470
 fundamental and once decided everything 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.079
 cosmetic we will begin to outline how it is going 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.119
 to be mentally for this we have 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.860
 your aspirations that are going to define what 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.229
 is what attracts you to life and that they go 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.899
 to be of great importance something else 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.579
 I want details like the traits for 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.500
 finish shaping your psyche with what 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.600
 what he likes and what he does not like and also others 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.979
 relevant nuances such as how 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.979
 walk or talk our sim 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.739
 the creation tool is pretty 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.810
 conservative and the same we can say of 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:24.319
 everything that happens when we take the leap 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:26.120
 to the world of the sims 4 the new 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.370
 video game is divided again between the 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.319
 construction and life are both 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.720
 great pillars of the work of maxis and 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.250
 they return to intertwine with mastery to the 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.260
 time to build our house or 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.060
 decorate it and the conclusions are those of 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.860
 comfort above novelty 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.410
 its creators have wanted what 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.750
 old was somewhat crude is now up 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.000
 extreme unsuspected and us without 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.010
 doubt we appreciate it now not only 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.049
 we can assemble complete rooms if 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.760
 is what we want but also the 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.920
 lengthen and we take with the same 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.690
 comfort that in the editor since or 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.790
 also rotate complete stays 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.709
 remember that before expanding your house 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.989
 it was a real hell moving from 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.420
 here and there furniture and wall is now 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.079
 It could not be simpler and that's all 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.079
 a triumph 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.470
 yes, if we are those players of the 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.480
 old school that enjoy each 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.340
 instant of the experience without and want 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.740
 have everything under control always 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.540
 we can do everything by hand is still 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.580
 just as fun to amass money for 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.290
 buy a bigger and prettier house 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.480
 in which to accommodate our parties 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.520
 or our family and all of this through 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.530
 in a living way that also observes 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.080
 some changes to make it all more 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.180
 simple the interface is smaller and the 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.280
 principle will cost us to get used to 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.500
 but soon we will realize that it is 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.660
 everything is right, everything is hidden or 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.160
 expands according to our wishes and 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.060
 it lets us rejoice in what is 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.060
 shows on screen 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.500
 on the other hand in the sims 4 what of 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.270
 it really matters is the aspiration that 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.340
 we have chosen and that will cause what 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.460
 we are attracted to sorrows be things like 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.940
 cult to the physical and relationships with 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:08.220
 others 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.220
 or art among many other things 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.660
 this assumes that we are free to do what 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.060
 that we want although if we follow our 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.889
 interests our sim will be happier and 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.690
 we will have many rewards 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.699
 What is non-negotiable is that 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.010
 no simple like to be alone anymore 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:25.570
 we know that they are social animals like 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.970
 there are always many ways to 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.800
 relate and they are all very fun 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.660
 we are left with the 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.270
 sentimental that are the most demanding 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.680
 but also the most entertaining 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.440
 thanks to them we can find a 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.840
 half orange form a family and good 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.800
 you know those other cool things that 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.800
 they also go with the pack 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.900
 although this time there are many more options 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.880
 to talk and so that everything goes well 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.620
 you have to take into account the tastes of the 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.540
 another person who at first did not 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.640
 we will know all this supposed to do 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.230
 friends is not as easy as before 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.390
 that along the way we will do the odd 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.220
 enemy but it is a success that 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.050
 so we can talk and do other things 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.000
 at the same time and also the phone 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.300
 mobile puts everyone to our 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.300
 scope 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.670
 and the sims 4 may not provide large 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.680
 changes to the formula brings with it 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.450
 some bugs and neither is it an advance 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.250
 brutal in the visual but improves the 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.140
 result of its predecessor almost to 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.180
 any level is one more game 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.790
 striking in animations has trimmed 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:28.220
 size with head to be more fluid and 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.900
 It also exudes sympathy and comfort 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.180
 the four sides in terms of their 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.580
 handling the new thing of maxis is a title 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.350
 addictive enjoyable and that thanks to their 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.090
 hours of play and the community is going to 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:42.280
 last a very long time has installed 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.280
 our team there is much more to ask
