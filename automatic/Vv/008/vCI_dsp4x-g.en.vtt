nine times faster you'll really notice

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.080 
nine times faster you'll really notice
this<00:04:50.760> in<00:04:50.970> games<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.600> apps<00:04:51.990> that<00:04:52.229> use<00:04:52.350> a<00:04:52.380> lot

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
this in games and apps that use a lot

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.050 
this in games and apps that use a lot
and<00:04:53.270> for<00:04:54.199> the<00:04:54.320> first<00:04:54.500> time<00:04:54.710> we<00:04:55.250> built<00:04:55.490> a<00:04:55.610> gyro

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
and for the first time we built a gyro

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.570 
and for the first time we built a gyro
into<00:04:56.360> this<00:04:56.510> iPad<00:04:57.020> that<00:04:57.860> gives<00:04:58.130> you<00:04:58.280> very

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
into this iPad that gives you very

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.640 
into this iPad that gives you very
precise<00:04:59.030> control<00:04:59.630> in<00:04:59.840> multiple<00:05:00.500> dimensions

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
precise control in multiple dimensions

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.550 
precise control in multiple dimensions
and<00:05:01.280> it<00:05:01.580> allows<00:05:01.820> us<00:05:02.090> to<00:05:02.479> really<00:05:02.780> measure<00:05:03.199> the

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
and it allows us to really measure the

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.760 
and it allows us to really measure the
orientation<00:05:04.340> of<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.490> iPad<00:05:05.000> in<00:05:05.150> space<00:05:05.770> these

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770

new<00:05:07.010> components<00:05:07.639> and<00:05:07.760> features<00:05:07.940> add<00:05:08.449> all

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
new components and features add all

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.110 
new components and features add all
kinds<00:05:08.960> of<00:05:09.410> possibilities<00:05:09.610> when<00:05:10.610> it<00:05:10.699> comes<00:05:10.940> to

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
kinds of possibilities when it comes to

kinds of possibilities when it comes to
apps<00:05:11.270> and<00:05:11.630> even<00:05:12.470> though<00:05:12.590> we<00:05:12.770> boosted<00:05:13.160> the

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
apps and even though we boosted the

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.340 
apps and even though we boosted the
performance<00:05:13.850> we<00:05:14.150> haven't<00:05:14.570> compromised<00:05:15.139> on

battery life the new ipad still gets a
full<00:05:18.350> 10<00:05:18.620> hours<00:05:18.979> and<00:05:19.250> that's<00:05:19.729> a<00:05:19.910> major

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
full 10 hours and that's a major

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.000 
full 10 hours and that's a major

with<00:05:22.610> all<00:05:22.790> that<00:05:22.940> we've<00:05:23.060> added<00:05:23.240> to<00:05:23.360> iPad<00:05:23.810> to<00:05:24.050> a

smart<00:05:30.919> cover<00:05:31.160> this<00:05:31.580> really<00:05:31.880> is<00:05:32.150> a<00:05:32.389> giant<00:05:32.690> leap

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930

forward

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.580 

the<00:05:36.500> original<00:05:37.009> iPad<00:05:37.509> defined<00:05:38.509> a<00:05:38.720> category<00:05:39.320> and

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
the original iPad defined a category and

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.159 
the original iPad defined a category and
I<00:05:40.400> think<00:05:40.669> that<00:05:40.850> the<00:05:40.940> ipad<00:05:41.060> 2<00:05:41.630> will<00:05:41.900> really

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
I think that the ipad 2 will really

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:47.830 
I think that the ipad 2 will really
define<00:05:42.590> a<00:05:42.620> category<00:05:43.340> for<00:05:43.639> years<00:05:43.880> to<00:05:43.970> come

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840
