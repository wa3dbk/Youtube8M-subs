00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
well attitude instead of just a

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.539 
well attitude instead of just a
traditional<00:01:42.350> G<00:01:42.859> chord<00:01:43.100> gives<00:01:43.280> me<00:01:43.369> a<00:01:43.399> little

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
traditional G chord gives me a little

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.859 
traditional G chord gives me a little
bit<00:01:43.700> more<00:01:43.820> flavor

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869

the<00:01:46.869> difference<00:01:47.229> there<00:01:47.380> right<00:01:47.649> so<00:01:48.460> we<00:01:48.520> got<00:01:48.609> the

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
the difference there right so we got the

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.930 
the difference there right so we got the
G<00:01:48.880> chord

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
G chord

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.240
