00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:06.809
 Here we are and welcome back to my channels 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:09.610
 new with ios 7 today a video dedicated to 

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:13.660
 series therefore of all the innovations it has 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:16.449
 introduced sirÃ©n in ios 7 practically 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.630
 silicon ios 7 has practically a new one 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:23.339
 look and now he knows how to do many things 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.339
 new we go immediately to greet 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.789
 hello siri perfect as you see the 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.300
 graphics have changed because there is this 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.190
 kind of transparency that hides everything 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.560
 what 's behind us though how 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.920
 see you can almost see the 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.750
 iconic we have on the home below a 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.160
 left we can go and see them all 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.560
 the things we can ask for 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.540
 to the apple home voice assistant like 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.250
 for example that the classic calls e 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.560
 write a message the opening of 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.550
 an application now there is also the 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.530
 possible as you see to see the tweets 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.200
 facebook practically send an e-mail 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.150
 time the bag the clock the notes e 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.659
 above all we could also go now 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.460
 to set the settings now 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.100
 let's go immediately to see another thing 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.690
 there is also integration with wikipedia 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.880
 now let's do some tests like this 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.880
 let's see how it works 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:30.400
 active perfect wifi you see how 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:35.950
 Easily activated the wifi setting 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:38.530
 and screen brightness here's it here 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.170
 practically with the bar to adjust 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.549
 display brightness 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:49.619
 let's see an integration instead 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:49.619
 with wikipedia how many inhabitants in Rome 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.720
 perfect you see opens the screen of 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.540
 wikipedia tells us some information 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.729
 already directly the serious and then we can 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.500
 go and consult all that 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.659
 we want directly on the page 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.270
 another source 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.759
 obviously also bing then really 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.370
 very fast and above all without going 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.690
 open safari and has therefore precisely 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.160
 Internet 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.890
 let's see for example another thing 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:23.090
 we can see I don't know for example 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.090
 the clock tomorrow wake me up at 7 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:33.150
 perfect you see compared to before as vi 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:35.489
 I said aires 7 then resolved 7 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.640
 seems to me to be much more 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.310
 quick to respond so it seems 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.500
 be especially easier to 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.720
 consult because he understands better 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.540
 our words because it often happened to me 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.959
 on ios 6 you have to repeat more than one 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.180
 once the command seems to me instead 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.920
 siri suoi s7 is really much more 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.150
 lending much faster in the 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.010
 reply 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.079
 one thing I do n't know if you've noticed better 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.840
 heard that the voice seems to me more 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.370
 natural before it was a bit more robotic a 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.900
 my opinion was really much more 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.970
 natural if I'm not mistaken they arrived 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.440
 even the new entries though as far as 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.180
 concerns English the French the 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.400
 German both male and female I hope 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.060
 that they be implemented as soon as possible 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.380
 also here on the version of course 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.319
 localized in Italian 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:26.370
 let's see for example another thing 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:34.310
 we can for example see on the 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:37.079
 repudiation of the Second World War ok 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.900
 perfect you see makes us see where 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:42.480
 we can go all that precisely 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.579
 we can go to consult with 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.829
 images and so on 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.380
 so in my opinion it was resolved 7 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:52.139
 really more handsome voice more 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.690
 faster natural to respond to 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:56.519
 our commands obviously very useful 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.630
 especially for enabling and disabling 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.639
 commands for example I show 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:04.200
 another thing 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:06.750
 enable perfect bluetooth you see 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.120
 activated the bluetooth really a lot 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.990
 fast let me know instead how you do it 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.970
 state 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:17.360
 trying and what impression it is giving you 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.360
 serums on ios 7 at the next video
