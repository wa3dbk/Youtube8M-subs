today<00:00:04.870> I'm<00:00:04.990> going<00:00:05.080> to<00:00:05.140> show<00:00:05.290> you<00:00:05.319> how<00:00:05.440> to<00:00:05.470> tie

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:05.710 
today I'm going to show you how to tie

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.889 
today I'm going to show you how to tie
up<00:00:05.859> a<00:00:06.040> dry<00:00:06.340> drop<00:00:06.790> or<00:00:06.939> set<00:00:07.120> up<00:00:07.240> and<00:00:07.450> what<00:00:07.720> that

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:07.899 
up a dry drop or set up and what that

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.170 
up a dry drop or set up and what that
means<00:00:08.140> is<00:00:08.440> you<00:00:08.769> have<00:00:08.800> a<00:00:08.950> dry<00:00:09.220> fly<00:00:09.490> as<00:00:09.760> your<00:00:10.030> lead

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:10.180 
means is you have a dry fly as your lead

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.789 
means is you have a dry fly as your lead
fly<00:00:10.450> and<00:00:10.750> that<00:00:10.900> can<00:00:11.050> act<00:00:11.230> as<00:00:11.410> somewhat<00:00:11.650> of<00:00:11.740> a

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:11.799 
fly and that can act as somewhat of a

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:13.589 
fly and that can act as somewhat of a
strike<00:00:12.009> indicator<00:00:12.490> or<00:00:12.610> float<00:00:12.820> and<00:00:13.030> then<00:00:13.480> you

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:13.599 
strike indicator or float and then you

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.900 
strike indicator or float and then you
could<00:00:13.750> have<00:00:13.900> an<00:00:14.019> in<00:00:14.230> with<00:00:14.440> sinks<00:00:15.040> behind<00:00:15.490> that

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 
could have an in with sinks behind that

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.550 
could have an in with sinks behind that
dry<00:00:16.120> fly<00:00:16.390> and<00:00:16.660> this<00:00:17.080> is<00:00:17.260> going<00:00:17.380> to<00:00:17.440> be

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
dry fly and this is going to be

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.650 
dry fly and this is going to be
extremely<00:00:17.830> helpful<00:00:18.250> for<00:00:18.640> beginning<00:00:19.210> anglers

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
extremely helpful for beginning anglers

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.849 
extremely helpful for beginning anglers
that<00:00:19.930> maybe<00:00:20.140> have<00:00:20.380> never<00:00:20.529> thought<00:00:20.800> about

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:20.859 
that maybe have never thought about

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:22.769 
that maybe have never thought about
running<00:00:21.369> a<00:00:21.430> dry<00:00:21.640> flight<00:00:21.910> and<00:00:22.180> an<00:00:22.240> imp<00:00:22.449> together

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
running a dry flight and an imp together

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.689 
running a dry flight and an imp together
and<00:00:23.380> I<00:00:23.470> probably<00:00:23.679> have<00:00:23.859> a<00:00:23.949> few<00:00:24.130> tips<00:00:24.310> hidden<00:00:24.609> in

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699 
and I probably have a few tips hidden in

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.480 
and I probably have a few tips hidden in
here<00:00:24.880> that<00:00:25.660> advanced<00:00:26.199> anglers<00:00:26.590> can<00:00:27.130> feed<00:00:27.340> off

here that advanced anglers can feed off

here that advanced anglers can feed off
of<00:00:27.699> to<00:00:27.849> some<00:00:28.090> advice<00:00:28.359> on<00:00:28.599> fishing<00:00:29.470> it<00:00:29.740> not<00:00:29.920> just

Boyet dry fly I just happen to have a
variation<00:00:35.590> of<00:00:35.620> internal<00:00:35.950> and<00:00:36.160> it's<00:00:36.400> called<00:00:36.550> a

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
variation of internal and it's called a

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.460 
variation of internal and it's called a
red<00:00:36.760> wing<00:00:37.000> thing<00:00:37.300> so<00:00:37.900> we<00:00:38.020> happen<00:00:38.290> to<00:00:38.320> be

part you can pivot off of that a little

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.940 
part you can pivot off of that a little
bit<00:00:48.880> but<00:00:49.480> you<00:00:49.630> want<00:00:49.660> a<00:00:49.930> relatively<00:00:50.470> short

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
heavy leader to get good turnover

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.940 
heavy leader to get good turnover
because<00:00:52.690> by<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.050> time<00:00:53.260> this<00:00:53.410> is<00:00:53.560> all<00:00:53.680> set<00:00:53.920> up

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.110 
because by the time this is all set up
you're<00:00:54.280> going<00:00:54.370> to<00:00:54.430> have<00:00:54.550> a<00:00:54.580> little<00:00:54.790> bit<00:00:54.970> of<00:00:55.060> a

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
you're going to have a little bit of a

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.150 
you're going to have a little bit of a
load<00:00:55.330> on<00:00:55.510> there<00:00:55.750> it<00:00:56.290> needs<00:00:56.440> to<00:00:56.560> turn<00:00:56.710> over<00:00:56.980> well

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160

load on there it needs to turn over well
the<00:00:58.120> tip<00:00:58.300> and<00:00:58.420> I'm<00:00:58.510> going<00:00:58.660> to<00:00:58.720> use<00:00:58.900> is<00:00:59.530> 4x

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
the tip and I'm going to use is 4x

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.150 
the tip and I'm going to use is 4x
floral<00:01:00.490> flex<00:01:00.730> plus<00:01:01.060> and<00:01:01.420> I'm<00:01:02.110> going<00:01:02.230> to<00:01:02.290> run<00:01:02.470> my

floral flex plus and I'm going to run my

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.570 
floral flex plus and I'm going to run my
dropper<00:01:03.610> about<00:01:03.989> 18<00:01:04.989> to<00:01:05.110> 24<00:01:05.560> inches<00:01:05.590> down<00:01:06.040> now

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
dropper about 18 to 24 inches down now

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.700 
dropper about 18 to 24 inches down now
when<00:01:07.509> you<00:01:07.630> set<00:01:07.869> up<00:01:07.899> your<00:01:08.140> dropper<00:01:08.530> length

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
when you set up your dropper length

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:09.929 
when you set up your dropper length
there's<00:01:08.920> a<00:01:08.979> couple<00:01:09.189> of<00:01:09.310> decisions<00:01:09.729> you<00:01:09.880> have

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
there's a couple of decisions you have

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:11.940 
there's a couple of decisions you have
to<00:01:10.090> bake<00:01:10.390> if<00:01:10.899> you're<00:01:11.170> in<00:01:11.289> a<00:01:11.350> really<00:01:11.530> fast

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
to bake if you're in a really fast

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.219 
to bake if you're in a really fast
technical<00:01:12.579> currents<00:01:13.060> you<00:01:13.659> want<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:13.929> keep<00:01:14.079> your

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
technical currents you want to keep your

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.590 
technical currents you want to keep your
dropper<00:01:14.619> a<00:01:14.770> little<00:01:15.100> bit<00:01:15.219> closer<00:01:15.609> or<00:01:16.090> shorter

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
dropper a little bit closer or shorter

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.539 
dropper a little bit closer or shorter
so<00:01:17.109> that<00:01:17.229> your<00:01:17.469> nymph<00:01:17.710> will<00:01:17.799> ride<00:01:18.070> a<00:01:18.369> little

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
so that your nymph will ride a little

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.039 
so that your nymph will ride a little
bit<00:01:18.670> closer<00:01:18.969> to<00:01:19.179> this<00:01:19.270> drive<00:01:19.509> line<00:01:19.719> you<00:01:19.869> keep

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
bit closer to this drive line you keep

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:21.510 
bit closer to this drive line you keep
track<00:01:20.320> of<00:01:20.380> it<00:01:20.649> you<00:01:20.829> can<00:01:20.950> imagine<00:01:21.130> if<00:01:21.399> this

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
track of it you can imagine if this

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.370 
track of it you can imagine if this
dropper<00:01:21.939> was<00:01:22.090> three<00:01:22.299> or<00:01:22.420> four<00:01:22.570> feet<00:01:22.749> long<00:01:22.990> and

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
dropper was three or four feet long and

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.349 
dropper was three or four feet long and
you<00:01:23.799> cast<00:01:24.039> across<00:01:24.399> varying<00:01:24.759> speeds<00:01:24.969> a<00:01:25.090> current

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:25.359 
you cast across varying speeds a current

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:26.789 
you cast across varying speeds a current
that<00:01:25.450> dropper<00:01:25.899> you<00:01:25.929> would<00:01:26.200> have<00:01:26.289> no<00:01:26.409> control

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
that dropper you would have no control

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.139 
that dropper you would have no control
of<00:01:26.829> it<00:01:27.100> it'd<00:01:27.280> be<00:01:27.310> kind<00:01:27.549> of<00:01:27.579> whipping<00:01:27.850> around<00:01:27.939> to

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
of it it'd be kind of whipping around to

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.539 
of it it'd be kind of whipping around to
the<00:01:28.210> current<00:01:28.539> so<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.289> closer<00:01:29.619> you<00:01:30.100> keep<00:01:30.340> that

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
the current so the closer you keep that

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.059 
the current so the closer you keep that
dropper<00:01:31.090> to<00:01:31.329> the<00:01:31.450> Leafly<00:01:31.899> the<00:01:32.469> more<00:01:32.679> control

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
dropper to the Leafly the more control

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:34.889 
dropper to the Leafly the more control
you<00:01:33.100> have<00:01:33.249> so<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.210> way<00:01:34.329> I'm<00:01:34.450> going<00:01:34.509> to<00:01:34.630> attach

you have so the way I'm going to attach

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.069

this is called New Zealand style I

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.929 
this is called New Zealand style I
didn't<00:01:38.079> name<00:01:38.229> it<00:01:38.289> it<00:01:38.829> must<00:01:39.249> be<00:01:39.399> how<00:01:39.520> they<00:01:39.670> do<00:01:39.789> it

in<00:01:39.999> New<00:01:40.060> Zealand<00:01:40.090> I<00:01:40.509> guess<00:01:40.689> but<00:01:40.840> that's<00:01:41.020> how<00:01:41.109> we

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
in New Zealand I guess but that's how we

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.099 
in New Zealand I guess but that's how we
do<00:01:41.289> it<00:01:41.409> here<00:01:41.619> I'm<00:01:42.520> going<00:01:42.640> to<00:01:42.729> take<00:01:42.909> my<00:01:43.600> tippet<00:01:44.049> I

do it here I'm going to take my tippet I

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:45.539 
do it here I'm going to take my tippet I
made<00:01:44.319> a<00:01:44.350> loop<00:01:44.560> out<00:01:44.740> of<00:01:44.770> it<00:01:45.009> I<00:01:45.130> just<00:01:45.189> took<00:01:45.490> it

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
made a loop out of it I just took it

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.219 
made a loop out of it I just took it
right<00:01:45.819> on<00:01:45.939> the<00:01:46.060> gape<00:01:46.210> of<00:01:46.359> the<00:01:46.420> hook<00:01:46.600> and<00:01:46.749> there

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
right on the gape of the hook and there

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:48.899 
right on the gape of the hook and there
was<00:01:47.350> a<00:01:47.380> variety<00:01:47.619> of<00:01:47.979> ways<00:01:48.189> to<00:01:48.219> do<00:01:48.520> this

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
was a variety of ways to do this

was a variety of ways to do this
this<00:01:49.119> just<00:01:49.329> happens<00:01:49.749> to<00:01:49.840> be<00:01:49.929> the<00:01:50.289> most<00:01:50.409> common

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
this just happens to be the most common

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.039 
this just happens to be the most common
in<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.280> way<00:01:51.399> that<00:01:51.759> most<00:01:52.329> of<00:01:52.450> our<00:01:52.539> guide<00:01:52.749> staff

in the way that most of our guide staff

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.319 
in the way that most of our guide staff
prefers<00:01:53.439> to<00:01:53.649> do<00:01:53.770> it<00:01:53.889> and<00:01:54.460> all<00:01:54.639> you<00:01:54.880> need<00:01:55.060> to<00:01:55.210> do

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:02.859 
do a clean shot let that knot so it

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.069 
do a clean shot let that knot so it
doesn't<00:02:03.280> burn<00:02:03.670> itself<00:02:04.030> up<00:02:04.270> cinch<00:02:04.869> that<00:02:04.929> down

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
doesn't burn itself up cinch that down

doesn't burn itself up cinch that down
and<00:02:05.619> now<00:02:05.679> what<00:02:06.490> I've<00:02:06.609> done<00:02:06.639> is<00:02:07.060> I've<00:02:07.630> made<00:02:07.810> a

and now what I've done is I've made a

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.510 
and now what I've done is I've made a
connection<00:02:08.080> just<00:02:08.800> to<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:08.950> gape<00:02:09.130> of<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.340> hook

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
connection just to the gape of the hook

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.300 
connection just to the gape of the hook
on<00:02:09.729> that<00:02:09.940> dry<00:02:10.179> fly<00:02:10.420> hope<00:02:10.810> you<00:02:10.959> can<00:02:11.080> see

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
on that dry fly hope you can see

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.089 
on that dry fly hope you can see
okay<00:02:11.880> and<00:02:11.970> my<00:02:12.690> dropper<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.260> now<00:02:13.410> going<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.739> be

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
okay and my dropper is now going to be

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.650 
okay and my dropper is now going to be
trailing<00:02:14.700> back<00:02:14.910> here<00:02:15.150> somewhere

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
trailing back here somewhere

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.020 
trailing back here somewhere
now<00:02:15.900> some<00:02:16.140> advice<00:02:16.410> on<00:02:16.650> distance<00:02:17.370> as<00:02:17.819> I

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
now some advice on distance as I

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.020 
now some advice on distance as I
mentioned<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.540> closer<00:02:18.840> this<00:02:19.200> fly<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:20.640> the

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
mentioned the closer this fly is the the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.729 
mentioned the closer this fly is the the
nymph<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.510> your<00:02:21.630> drive<00:02:21.870> fly<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.110> more<00:02:22.380> control

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
nymph to your drive fly the more control

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.620 
nymph to your drive fly the more control
you<00:02:22.770> have<00:02:22.920> so<00:02:23.340> if<00:02:23.459> you<00:02:23.580> are<00:02:23.670> fishing<00:02:24.030> hopper<00:02:24.420> a

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
you have so if you are fishing hopper a

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.420 
you have so if you are fishing hopper a
hopper<00:02:25.050> dropper<00:02:25.410> set<00:02:25.620> up<00:02:25.739> right<00:02:26.040> up<00:02:26.190> close<00:02:26.340> to

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
hopper dropper set up right up close to

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.610 
hopper dropper set up right up close to
the<00:02:26.670> bank<00:02:26.849> having<00:02:27.780> this<00:02:27.900> nymph<00:02:28.170> close<00:02:28.380> might

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
the bank having this nymph close might

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.110 
the bank having this nymph close might
be<00:02:28.769> an<00:02:28.860> advantage<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.489> that<00:02:29.670> way<00:02:29.819> you<00:02:29.880> can

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
be an advantage and that way you can

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.120 
be an advantage and that way you can
have<00:02:30.269> your<00:02:30.300> nymph<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:30.989> your<00:02:31.319> drive<00:02:31.620> fly<00:02:31.860> close

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
have your nymph and your drive fly close

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.979 
have your nymph and your drive fly close
to<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.370> bank<00:02:32.550> of<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.760> structure<00:02:33.209> if<00:02:33.390> I'm

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
to the bank of the structure if I'm

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.350 
to the bank of the structure if I'm
fishing<00:02:34.280> wide-open<00:02:35.280> riffles<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.760> pools<00:02:36.030> and

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
fishing wide-open riffles and pools and

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.550 
fishing wide-open riffles and pools and
I<00:02:36.450> want<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.690> get<00:02:36.750> my<00:02:36.900> dropper<00:02:37.260> down<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.440> little

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
I want to get my dropper down a little

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.280 
I want to get my dropper down a little
bit<00:02:37.709> deeper<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.250> I'm<00:02:38.910> casting<00:02:39.180> back<00:02:39.630> upstream

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
bit deeper and I'm casting back upstream

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.170 
bit deeper and I'm casting back upstream
into<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.709> current<00:02:41.040> running<00:02:41.640> this<00:02:41.849> much

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
into the current running this much

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.479 
into the current running this much
deeper<00:02:42.599> will<00:02:42.720> be<00:02:42.840> effective<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:44.160> reason<00:02:44.430> I

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
deeper will be effective the reason I

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.880 
deeper will be effective the reason I
say<00:02:44.670> casting<00:02:45.120> back<00:02:45.269> upstream<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:46.049> because

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
say casting back upstream is because

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.720 
say casting back upstream is because
when<00:02:47.340> this<00:02:47.519> hits<00:02:47.910> it's<00:02:48.239> a<00:02:48.390> very<00:02:48.630> it's<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.470> very

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
when this hits it's a very it's a very

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.250 
when this hits it's a very it's a very
challenging<00:02:50.730> thing<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.390> get<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:51.720> nib<00:02:51.959> right

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
challenging thing to get that nib right

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.780 
challenging thing to get that nib right
underneath<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:52.769> drive<00:02:53.190> flight<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.580> hang

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
underneath that drive flight to hang

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.910 
underneath that drive flight to hang
like<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.569> when<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:54.989> cast<00:02:55.200> upstream

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
like that and when you cast upstream

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.009 
like that and when you cast upstream
that<00:02:56.580> fly<00:02:56.910> let's<00:02:57.239> just<00:02:57.420> say<00:02:57.540> this<00:02:57.750> is<00:02:57.900> the

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019
