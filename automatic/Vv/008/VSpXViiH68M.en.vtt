00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.559
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.420
 find the diagnostic connector in 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:16.779
 this case is under the seat 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.779
 of the driver is a truck 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.150
 I am another previous one is a good minivan in 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.669
 Many toyota vehicles are in 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.669
 the engine compartment near 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.760
 the shock absorber tower on the 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:37.250
 passenger is usually in the 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.110
 most vehicles and trucks what 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.870
 we have to do is bridge the 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:46.270
 terminals 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:49.800
 1 and what is still being 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:54.440
 and the other terminal is the t 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.440
 and one that is adapted in between 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.400
 and we connect a bridge 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.489
 on this side I have 2 carlos united 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:10.850
 we proceed to open the switch 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.850
 we will observe the flicker of light 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.820
 it's down here 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.820
 two 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:25.829
 1 code 31 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.829
 1 2 3 4 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:37.110
 141 is the code 41 1234 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:42.060
 1 2 3 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.060
 43 12 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.570
 Four. Five 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.390
 12 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:55.070
 52 keep repeating as long as you have 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.630
 the bridge in the diagnostic connector 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.990
 for the time being we improve the blinking 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.990
 of 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.970
 in focus of the oil level that's another 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.920
 affair 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.290
 but in this way they get the codes 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.979
 in a system or sees from one in vehicle its 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.979
 toyota production 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.980
 the definition of the codes that has 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:23.110
 obtained the code 31 refers to 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.640
 sensor circuit failure 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:30.120
 of air flow or vacuum 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:34.230
 the code 41 refers to the circuit of the 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:39.150
 throttle position TPS sensor 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:41.720
 43 code means that no 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.290
 signal 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.290
 d 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:52.610
 start or march 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:56.750
 in the computer 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:03:01.400
 and the code 52 refers to the sensor 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.110
 detonation because they are enough codes not 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.450
 I know what will have happened on this occasion 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.100
 possibly someone guiding or doing 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.540
 some tests disconnecting the 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:14.060
 sensors and causes these codes good 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.920
 What I 'm going to do is erase the 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.750
 codes how do we erase the 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.580
 codes in this system because it's very 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.820
 easy we just unplug the 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.890
 battery for a period of 1 or 2 minutes 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.990
 with that will be enough 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.910
 you do not want to disconnect the battery by 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.980
 that you are going to lose the memory of 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.350
 stereo what you can do is 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.560
 disconnect the fuse that feeds the 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:41.210
 computer 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:44.370
 in this case here we have the description 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:47.970
 and it's this one here 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.989
 what does it say in English? 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.989
 jackson electronics 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.230
 what would he do 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.670
 we connect for a minute we return 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.220
 to connect and with that they should have 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.730
 the codes of the 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.730
 memory 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.420
 good there are no codes in memory 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.519
 of the focus of the check or service for 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.609
 blink this way 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.109
 If the bridge by placing the focus for the 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.990
 this way it means that no 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.200
 you have no registered fault code 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.420
 In Memory 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.040
 backwards to look at this videos but this 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.810
 the information that is 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.520
 presented and I invite you to 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.440
 subscribe to my channel where you go to 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.280
 find more interesting information 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.280
