00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.320
 explaining things and such that it showed 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.369
 some things I do things in 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.660
 my life is such 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.579
 you do not know you do not know 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.230
 much so that I will explain a 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.170
 bit of things and many things 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.480
 You ask me good to start one. 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.149
 ask the mother why you use these 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.850
 votes never take your glasses off because man 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.020
 My ground , I think it's mine. 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.180
 it did not rain we painted I have it in 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.960
 eye then I get very bad type bulb 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.940
 leave it bad to have 14 ac 3 75 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.649
 other side of the broken glass when 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.750
 broke for those who buy another 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.000
 project without time from behind 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.729
 so that's it, my degree is very 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.890
 strong have to wear glasses is kind of 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.560
 family, my mother uses my brother, my father 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.689
 It's kind of like everybody has games there. 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.270
 degrees because it showed a more 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.729
 weak because it is more like a degree 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.890
 that used this is a higher degree 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.479
 since it has increased but I think that now part 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.880
 at least that's what made him famous and 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.470
 said he did not even stop at age 18 or 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.270
 less then three years to do 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.500
 surgery to ask for the case but 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.270
 still have to continue using it because 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.500
 sees evil willingly or not such one 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.360
 of the things I want to explain 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.880
 maybe we understand but that's it 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.290
 pull very badly without glasses and have another 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.540

 time or if you already have other singers that 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.030

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.310
 He is because he is very cute and such he 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.920

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.320
 dorinha and soft to lose is a lot but it is a 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:37.090
 chance for those who do not know and know the 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:39.460
 search there by the branch he does not

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:59.440

00:03:48.450 --> 00:04:01.300

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.060
 also what I do and how to show 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.800
 as for example I walk from longboard 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.570
 Yes, where are they good but then I started 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.400
 record video stopped because I walk a lot without 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.470
 time and such but I still have and I will 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.700
 show you with people I picked up here already 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.350
 I wanted to show you too. 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.300
 because it's something I do for 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.280

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.430
 I do not walk too much and I like it but I like it 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.130

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.910

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.800
