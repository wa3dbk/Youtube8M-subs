00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.180 
faction reset or you've installed a new
ROM<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.220> for<00:00:09.030> whatever<00:00:09.269> reason<00:00:09.900> your<00:00:10.380> IMEI<00:00:10.710> is

you how to make me restore it now you
need<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.029> get<00:00:24.150> into<00:00:24.330> what's<00:00:24.630> called<00:00:24.720> engineer

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
need to get into what's called engineer

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.769 
need to get into what's called engineer
mode<00:00:25.500> now<00:00:26.099> there's<00:00:26.910> many<00:00:27.090> ways<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.420> doing<00:00:27.599> it

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
mode now there's many ways of doing it

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.919 
mode now there's many ways of doing it
but<00:00:27.960> one<00:00:28.289> way<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.680> input<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.580> code<00:00:29.820> now<00:00:30.420> the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
but one way is to input a code now the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.830 
but one way is to input a code now the
code<00:00:31.170> for<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:31.619> phone<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:32.730> code<00:00:33.030> but

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
code for this phone is this code but

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.440 
code for this phone is this code but
your<00:00:34.559> code<00:00:34.860> might<00:00:35.190> be<00:00:35.370> different<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.420> need

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
your code might be different so you need

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.389 
your code might be different so you need
to<00:00:36.840> look<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.230> out<00:00:37.410> on<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.280> Internet<00:00:43.040> okay<00:00:44.040> so

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
to look that out on the Internet okay so

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.400 
to look that out on the Internet okay so
once<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.789> there<00:00:44.969> your<00:00:45.329> menu<00:00:46.020> might<00:00:46.260> be

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
once in there your menu might be

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.869 
once in there your menu might be
slightly<00:00:46.649> different<00:00:46.950> but<00:00:47.460> what<00:00:47.700> we're

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
slightly different but what we're

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.540 
slightly different but what we're
looking<00:00:48.210> for<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.719> connectivity<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.860> then

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
looking for is connectivity and then

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.420 
looking for is connectivity and then
down<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.850> CD<00:00:51.360> s<00:00:51.449> information<00:00:51.809> then<00:00:52.710> radio

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
down to CD s information then radio

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.630 
down to CD s information then radio
information<00:00:53.760> now<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:55.110> adjust<00:00:55.230> sim<00:00:55.770> one<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.460> go
