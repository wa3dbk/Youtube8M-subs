00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
out very easy like we just started this

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.069 
out very easy like we just started this
and<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.100> looks<00:01:53.220> pretty<00:01:53.579> easy<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.119> far<00:01:54.390> but<00:01:54.960> it

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
and it looks pretty easy so far but it

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.260 
and it looks pretty easy so far but it
is<00:01:55.229> going<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.680> get<00:01:55.829> harder<00:01:56.070> more<00:01:56.490> enemies<00:01:56.850> will

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
is going to get harder more enemies will

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.749 
is going to get harder more enemies will
show<00:01:57.509> up<00:01:57.689> enemies<00:01:58.649> will<00:01:58.829> also<00:01:59.159> show<00:01:59.369> up<00:01:59.399> from

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
show up enemies will also show up from

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.929 
show up enemies will also show up from
behind<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.840> look<00:02:01.079> out<00:02:01.170> for<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.670> also<00:02:02.670> their

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
behind so look out for that also their

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.469 
behind so look out for that also their
weapons<00:02:03.420> get<00:02:03.659> even<00:02:04.049> more<00:02:04.290> complicated<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:05.479> it

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
weapons get even more complicated so it

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.330 
weapons get even more complicated so it
definitely<00:02:06.780> gets<00:02:07.049> harder<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.649> I'm<00:02:08.099> just

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
definitely gets harder and I'm just

definitely gets harder and I'm just
showing<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.849> beginning<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:09.690> stage

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.250 
showing you the beginning of this stage
what<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.520> really<00:02:11.910> like<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.120> when<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.569> let<00:02:12.750> go

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
what I really like is when you let go

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.050 
what I really like is when you let go
of<00:02:13.470> your<00:02:13.620> finger<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.159> goes<00:02:14.580> into<00:02:14.760> slow

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
of your finger and that goes into slow

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.300 
of your finger and that goes into slow
motion<00:02:15.319> very<00:02:16.319> cool<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.890> can<00:02:16.980> see<00:02:17.129> what's

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
motion very cool you can see what's

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.170 
motion very cool you can see what's
happening<00:02:17.450> well<00:02:18.450> well<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.170> let<00:02:19.470> go<00:02:20.180> it

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
happening well well you let go it

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.000 
happening well well you let go it
would've<00:02:21.360> been<00:02:21.390> cool<00:02:21.689> it<00:02:21.840> also<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.650> sound

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
goes into slow motion that would have

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.899 
goes into slow motion that would have
been<00:02:24.870> really<00:02:24.930> nice<00:02:25.319> if<00:02:25.560> they<00:02:25.739> add<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.670> in<00:02:26.819> an
