00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.760
 when we get angry, a 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:10.290
 structure called cerebral amygdala that 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.269
 is in charge of controlling the 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.269
 emotions and that has a great capacity 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.890
 to break with what is socially 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.199
 accepted so that migra age does not 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.150
 cause problems is controlled by the 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.849
 prefrontal cortex of the cortex 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.949
 prefrontal analyzing thinks already I know 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.650
 let's say the filters of what is 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.929
 right socially there are however in 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.210
 an anger the release of so much dopamine 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.399
 and noradrenaline causes the amygdala to 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.530
 impose the bark when we get angry 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.510
 we activate neural networks that 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.450
 directly involve the release of 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.600
 dopamine that makes it inactive in the 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.120
 smarter areas of the brain 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.940
 the rational processes and the filters are 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.160
 they lose us emotion dominates and then 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.170
 we say or carry out actions that 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.969
 they can hurt others and that in 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.519
 our moments we would not dare to 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.409
 perform once with my brother he 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.559
 had had an incident that they had 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:06.149
 hit and this and I got mad at him and at 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.850
 third day I said how good you 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.770
 will hit and what I do when it has 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.110
 angry is that I say many truths 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.270
 that often it is not convenient to say and 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.680
 good obsessed because it awakens many 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.450
 resentments 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.890
 I know that at this moment I am very angry 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.170
 angry 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.270
 I want to hurt you because the game is the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.890
 reality of the unconscious does not reason and 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.890
 I want to hurt 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.240
 the process in which the entire amygdala 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.159
 lasts 20 to 25 minutes after that 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.020
 repentance comes because the 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.710
 prefrontal cortex works again 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.220
 properly books that I said yes yes what 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.909
 I think but now it's like I say to the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:55.320
 person as he explained that I wear the 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.810
 quotes that was not true I do not know if it is 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.920
 true but I have to make you believe 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.979
 the other person that was not true 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.330
 so that he can forgive me, he is also 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.820
 proven that who being the 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.170
 men are the men 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.569
 we have a greater capacity 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.459
 dopamine release in this sense and 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.200
 we also release testosterone and also 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.450
 we have the same biggest brain 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.170
 and the bigger hypothalamus what does it mean 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.550
 this 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.580
 we are the males that we generate 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.260
 greater aggression greater behavioral strength and 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.819
 a greater expression that I want 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.370
 be right the key to face 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.290
 an anger is to take a time in what 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.190
 the amygdala goes off to go back to 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.190
 act with cristian
