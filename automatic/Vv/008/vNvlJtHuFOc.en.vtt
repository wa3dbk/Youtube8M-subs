00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.950
 There were some swiss man 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.150
 that was a horny stream actually 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.370
 until late into the night are so many 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.040
 I actively wanted to thank you for that 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.030
 for the buck synonymous with the next stream 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.380
 to watch a video description 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.630
 insidertipp then you are also marianne 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.860
 man or easily this video it 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.250
 This is about something completely 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.960
 special a map extension the us 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.330
 maybe even relatively likely 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.220
 However, it may be pure 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.600
 I have to speculate at this point 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.370
 Just say it was rockstar 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.290
 Games not officially said 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.120
 or if the card ever gets through 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.890
 the update will change as you get hot 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.900
 mission was designed to look special 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.970
 not even something said but with 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.310
 my possible extensions of the map 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.750
 one could agree relatively like 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.070
 I'm just writing your opinion 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.780
 in addition then in the comments 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.670
 or maybe your own theory, though 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.500
 Please do not offend each other 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.509
 for other theories or views 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.950
 because then you know if you are ready 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.950
 you already know you already know 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.300
 we are all one 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.590
 and of course not 100 percent 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.030
 confirmed by rockstar games from therefore 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.850
 you should just speculate but 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.259
 but that must be sang doherty slave 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.580
 we all have a little fun all of us 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.060
 look forward to a hot update 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.369
 hopefully coming soon probably yes 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.130
 yes, when, and I have 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.360
 this aircraft carrier so often in the 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.789
 seen trailer or of course, too 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.440
 this screenshot and I am as 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.509
 relatively likely that even so 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.640
 a kind of yes by this update also 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.170
 a little bit more military parts into 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.670
 play comes in because we get yes 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.399
 that was confirmed by this hydra chip 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.009
 to that and we know is the hydra chip 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.599
 also a zinc state of law that is 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.060
 Of course, relatively far 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:09.619
 And besides, you have to say that you 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.270
 on the present military track 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.670
 barely any space at all 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.410
 no room for another point 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.569
 of any plane or one 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.700
 panzers or a barak for example 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.319
 They all have their fixed point of view 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.670
 and i think by a new patch 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.050
 The sport.de are not synonymous 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.240
 change that means now to one 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.610
 friend of an old jet at once 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.079
 then after hais update becomes hydra 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.430
 I am relatively unlikely 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.250
 that was all firmly programmed that 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.100
 if they are not likely 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.260
 Therefore , New Year's point has to change 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.420
 just over here now we have the 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.610
 trailer seen that hydra there 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.780
 chip apparently sport because from there 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.700
 are they started? 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.320
 At least in the hot mission we know 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.480
 So now there is this aircraft carrier 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.590
 already with the hydra jet and exactly these 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.420
 I could also have a plane carrier 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.000
 Easy in free mode if you have now 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.580
 online traveling is imagine that we 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.680
 the map extension among others two 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.030
 Special boats now I have to 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.709
 first on this here that is relative 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.870
 probably because then so too 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.120
 the spawn point of the hydra jet 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.370
 could or could even represent 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.410
 other planes or other heli head 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.540
 that has us new plane or 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.160
 to expect helicopters and therefore think 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.959
 I could also in like also in 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.970
 the proximity of the military base just like that 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.980
 Of course I will not be solid bread 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.140
 moves but if would move or 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.840
 you even see it interacting 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.790
 could boni that we real dream if 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.959
 but you could cruise with a ban 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.590
 that alone is good too 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:34.650
 just plodding around that would be one 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.910
 wrong thing as I am what do you mean 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.010
 write that here is my moment but 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.610
 Gives him thumbs up and that 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.019
 further we also board this yacht 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.970
 we have also seen in the trailer 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.920
 which will also rainer robbery about 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.970
 a robbery raid of a what 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.970
 is going on with that 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.379
 jewelery , yes, the good old promise 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:03.329
 always makes me for what I 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.340
 actually no, I say now 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.349
 nothing further uwe happy on this 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.510
 noble bread go into this cool yacht in 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:12.150
 you can be in story mode once 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.069
 must where michael tracy rescues 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.480
 quite the hiru the whole young man 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.120
 and there is also a robbery 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.220
 mission and I also think that each 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.870
 yacht at least to 100 percent because 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.690
 but this mission will be there 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.090
 maybe that's something new 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.620
 available for us just looks 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.880
 round image that one side just depends 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.370
 went a bit can relax 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.120
 maybe they are normal too 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.740
 computerized person on it 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.930
 Of course, a funny action, too 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.479
 what I would celebrate extremely would be if 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.940
 you can just drive and so 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.830
 Until your trainee allowed cold weather 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.750
 if you go with this bus 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.130
 yacht rumcruisen could or with the 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.900
 plane regulates how I say but me 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.520
 must indeed honestly say is he 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.530
 this fun mobile will be which one 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.900
 could move this fat military 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.850
 Aircraft carrier can actually do business 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.440
 Unfortunately you do not move too 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.090
 pretty weird then you see 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.650
 not really and leader on the 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.120
 first look at these pictures though 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.979
 of course, something that should be happy 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.240
 but no matter what do you mean , just write 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.590
 in the comments one i am again 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.449
 once too much to be blown away 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.220
 to talk to her was like that 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:13.340
 your video that's clear 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.260
 the coffeeshops like it if so 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:19.010
 six friends and subscribes to the channel 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.010
 if you do not miss anything 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.169
 then we'll vote in the next video 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:24.169
 with the break
