00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.720 
actually a much lower arcing shot and
what<00:03:02.120> was<00:03:02.239> also<00:03:02.450> very<00:03:02.720> important<00:03:03.049> enough<00:03:03.260> is

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
what was also very important enough is

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.729 
what was also very important enough is
the<00:03:04.730> fact<00:03:04.940> that<00:03:05.230> sailor<00:03:06.230> that's<00:03:06.500> already

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
savings their use of Kuroko's in this

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.289 
savings their use of Kuroko's in this
direction<00:03:15.370> they've<00:03:16.370> gotten<00:03:16.670> accustomed<00:03:17.150> to

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
direction they've gotten accustomed to

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.020 
direction they've gotten accustomed to
it<00:03:17.480> so<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.530> only<00:03:18.739> way<00:03:19.069> they<00:03:19.280> can<00:03:19.400> actually<00:03:19.519> be

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
it so the only way they can actually be

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.860 
it so the only way they can actually be
if<00:03:21.670> coracle<00:03:22.670> were<00:03:22.730> over<00:03:23.090> used<00:03:23.420> his

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
if coracle were over used his

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.589 
if coracle were over used his
misdirection<00:03:24.670> they<00:03:25.670> would<00:03:25.880> catch<00:03:26.090> on<00:03:26.360> to<00:03:26.480> it

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
misdirection they would catch on to it

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.320 
misdirection they would catch on to it
and<00:03:26.900> know<00:03:27.860> and<00:03:28.069> his<00:03:28.220> skills<00:03:28.459> wouldn't<00:03:28.849> work<00:03:29.060> as

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
and know and his skills wouldn't work as

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.530 
and know and his skills wouldn't work as
well<00:03:30.370> so<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.549> only<00:03:31.670> way<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:31.850> actually<00:03:32.060> beat

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
well so the only way to actually beat

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.090 
well so the only way to actually beat
them<00:03:32.690> in<00:03:32.810> that<00:03:32.959> case<00:03:33.230> would<00:03:33.470> be<00:03:33.500> using

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
them in that case would be using

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.930 
them in that case would be using
overflow<00:03:34.519> the<00:03:35.420> mr.<00:03:35.690> hungar<00:03:35.959> flow<00:03:36.109> and<00:03:36.940> they

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
overflow the mr. hungar flow and they

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.430 
overflow the mr. hungar flow and they
can't<00:03:38.180> afford<00:03:38.299> to<00:03:38.600> do<00:03:38.750> that<00:03:38.930> because<00:03:39.019> once<00:03:39.320> it

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
can't afford to do that because once it

neck-and-neck was seen at one time so it

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.310 
neck-and-neck was seen at one time so it
is<00:04:47.020> what<00:04:47.230> it<00:04:47.320> is<00:04:47.410> in<00:04:47.530> that<00:04:47.590> case<00:04:47.860> and<00:04:48.180> that

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
is what it is in that case and that

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
whole senpai mentality that customers

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.180 
whole senpai mentality that customers
who've<00:04:54.370> had<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:55.150> entire<00:04:55.540> time<00:04:55.900> it<00:04:56.500> was<00:04:56.770> for<00:04:56.980> an

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
obvious reason so that being said the

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.990 
obvious reason so that being said the
animation<00:05:01.510> overall<00:05:01.960> was<00:05:02.200> okay<00:05:02.850> I'll<00:05:03.850> be

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
animation overall was okay I'll be

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.370 
animation overall was okay I'll be
honest<00:05:04.300> like<00:05:04.480> if<00:05:04.660> you<00:05:04.780> compared<00:05:05.110> to<00:05:05.230> the

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
honest like if you compared to the

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.810 
honest like if you compared to the
previous<00:05:05.740> game<00:05:05.950> between<00:05:07.920> Rob<00:05:08.920> Guzan<00:05:09.190> santoku

the<00:05:10.660> animation<00:05:11.110> in<00:05:11.320> that<00:05:11.500> game<00:05:11.740> was<00:05:12.430> amazing

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
the animation in that game was amazing

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.920 
the animation in that game was amazing
in<00:05:14.280> this<00:05:15.280> particular<00:05:15.670> match<00:05:16.000> between<00:05:16.300> Cairo

in this particular match between Cairo
and<00:05:17.080> sitting<00:05:17.640> at<00:05:18.640> this<00:05:18.760> point<00:05:19.000> in<00:05:19.060> time<00:05:19.210> it's

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
and sitting at this point in time it's

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.730 
and sitting at this point in time it's
been<00:05:20.410> okay<00:05:21.310> nor<00:05:22.120> near<00:05:22.510> the<00:05:23.140> animation<00:05:23.620> of<00:05:23.680> the

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
been okay nor near the animation of the

been okay nor near the animation of the
previous<00:05:24.190> game<00:05:24.370> which<00:05:24.880> is<00:05:24.970> unfortunate<00:05:25.980> so<00:05:26.980> a

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
previous game which is unfortunate so a

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.690 
previous game which is unfortunate so a
mission<00:05:27.400> okay

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
mission okay

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.670 
mission okay
pacing<00:05:28.270> I<00:05:28.690> think<00:05:29.140> we're<00:05:29.290> on<00:05:29.410> the<00:05:29.440> third

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
pacing I think we're on the third

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.540 
pacing I think we're on the third
quarter<00:05:30.040> right<00:05:30.160> now<00:05:30.340> and<00:05:31.560> it's<00:05:32.560> still<00:05:32.950> a<00:05:32.980> close

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
quarter right now and it's still a close

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.480 
quarter right now and it's still a close

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
characterization I would mainly go for

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.070 
characterization I would mainly go for
it<00:05:48.130> I<00:05:48.250> mean<00:05:48.280> the<00:05:48.880> gods<00:05:49.060> aspects<00:05:49.570> I<00:05:49.780> don't<00:05:49.930> think

it I mean the gods aspects I don't think

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.500 
it I mean the gods aspects I don't think
he's<00:05:50.200> that<00:05:50.350> relevant<00:05:50.980> to<00:05:51.100> the<00:05:51.190> overall<00:05:51.520> series

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
he's that relevant to the overall series

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.260 
he's that relevant to the overall series
of<00:05:52.990> crew<00:05:53.980> goes<00:05:54.160> basketball<00:05:54.700> so<00:05:54.940> he<00:05:55.060> can<00:05:55.180> be

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
of crew goes basketball so he can be

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.230 
of crew goes basketball so he can be
ignored<00:05:55.630> and<00:05:56.070> it's<00:05:57.070> nearly<00:05:57.340> Castle<00:05:57.850> Matsu

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240
