 to start absorbing a little bit of 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:48.120

 first on the ribbon the little hands 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.340
 the vegetables are delicious on 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:07.590
 portovello is good par excellence in 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:13.100
 Japan takes a lot of tea to cure 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.100
 chronic conditions type diabetes cancer 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.250
 helps lower cholesterol levels 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.769
 we are talking about a food that is 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.139
 sensational then here what are we going to 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.979
 do is we're going to put in a pot 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:29.000
 everything we are going to put our portovelo 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.000
 we are going to add the ginger 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.680
 The peas 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.350
 it also scares us 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:42.560
 we are going to put 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.960
 a little bit of germ that they can use 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.820
 the germ that you prefer we are going to 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.590
 season with a little bit of salt and 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.230
 Pepper 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.770
 and we're going to assume that already die or our 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.620
 chicken no 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.169
 at least that will be the 20 minutes that 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.710
 be there not what we are going to do is that 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:04.470
 let's put our support here with 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.199
 all of the marinade all dot and you 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.229
 let's take a little spin so 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:12.780
 you start then to take all the flavors 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:15.009
 at the same time I recommend them here 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.949
 that plug the 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.960
 the pot so that the vegetables release their 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:22.449
 taste and do not evaporate nickel and warmth 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.580
 anise as I like it better then let's 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:27.849
 put a lid on it and let's leave it there 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.210
 let it begin to cook now I want 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:34.449
 tell them this dish because I like it 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:37.449
 it's easy to do it can also be a 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:40.849
 unique saucer so you feel like you 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:43.759
 you eat this and you're already combed back 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:46.610
 a cut does not go away because we come back 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:49.839
 with some paletas since they are very good 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.839
 for the cold there 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.450
