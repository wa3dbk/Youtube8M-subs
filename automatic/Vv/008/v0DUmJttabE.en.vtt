want<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.090> make<00:02:46.240> sure<00:02:46.390> that's<00:02:46.540> clean<00:02:46.930> make<00:02:47.440> sure

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
want to make sure that's clean make sure

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.460 
want to make sure that's clean make sure
that<00:02:48.040> you<00:02:48.160> dry<00:02:48.520> out<00:02:48.820> your<00:02:49.180> puck<00:02:49.450> really<00:02:50.020> well

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
that you dry out your puck really well

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.580 
that you dry out your puck really well
like<00:02:50.920> it<00:02:51.040> needs<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.370> be<00:02:51.570> bone<00:02:52.570> dry<00:02:52.990> on<00:02:53.320> the

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
like it needs to be bone dry on the

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.520 
like it needs to be bone dry on the
inside<00:02:54.090> so<00:02:55.090> that<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.660> grinds<00:02:56.020> don't<00:02:56.620> stick<00:02:57.330> to

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
inside so that the grinds don't stick to

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.580 
inside so that the grinds don't stick to
the<00:02:59.530> wet<00:02:59.830> inside<00:03:00.340> of<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:01.720> Porta<00:03:02.140> filter<00:03:04.590> with

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
we go ahead and put this in here and

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.130 
we go ahead and put this in here and
after<00:03:18.130> I<00:03:18.310> push<00:03:18.820> in<00:03:19.060> to<00:03:19.959> start<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.410> double<00:03:20.739> shot

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
after I push in to start the double shot

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.300 
after I push in to start the double shot
what<00:03:23.140> you<00:03:23.380> need<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.620> do<00:03:23.769> is<00:03:23.950> sit<00:03:24.100> here<00:03:24.130> and

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
what you need to do is sit here and

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.000 
what you need to do is sit here and
jiggle<00:03:25.000> this<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.170> whole<00:03:26.320> time<00:03:26.590> that's<00:03:26.800> going

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
jiggle this the whole time that's going

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.670 
jiggle this the whole time that's going
to<00:03:27.070> do<00:03:27.160> two<00:03:27.400> things<00:03:27.700> one<00:03:28.150> it's<00:03:28.870> gonna<00:03:29.140> allow

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
to do two things one it's gonna allow

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.890 
to do two things one it's gonna allow
the<00:03:29.739> beans<00:03:30.190> in<00:03:30.430> here<00:03:30.700> to<00:03:30.910> kind<00:03:31.180> of<00:03:31.269> take<00:03:31.870> a

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
the beans in here to kind of take a

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.870 
the beans in here to kind of take a
little<00:03:32.140> bit<00:03:32.290> of<00:03:32.380> vibration<00:03:32.530> sometimes<00:03:33.489> a

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
little bit of vibration sometimes a

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.870 
little bit of vibration sometimes a
little<00:03:33.970> pockets<00:03:34.570> I'll<00:03:34.690> end<00:03:34.930> up<00:03:35.880> being

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
little pockets I'll end up being

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.630 
little pockets I'll end up being
happening<00:03:37.420> in<00:03:37.510> here<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:37.930> there<00:03:38.050> won't<00:03:38.170> be<00:03:38.640> all

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
happening in here and there won't be all

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.310 
happening in here and there won't be all
the<00:03:39.940> all<00:03:40.209> not<00:03:40.480> all<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:40.750> beans<00:03:40.959> will<00:03:41.170> go

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
the all not all the beans will go

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.340 
the all not all the beans will go
through<00:03:41.730> so<00:03:42.730> by<00:03:43.120> jiggling<00:03:43.540> this<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:44.140> puts

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
through so by jiggling this it puts

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.140 
through so by jiggling this it puts
vibration<00:03:44.830> on<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:45.010> machine<00:03:45.340> that<00:03:45.370> helps<00:03:45.790> this

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
vibration on the machine that helps this

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.259 
vibration on the machine that helps this
it<00:03:46.750> also<00:03:47.019> the<00:03:47.590> vibration<00:03:48.100> here<00:03:48.459> is<00:03:48.730> gonna

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
it also the vibration here is gonna

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.570 
it also the vibration here is gonna
allow<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.810> beans<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.440> settle<00:03:50.860> out<00:03:51.010> because

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
allow the beans to settle out because

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.880 
allow the beans to settle out because
they<00:03:52.030> typically<00:03:52.420> want<00:03:52.720> to<00:03:52.870> fill<00:03:53.470> up<00:03:53.650> in<00:03:53.799> the

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
they typically want to fill up in the

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.600 
they typically want to fill up in the
back<00:03:54.540> and<00:03:55.540> I<00:03:55.840> like<00:03:55.989> pile<00:03:56.260> up<00:03:56.560> so<00:03:56.890> there's<00:03:57.459> also

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
back and I like pile up so there's also

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.370 
back and I like pile up so there's also
a<00:03:57.730> little<00:03:57.850> pockets<00:03:58.360> it's<00:03:58.660> been<00:03:58.840> resolved<00:03:59.230> so

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
a little pockets it's been resolved so

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:13.910 
a little pockets it's been resolved so
we're<00:03:59.470> going<00:03:59.590> to

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.949 

so<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:17.260> then<00:04:17.890> of<00:04:18.040> course<00:04:18.070> lastly<00:04:18.840> one<00:04:19.840> of<00:04:19.900> the

it kind of flattened out want to give it
a<00:04:40.090> couple<00:04:40.540> of<00:04:40.750> good<00:04:40.810> jingles<00:04:41.560> or<00:04:41.890> jiggles

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
a couple of good jingles or jiggles

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.790 
a couple of good jingles or jiggles
there<00:04:42.520> what<00:04:43.390> that<00:04:43.420> does<00:04:43.780> just<00:04:44.050> get<00:04:44.440> rid<00:04:44.530> of<00:04:44.590> any

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
there what that does just get rid of any

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.460 
there what that does just get rid of any
air<00:04:45.040> pockets<00:04:45.580> down<00:04:45.760> underneath<00:04:46.380> and<00:04:47.380> again

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
air pockets down underneath and again

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.410 
air pockets down underneath and again
you<00:04:47.710> want<00:04:47.800> to<00:04:47.890> make<00:04:47.950> sure<00:04:48.280> that<00:04:48.400> it's<00:04:48.610> as<00:04:48.760> flat

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
you want to make sure that it's as flat

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.260 
you want to make sure that it's as flat
as<00:04:49.630> you<00:04:49.720> can<00:04:50.490> okay<00:04:51.490> so<00:04:51.550> they<00:04:51.850> were<00:04:51.940> pretty<00:04:52.060> much

as you can okay so they were pretty much

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.210 
as you can okay so they were pretty much
good<00:04:52.450> to<00:04:52.570> go

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
good to go

good to go
some<00:04:54.220> people<00:04:54.460> like<00:04:54.580> to<00:04:54.610> do<00:04:54.850> that<00:04:56.070> most<00:04:57.070> people

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
some people like to do that most people

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.850 
some people like to do that most people
I<00:04:57.580> observe<00:04:57.970> like<00:04:58.390> to<00:04:58.600> do<00:04:58.930> this<00:04:59.080> by<00:04:59.260> hand<00:04:59.530> so

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
I observe like to do this by hand so

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.850 
I observe like to do this by hand so
I've<00:05:00.520> been<00:05:00.640> doing<00:05:00.850> it<00:05:00.910> by<00:05:01.000> hand<00:05:01.210> and<00:05:01.740> kind<00:05:02.740> of

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
I've been doing it by hand and kind of

can see the pressure range here is up in
the<00:06:05.490> higher<00:06:05.729> end<00:06:06.090> anywhere<00:06:06.930> between<00:06:07.110> like

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
the higher end anywhere between like

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
and that was it um I also pre-programmed

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.950 
and that was it um I also pre-programmed
to<00:06:13.530> my<00:06:13.650> machine<00:06:14.039> to<00:06:14.340> do<00:06:14.580> a<00:06:14.610> shorter<00:06:15.120> shot<00:06:15.389> so

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
to my machine to do a shorter shot so

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.830 
to my machine to do a shorter shot so
it's<00:06:16.740> slightly<00:06:17.220> shorter<00:06:17.729> than<00:06:17.759> normal<00:06:17.880> that

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
it's slightly shorter than normal that

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.779 
it's slightly shorter than normal that
would<00:06:19.259> have<00:06:19.380> probably<00:06:19.560> gone<00:06:19.889> anywhere<00:06:20.370> from

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:20.789 
would have probably gone anywhere from

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:23.360 
would have probably gone anywhere from
just<00:06:21.120> a<00:06:21.509> few<00:06:21.840> to<00:06:22.259> a<00:06:22.289> few<00:06:22.800> seconds

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370
