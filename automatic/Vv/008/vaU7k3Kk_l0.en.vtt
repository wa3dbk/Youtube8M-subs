00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 there is everyone it's frau ski we get 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.040
 found today for a new 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.450
 video on gta 5 so a video for you 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.679
 show where the parachute is located because 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.410
 that there are a lot of people I think they 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.620
 do not know where he is so here on the 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.620
 map 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.760
 it is at the device level so that 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.539
 this is the bottom of the device so if 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.279
 you want to take the periphery 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.920
 you take to mount devices 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.189
 here otherwise we can go directly through 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:35.010
 the little road here on motorbike it's a 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:37.850
 board and we end up here this 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.850
 device wheels 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.520
 so here is the parachute 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.789
 I take it there is also a small 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.120
 type letter exactly to the east since 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:52.190
 I had found it before my little lake 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.940
 for the mystery of the fall murder he 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.159
 informs so I've never tested the 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.629
 parachute from there so I'm going 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.420
 maybe I 'm missing out I do not know we're gonna 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.739
 see 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:10.250
 where then we go to the bottom right I 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:16.340
 parachute to open it I believe that 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:19.179
 it's x kids to test it smells like 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.179
 suicide but his words 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:29.350
 ok I do not know how we rent the market 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.780
 so I'm going to take a break I just 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:38.410
 see how we parachute it to everything from 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:41.100
 next so everyone is so here 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.229
 we are at the airport 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.290
 for the parachute 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.300
 So here it is here it is where 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.430
 he must land 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:55.390
 so again normally he is there he 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.340
 there is a flying school selling 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.619
 like that you go in and then there 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:05.440
 will have different crazy things parachute 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:07.420
 where should I start and you can 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.860
 stay like that with golf 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:15.210
 some will go down in peak 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.210
 I'm trying to attract at the zone level 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.290
 who are close to him 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.880
 I had missed I think you can a lot 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.209
 I can take you elsewhere 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.660
 I can precise landing for 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.660
 turn 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:51.499
 yz and to detach the the parachute so 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.499
 I will not do it 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.560
 the little low planes that you can 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.120
 fly if you 're lucky because 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.430
 as soon as you get into the knit dress 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:11.340
 Africa you have two or three stars 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:15.180
 at more like that now jacir and 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:18.300
 precise landings so there what I have 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.720
 to do to land clb more herved on 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.720
 xbox 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.980
 if I succeed I looked like are a little 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.980
 too much 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:39.400
 it's going to be fair with I just wish 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:42.070
 because you just have a thing 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:50.260
 like that I'm going to show you what he 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:52.900
 yad others up sound landing in flight 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:04:00.280
 go it starts with that then 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:03.510
 you have that hop the helicopter is something 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:07.360
 managed absolutely no it's super hot 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.700
 skydiving so show the area 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.170
 landing without fail to land 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.430
 on a truck platform I 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:29.650
 successful the first time we will see if the 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:34.470
 risk like me it's pretty hot I 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.470
 was doing my turn feeling too fast 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.070
 normally a hotpot of advances 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.770
 in short, we can not buy 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:55.699
 I misplaced 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:55.699
 on the ground 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.880
 4 6 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:10.669
 it's too fair again 

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:10.669
 I would not have my sheet 

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:17.809
 I still have rhythm 

00:05:14.269 --> 00:05:17.809
 good are the people 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.810
 for just now for the fact that 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.660
 I actually did just have to jump from 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.180
 Calf was too low so you 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:33.030
 jump in a helicopter of a building 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:36.080
 like that so here on this people I 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:39.440
 you leave me I 'll go eat and 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.440
 baÃ¯ everyone
