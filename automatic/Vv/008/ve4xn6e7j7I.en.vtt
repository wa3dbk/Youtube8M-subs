00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
beware or something like that and then I

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.900 
beware or something like that and then I
did<00:00:51.160> the<00:00:51.280> image<00:00:51.809> ok<00:00:52.890> again<00:00:53.890> here's<00:00:54.460> the<00:00:54.699> other

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
did the image ok again here's the other

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.869 
did the image ok again here's the other
now<00:00:55.300> side<00:00:55.989> by<00:00:56.170> side<00:00:59.309> you<00:01:00.309> can<00:01:00.489> see<00:01:00.520> the

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
now side by side you can see the

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.650 
now side by side you can see the
difference<00:01:01.359> it<00:01:01.690> what<00:01:02.379> I<00:01:02.410> mean<00:01:02.739> is<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:04.360> one

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
difference it what I mean is the one

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.109 
difference it what I mean is the one
that<00:01:04.930> the<00:01:05.350> other<00:01:05.500> one<00:01:05.680> is<00:01:05.710> not<00:01:05.979> as<00:01:06.250> clear<00:01:06.790> once

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
that the other one is not as clear once

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.240 
that the other one is not as clear once
I<00:01:07.299> top<00:01:07.510> coated<00:01:07.900> it<00:01:07.990> it<00:01:08.170> became<00:01:08.470> fuzzy<00:01:09.070> it

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
I top coated it it became fuzzy it

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.910 
I top coated it it became fuzzy it
became<00:01:09.549> blurry<00:01:09.880> and<00:01:10.299> that<00:01:10.990> is<00:01:11.229> caused<00:01:11.500> by<00:01:11.860> the

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
became blurry and that is caused by the

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.380 
became blurry and that is caused by the
top<00:01:12.490> coat<00:01:12.850> it<00:01:13.750> makes<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:14.920> image<00:01:15.100> bleed<00:01:15.700> just<00:01:16.270> a

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
top coat it makes the image bleed just a

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.410 
top coat it makes the image bleed just a
little<00:01:16.720> bit<00:01:16.990> I<00:01:17.260> think<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.880> have<00:01:19.000> to<00:01:19.090> be<00:01:19.119> really

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
little bit I think you have to be really

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.230 
little bit I think you have to be really
careful<00:01:19.600> when<00:01:19.900> you<00:01:20.049> top<00:01:20.290> coat<00:01:20.500> your<00:01:20.650> stamps

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
careful when you top coat your stamps

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.999 
careful when you top coat your stamps
with<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.420> top<00:01:22.780> coats<00:01:23.080> anyways<00:01:23.680> because

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
with the top coats anyways because

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.460 
with the top coats anyways because
there's<00:01:24.460> a<00:01:24.520> tendency<00:01:24.820> for<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.900> stamped<00:01:26.470> image

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
there's a tendency for the stamped image

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.910 
there's a tendency for the stamped image
to<00:01:27.070> bleed<00:01:27.509> seche<00:01:28.509> vite<00:01:28.750> does<00:01:29.080> a<00:01:29.110> really<00:01:29.619> good

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
to bleed seche vite does a really good

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.670 
to bleed seche vite does a really good
job<00:01:29.979> it's<00:01:30.580> a<00:01:30.670> fast<00:01:31.119> drying<00:01:31.390> top<00:01:31.509> coat<00:01:31.689> but<00:01:32.560> when

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
job it's a fast drying top coat but when

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.289 
job it's a fast drying top coat but when
you<00:01:32.799> top<00:01:33.040> coat<00:01:33.250> over<00:01:33.460> your<00:01:33.579> image<00:01:33.700> you<00:01:34.000> can't

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299

like<00:01:34.509> double<00:01:34.960> swipe<00:01:35.320> you<00:01:35.650> can't<00:01:35.920> keep<00:01:36.130> swiping

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
like double swipe you can't keep swiping

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.020 
like double swipe you can't keep swiping
over<00:01:37.090> it<00:01:37.240> when<00:01:37.420> you<00:01:37.509> top<00:01:37.750> coat<00:01:38.790> ok<00:01:39.790> and<00:01:39.850> that's

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
over it when you top coat ok and that's

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.690 
over it when you top coat ok and that's
