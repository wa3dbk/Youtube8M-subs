00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.180
 hello to all of you girls rich 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.099
 today show you how to use them 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.809
 use some passwords 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.240
 sims 3 so go to the main thing that we 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.480
 must do first we pinch 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.570
 shift + 3 + c we go 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.539
 Input window we clamp English 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.710
 keyboard and enters the next password he 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.830
 called testing an hour and to wring them 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.830
 so we enter 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:52.520
 hold shift and so gives us this 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.379
 password it gives us many different functions 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.469
 if we enter it in the game then we are not 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:04.080
 We can do and go from the main menu 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:06.119
 we can and so we press to play and so we went 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:13.520
 with you a player and now we will analyze some 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:15.330
 properties of this code for luck 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.140
 clamp which all 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.140
 and poke between the trunk and you and happiness 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.979
 we have 502 fate and we click 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.490
 it turns out 1000 and so this code gives us 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.970
 500 you and happiness what else can this code 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:37.920
 he may add need 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:40.310
 for example decrease increase for example 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.130
 all different 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:47.070
 what else can the same be done with 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.280
 relationship now on only one 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.549
 relationship but for example I would increase and 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:59.570
 we have already become best friends i can 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:02.600
 reduce and on your own worst enemies so 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.390
 what else can this code 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.700
 Well, for example, hold shift and click on 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.720
 mailbox 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:14.209
 it gives us a lot of different functions 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.480
 click the object here delete key 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:21.890
 In our case, he is cast there for no reason. 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.690
 what cause the guest to turn off the needs 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.489
 you just won't have these 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.850
 needs your sims nothing will 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.819
 want to choose a career you can choose 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.260
 any career with any experience you for 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:38.870
 character you can call any service 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:42.230
 maid master nanny can even death 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:46.040
 cause what else can you meet 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:53.150
 all the inhabitants of the city you can find friends 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:56.930
 and what else can this code hold shift 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.690
 and click on the character can change 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:04.640
 your character's character choose it 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:09.500
 favorite music and that he matured what 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:12.010
 still so for example if you do not want 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.500
 for example, you urgently need to go somewhere 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:21.440
 I don't want to move it for a long time 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:23.450
 stomp that case we pin key 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.350
 shift and the same place where you want to 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.250
 transfer 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.250
 here you see there is a key teleport 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:37.540
 always we pinch 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:40.120
 not for a second what else does this one give us 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.430
 we can buy on this plot and 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.580
 build on this plot 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:50.560
 the strangest thing we build on it 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:52.650
 plot at your own expense so let's 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.110
 talk about other fields 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:00.160
 for example the code for the money we hold shift and 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:03.700
 arrow and we will be following this code 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.970
 many do not know him anyway about it 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.209
 I will say he called smeared yes he 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:21.310
 adds 500 thousand rubles 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:23.340
 So we enter I added 500 thousand 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.340
 rubles 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:37.380
 what else is the code but if you don't want 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.590
 for example immediately 500,000 you can 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.020
 break up 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:54.430
 for a thousand such a move is called catching 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:56.669
 need to press enter and I have these 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.669
 numbers 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.570
 The following code about which I would like 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.070
 tell rather help when 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:16.360
 construction is called amboy debac 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:20.140
 video cute go construction mode and 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.390
 I push the sort by my values 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:26.220
 there was such a question he called 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:29.229
 laying off some he appears above 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.009
 Intended sort I had 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:32.819
 here 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:35.889
 it gives us a lot of opportunities 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:37.319
 any items that appear here 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:42.339
 there is in the whole city 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:43.889
 there is even a fog generator example 

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:52.860
 and all sorts of things 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:56.439
 all sorts of things and even portable 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:06:09.789
 portable shower put a little something 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:14.110
 different and so but these all that I wanted 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:18.580
 tell you thanks for watching 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:21.270
 our channel look further thank you 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.270
 until
