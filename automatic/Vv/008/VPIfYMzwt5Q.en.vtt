00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 hi and welcome to another video in 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.550
 this video will make a unboxing bar 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.320
 review of this action figure like 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.290
 you can see it is the ex 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.660
 8x name number dedicated to batman's 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.980
 Michael Keaton from the legendary film Batman 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.500
 of 1989 directed by tim burton 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.410
 we see the box very nice packaging 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.180
 beautiful resistant 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.710
 very nice also the contrast already a 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.619
 black that very much resembles that of the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.800
 batman costume 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:42.870
 we see these images on the part 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:45.840
 front of the box opening the closure 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:52.860
 and on magnets we find on this side 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:55.969
 this promo from the batmobile told a 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.969
 fire this part of the law 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.930
 on this panel we see this 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.090
 speedily this sort of tooth 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:21.149
 serves to project the signal ba with 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:25.110
 the help of a torch removed this 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:27.740
 panel we find there is a child in 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.740
 all its splendor 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:35.399
 then from the show more closely the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.610
 we'll take a closer look at the former figer 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:43.110
 includes two spare parts for the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.479
 mouth two extra mouth pisis and different 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:54.450
 accessories that I will then show you remove 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:56.310
 you can see this yellow panel 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.170
 among the accessories we have three pairs of 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.959
 interchangeable hands therefore besides the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:07.679
 two in the collection fig and then 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:15.620
 two fists closed and we say different 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:19.709
 hands for accessories and a relaxed one 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.040
 then removed this sponge on which 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:26.360
 she is a line-laid filler 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.360
 we find the accessories box 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.220
 let's take a closer look at everyone 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:35.190
 the accessories we have the cloak la 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.769
 display stand the basic version of ex with 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.760
 led lights 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:45.150
 then these two sticks are inserted 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.280
 in the mantle to keep it open if you 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.340
 you want to expose batman as an example 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.010
 same planing then we have several 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:58.470
 accessories including two little stars 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:01.440
 ninja what looks like a bomb with 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.560
 detonator the remote control of the 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.209
 vocal batmobile 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.590
 I know if you remember the different grandeur guns 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.290
 in this and I think they are the vials 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.709
 that batman throws on the ground whenever he wants 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.260
 create smoke to escape 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:22.450
 this clip serves to put in the plan 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:26.269
 on the belt this is what we say 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:29.239
 I wouldn't know how to describe the utility 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:32.599
 in the scene in the final scene of del 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.519
 bell tower when it has to stop the body 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.810
 of the poor of joker 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.560
 but above all I really like this 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.380
 accessory that hooks lance 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.750
 user of the batman museum scene 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.730
 spoiled king vicky veil and could not 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.920
 miss the batarang with a lot of col 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.150
 close 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.239
 let's take a closer look at a 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:57.220
 batman who say guys this action 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:04:00.830
 exceptional figer is really perfect 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:05.750
 I can't find any defects from 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:07.459
 highlight but only merits are 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.870
 fantastic boots I always have 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.700
 found in beautiful since I have them 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.260
 seen in movies 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.789
 these sports boots a lot 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:18.769
 details look at the texture of the 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:21.590
 costume 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.440
 you know that in the first movie in the batman 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.350
 of 1989 obviously not the technology 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.700
 was at current levels 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.680
 the costume was rather rudimentary 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.380
 probably the hood was also 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:40.430
 carved by hand was a bit coarse a 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:43.910
 awkwardly awesome the painting 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.520
 of the eyes especially the black part 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:51.190
 of the eye actually seems to make 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.190
 up is awesome 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.200
 about eyes action figures 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.210
 of the east of the former line have 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:05.640
 a particular functionality is involved 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:08.540
 of the pears and see this this line 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:12.360
 on the back of the head 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:15.330
 this this door let's say yes 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.300
 removes and inside you will find there is a 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.240
 lever that serves to move the eyes 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:26.640
 then maybe a real show later we go 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:35.220
 even on the back it's really an action 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:38.160
 perfect figures to say here is the lever 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.880
 of the lost as you can see it 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.110
 door is held in place by a magnet 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.790
 this functionality takes a 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.390
 of particular importance is the case of 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.030
 batman 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:52.110
 since the mobility of the neck is limited 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:54.810
 from the hood action figure obviously 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:57.270
 super articulated at 30 points of 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.640
 articulation and the same is true 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.340
 that I did for the batman begins ie 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.200
 being the rubber and makes below is true 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.690
 very thin then the range of 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.520
 movement is excellent but I do not recommend it 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.890
 strongly to expose election figer with 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.170
 legs with arms completely 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:15.000
 fold because I assure you that yes 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:17.720
 they will soon form clays 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.720
 on the costume 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.320
 another thing I want to put in 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.940
 highlight the fact that probably 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:28.620
 the author knows the limit of the 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:31.380
 batman begins which is lava from below 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:34.200
 coma costume does not attract so much dust 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.690
 as in the case of batman begins at the touch 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:41.060
 and very smooth it is not the rough so it is 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.060
 even easier to clean 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:48.630
 and here is batman in all its glory 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.760
 complete with cloak really 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:54.080
 fantastic 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.080
 let me show you more closely 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.639
 the coat is very beautiful the only thing is 

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:08.190
 that just pulled out of the packaging goes 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:10.229
 a little bell so you'll have to 

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:12.620
 work a little to get it down well 

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:12.620
 straight ahead 

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:21.610
 to conclude I would like to do some 

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:24.370
 Price considerations is true 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:27.640
 more than 200 euros but guys worth every 

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:30.730
 penny what you have to consider 

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.500
 this while for batman begins the dark 

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:34.420
 knight the dark knight rises the movies more 

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.130
 recent you can find there is a fridge and if 

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.580
 truly collectible for all 

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.340
 pockets 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.690
 for this film the only action figer 

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:43.450
 worthy of note before the realization 

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:46.110
 of the die of the former number 9 from eight ice 

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.110
 was this 

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.740
 so if you are a fan of this movie 

00:07:49.789 --> 00:07:54.340
 like me if you loved him like me 

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:56.599
 this is the collectible to have 

00:07:54.340 --> 00:08:00.910
 Having said this, I greet you and give you 

00:07:56.599 --> 00:08:00.910
 appointment to the next video ciao
