00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
end about something else so you have to

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.799 
end about something else so you have to
hang<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.520> watch<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.850> as<00:00:35.969> well<00:00:36.170> yes<00:00:38.809> well

what<00:00:40.140> we're<00:00:40.500> going<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.680> do<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.040> try<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.370> show

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
what we're going to do is try to show

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.299 
what we're going to do is try to show
you<00:00:41.790> how<00:00:42.510> we<00:00:42.570> would<00:00:43.050> create<00:00:43.350> steam

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
you how we would create steam

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.340 
you how we would create steam
don't<00:00:44.789> forget<00:00:45.090> sometimes<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.780> can't<00:00:46.050> move

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
don't forget sometimes you can't move

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.400 
don't forget sometimes you can't move
the<00:00:46.680> cap<00:00:46.920> or<00:00:47.250> product<00:00:47.789> for<00:00:48.629> some<00:00:48.780> reason<00:00:49.170> there

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
the cap or product for some reason there

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.010 
the cap or product for some reason there
might<00:00:49.440> be<00:00:49.590> something<00:00:50.010> supporting<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.809> if<00:00:51.809> you

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
might be something supporting it if you

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.020 
might be something supporting it if you
using<00:00:52.260> boiling<00:00:52.800> water<00:00:53.010> then<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.640> got<00:00:53.940> to

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
using boiling water then you got to

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.660 
using boiling water then you got to
empty<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.570> cup<00:00:55.140> before<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.680> do<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:55.980> again<00:00:56.219> so

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
empty the cup before you do it again so

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.189 
empty the cup before you do it again so
sometimes<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.480> need<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.750> do<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:57.989> several

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
sometimes you need to do it several

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.740 
sometimes you need to do it several
times<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.739> shot<00:00:58.949> like<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.160> it's<00:01:00.090> also<00:01:00.300> used<00:01:00.629> a

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
times a shot like this it's also used a

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.660 
times a shot like this it's also used a
lot<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.020> video<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.500> course<00:01:01.739> where<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.460> need

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
lot in video of course where you need

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.609 
lot in video of course where you need
steam<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.210> lasts<00:01:03.359> for<00:01:03.570> longer<00:01:03.870> but<00:01:04.290> anyway

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
steam that lasts for longer but anyway

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.550 
steam that lasts for longer but anyway
this<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.949> look<00:01:05.100> at<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.309> steam<00:01:05.610> first<00:01:06.560> right

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
this is a look at the steam first right

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.620 
this is a look at the steam first right
so<00:01:07.799> we<00:01:07.950> boil<00:01:08.130> up<00:01:08.310> some<00:01:08.490> water<00:01:08.700> pour<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.450> into

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
so we boil up some water pour it into

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.050 
so we boil up some water pour it into
the<00:01:09.840> cup<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.530> makes<00:01:10.770> nice<00:01:10.950> steam<00:01:11.340> it's

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
the cup and it makes nice steam it's

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.450 
the cup and it makes nice steam it's
it's<00:01:12.390> not<00:01:12.689> very<00:01:13.020> thick<00:01:13.110> steam<00:01:13.710> which<00:01:13.920> causes<00:01:14.430> a

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
it's not very thick steam which causes a

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.100 
it's not very thick steam which causes a
problem<00:01:14.760> when<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.330> against<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.900> lighter

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
problem when it's against a lighter

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.070 
problem when it's against a lighter
background<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.610> also<00:01:17.850> doesn't<00:01:18.330> last<00:01:18.659> for

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
background and it also doesn't last for

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.859 
background and it also doesn't last for
that<00:01:19.200> long<00:01:19.520> if<00:01:20.520> you're<00:01:20.759> shooting<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.180> video<00:01:21.390> or

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
that long if you're shooting a video or

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.219 
that long if you're shooting a video or
you<00:01:21.990> need<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.979> last<00:01:23.189> longer<00:01:24.020> then<00:01:25.020> you've

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
you need it to last longer then you've

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.280 
you need it to last longer then you've
got<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> problem<00:01:26.000> now<00:01:27.000> another<00:01:27.780> really

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
got a problem now another really

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.640 
got a problem now another really
short-term<00:01:29.299> solution<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.630> steam<00:01:30.869> gun<00:01:31.079> now

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
short-term solution is the steam gun now

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.520 
short-term solution is the steam gun now
this<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.159> super<00:01:32.369> up<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.700> lot<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.030> think<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.780> not

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
this is super up a lot to think that not

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.550 
this is super up a lot to think that not
necessarily<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.520> make<00:01:35.549> water<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.350> port<00:01:37.350> or

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
necessarily to make water a port or

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.499 
necessarily to make water a port or
coffee<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.979> look<00:01:38.159> hot<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:38.939> such<00:01:39.479> a

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
coffee to look hot it's such a

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.810 
coffee to look hot it's such a
short-term<00:01:40.140> thing<00:01:40.200> but<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.369> be<00:01:41.610> put

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
short-term thing but it can be put

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.670 
short-term thing but it can be put
through<00:01:41.850> pipes<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.990> all<00:01:43.140> sorts<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.619> things

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
through pipes and all sorts of things

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.830 
through pipes and all sorts of things
for<00:01:44.220> other<00:01:44.340> uses<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.360> good<00:01:45.570> thing<00:01:45.750> to

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
for other uses so it's a good thing to

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.230 
for other uses so it's a good thing to
bear<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.020> mind

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.180 

now<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.600> way<00:01:49.810> we<00:01:50.080> would<00:01:50.200> do<00:01:50.440> it<00:01:50.470> or<00:01:50.830> we<00:01:50.920> used<00:01:51.070> to

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
now the way we would do it or we used to

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.610 
now the way we would do it or we used to
do<00:01:51.370> it<00:01:51.520> as<00:01:52.060> professionals<00:01:52.780> before<00:01:53.080> Photoshop

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
do it as professionals before Photoshop

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.070 
do it as professionals before Photoshop
but<00:01:54.070> also<00:01:54.280> for<00:01:54.640> videos<00:01:54.970> now<00:01:55.210> it's<00:01:55.420> very<00:01:55.720> useful

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
but also for videos now it's very useful

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.510 
but also for videos now it's very useful
is<00:01:56.260> with<00:01:57.160> hydrochloric<00:01:57.610> acid<00:01:58.360> and<00:01:58.630> ammonia

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
is with hydrochloric acid and ammonia

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.060 
is with hydrochloric acid and ammonia
now<00:02:00.520> what<00:02:01.510> you<00:02:01.660> have<00:02:01.810> to<00:02:01.990> do<00:02:02.170> in<00:02:02.650> you<00:02:02.920> have<00:02:03.010> to

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
now what you have to do in you have to

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.910 
now what you have to do in you have to
be<00:02:03.160> very<00:02:03.550> careful<00:02:04.120> is<00:02:04.330> a<00:02:04.540> little<00:02:05.110> hydrochloric

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
be very careful is a little hydrochloric

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.180 
be very careful is a little hydrochloric
acid<00:02:06.370> around<00:02:06.940> one<00:02:07.180> inch<00:02:07.390> of<00:02:07.540> the<00:02:07.660> cup<00:02:07.900> and

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
acid around one inch of the cup and

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.300 
acid around one inch of the cup and
around<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.369> other<00:02:09.520> side<00:02:09.910> of<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.300> cup<00:02:10.540> the<00:02:10.960> age

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
around the other side of the cup the age

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.760 
around the other side of the cup the age
you<00:02:12.310> put<00:02:12.550> ammonia<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.780> chemical<00:02:14.260> reaction

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
you put ammonia and a chemical reaction

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.280 
you put ammonia and a chemical reaction
or<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:14.980> reaction<00:02:15.400> of<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.610> gases<00:02:16.030> causes<00:02:16.990> smoke

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
or a reaction of the gases causes smoke
