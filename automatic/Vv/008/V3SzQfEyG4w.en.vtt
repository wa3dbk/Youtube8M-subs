00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.710
 of course 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.710
 of course that not only are the players there 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.860
 for something that soda 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.610
 after a mixed note 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.710
 but mexico 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.780
 every school on me I found myself on the collar of the blouse 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.350
 we think 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.970

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:58.600

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.880
 a growing global demand for india 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.390
 that's how to seduce her 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.360
 for several days of rocket fire 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.010
 ngwenya and a normalization of their relations 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.160
 in three heats and one third of people with 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.510
 overall the number of very strong heat 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.720
 montrÃ©al remains no less than the job market does not leave again 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.710

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.710
