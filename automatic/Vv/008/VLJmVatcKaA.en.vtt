00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.090
 the nut cake recipe so here it 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.380
 must obviously nuts 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.090
 lots of things but if we are going to be very 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.130
 Simple is done very quickly 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.810
 bar a butter ointment and one starts 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.140
 you will see the recipe five minutes 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.320
 chrono 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.420
 so we will start by beating the 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.119
 icing sugar with the ointment butter then 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.140
 to families a fatah cream on 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.010
 butter ointment is butter 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.290
 ambient temperature 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.500
 if it is passed ointment we pass a small 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.870
 micron pot here of course if you 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.489
 have a mechanical robot we use his 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.660
 robot at home obviously what 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.360
 is important is to start from a good 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.980
 butter ointment be really good 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.980
 others icing sugar or icing sugar 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.980
 so we will start mixing at the 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.300
 the arize go there we really have a 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.890
 device that is well homogeneous 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.969
 you start and mix the sugar well 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.530
 ice cream so it takes a little while 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.149
 but that would be fine 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.710
 go we'll go to the furnaces of a 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.299
 yes we go to whipping should 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.490
 to incorporate the eggs this is indeed 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.130
 earlier gradually yes we mix 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.979
 as and when better and you can 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.490
 add me the flour go in addition to a 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:18.700
 big spoon 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:21.640
 not sure since flour baking powder 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.890
 for that to blow the little secret of 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.600
 the recipe is a little to this lemon 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.009
 to bring some freshness to the cake and 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.659
 for color to have a side a 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.180
 little bit of bray cake we will put 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:35.079
 a little bit of cocoa powder 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:43.270
 bitter I will help the melting of cocoa 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:44.590
 with milk it's completely finished 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.270
 we just have to add we have 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.869
 nothing grossly crushed 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.390
 we are going from the kernel to 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.369
 instruments the hardiness of your cake 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.960
 war me I come gifts 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.369
 humorous black can 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.110
 possibly be replaced by 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.770

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.299

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.829
 we are in agreement behind it remains 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.509
 more than to garnish our cake molds with 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.290
 three quarters are three quarters since 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.979

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.000
 size of your mold there was the 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.290
 tip of the knife in the chest 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.330
