00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
to go and pull this out let's take a

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.289 
to go and pull this out let's take a
look<00:01:19.049> at<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.200> thing<00:01:19.970> almost<00:01:20.970> looks<00:01:21.060> like<00:01:21.180> a

look at this thing almost looks like a

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.330 
look at this thing almost looks like a
pastry<00:01:23.540> see<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.780> that's<00:01:25.619> actually<00:01:25.890> not<00:01:26.159> how

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
pastry see that that's actually not how

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.060 
pastry see that that's actually not how
it's<00:01:26.520> supposed<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.880> look<00:01:27.590> see<00:01:28.590> these<00:01:28.740> soft

those main pinion and main shaft

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.490 
those main pinion and main shaft
bearings<00:01:40.040> okay<00:01:41.150> it's<00:01:42.150> all<00:01:42.270> melted<00:01:42.689> out<00:01:42.810> these

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
bearings okay it's all melted out these

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.450 
bearings okay it's all melted out these
bearings<00:01:43.860> right<00:01:44.009> now<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.250> here<00:01:44.399> are

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
bearings right now in here are

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.039 
bearings right now in here are
completely<00:01:44.909> dry<00:01:46.100> put<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.280> back<00:01:47.869> which<00:01:48.869> has

here get a close-up look this is another

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.060 
here get a close-up look this is another
customer's<00:01:54.119> transmission<00:01:54.780> bearing<00:01:55.680> got<00:01:55.829> so

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
customer's transmission bearing got so

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.819 
customer's transmission bearing got so
hot<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.490> race<00:01:56.759> we're<00:01:56.969> trying<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.210> get<00:01:57.360> out<00:01:57.829> but

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
hot the race we're trying to get out but

hot the race we're trying to get out but
that<00:01:58.890> big<00:01:59.640> pillow<00:01:59.909> thing<00:02:00.950> just<00:02:01.950> wiped<00:02:02.250> out

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
that big pillow thing just wiped out

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.679 
that big pillow thing just wiped out
clean<00:02:02.700> that's<00:02:02.939> what<00:02:03.090> it's<00:02:03.240> supposed<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.630> look

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
transmission feels good I'm not sure if

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.810 
transmission feels good I'm not sure if
I<00:02:19.140> hear<00:02:19.320> something<00:02:19.590> or<00:02:19.800> not<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.250> there<00:02:20.400> any<00:02:20.640> way

without having to open up the whole

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.060 
without having to open up the whole
transmission<00:02:23.990> see<00:02:24.990> that<00:02:25.200> if<00:02:25.320> my<00:02:25.470> bearing

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
transmission see that if my bearing

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.470 
transmission see that if my bearing
