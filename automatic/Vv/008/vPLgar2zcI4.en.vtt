if<00:01:31.560> there<00:01:31.710> was<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.860> car<00:01:32.159> that's<00:01:32.369> about<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.700> hit<00:01:32.790> a

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
if there was a car that's about to hit a

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.060 
if there was a car that's about to hit a
person<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> dog<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.810> probably<00:01:34.530> pushed<00:01:34.979> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
person and a dog I probably pushed the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.069 
person and a dog I probably pushed the
person<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> way<00:01:35.700> instead<00:01:36.030> but<00:01:36.750> if<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.900> did

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
person on the way instead but if I did

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.630 
person on the way instead but if I did
that<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.290> probably<00:01:37.619> get<00:01:37.890> hit<00:01:37.979> by<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.130> car<00:01:38.340> too

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
that I probably get hit by the car too

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.490 
that I probably get hit by the car too
and<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.090> would<00:01:39.240> suck<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.750> mean<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.259> probably

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
and that would suck I mean I probably

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.109 
and that would suck I mean I probably
just<00:01:40.770> do<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.950> logical<00:01:41.340> thing<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.729> as<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.939> car

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
just do the logical thing and as the car

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.420 
just do the logical thing and as the car
drives<00:01:42.360> by<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.899> jump<00:01:43.530> into<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.890> moving<00:01:44.159> cars

steer it away from the man and just hit

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.569 
steer it away from the man and just hit
the<00:01:58.290> dog<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.890> could<00:01:59.100> save<00:01:59.280> his<00:01:59.430> life

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
the dog so that I could save his life

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.679 
the dog so that I could save his life
and<00:01:59.790> then<00:01:59.880> I'd<00:02:00.000> probably<00:02:00.119> have<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.450> run<00:02:00.630> him

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
and then I'd probably have to run him

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.090 
and then I'd probably have to run him
over<00:02:00.810> as<00:02:01.049> well<00:02:01.229> because<00:02:01.500> he<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:01.770> witnessed

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100

me<00:02:02.189> kill<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.430> guy<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.820> run<00:02:02.909> over<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.180> dog<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:03.719> to

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
me kill a guy and run over a dog just to

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.179 
me kill a guy and run over a dog just to
save<00:02:03.990> his<00:02:04.140> life<00:02:04.290> but<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.590> point<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.070> would

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
save his life but the point is I would

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.950 
save his life but the point is I would
save<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.460> man's<00:02:05.670> life<00:02:05.820> over<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.390> dog<00:02:06.630> and

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
save the man's life over the dog and

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.130 
save the man's life over the dog and
then<00:02:07.680> enough<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.099> kill<00:02:08.429> him<00:02:08.610> as<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.539> was<00:02:09.869> saying

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
then enough to kill him as I was saying

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.000 
then enough to kill him as I was saying
I<00:02:10.259> always<00:02:10.619> saw<00:02:10.800> myself<00:02:10.830> as<00:02:11.310> like<00:02:11.430> an<00:02:11.520> animal

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
I always saw myself as like an animal

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.380 
I always saw myself as like an animal
but<00:02:12.129> I<00:02:12.159> guess<00:02:12.310> I<00:02:12.340> never<00:02:12.459> realized<00:02:12.760> how<00:02:13.000> little

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
but I guess I never realized how little

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.759 
but I guess I never realized how little
society<00:02:13.810> actually<00:02:13.930> values<00:02:14.349> their<00:02:14.560> lives

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
society actually values their lives

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.350 
society actually values their lives
compared<00:02:15.099> to<00:02:15.190> ours<00:02:15.459> think<00:02:15.700> about<00:02:15.909> if<00:02:16.060> a<00:02:16.180> human

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
compared to ours think about if a human

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.910 
compared to ours think about if a human
kills<00:02:16.659> another<00:02:16.810> human<00:02:17.170> he<00:02:17.290> ends<00:02:17.560> up<00:02:17.650> in<00:02:17.769> Jim

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
kills another human he ends up in Jim

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.440 
kills another human he ends up in Jim
and<00:02:18.129> Adam<00:02:18.310> a<00:02:18.370> were<00:02:18.489> to<00:02:18.580> even<00:02:18.700> harm<00:02:18.970> a<00:02:19.060> human<00:02:19.299> it

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
and Adam a were to even harm a human it

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.119 
and Adam a were to even harm a human it
wouldn't<00:02:19.659> go<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.780> jail<00:02:20.140> we<00:02:20.379> probably<00:02:20.590> kill<00:02:20.950> in

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
wouldn't go to jail we probably kill in

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.440 
wouldn't go to jail we probably kill in
fact<00:02:21.310> most<00:02:21.549> of<00:02:21.640> our<00:02:21.790> pets<00:02:21.970> that<00:02:22.030> we<00:02:22.180> love<00:02:22.330> the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
fact most of our pets that we love the

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.880 
fact most of our pets that we love the
most<00:02:22.599> are<00:02:22.750> pretty<00:02:22.959> much<00:02:23.140> already<00:02:23.440> in<00:02:23.560> jail

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
most are pretty much already in jail

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.710 
most are pretty much already in jail
take<00:02:24.099> dogs<00:02:24.310> for<00:02:24.549> example<00:02:24.909> we<00:02:25.030> lock<00:02:25.239> them<00:02:25.450> up<00:02:25.540> so

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
take dogs for example we lock them up so

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.509 
take dogs for example we lock them up so
they<00:02:25.810> don't<00:02:25.840> run<00:02:26.110> away<00:02:26.230> they<00:02:26.709> only<00:02:26.980> eat<00:02:27.370> when

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
they don't run away they only eat when

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.070 
they don't run away they only eat when
we<00:02:27.640> tell<00:02:27.849> them<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.390> if<00:02:28.510> you<00:02:28.599> have<00:02:28.690> two<00:02:28.840> dogs

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
we tell them to and if you have two dogs

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.509 
we tell them to and if you have two dogs
I<00:02:29.260> mean<00:02:29.290> they<00:02:29.500> might<00:02:29.650> not<00:02:29.769> be<00:02:29.890> in<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.040> shower<00:02:30.250> but

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
I mean they might not be in a shower but

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:31.949 
I mean they might not be in a shower but
there's<00:02:30.700> always<00:02:30.819> that<00:02:30.970> one<00:02:31.209> dog<00:02:31.540> that<00:02:31.569> likes

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
there's always that one dog that likes

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.570 
there's always that one dog that likes
to<00:02:32.110> hump<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.530> other<00:02:32.739> one<00:02:32.980> even<00:02:33.250> people<00:02:33.519> who

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
to hump the other one even people who

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.699 
to hump the other one even people who
love<00:02:33.790> animals<00:02:34.000> most<00:02:34.510> like<00:02:34.810> zookeepers<00:02:35.410> think

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
love animals most like zookeepers think

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.110 
love animals most like zookeepers think
about<00:02:35.860> in<00:02:35.980> an<00:02:36.099> animal's<00:02:36.459> perspective<00:02:36.489> they're

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
about in an animal's perspective they're

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.699 
about in an animal's perspective they're
pretty<00:02:37.390> much<00:02:37.480> just<00:02:37.540> a<00:02:37.750> warning<00:02:38.019> of<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.290> Big<00:02:38.500> Joe

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709
