00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
see on this one that it's just a series

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.960 
see on this one that it's just a series
of<00:00:29.990> lines<00:00:30.619> getting<00:00:31.009> bigger<00:00:31.310> and<00:00:31.519> bigger<00:00:31.580> that

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
of lines getting bigger and bigger that

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.780 
of lines getting bigger and bigger that
are<00:00:32.090> outlining<00:00:32.660> the<00:00:33.440> shape<00:00:33.470> of<00:00:33.890> the<00:00:34.310> cat<00:00:34.520> on

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
are outlining the shape of the cat on

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.250 
are outlining the shape of the cat on
there<00:00:35.680> and<00:00:36.680> here's<00:00:36.860> another<00:00:37.010> one<00:00:38.020> one<00:00:39.020> of<00:00:39.140> the

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
there and here's another one one of the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.320 
there and here's another one one of the
fun<00:00:39.560> things<00:00:39.590> about<00:00:40.160> it<00:00:40.400> is<00:00:40.430> to<00:00:40.790> vary<00:00:41.090> your

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
fun things about it is to vary your

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.330 
fun things about it is to vary your
width<00:00:41.570> so<00:00:41.840> sometimes<00:00:42.290> I<00:00:42.470> have<00:00:42.650> my<00:00:42.860> lines<00:00:43.100> very

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
width so sometimes I have my lines very

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.160 
width so sometimes I have my lines very
close<00:00:43.640> together<00:00:43.850> and<00:00:44.300> sometimes<00:00:44.660> I<00:00:44.780> have<00:00:44.960> them

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
close together and sometimes I have them

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.140 
close together and sometimes I have them
a<00:00:45.200> little<00:00:45.470> bit<00:00:45.560> farther<00:00:45.830> apart<00:00:46.070> so<00:00:46.910> play<00:00:47.120> with

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
a little bit farther apart so play with

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.460 
a little bit farther apart so play with
that<00:00:47.390> and<00:00:47.600> it'll<00:00:47.810> add<00:00:47.990> a<00:00:48.020> little<00:00:48.290> bit<00:00:48.440> of

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
that and it'll add a little bit of

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.330 
that and it'll add a little bit of
liveliness<00:00:48.950> to<00:00:49.820> your<00:00:50.090> design<00:00:50.920> so<00:00:51.920> I'm<00:00:52.190> not

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
liveliness to your design so I'm not

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.590 
liveliness to your design so I'm not
going<00:00:52.490> to<00:00:52.550> show<00:00:52.700> that<00:00:52.730> one<00:00:53.000> on<00:00:53.150> the<00:00:53.240> machine

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
going to show that one on the machine

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.720 
going to show that one on the machine
I'm<00:00:54.500> just<00:00:54.770> going<00:00:54.890> to<00:00:54.950> show<00:00:55.130> it<00:00:55.160> on<00:00:55.340> a<00:00:55.370> piece<00:00:55.610> of

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
I'm just going to show it on a piece of

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.670 
I'm just going to show it on a piece of
paper<00:00:55.850> so<00:00:56.180> that<00:00:56.300> you<00:00:56.390> can<00:00:56.540> see<00:00:56.810> the<00:00:57.470> whole

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
paper so that you can see the whole

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.390 
paper so that you can see the whole
thing<00:00:57.710> I<00:00:58.870> recommend<00:00:59.870> choosing<00:01:00.380> a<00:01:00.830> simple

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
thing I recommend choosing a simple

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.380 
thing I recommend choosing a simple
shape<00:01:01.700> if<00:01:02.480> it<00:01:02.690> was<00:01:02.900> a<00:01:03.230> cat<00:01:03.920> that<00:01:03.980> had<00:01:04.369> you<00:01:05.269> know

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
shape if it was a cat that had you know

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.830 
shape if it was a cat that had you know
jaggedy<00:01:05.899> whiskers<00:01:06.289> on<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:06.770> side<00:01:07.149> for<00:01:08.149> the<00:01:08.659> cat

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
jaggedy whiskers on the side for the cat

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.209 
jaggedy whiskers on the side for the cat
space<00:01:09.170> you<00:01:09.530> don't<00:01:09.619> want<00:01:09.829> to<00:01:09.890> have<00:01:10.009> to<00:01:10.100> go

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:10.219 
space you don't want to have to go

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:12.160 
space you don't want to have to go
around<00:01:10.369> those<00:01:10.820> little<00:01:11.149> jagged<00:01:11.329> e<00:01:11.509> whiskers<00:01:11.840> so

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
around those little jagged e whiskers so

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.800 
around those little jagged e whiskers so
pick<00:01:12.439> the<00:01:12.469> echo<00:01:12.979> quilting<00:01:13.189> to<00:01:14.000> go<00:01:14.149> around<00:01:14.570> a

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
pick the echo quilting to go around a

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.169 
pick the echo quilting to go around a
relatively<00:01:15.380> simple<00:01:15.710> shaped<00:01:16.130> cat<00:01:16.700> or<00:01:16.969> other

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:17.179 
relatively simple shaped cat or other

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:19.389 
relatively simple shaped cat or other
applique<00:01:17.719> and<00:01:17.960> then<00:01:18.469> it's<00:01:18.619> very<00:01:18.710> simple<00:01:18.859> you

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
applique and then it's very simple you

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:27.669 
applique and then it's very simple you
just<00:01:19.789> start<00:01:20.240> at<00:01:21.079> one<00:01:21.140> edge<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:23.390> go<00:01:23.539> up<00:01:26.679> and

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:27.679 
just start at one edge and go up and

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:29.770 
just start at one edge and go up and
when<00:01:27.859> you<00:01:27.950> get<00:01:28.070> to<00:01:28.219> the<00:01:28.340> bottom<00:01:28.729> here<00:01:29.149> you

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
when you get to the bottom here you

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.450 
when you get to the bottom here you
don't<00:01:29.960> want<00:01:30.109> to<00:01:30.200> tie<00:01:30.679> off<00:01:30.950> and<00:01:31.189> cut<00:01:31.340> your

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
don't want to tie off and cut your

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.499 
don't want to tie off and cut your
threads<00:01:31.789> because<00:01:32.060> that's<00:01:32.240> going<00:01:32.390> to<00:01:32.450> be

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
threads because that's going to be

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.480 
threads because that's going to be
tedious<00:01:32.929> and<00:01:33.200> time-consuming<00:01:33.439> just<00:01:34.189> scootch

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
tedious and time-consuming just scootch

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.819 
tedious and time-consuming just scootch
over<00:01:34.670> at<00:01:34.939> the<00:01:35.060> bottom<00:01:37.990> go<00:01:38.990> up<00:01:39.200> and<00:01:39.409> around<00:01:39.649> it

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
over at the bottom go up and around it

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:45.520 
over at the bottom go up and around it
again<00:01:41.409> and<00:01:43.240> you<00:01:44.240> just<00:01:44.270> keep<00:01:44.689> following<00:01:45.319> that

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
again and you just keep following that

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.639 
again and you just keep following that
shape<00:01:46.039> of<00:01:46.310> your<00:01:46.719> applique<00:01:47.719> over<00:01:48.289> and<00:01:48.439> over

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
shape of your applique over and over

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.050 
shape of your applique over and over
again<00:01:48.740> until<00:01:49.249> you<00:01:49.340> get<00:01:49.460> to<00:01:49.579> the<00:01:49.700> edges<00:01:49.850> of<00:01:50.030> your

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
again until you get to the edges of your

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.809 
again until you get to the edges of your
block<00:01:50.329> so<00:01:51.259> that's<00:01:51.469> it<00:01:51.710> echo<00:01:52.280> quilting<00:01:52.490> is

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
block so that's it echo quilting is

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:54.639 
block so that's it echo quilting is
really<00:01:53.179> really<00:01:53.450> easy<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:53.840> do<00:01:53.990> and<00:01:54.020> you<00:01:54.380> don't

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
really really easy to do and you don't
