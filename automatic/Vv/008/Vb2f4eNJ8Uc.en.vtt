the reason for this if it comes after
the<00:00:30.090> COG<00:00:30.390> below<00:00:31.009> it's<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.130> bit<00:00:32.340> Lee<00:00:32.610> if<00:00:32.820> we<00:00:32.940> can't

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
the COG below it's a bit Lee if we can't

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.850 
the COG below it's a bit Lee if we can't
get<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.270> background<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.780> want<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.440> have<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.770> do

with the barrels probably split punching
if<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.480> bit<00:00:39.750> actually<00:00:39.960> there<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.680> crankcase

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
if this bit actually there the crankcase

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.970 
if this bit actually there the crankcase
and<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.399> case<00:00:41.579> in<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.940> future<00:00:42.469> to<00:00:43.469> get<00:00:43.890> it

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
and this case in the future to get it

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.250 
and this case in the future to get it
back<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.160> which<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.850> nice<00:00:45.140> nice<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.950> be<00:00:47.070> honest

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
back on which is nice nice to be honest

back on which is nice nice to be honest
let's<00:00:49.649> Martine<00:00:50.039> keep<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> chain<00:00:50.579> tart<00:00:50.850> okay

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
let's Martine keep the chain tart okay

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.910 
let's Martine keep the chain tart okay
at<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.550> stage<00:00:53.820> if<00:00:54.059> we<00:00:54.239> are<00:00:54.390> replaced<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
at this stage if we are replaced and the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.560 
at this stage if we are replaced and the
cam<00:00:56.129> chain<00:00:56.160> up<00:00:56.670> here<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:59.520> very<00:00:59.760> easy

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
cam chain up here and the very easy

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.049 
cam chain up here and the very easy
tricular<00:01:01.050> train<00:01:01.530> here<00:01:01.800> alright

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
tricular train here alright

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.840 
tricular train here alright
replacing<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.049> chain<00:01:04.320> basically<00:01:05.129> grain

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
replacing the chain basically grain

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.660 
replacing the chain basically grain
don't<00:01:06.150> pin<00:01:06.540> split<00:01:07.439> okay<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.250> you'll<00:01:08.369> have<00:01:08.460> two

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
don't pin split okay so you'll have two

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.020 
don't pin split okay so you'll have two
pieces<00:01:09.119> keeping<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.840> tired<00:01:10.049> all<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.260> time<00:01:10.380> and

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
pieces keeping it tired all the time and

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.830 
pieces keeping it tired all the time and
with<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> new<00:01:12.270> chain<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.580> one<00:01:14.580> end<00:01:14.820> okay<00:01:15.509> one

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
with the new chain and one end okay one

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.289 
with the new chain and one end okay one
end<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.920> oil<00:01:16.979> chain<00:01:17.369> one<00:01:17.700> end<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> new

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
end of the oil chain one end of the new

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.820 
end of the oil chain one end of the new
chain<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:19.310> basically<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.729> can<00:01:20.790> actually<00:01:21.299> I

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
chain and basically you can actually I

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.640 
chain and basically you can actually I
didn't<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.130> press<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.520> put<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:24.650> into

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
didn't you have to press you put it into

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.850 
didn't you have to press you put it into
neutral<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.850> should<00:01:27.000> be<00:01:27.060> actually<00:01:27.180> feed

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
neutral and you should be actually feed

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.530

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
you know more actually feature was if

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.850 
you know more actually feature was if
you<00:01:32.579> know<00:01:32.670> what<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.790> mean<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.530> take<00:01:34.530> out<00:01:34.680> your

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
temporary pin from the other no and put

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.859 
temporary pin from the other no and put
it<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.130> your<00:01:38.159> know<00:01:38.400> your<00:01:39.299> new<00:01:39.479> link<00:01:39.689> another

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
it in your know your new link another

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.260 
it in your know your new link another
one<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.650> tightness<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:42.060> that's<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:43.860> very

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
one and tightness and that's the very

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.240 
one and tightness and that's the very
easiest<00:01:45.270> way<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.450> can<00:01:45.570> think<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:46.020> putting<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.130> new

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
easiest way I can think of putting a new

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.499 
easiest way I can think of putting a new
can<00:01:47.490> chain<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.880> we're<00:01:47.970> all<00:01:48.090> taking<00:01:48.240> off

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
can chain and we're all taking off

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.380 
can chain and we're all taking off
everything<00:01:48.840> okay<00:01:49.259> now<00:01:50.070> as<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.970> can<00:01:51.030> see<00:01:51.210> with

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
everything okay now as you can see with

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.560 
everything okay now as you can see with
the<00:01:51.509> pockets<00:01:52.640> that's<00:01:53.640> number<00:01:53.820> two<00:01:54.090> which<00:01:54.390> are

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
the pockets that's number two which are

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.899 
the pockets that's number two which are
actually<00:01:55.049> two<00:01:55.229> them<00:01:55.409> are<00:01:55.530> over<00:01:55.649> me<00:01:55.950> okay

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
actually two them are over me okay

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.310 
actually two them are over me okay
the<00:01:57.149> rest<00:01:57.329> I'm<00:01:57.479> actually<00:01:57.630> gonna<00:01:57.899> leave<00:01:58.049> say
