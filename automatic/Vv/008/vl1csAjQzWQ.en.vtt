00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
like a Christmas tree it starts kind of

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.610 
like a Christmas tree it starts kind of
wider<00:00:42.540> at<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.780> bottom<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.230> gets<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.440> little

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
wider at the bottom and gets a little

like<00:00:47.670> blackest<00:00:48.180> black<00:00:48.480> or<00:00:48.840> what<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.620> black

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
like blackest black or what is it black

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.360 
like blackest black or what is it black

final review / opinions so I really like
this<00:02:07.350> mascara<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:08.130> remember<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.610> everyone's

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
this mascara I remember that everyone's

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.430 
this mascara I remember that everyone's
eyelashes<00:02:09.390> are<00:02:09.539> different<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.110> feel<00:02:10.319> like

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
eyelashes are different and I feel like

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.050 
eyelashes are different and I feel like
mascaras<00:02:10.979> wear<00:02:11.130> differently<00:02:11.610> on<00:02:11.700> each<00:02:11.790> people

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
mascaras wear differently on each people

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.620 
mascaras wear differently on each people
on<00:02:12.390> each<00:02:12.810> people<00:02:13.080> on<00:02:13.650> different<00:02:13.920> people<00:02:14.630> for

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
on each people on different people for

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.120 
on each people on different people for
me<00:02:15.750> when<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:15.930> wear<00:02:16.079> this<00:02:16.170> mascara<00:02:16.650> on<00:02:16.829> my<00:02:16.860> lower

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
me when I wear this mascara on my lower

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.310 
me when I wear this mascara on my lower
lashes<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.790> tend<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.690> notice<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.959> little<00:02:19.170> bit<00:02:19.260> of

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
lashes I tend to notice a little bit of

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.170 
lashes I tend to notice a little bit of
smudging<00:02:19.680> underneath<00:02:20.010> my<00:02:20.160> eyelashes<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:20.970> I

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
smudging underneath my eyelashes so I

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.699 
smudging underneath my eyelashes so I
think<00:02:21.450> this<00:02:21.690> would<00:02:21.810> be<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.930> good<00:02:22.110> mascara<00:02:22.410> just

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
think this would be a good mascara just

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.650 
think this would be a good mascara just
to<00:02:22.860> use<00:02:23.010> on<00:02:23.190> your<00:02:23.310> top<00:02:23.519> lashes<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.180> then<00:02:24.269> use<00:02:24.630> a

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
to use on your top lashes and then use a

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.259 
to use on your top lashes and then use a
different<00:02:24.989> mascara<00:02:25.440> on<00:02:25.620> your<00:02:25.739> lower<00:02:25.920> lashes

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
different mascara on your lower lashes

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.150 
different mascara on your lower lashes
um<00:02:27.269> you<00:02:27.660> know<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:27.810> think<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.590> this<00:02:28.680> mascara<00:02:29.040> is

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
um you know I think that this mascara is

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.370 
um you know I think that this mascara is
pretty<00:02:29.340> awesome<00:02:29.489> however<00:02:30.269> I<00:02:30.359> did<00:02:30.660> notice<00:02:31.109> it

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
pretty awesome however I did notice it

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.150 
pretty awesome however I did notice it
flicked<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.739> little<00:02:31.950> bit<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:33.440> so<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.920> know<00:02:35.010> if

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
flicked a little bit and so you know if

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.650 
flicked a little bit and so you know if
you<00:02:35.340> have<00:02:35.579> time<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.880> check<00:02:36.000> that<00:02:36.180> up<00:02:36.329> then<00:02:36.540> that

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
you have time to check that up then that

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.460 
you have time to check that up then that
would<00:02:36.780> be<00:02:36.900> amazing

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
would be amazing

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.900 
would be amazing
but<00:02:37.890> other<00:02:38.040> than<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.340> really<00:02:38.459> do<00:02:38.790> like

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
but other than that I really do like

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.370 
but other than that I really do like
this<00:02:39.030> mascara<00:02:39.480> as<00:02:39.630> you<00:02:39.690> guys<00:02:39.840> can<00:02:40.019> see<00:02:40.230> it

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
this mascara as you guys can see it

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.860 
this mascara as you guys can see it
gives<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.739> a<00:02:40.769> lot<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.220> length<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:41.970> volume<00:02:42.269> and

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
gives you a lot of length and volume and

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.380 
gives you a lot of length and volume and
I<00:02:43.109> think<00:02:43.980> actually<00:02:44.130> more<00:02:44.489> volume<00:02:44.940> than<00:02:45.150> length

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
I think actually more volume than length

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.300 
I think actually more volume than length
so<00:02:45.690> that's<00:02:46.200> what<00:02:46.350> this<00:02:46.440> mascara<00:02:46.799> looks<00:02:47.070> like<00:02:47.220> I

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
so that's what this mascara looks like I

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.130 
so that's what this mascara looks like I
hope<00:02:47.459> you<00:02:47.549> guys<00:02:47.670> enjoyed<00:02:48.000> this<00:02:48.150> review<00:02:48.359> /<00:02:48.750> demo
