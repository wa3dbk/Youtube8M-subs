00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 the zoom-function gibbs under ios already 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.940
 a bit longer hiding in 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.379
 the attitudes there in the area 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.040
 tools we can always 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.719
 stand in 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.730
 there you can turn it on and off 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.219
 set a few configuration here 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.780
 we got into the zoom function now 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.010
 already laid on the homebutton that 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.580
 If I call the home button three times 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.880
 to press 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.170
 that was only twice when I was three times 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.550
 press the home button then he asks 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.019
 we want what we want to do 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.210
 here the grays describe the 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.900
 reverse colors or even the super 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.480
 activate 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.940
 and in contrast to ios 7 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.200
 improved a bit under ios 8 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.700
 or were a two 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.660
 small adjustments always make the sun 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.820
 show briefly 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.649
 the zoom in the first place for people who 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.700
 have problems with the iphone display 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.260
 read 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.940
 if we activate it we will get it 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.559
 a small window appears that 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.570
 almost into a picture of the 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.950
 current screen shows bigger on 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.940
 I have here a small cursor 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.719
 inside the cursor chambers use as 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.280
 I I see the search activates 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.500
 use cursor chamber around here, so to speak 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.000
 through the whole screen display 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.460
 to fly if I have my finger 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.439
 We can turn one into one 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.970
 we will say application navigation now 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.530
 that from the spot and now I can you 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.270
 use as normal as I usually do 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.010
 would do if I cant on the play 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.240
 he has only come to the application 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.610
 goes on and I have here again 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.229
 the larger section inside the me 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.850
 then you can use it normally, that is 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.680
 if I'm not on this one right now 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.990
 I can handle this stick here 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.729
 also normal up and down scroll only 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.200
 if I cut the screen after 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.470
 must shift left and right 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.520
 I use this path in there 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.020
 Incidentally , hide in also one 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.710
 two other attitude if I once 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.060
 short on this joystick shopping tip 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.610
 crawl so an overlay appears where i am 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.530
 then I can choose whether the result to 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.540
 activated that was the thing the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.070
 under 16 also already standard was the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.680
 apartments screen cutout but 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.350
 that the complete the complete screen 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.420
 Enlarged down these little magnifying glasses 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.860
 Plus - I can tell you how big 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.719
 I like this cut out the 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.460
 authorities since I can almost go back 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.619
 to the default setting but can 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.759
 me also in small in small 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.659
 take screen cutout and the 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.179
 really big doll pull 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.590
 filter I can now say that too 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.629
 not only wants it bigger but 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.049
 also grays in grayscale 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:15.280
 displayed or invested and 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.060
 The control can then again 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.069
 hide 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.900
 that is then that in this genre 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.400
 stick on or not 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.019
 see I bring to get out again 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.790
 With the home button you have enough 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.200
 Zoomed in and made the thing as you did 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.200
 you want to be able to do on your device 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.920
 Again, three times on the home 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.450
 press button 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.340
 I click here the control displays 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.080
 yes expresses on such a day and 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.620
 I'm back in the normal display in that 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.890
 the zoom or 18 for people who are not 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.849
 quite as good as you can see and me 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.849
 looking for children
