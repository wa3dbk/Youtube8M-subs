00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
doing it for a few seconds and then

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.210 
doing it for a few seconds and then
switching<00:05:15.250> and<00:05:15.460> it<00:05:16.210> just<00:05:16.480> it<00:05:16.840> allows<00:05:17.650> you<00:05:18.010> to

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
body okay I think that's the that's sort

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.800 
body okay I think that's the that's sort
of<00:05:23.770> the<00:05:23.830> difference<00:05:24.310> between<00:05:24.660> yoga<00:05:25.660> and

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
of the difference between yoga and

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.660 
of the difference between yoga and
stretching<00:05:26.320> if<00:05:26.680> you're<00:05:26.830> going<00:05:27.010> to<00:05:27.130> make<00:05:27.640> a

stretching if you're going to make a

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.720 
stretching if you're going to make a
difference<00:05:28.630> between<00:05:29.380> with<00:05:29.530> you<00:05:29.680> and<00:05:30.610> you

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
difference between with you and you

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.960 
difference between with you and you
really<00:05:30.880> focus<00:05:31.180> obviously<00:05:31.720> on<00:05:32.170> breath<00:05:32.970> when

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
you're when you are doing the poses

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.810 
you're when you are doing the poses
breathing<00:05:37.600> into<00:05:38.050> any<00:05:38.500> tightness<00:05:39.190> and<00:05:39.610> just
