coming<00:00:24.900> out<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.170> try<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.439> for<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.859> first<00:00:25.890> time

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
coming out to try it for the first time

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.580 
coming out to try it for the first time
I<00:00:26.609> think<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.539> lot<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.750> people<00:00:27.960> think<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.260> racing

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
I think a lot of people think of racing

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.519 
I think a lot of people think of racing
are<00:00:28.710> just<00:00:28.859> normal<00:00:29.609> driving<00:00:29.849> but<00:00:30.150> faster<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:31.349> it

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
are just normal driving but faster is it

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.740 
are just normal driving but faster is it
like<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.769> or<00:00:31.949> what<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.160> what<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.750> peculiar

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
like that or what is what is peculiar

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.970 
like that or what is what is peculiar
about<00:00:33.780> racing<00:00:34.230> here<00:00:34.380> we're<00:00:34.590> different<00:00:34.860> about

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
about racing here we're different about

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.799 
about racing here we're different about
racing<00:00:35.250> here<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.489> driving<00:00:35.820> your<00:00:35.940> car<00:00:36.120> well

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
racing here the driving your car well

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.950 
racing here the driving your car well
yeah<00:00:37.410> people<00:00:38.010> do<00:00:38.280> think<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.910> racing<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.660> just

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
yeah people do think of racing is just

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.680 
yeah people do think of racing is just
going<00:00:40.290> out<00:00:40.649> there<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.300> driving<00:00:42.300> really<00:00:42.570> fast

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
going out there and driving really fast

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.830 
going out there and driving really fast
I<00:00:43.379> remember<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.280> first<00:00:44.730> time<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.570> got

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
I remember the first time that I got

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.560 
I remember the first time that I got
into<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.170> race<00:00:46.469> car<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.610> drove<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.539> a

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
into a race car and I drove on a

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.410 
into a race car and I drove on a
racetrack<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.559> after<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.340> first<00:00:50.640> time<00:00:51.090> I

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
racetrack and after that first time I

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.080 
racetrack and after that first time I
quickly<00:00:51.840> realized<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.739> driving<00:00:53.370> fast<00:00:53.730> out

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
quickly realized that driving fast out

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.330 
quickly realized that driving fast out
on<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.390> street<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:55.260> wasn't<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.829> place<00:00:56.070> to

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
on the street that wasn't the place to

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.029 
on the street that wasn't the place to
do<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.550> because<00:00:57.090> there's<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.840> lot<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.170> things

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
do it because there's a lot of things

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.220 
do it because there's a lot of things
that<00:00:59.370> you're<00:00:59.579> not<00:00:59.609> in<00:01:00.030> control<00:01:00.449> about<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
that you're not in control about on the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.950 
that you're not in control about on the
street<00:01:01.559> whereas<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> racetrack<00:01:02.960> you

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
street whereas on the racetrack you

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.899 
street whereas on the racetrack you
don't<00:01:04.140> have<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.470> worry<00:01:04.680> about<00:01:04.769> cars<00:01:05.280> going<00:01:05.640> in

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
don't have to worry about cars going in

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.350 
don't have to worry about cars going in
the<00:01:06.270> wrong<00:01:06.450> direction

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
the wrong direction

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.110 
the wrong direction
and<00:01:07.510> you<00:01:08.080> you<00:01:08.380> also<00:01:08.590> learn<00:01:09.250> the<00:01:09.670> proper

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
and you you also learn the proper

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.320 
and you you also learn the proper
technique<00:01:10.960> for<00:01:11.200> driving<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:12.040> car<00:01:12.310> at<00:01:12.850> speed

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
technique for driving the car at speed

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.390 
technique for driving the car at speed
and<00:01:13.870> there<00:01:14.110> are<00:01:14.260> certain<00:01:14.740> things<00:01:14.860> that<00:01:15.280> you

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
and there are certain things that you

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.820 
and there are certain things that you
have<00:01:15.520> to<00:01:15.850> be<00:01:16.030> aware<00:01:16.330> of<00:01:16.390> when<00:01:17.290> you're<00:01:17.470> driving

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
have to be aware of when you're driving

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.580 
have to be aware of when you're driving
a<00:01:18.130> car<00:01:18.160> fast<00:01:19.120> and<00:01:19.450> actually<00:01:19.840> everything<00:01:20.320> that

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
a car fast and actually everything that

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.460 
a car fast and actually everything that
you<00:01:20.950> learn<00:01:21.340> about<00:01:21.780> driving<00:01:22.780> on<00:01:23.110> a<00:01:23.140> racetrack

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
you learn about driving on a racetrack

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.670 
you learn about driving on a racetrack
it<00:01:24.280> makes<00:01:24.610> you<00:01:24.820> a<00:01:24.850> better<00:01:25.270> driver<00:01:25.900> out<00:01:26.320> on<00:01:26.530> the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
it makes you a better driver out on the

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.650 
it makes you a better driver out on the
street<00:01:26.980> because<00:01:27.160> you<00:01:27.460> understand<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.210> car<00:01:28.420> a

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
street because you understand the car a

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.780 
street because you understand the car a
little<00:01:28.930> bit<00:01:29.080> better<00:01:29.350> and<00:01:29.710> what<00:01:30.160> its<00:01:30.310> abilities

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
little bit better and what its abilities

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.510 
little bit better and what its abilities
are<00:01:31.050> you<00:01:32.050> know<00:01:32.170> I<00:01:32.200> guess<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.310> most

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
are you know I guess the the most

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.330 
are you know I guess the the most
trouble<00:01:34.000> I<00:01:34.090> see<00:01:34.390> is<00:01:34.720> they<00:01:35.350> get<00:01:35.590> into<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.100> car

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
trouble I see is they get into the car

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.719 
trouble I see is they get into the car
and<00:01:36.850> they're<00:01:37.360> very<00:01:37.570> anxious<00:01:38.350> to<00:01:38.560> go<00:01:38.740> very<00:01:39.040> fast

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
and they're very anxious to go very fast

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.870 
and they're very anxious to go very fast
and<00:01:39.850> sometimes<00:01:40.630> they<00:01:41.590> they<00:01:41.920> get<00:01:42.310> ahead<00:01:42.610> of<00:01:42.790> the

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
and sometimes they they get ahead of the

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.750 
and sometimes they they get ahead of the
technique<00:01:43.450> and<00:01:43.810> they'll<00:01:44.050> try<00:01:44.350> to<00:01:44.410> go<00:01:44.740> too<00:01:45.370> fast

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
technique and they'll try to go too fast

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.660 
technique and they'll try to go too fast
too<00:01:46.180> soon<00:01:46.210> and<00:01:46.960> not<00:01:47.229> practice<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.190> technique

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
too soon and not practice the technique

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.030 
too soon and not practice the technique
and<00:01:48.880> it's<00:01:49.330> really<00:01:49.660> the<00:01:49.900> technique<00:01:50.350> you<00:01:50.860> need

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
and it's really the technique you need

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.980 
and it's really the technique you need
the<00:01:51.220> proper<00:01:51.670> technique<00:01:52.119> to<00:01:52.300> drive<00:01:52.540> these<00:01:52.780> cars

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
the proper technique to drive these cars

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.140 
the proper technique to drive these cars
properly<00:01:53.380> just<00:01:53.920> like<00:01:54.160> any<00:01:54.430> other<00:01:54.670> sport

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
properly just like any other sport

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.940 
properly just like any other sport
there's<00:01:55.450> a<00:01:55.540> certain<00:01:55.900> technique<00:01:56.260> for<00:01:56.500> doing<00:01:56.680> it

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
there's a certain technique for doing it

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.250 
there's a certain technique for doing it
and<00:01:57.220> you<00:01:57.670> need<00:01:57.910> the<00:01:58.150> technique<00:01:58.600> so<00:01:58.840> people

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
and you need the technique so people

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.170 
and you need the technique so people
forget<00:01:59.800> about<00:02:00.040> the<00:02:00.460> technique

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.450 

we<00:02:05.570> ended<00:02:05.780> up<00:02:05.900> spinning<00:02:06.320> on<00:02:06.770> because<00:02:07.220> of<00:02:07.340> how

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
we ended up spinning on because of how

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.530 
we ended up spinning on because of how
fast<00:02:07.760> they're<00:02:08.180> going

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
fast they're going

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.570 
fast they're going
but<00:02:09.080> because<00:02:09.410> they're<00:02:09.619> not<00:02:09.650> using<00:02:10.100> proper

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
but because they're not using proper

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:34.940 
but because they're not using proper
technique<00:02:10.790> it's<00:02:11.450> all<00:02:11.690> about

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.890 

well<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:36.220> lot<00:02:36.550> of<00:02:36.580> people<00:02:36.730> out<00:02:37.239> on<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.540> street

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
well a lot of people out on the street

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.559 
well a lot of people out on the street
we<00:02:38.200> tend<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.650> drive<00:02:39.099> with<00:02:39.580> our<00:02:39.730> foot<00:02:40.120> on<00:02:40.330> the

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
we tend to drive with our foot on the

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.630 
we tend to drive with our foot on the
brake<00:02:40.810> pedal<00:02:41.080> as<00:02:41.440> we're<00:02:41.739> going<00:02:42.010> around<00:02:42.250> the

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
brake pedal as we're going around the

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.240 
brake pedal as we're going around the
corner<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.270> actually<00:02:44.140> that's<00:02:44.830> not<00:02:45.069> the

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
corner and actually that's not the

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.400 
corner and actually that's not the
correct<00:02:45.819> way<00:02:46.120> of<00:02:46.150> going<00:02:46.510> around<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:47.050> corner

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
correct way of going around the corner

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.500 
correct way of going around the corner
what<00:02:47.590> we<00:02:47.709> have<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:48.130> do<00:02:48.280> is<00:02:48.489> we<00:02:48.640> have<00:02:48.819> to<00:02:48.940> do<00:02:49.209> all

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
what we have to do is we have to do all

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.259 
what we have to do is we have to do all
of<00:02:49.540> our<00:02:49.959> braking<00:02:50.560> before<00:02:51.310> we<00:02:51.580> even<00:02:51.940> start

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
of our braking before we even start

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.509 
of our braking before we even start
turning<00:02:52.690> into<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.989> corner<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:53.620> then<00:02:54.040> once<00:02:54.310> we

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
turning into the corner and then once we

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.130 
turning into the corner and then once we
start<00:02:54.819> turning<00:02:55.269> into<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.540> corner<00:02:55.930> we're

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
start turning into the corner we're

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.199 
start turning into the corner we're
supposed<00:02:56.410> to<00:02:56.530> be<00:02:56.769> back<00:02:57.069> on<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.640> gas<00:02:57.819> pedal

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
supposed to be back on the gas pedal

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.809 
supposed to be back on the gas pedal
what<00:02:58.540> that<00:02:58.750> does<00:02:59.050> is<00:02:59.349> that<00:02:59.790> balances<00:03:00.790> the

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
what that does is that balances the

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.729 
what that does is that balances the
weight<00:03:01.239> of<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.510> car<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:02.080> gives<00:03:02.290> us<00:03:02.440> good

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
weight of the car and it gives us good

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.820 
weight of the car and it gives us good
traction<00:03:03.519> as<00:03:03.880> we<00:03:04.299> steer<00:03:04.780> through<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.319> corners

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
traction as we steer through the corners

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.190 
traction as we steer through the corners
once<00:03:06.610> you<00:03:06.819> get<00:03:07.030> into<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.420> car<00:03:07.630> and<00:03:07.900> you<00:03:08.049> do

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
once you get into the car and you do

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.380 
once you get into the car and you do
your<00:03:08.380> first<00:03:08.680> couple<00:03:09.250> of<00:03:09.310> laps<00:03:09.519> in<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.910> car<00:03:10.120> all

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
your first couple of laps in the car all

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.539 
your first couple of laps in the car all
the<00:03:10.420> nervousness<00:03:11.260> goes<00:03:11.680> away<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.160> you<00:03:12.250> start

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
the nervousness goes away and you start

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.100 
the nervousness goes away and you start
feeling<00:03:12.730> more<00:03:13.030> comfortable<00:03:13.269> about<00:03:13.840> what

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
feeling more comfortable about what

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.289 
feeling more comfortable about what
you're<00:03:14.319> doing<00:03:14.610> does<00:03:15.610> it<00:03:15.730> cost<00:03:15.910> an<00:03:16.060> arm<00:03:16.150> I'd

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
you're doing does it cost an arm I'd

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.710 
you're doing does it cost an arm I'd
like<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:17.709> drive<00:03:17.980> these<00:03:18.310> cars<00:03:18.640> no<00:03:19.209> it<00:03:19.390> doesn't

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
like to drive these cars no it doesn't

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.229 
like to drive these cars no it doesn't
cost<00:03:19.930> an<00:03:20.200> arm<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.620> leg<00:03:20.650> but<00:03:21.340> certainly<00:03:21.910> it's

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
cost an arm and a leg but certainly it's

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.590 
cost an arm and a leg but certainly it's
not<00:03:22.360> as<00:03:22.810> cheap<00:03:23.200> as<00:03:23.440> picking<00:03:23.890> up

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
not as cheap as picking up

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:37.750 
not as cheap as picking up
going<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:25.930> play<00:03:26.140> a<00:03:26.170> game<00:03:26.410> of<00:03:26.620> tennis

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.819
