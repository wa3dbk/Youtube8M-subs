overall it's a held it pretty good in

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.240 
overall it's a held it pretty good in
here

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
here

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.380 
here
so<00:01:26.299> the<00:01:27.299> back<00:01:28.070> battery<00:01:29.070> compartment<00:01:29.610> power

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
so the back battery compartment power

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.870 
so the back battery compartment power
plug<00:01:30.750> uses<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> AC<00:01:31.799> brick<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.280> plugs<00:01:32.549> into<00:01:32.729> the

plug uses a AC brick that plugs into the
wall<00:01:33.140> which<00:01:34.140> keeps<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.650> size<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.189> radio

you're<00:01:38.820> close<00:01:39.030> with<00:01:39.060> headphones<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.900> little

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
you're close with headphones is a little

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.240 
you're close with headphones is a little
inconvenient<00:01:41.159> but<00:01:42.380> line<00:01:43.380> out<00:01:43.560> for<00:01:43.890> recording

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
inconvenient but line out for recording

inconvenient but line out for recording
radio<00:01:44.490> aux<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.390> like<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.780> say<00:01:45.990> they<00:01:46.380> hook<00:01:47.100> up<00:01:47.220> my

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
radio aux in like I say they hook up my

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.380 
radio aux in like I say they hook up my
TV<00:01:48.000> -<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:49.259> your<00:01:49.380> ham<00:01:49.970> antenna<00:01:50.970> there<00:01:51.180> it

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
TV - you have your ham antenna there it

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.889 
TV - you have your ham antenna there it
does<00:01:51.570> come<00:01:51.750> with<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.990> loop<00:01:52.259> am<00:01:52.979> antenna<00:01:53.840> which<00:01:54.840> I

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
does come with a loop am antenna which I

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.950 
does come with a loop am antenna which I
don't<00:01:55.049> have<00:01:55.200> hooked<00:01:55.409> up<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.710> here<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:56.960> looking

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
don't have hooked up in here but looking

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.490 
don't have hooked up in here but looking
for<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.170> later

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
for that later

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.850 
for that later
and<00:01:58.740> then<00:01:59.189> for<00:01:59.579> FM<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.090> uses<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.860> telescoping

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
and then for FM it uses a telescoping

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
and then for FM it uses a telescoping
antenna<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.530> attached<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:05.399> if<00:02:05.729> you're

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
antenna that is attached and if you're

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.280 
antenna that is attached and if you're
good<00:02:06.030> with<00:02:06.149> wiring<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.509> could<00:02:06.630> probably<00:02:06.750> pull

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
good with wiring you could probably pull

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.219 
good with wiring you could probably pull
this<00:02:07.409> off<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.649> hook<00:02:08.190> up<00:02:08.340> an<00:02:08.489> external<00:02:08.610> antenna

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
this off and hook up an external antenna

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.020 
this off and hook up an external antenna
it<00:02:10.229> would<00:02:10.319> be<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.500> hard<00:02:10.739> but<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.340> do<00:02:11.640> wish<00:02:11.849> it

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
it would be that hard but I do wish it

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.190 
it would be that hard but I do wish it
came<00:02:12.239> with<00:02:12.420> a

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
it hops around sometimes really wildly

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.030 
it hops around sometimes really wildly
like<00:03:54.370> I've<00:03:54.519> had<00:03:54.640> it<00:03:54.790> jumped<00:03:55.090> like<00:03:55.239> ten<00:03:56.040> clicks

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
like I've had it jumped like ten clicks

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.619 
like I've had it jumped like ten clicks
and<00:03:57.420> just<00:03:58.420> one<00:03:58.599> like<00:03:58.870> short<00:03:59.260> turn<00:04:00.510> you<00:04:01.510> know<00:04:01.599> I

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629 
and just one like short turn you know I

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.809 
and just one like short turn you know I
think<00:04:01.690> knobs<00:04:02.019> are<00:04:02.470> a<00:04:02.830> little<00:04:03.430> bit<00:04:03.670> better

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
think knobs are a little bit better

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:10.460 
think knobs are a little bit better
built<00:04:06.900> wheels<00:04:07.900> I<00:04:08.319> think<00:04:08.799> would<00:04:09.280> be<00:04:09.310> a<00:04:09.430> plus

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
built wheels I think would be a plus

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.369 
built wheels I think would be a plus
what<00:04:11.470> I<00:04:11.500> do<00:04:11.590> is<00:04:11.950> that<00:04:11.980> it<00:04:12.220> is<00:04:12.549> come<00:04:12.790> with<00:04:12.819> this

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
what I do is that it is come with this

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.800 
what I do is that it is come with this
remote<00:04:14.379> control<00:04:14.440> I<00:04:15.060> use<00:04:16.060> that<00:04:16.269> almost

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
remote control I use that almost

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.980 
remote control I use that almost
exclusively<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:18.820> control<00:04:19.180> it<00:04:19.329> and<00:04:21.780> as<00:04:22.780> funny

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
exclusively to control it and as funny

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.980 
exclusively to control it and as funny
as<00:04:23.139> I<00:04:23.380> have<00:04:23.500> a<00:04:23.530> standing<00:04:24.010> WR<00:04:24.580> to<00:04:24.820> radio<00:04:25.660> at<00:04:25.810> work

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
and it came with a remote control I

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.150 
and it came with a remote control I
never<00:04:28.690> use<00:04:28.930> it<00:04:29.080> because<00:04:29.199> it<00:04:29.470> is<00:04:29.590> such<00:04:29.979> great

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
never use it because it is such great

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.860 
never use it because it is such great
knobs<00:04:30.550> and<00:04:30.910> buttons<00:04:30.970> on<00:04:31.389> the<00:04:31.479> front<00:04:31.630> for

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.360 
this I think by default it does have a
base<00:05:14.410> year<00:05:15.389> tone<00:05:16.389> to<00:05:16.630> it<00:05:17.010> if<00:05:18.010> you<00:05:18.160> like<00:05:18.310> to
