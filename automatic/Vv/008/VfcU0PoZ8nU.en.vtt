problem that didn't really exist I mean

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.240 
problem that didn't really exist I mean
at<00:01:02.909> the<00:01:03.030> time<00:01:03.269> the<00:01:03.510> British<00:01:04.010> Army<00:01:05.010> thought

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
at the time the British Army thought

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.480 
at the time the British Army thought
that<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.760> 455<00:01:06.510> Webley<00:01:07.170> mark<00:01:07.440> 6<00:01:07.770> was<00:01:08.010> just<00:01:08.280> too

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
that the 455 Webley mark 6 was just too

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.190 
that the 455 Webley mark 6 was just too
much<00:01:08.640> gun<00:01:08.940> for<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.210> troops<00:01:09.480> to<00:01:09.570> handle<00:01:10.050> and

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
much gun for the troops to handle and

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.640 
much gun for the troops to handle and
that<00:01:10.230> a<00:01:11.130> 38<00:01:11.580> would<00:01:11.760> be<00:01:11.880> better<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:13.290> why<00:01:13.470> they

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
that a 38 would be better the why they

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.860 
that a 38 would be better the why they
settled<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.040> 38<00:01:14.430> Smith<00:01:14.670> &amp;<00:01:14.730> Wesson<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.510> honestly

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
couldn't say because it was already

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.250
