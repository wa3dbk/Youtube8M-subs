00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.640
 tells crowd beauty of senac in 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.010
 machinery today back teaching that 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.610
 how to decipher the men's code the new 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.679
 map is a very complicated code here but 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.839
 the diffusion on the internet and I found 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.690
 show here for you very simple 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.800
 so here's a code here on the wall 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.170
 are three lines 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.250
 We'll look after you later, we'll have it later. 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.240
 that honor a boards there with guy go 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.220
 so it's very simple people 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.109
 first make this table here later 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.969
 I'm going to leave this image for you 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.579
 can download and print to stay 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.350
 will and we will translate from 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.020
 This game of the old here is a game of 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.329
 each one has three letters and only in the 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.110
 The end has two fancy as well 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.789
 simple 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.260
 so the first line we'll go 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.239
 bring us here then look at the 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.219
 I draw the white line 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.829
 so the white line knows that the 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.660
 two sides and one down 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.770
 then we will observe here that gives the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.739
 same two sides and a bottom 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.390
 then this is the first letter and f 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.020
 We'll see a little black dot you have. 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.000
 more bodanski left eder if you have 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.260
 half is and if you're in the corner here 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.049
 right efe 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.140
 then here the first line is the 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.040
 letter to note that the letter of two 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.770
 scratchs 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.509
 the back underneath risk in red more 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.930
 close to the day 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.360
 Let's go to the next letter. 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.130
 Look how it's changed, look at the drawing. 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.079
 outline is the same around the opic 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.079
 r as it is more on the right side not 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.390
 is in the middle she will be r and the next 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.479
 from here we will see the same design 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.670
 drawing of y or lyz as she was 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.170
 left will be y 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.030
 then we see that the y beauty and already 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.070
 has been for 12 years the first three 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.689
 first letters that already gives a word and 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.020
 When you go up at night, you go. 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.719
 realize that you have a board that starts 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.119
 with Dra then bring the rest I already know 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.219
 It will be the drae something up there. 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.960
 this will be the first time in the radar 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.619
 second line is according to the 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.660
 honored 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.190
 so let's see here we'll bring it already 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.410
 I left the transition here but we're just going 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.810
 check the line 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.160
 to and the first frame here the same line 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.990
 huh 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.300
 the risk is in the middle this time she 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.280
 then it's b then the next one here 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.860
 complete square realizes that here in the 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.820
 center is a full square 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:33.450
 so it's the letter in the case here enya here 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.490
 here is the excuse here is the oil 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.800
 and then it 's a letter there, as it already exists in 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:44.280
 transition there for you the lyrics and here 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:48.060
 Look at the rich and skin skin the same 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.440
 And that letter there is a 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.850
 most boring part if you have to have 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.820
 a lot of patience 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.420
 so here's the boni has a sign there 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.860
 that starts with boni is also very easy 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:05.340
 and the next one is grosjean 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:08.550
