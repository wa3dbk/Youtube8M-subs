 close half time 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.710

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.149
 the c1 and then of this radio 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.149
 is equipped with a dual core processor 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.790

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.000
 at a frequency of 1.3 gigas very fast 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.000
 as well 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.830

 present if you want moreover 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.970
 know more about fast enough 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.320
 do not hesitate to watch the video of 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.330
 liquid to the three duos 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.160
 above you 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.550
 due to his quick discovers the camera 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.250
 5 megapixels we saw 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.350
 in flash led on 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.840
 back to low light 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.390
 and small improvements that have been 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.070
 also made in relation to lipids 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.620
 three duets 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.520
 produced in very good current 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.409
 completed by this one 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.000
 the device the world to the speaker 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.000
 front end meet again 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.270
 so 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.970
 for a clearer sound 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.470
 better steer towards or watching 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.960
 for example on a car 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.159
 a term from France 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.310
 weeds android 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.480
 four jeff bean points 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.930
 liquid z4 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.980
 little peculiarity it comes with 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.090
 the people in charge of our application 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.950
 now we are no longer presenting 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.120
 hardly the price of fashion that allows 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.060
 people who are not familiar 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.770
 of android who would 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.569
 scared by the technology that would have 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.000
 afraid of complex d 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.410
 read android 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.950
 simplified for them 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.950
 also and 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.610
 they were designed 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.140
 children or the oldest of them 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.990
 with specific features if 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.000
 I show you 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.430
 one and two modes for seniors the idea 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.010
 is that you buy this phone 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.900
 grandparents and parents you have the 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.109
 possibility of their loan define as well 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.130
 contact as well as to let them access 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:47.930
 to the radio 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.930
 weather at a magnifying glass at 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.290
 alarm etc and in contact they have the 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.280
 ability to make calls 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.010
 to send sms 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.870
 obviously like this program eight 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.520
 mandates j as the replacement of 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.520
 the interface it is impossible to in 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.140
 go out except 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.660
 with of course the use of a code 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.010
 pin and the idea is to make a 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.580
 very simple use if they ever 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.730
 are lost 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.630
 these users there 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.530
 simply press the button 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.580
 home home 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.670
 find themselves on their home page 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.620
 so be fun when they in 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.930
 came out obviously it's not definitive 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.670
 we can return 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.880
 pandraud is complete once one is 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.390
 centered especially 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.190
 I had a little more mature than he 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.230
 it's no problem 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.920
 acer liquid from z4 duo will be available 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.140
 second week 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.140
