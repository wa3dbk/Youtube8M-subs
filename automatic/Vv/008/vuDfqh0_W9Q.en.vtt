00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.040 
belted radial tire let's take a closer
look<00:00:16.560> at<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:17.000> there<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.119> says<00:00:18.300> steel<00:00:18.570> belted

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
look at this there it says steel belted

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.939 
look at this there it says steel belted
and<00:00:19.320> it's<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.160> CE<00:00:20.400> entra<00:00:20.820> plus<00:00:21.740> whatever<00:00:22.740> the

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.720 

dug<00:00:33.420> out<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.750> area<00:00:34.079> here<00:00:34.440> I'm<00:00:35.070> gonna<00:00:35.280> rest<00:00:35.550> it

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
dug out this area here I'm gonna rest it

dug out this area here I'm gonna rest it
on<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.969> tree<00:00:37.250> then<00:00:38.250> fill<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.809> it

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
on the tree then fill this in so it

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.440 
on the tree then fill this in so it
gives<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.410> sturdiness<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.190> needs

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
coming out from the radial tires I went

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.210 
coming out from the radial tires I went
ahead<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.050> cut<00:01:46.170> open<00:01:46.410> this<00:01:46.470> day<00:01:46.680> we<00:01:46.890> retrieved

all the fragments and there are the
hollow<00:01:49.110> points<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:50.580> ball<00:01:50.820> ammo<00:01:51.090> just<00:01:51.300> smashes

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
hollow points the ball ammo just smashes

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.320 
hollow points the ball ammo just smashes
when<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.320> hits<00:01:52.470> metal<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.149> and<00:01:54.149> that's

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
when it hits metal and and that's

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.359 
when it hits metal and and that's
basically<00:01:54.690> what<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.050> get<00:01:55.200> right<00:01:55.410> there<00:01:55.470> it

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.920 
doesn't matter what the caliber is it
just<00:01:58.140> smashes<00:01:58.410> and<00:01:58.740> pancakes<00:01:59.509> but<00:02:00.509> there<00:02:00.810> are

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
just smashes and pancakes but there are

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.230 
just smashes and pancakes but there are
your<00:02:01.050> hollow<00:02:01.200> points<00:02:01.820> so<00:02:02.820> there<00:02:02.970> you<00:02:03.060> have<00:02:03.119> it

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240
