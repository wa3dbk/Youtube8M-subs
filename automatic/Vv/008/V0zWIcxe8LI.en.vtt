00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
capital letters and we'll start using

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.799 
capital letters and we'll start using
that<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.590> our<00:00:34.680> script<00:00:35.100> now<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.239> our<00:00:36.360> scripts

JavaScript and call this one shoot okay

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.959 
JavaScript and call this one shoot okay
we'll<00:00:45.570> use<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.870> one<00:00:46.079> for<00:00:46.260> shooting<00:00:46.640> now<00:00:47.640> open

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
we'll use this one for shooting now open

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.450 
we'll use this one for shooting now open
it<00:00:48.059> up<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:49.289> update<00:00:49.620> function<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.190> already

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
it up and the update function is already

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.660 
it up and the update function is already
there<00:00:51.379> but<00:00:52.379> before<00:00:52.530> we<00:00:52.890> start<00:00:52.949> messing<00:00:53.550> around

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
there but before we start messing around

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.060 
there but before we start messing around
in<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.180> update<00:00:54.510> function<00:00:54.719> let's<00:00:55.500> first<00:00:55.860> add

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
in the update function let's first add

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.610 
in the update function let's first add
some<00:00:56.489> variables<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.629> first<00:00:57.930> variable<00:00:58.320> that

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
some variables the first variable that

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.760 
some variables the first variable that
we<00:00:58.800> need<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.219> called<00:00:59.730> speed<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.559> let's<00:01:01.559> set

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
we need is called speed and let's set

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.810 
we need is called speed and let's set
this<00:01:01.920> variable<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> float<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.890> 3.0<00:01:04.890> now

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
this variable to a float of 3.0 now

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.330 
this variable to a float of 3.0 now
remember<00:01:06.060> an<00:01:06.390> integer<00:01:07.170> variable<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.070> whole

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
remember an integer variable is a whole

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.969 
remember an integer variable is a whole
number<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.909> float<00:01:09.180> has<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.540> dot<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.799> has

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
number of float has a dot so it has

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.000 
number of float has a dot so it has
decimals<00:01:11.549> now<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.390> do<00:01:12.750> note<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.049> speed<00:01:13.770> is

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
decimals now you do note that speed is

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.469 
decimals now you do note that speed is
turning<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.460> different<00:01:14.820> color<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.330> it's

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
turning a different color so it's

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.300 
turning a different color so it's
probably<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.960> predefined<00:01:16.380> word<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.189> this

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
probably a predefined word but in this

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.060 
probably a predefined word but in this
case<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:17.820> not<00:01:17.939> going<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.420> bug<00:01:18.990> as<00:01:19.140> much<00:01:19.380> so

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
case it's not going to bug as much so

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.640 
case it's not going to bug as much so
it's<00:01:20.250> fine<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.960> we<00:01:21.960> need<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.229> second

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
it's fine like this we need in second

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.969 
it's fine like this we need in second
variable<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.430> variable<00:01:23.909> will<00:01:24.150> call

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
variable and this variable will call

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.080 
variable and this variable will call
create<00:01:26.509> prefab<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:28.400> let's<00:01:29.400> make<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.970> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
create prefab and let's make this of the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.910 
create prefab and let's make this of the
type<00:01:30.360> transform<00:01:31.280> as<00:01:33.020> you<00:01:34.020> can<00:01:34.140> see<00:01:34.409> i'm<00:01:34.650> not

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
type transform as you can see i'm not

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.140 
type transform as you can see i'm not
using<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:36.030> equals<00:01:36.960> sign<00:01:37.799> here<00:01:38.250> i'm<00:01:38.610> just<00:01:38.670> using

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
using a equals sign here i'm just using

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.359 
using a equals sign here i'm just using
a<00:01:39.360> column<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:39.960> then<00:01:40.079> transform<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.979> make<00:01:41.159> sure

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
a column and then transform to make sure

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.310 
a column and then transform to make sure
that<00:01:41.670> unity<00:01:42.390> knows<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.170> a

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
that unity knows that this is a

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.520 
that unity knows that this is a
transform<00:01:43.979> variable<00:01:44.299> so<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.960> way<00:01:46.020> it

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
transform variable so in that way it

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.399 
transform variable so in that way it
will<00:01:47.040> point<00:01:47.340> back<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.790> game<00:01:48.090> object<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:49.290> is

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
will point back to a game object that is

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.950 
will point back to a game object that is
all<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:49.860> need<00:01:50.040> from<00:01:50.189> here<00:01:50.750> now<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.869> the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
all that we need from here now in the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.990 
all that we need from here now in the
update<00:01:52.290> function<00:01:52.500> we<00:01:53.189> can<00:01:53.220> start<00:01:53.579> writing<00:01:53.820> our

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
update function we can start writing our

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.170 
update function we can start writing our
code<00:01:54.350> now<00:01:55.350> first<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.890> course<00:01:56.130> what<00:01:56.729> we<00:01:56.850> need<00:01:57.030> to

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
code now first of course what we need to

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.109 
code now first of course what we need to
do<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:58.070> find<00:01:59.070> out<00:01:59.310> if<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.990> fire<00:02:01.829> button<00:02:02.670> is

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
do is find out if a fire button is

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.990 
do is find out if a fire button is
pressed<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:04.680> course<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.490> don't<00:02:05.610> want<00:02:05.850> the

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
pressed of course you don't want the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.940 
pressed of course you don't want the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.400 
script to start throwing crates around
at<00:02:08.250> will<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:09.030> only<00:02:09.179> want<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.539> crate<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.140> be

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
at will you only want the crate to be

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.840 
at will you only want the crate to be
thrown<00:02:10.950> when<00:02:11.550> there's<00:02:11.790> actually<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.270> butt

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
thrown when there's actually a butt

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.510 
thrown when there's actually a butt
pressed<00:02:13.180> so<00:02:13.780> in<00:02:13.900> this<00:02:14.050> case<00:02:14.350> we'll<00:02:14.950> type<00:02:15.220> if

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
pressed so in this case we'll type if

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:23.160 
pressed so in this case we'll type if
input<00:02:16.890> dot<00:02:18.330> get<00:02:19.330> button<00:02:20.260> down<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.990> then<00:02:22.990> this

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
input dot get button down and then this

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.040 
input dot get button down and then this
will<00:02:23.320> be<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.830> string<00:02:24.490> fire<00:02:24.850> one<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:28.540> everything

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
will be a string fire one and everything

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.320 
will be a string fire one and everything
inside<00:02:29.350> this<00:02:29.680> code<00:02:29.950> is<00:02:30.100> true<00:02:30.460> now<00:02:31.120> make<00:02:31.300> sure

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
inside this code is true now make sure

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.540 
inside this code is true now make sure
you<00:02:31.480> copy<00:02:31.840> everything<00:02:32.230> exactly<00:02:32.860> input<00:02:33.370> with<00:02:33.520> a

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
you copy everything exactly input with a

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.210 
you copy everything exactly input with a
capital<00:02:33.820> i<00:02:34.290> transformed<00:02:35.290> with<00:02:35.380> a<00:02:35.470> capital<00:02:35.680> t

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
capital i transformed with a capital t

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.330 
capital i transformed with a capital t
get<00:02:37.120> button<00:02:37.540> down<00:02:37.780> with<00:02:38.050> capitals<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:38.860> then

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
get button down with capitals and then

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.750 
get button down with capitals and then
fire<00:02:39.700> one<00:02:40.410> okay<00:02:41.410> now<00:02:41.950> it's<00:02:42.160> time<00:02:42.250> for<00:02:42.640> us<00:02:42.730> to

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
fire one okay now it's time for us to

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.810 
fire one okay now it's time for us to
create<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:44.100> prefab<00:02:45.100> in<00:02:45.310> 3d<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:47.550> we<00:02:48.550> do<00:02:48.700> this

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
create the prefab in 3d and we do this

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.420 
create the prefab in 3d and we do this
using<00:02:49.150> script<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:49.900> after<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.620> we<00:02:51.100> need<00:02:51.280> to

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
using script and after that we need to

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.700 
using script and after that we need to
add<00:02:51.720> force<00:02:52.740> to<00:02:53.740> the<00:02:54.180> prefab<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.450> this<00:02:55.990> way<00:02:56.200> the

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
add force to the prefab and this way the

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.480 
add force to the prefab and this way the
crate<00:02:57.100> will<00:02:57.430> move<00:02:58.150> around<00:02:58.420> in<00:02:58.690> 3d<00:02:59.050> space<00:02:59.490> now

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
crate will move around in 3d space now

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.530 
crate will move around in 3d space now
to<00:03:01.060> make<00:03:01.240> a<00:03:01.270> new<00:03:01.770> prefab<00:03:02.770> in<00:03:03.100> 3d<00:03:03.730> space<00:03:03.880> we<00:03:04.330> will

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
to make a new prefab in 3d space we will

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.660 
to make a new prefab in 3d space we will
make<00:03:04.720> a<00:03:04.930> new<00:03:05.260> variable<00:03:05.710> and<00:03:05.920> call<00:03:06.130> it<00:03:06.310> VAR

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
make a new variable and call it VAR

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.290 
make a new variable and call it VAR
crate<00:03:07.270> and<00:03:07.890> this<00:03:08.890> crate<00:03:09.220> we<00:03:09.970> need<00:03:10.150> to

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
crate and this crate we need to

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.080 
crate and this crate we need to
instantiate<00:03:10.720> so<00:03:11.530> type<00:03:11.830> in<00:03:12.340> 10<00:03:13.300> t<00:03:13.870> 8<00:03:14.050> and<00:03:14.970> if<00:03:15.970> you

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
instantiate so type in 10 t 8 and if you

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.340 
instantiate so type in 10 t 8 and if you
type<00:03:16.270> it<00:03:16.420> correctly<00:03:16.450> it<00:03:16.990> will<00:03:17.080> turn<00:03:17.320> a

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
type it correctly it will turn a

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.370 
type it correctly it will turn a
different<00:03:17.560> color<00:03:17.770> and<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:19.600> instantiate

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
different color and the instantiate

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.770 
different color and the instantiate
function<00:03:21.010> which<00:03:21.430> is<00:03:21.460> predefined<00:03:21.940> by<00:03:22.390> unity

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
function which is predefined by unity

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.600 
function which is predefined by unity
takes<00:03:23.260> three<00:03:23.530> variables<00:03:24.070> one<00:03:24.370> two<00:03:24.880> and<00:03:25.120> three

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
takes three variables one two and three

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.250 
takes three variables one two and three
you<00:03:27.610> have<00:03:27.700> to<00:03:27.850> divide<00:03:28.150> these<00:03:28.330> by<00:03:28.540> commas<00:03:29.020> so

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
you have to divide these by commas so

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.420 
you have to divide these by commas so
that<00:03:29.410> the<00:03:29.560> script<00:03:29.860> knows<00:03:30.070> that<00:03:30.310> you're

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
that the script knows that you're

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.660 
that the script knows that you're
sending<00:03:30.670> three<00:03:31.030> variables<00:03:31.570> to<00:03:31.750> this<00:03:31.870> function

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
sending three variables to this function

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.790 
sending three variables to this function
okay<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:33.790> first<00:03:33.970> is<00:03:34.270> what<00:03:34.600> prefab<00:03:35.200> are<00:03:35.470> we

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
okay the first is what prefab are we

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.480 
okay the first is what prefab are we
going<00:03:35.980> to<00:03:36.250> make<00:03:36.430> so<00:03:37.060> that<00:03:37.240> is<00:03:37.360> our<00:03:37.540> create

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
going to make so that is our create

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.030 
going to make so that is our create
prefab<00:03:39.490> as<00:03:39.760> we<00:03:40.720> have<00:03:40.900> defined<00:03:41.350> this<00:03:41.530> variable

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
prefab as we have defined this variable

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.570 
prefab as we have defined this variable
here<00:03:42.370> and<00:03:42.900> we<00:03:43.900> simply<00:03:44.320> sent<00:03:44.620> that<00:03:44.830> function<00:03:45.430> in

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
here and we simply sent that function in

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.780 
here and we simply sent that function in
here<00:03:46.230> next<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.860> variable<00:03:48.340> that<00:03:48.490> the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
here next the variable that the

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.790 
here next the variable that the
instantiate<00:03:49.690> function<00:03:50.260> needs<00:03:50.530> is<00:03:50.740> the

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
instantiate function needs is the

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.130 
instantiate function needs is the
position<00:03:51.790> of<00:03:51.940> where<00:03:52.180> in<00:03:52.360> the<00:03:52.450> world<00:03:52.660> we<00:03:52.930> will

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
position of where in the world we will

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.650 
position of where in the world we will
create<00:03:53.350> it<00:03:53.650> now<00:03:54.190> we<00:03:54.730> are<00:03:54.910> going<00:03:54.940> to<00:03:55.330> attach

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
create it now we are going to attach

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.470 
create it now we are going to attach
this<00:03:55.990> one<00:03:56.260> to<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:56.590> main<00:03:56.800> camera<00:03:57.160> so<00:03:57.910> we're

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
this one to the main camera so we're

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.190 
this one to the main camera so we're
just<00:03:58.510> need<00:03:58.960> to<00:03:59.110> type<00:03:59.320> transform<00:04:00.270> dot<00:04:01.270> position

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
just need to type transform dot position

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.680 
just need to type transform dot position
and<00:04:02.410> this<00:04:03.010> will<00:04:03.220> sent<00:04:03.550> the<00:04:03.760> position<00:04:04.360> of<00:04:04.510> our

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
and this will sent the position of our

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.110 
and this will sent the position of our
main<00:04:04.900> camera<00:04:05.200> and<00:04:05.520> then<00:04:06.520> last<00:04:06.760> but<00:04:06.880> not<00:04:07.060> least

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
main camera and then last but not least

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.680 
main camera and then last but not least
the<00:04:07.480> third<00:04:07.510> variable<00:04:08.140> is<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:09.160> rotation<00:04:09.880> so

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
the third variable is the rotation so

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.620 
the third variable is the rotation so
and<00:04:11.200> this<00:04:11.230> is<00:04:11.980> done<00:04:12.250> in<00:04:12.280> unity<00:04:12.910> using

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
and this is done in unity using

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.020 
and this is done in unity using
quaternions<00:04:14.320> now<00:04:15.160> i'll<00:04:15.310> explain<00:04:15.610> this<00:04:15.820> later

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
quaternions now i'll explain this later

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.610 
quaternions now i'll explain this later
so<00:04:16.420> for<00:04:16.960> now<00:04:17.080> just<00:04:17.140> type<00:04:17.910> quaternion<00:04:19.620> dot

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
so for now just type quaternion dot

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.340 
so for now just type quaternion dot
identity

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
identity

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.860 
identity
which<00:04:23.130> is<00:04:23.280> basically<00:04:23.670> the<00:04:24.000> rotation<00:04:24.510> of<00:04:24.690> our

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
which is basically the rotation of our

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.960 
which is basically the rotation of our
current<00:04:25.200> camera<00:04:25.440> so<00:04:26.010> that<00:04:26.040> it<00:04:26.220> shoots<00:04:26.490> in<00:04:26.640> 3d

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
current camera so that it shoots in 3d

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.260 
current camera so that it shoots in 3d
space<00:04:27.620> okay<00:04:28.620> so<00:04:28.680> this<00:04:28.920> will<00:04:29.100> create<00:04:29.220> a<00:04:29.370> crate

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
space okay so this will create a crate

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.450 
space okay so this will create a crate
now<00:04:30.960> we<00:04:31.020> need<00:04:31.260> to<00:04:31.290> add<00:04:31.470> some<00:04:31.500> force<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.310> our

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
now we need to add some force to our

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.270 
now we need to add some force to our
crate<00:04:32.780> so<00:04:33.780> I<00:04:34.110> crate<00:04:34.620> has<00:04:34.830> a<00:04:34.860> rigid<00:04:35.250> body

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
crate so I crate has a rigid body

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.370 
crate so I crate has a rigid body
attached<00:04:35.820> to<00:04:36.060> it<00:04:36.150> in<00:04:36.300> our<00:04:36.420> prefab<00:04:36.900> so<00:04:37.110> we<00:04:37.230> can

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
attached to it in our prefab so we can

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.500 
attached to it in our prefab so we can
use<00:04:37.590> the<00:04:37.770> rigid<00:04:38.040> body<00:04:38.070> functions<00:04:38.790> type<00:04:39.120> create

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
use the rigid body functions type create

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.530 
use the rigid body functions type create
dot<00:04:40.140> rigid<00:04:40.680> body<00:04:41.540> dot<00:04:42.540> add<00:04:42.780> force<00:04:43.620> and<00:04:44.540> then

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
dot rigid body dot add force and then

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.440 
dot rigid body dot add force and then
the<00:04:45.660> force<00:04:45.930> will<00:04:46.170> come<00:04:46.350> from<00:04:46.470> a<00:04:46.620> transform<00:04:47.450> dot

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
the force will come from a transform dot

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.260 
the force will come from a transform dot
forward<00:04:49.020> which<00:04:49.830> is<00:04:49.980> basically<00:04:50.310> shorthand<00:04:51.030> of

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
forward which is basically shorthand of

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.410 
forward which is basically shorthand of
where<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:52.530> camera<00:04:53.010> is<00:04:53.040> looking<00:04:53.250> towards<00:04:53.820> so

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
where the camera is looking towards so

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.120 
where the camera is looking towards so
basically<00:04:54.870> is<00:04:55.020> local<00:04:55.530> Z<00:04:55.890> its<00:04:56.190> depth<00:04:57.500> x<00:04:58.500> a<00:04:58.740> speed

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
basically is local Z its depth x a speed

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.430 
basically is local Z its depth x a speed
of<00:04:59.160> 2,000<00:05:01.130> alright<00:05:02.130> let's<00:05:02.370> save<00:05:02.610> this<00:05:03.440> let's

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
of 2,000 alright let's save this let's

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.030 
of 2,000 alright let's save this let's
close<00:05:04.830> our<00:05:05.010> script<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:06.350> then<00:05:07.350> attach<00:05:07.830> our

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
close our script and then attach our

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.270 
close our script and then attach our
script<00:05:08.340> to<00:05:08.460> our<00:05:08.610> main<00:05:08.820> camera<00:05:09.800> now<00:05:10.800> in<00:05:11.070> our

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
script to our main camera now in our

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.070 
script to our main camera now in our
main<00:05:11.490> camera<00:05:11.730> you<00:05:12.000> can<00:05:12.030> see<00:05:12.360> that<00:05:12.540> speed<00:05:12.930> is

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
main camera you can see that speed is

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.990 
main camera you can see that speed is
defined<00:05:13.440> as<00:05:13.590> a<00:05:13.620> variable<00:05:14.010> and<00:05:14.370> our<00:05:14.700> create

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
defined as a variable and our create

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.150 
defined as a variable and our create
prefab<00:05:15.480> is<00:05:15.630> defined<00:05:15.960> as<00:05:16.110> a<00:05:16.140> variable<00:05:16.530> but<00:05:17.100> I

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
prefab is defined as a variable but I

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.490 
prefab is defined as a variable but I
create<00:05:17.520> prefab<00:05:18.060> right<00:05:18.300> now<00:05:18.480> is<00:05:18.750> empty<00:05:19.230> it's<00:05:19.380> an

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
create prefab right now is empty it's an

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.090 
create prefab right now is empty it's an
empty<00:05:19.710> transform<00:05:20.490> variable<00:05:20.810> now<00:05:21.810> simply<00:05:22.560> to

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
empty transform variable now simply to

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.340 
empty transform variable now simply to
solve<00:05:23.460> that<00:05:23.700> we<00:05:23.940> just<00:05:24.150> go<00:05:24.300> to<00:05:24.360> prefab<00:05:24.990> and<00:05:25.230> and

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
solve that we just go to prefab and and

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.930 
solve that we just go to prefab and and
drag<00:05:25.620> our<00:05:25.800> create<00:05:26.130> right<00:05:26.340> on<00:05:26.460> top<00:05:26.670> of<00:05:26.850> this

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
drag our create right on top of this

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.200 
drag our create right on top of this
variable<00:05:27.270> and<00:05:27.600> now<00:05:27.810> it's<00:05:27.960> it<00:05:28.670> of<00:05:29.670> course<00:05:30.060> we

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
variable and now it's it of course we

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.210 
variable and now it's it of course we
could<00:05:30.330> do<00:05:30.420> that<00:05:30.540> in<00:05:30.630> script<00:05:30.930> also<00:05:31.110> but<00:05:31.620> why<00:05:32.040> not

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
could do that in script also but why not

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.710 
could do that in script also but why not
use<00:05:32.370> the<00:05:32.550> power<00:05:32.760> of<00:05:32.880> the<00:05:33.030> editor<00:05:33.360> to<00:05:33.540> make

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
use the power of the editor to make

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.380 
use the power of the editor to make
things<00:05:33.990> happen<00:05:34.170> pretty<00:05:34.680> quickly<00:05:35.150> now<00:05:36.150> when<00:05:36.360> I

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
things happen pretty quickly now when I

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.590 
things happen pretty quickly now when I
run<00:05:36.450> our<00:05:36.750> game<00:05:36.960> and<00:05:37.170> I<00:05:38.010> use<00:05:38.250> the<00:05:38.280> left<00:05:39.090> control

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
run our game and I use the left control

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.450 
run our game and I use the left control
which<00:05:39.810> is<00:05:39.930> our<00:05:40.080> fire<00:05:40.320> button<00:05:40.620> you<00:05:40.860> can<00:05:40.980> see<00:05:41.220> I'm

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
which is our fire button you can see I'm

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.060 
which is our fire button you can see I'm
actually<00:05:41.880> shooting<00:05:42.420> out<00:05:42.630> crates<00:05:43.350> into<00:05:43.860> the

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
actually shooting out crates into the

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.790 
actually shooting out crates into the
world<00:05:44.250> that's<00:05:45.120> pretty<00:05:45.300> cool<00:05:45.420> huh<00:05:45.600> now<00:05:46.530> if<00:05:46.680> you

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
world that's pretty cool huh now if you

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.050 
world that's pretty cool huh now if you
want<00:05:47.010> of<00:05:47.100> course<00:05:47.250> you<00:05:47.430> can<00:05:47.550> add<00:05:47.700> some<00:05:47.910> more

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
want of course you can add some more

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.000 
want of course you can add some more
floor<00:05:48.360> to<00:05:48.570> something<00:05:48.900> to<00:05:49.020> make<00:05:49.230> sure<00:05:49.830> that

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
floor to something to make sure that

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.810 
floor to something to make sure that
things<00:05:50.250> bounce<00:05:50.520> off<00:05:50.760> of<00:05:50.790> each<00:05:51.030> other<00:05:52.820> but

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
things bounce off of each other but

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.630 
things bounce off of each other but
that's<00:05:54.000> pretty<00:05:54.150> cool<00:05:54.360> so<00:05:54.600> far
