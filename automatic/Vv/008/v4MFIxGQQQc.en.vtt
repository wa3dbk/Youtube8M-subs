00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.649
 Hello everyone in this video, I will show you how 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:13.679
 scald the flange in theory to take two 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:17.490
 or three videos this video on the theory here 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:21.990
 of my past video remained flange by 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.269
 tack how to boil it a group 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.760
 there is not one way yet dependent on 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.529
 electrodes which in this case 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.300
 electrode to 46 with rutile coating 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.230
 Cook I say when in one pass 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.170
 when for 2 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.550
 better for 2 will be prettier because 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:45.780
 here you see how the gap turns out 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:51.590
 better in two passes and merced begin 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:54.490
 Now I will show how to cook begin with the roots 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.440
 closer 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.470
 root as if we cook especially no 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.420
 oscillatory movements do not do 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:06.059
 we light the center as though not with 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.059
 a little run forward go like this 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:13.090
 and gradually you brew why 

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:14.109
 run forward so that the flag leaks 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.149
 blew 

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:18.909
 when we period choose this we 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:21.219
 get rid of him and so on one more 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.929
 way from such a put electrode he himself 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:26.500
 by itself it burns we just do such 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:30.130
 movements are small and antonese and 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.130
 gradually burns out saying planets what 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:37.329
 As for roots, you can also overlap 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.869
 two ways you can go just like that 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.869
 here is a wave 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.990
 above it is visible and drawn 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.229
 and such small oscillatory movements 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.170
 metal how would he go to bed 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:58.329
 there will be a smooth beautiful second way 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:00.909
 it is possible vymerochka usually with too when well 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:07.810
 such a root turned out to be rude big 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:09.519
 eight convenient overlap there it is 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.760
 it was so eight drawn and so 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.680
 it turns out so on but they say 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.049
 a little swimming even movement will be 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.239
 whether such gypsum was smeared on 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.600
 which let's not talk to us for a long time 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.459
 us 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.680
 convenient bottom position all if you cook 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:34.569
 like this you can vertically in one pass 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.880
 you can also just do the main 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.700
 saturnus margin naturally because 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.120
 electrodes can be without separation asura body 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.930
 covering the ears of the satra he will be more beautiful 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.549
 you can also this same eight-river 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.739
 Basically the same but better 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.030
 flange personal position beautiful 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.970
 faster 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.880
 on the other hand, too, on both sides 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.209
 it is desirable to boil down at all just lari 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.200
 also position sit on a vein to tonic 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:08.810
 to leave because it is already a mirror 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.340
 we put an electrode there we roll and provar and 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:16.690
 no oscillatory movements are possible 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:19.090
 do kill and that's it 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.100
 this as for the theory of the next video 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.370
 I 'll show you how it will look like. 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.370
 practice
