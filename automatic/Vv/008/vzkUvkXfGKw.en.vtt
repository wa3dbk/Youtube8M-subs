from<00:00:25.260> Advanced<00:00:25.710> Micro<00:00:25.800> Devices<00:00:30.679> now<00:00:31.679> one<00:00:31.890> of

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
from Advanced Micro Devices now one of

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.130 
from Advanced Micro Devices now one of
the<00:00:32.070> most<00:00:32.219> important<00:00:32.880> things<00:00:33.059> from<00:00:33.390> AMD<00:00:33.690> side

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
the most important things from AMD side

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.560 
the most important things from AMD side
is<00:00:34.940> compatibility<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.780> AMD<00:00:37.260> has<00:00:37.550> implemented

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
is compatibility so AMD has implemented

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.209 
is compatibility so AMD has implemented
complete<00:00:39.570> backwards<00:00:40.260> compatibility<00:00:40.829> for

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
complete backwards compatibility for

generation<00:02:01.560> we're<00:02:02.399> seeing<00:02:02.610> about<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.820> 10%

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
generation we're seeing about a 10%

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.230 
generation we're seeing about a 10%
improvement<00:02:03.600> in<00:02:04.140> overall<00:02:04.710> all<00:02:05.369> round<00:02:05.820> system

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
improvement in overall all round system

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.670 
improvement in overall all round system
performance<00:02:06.750> bearing<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.259> mind<00:02:07.290> though<00:02:07.649> that

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
performance bearing in mind though that

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.830 
performance bearing in mind though that
this<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.160> 6<00:02:08.459> core<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.940> these<00:02:09.390> two<00:02:09.599> are<00:02:09.690> both

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
this is a 6 core and these two are both

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.229 
this is a 6 core and these two are both
8<00:02:10.080> cores<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.979> this<00:02:11.220> improvement<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.940> almost

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
8 cores so this improvement is almost

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.660 
8 cores so this improvement is almost
less<00:02:12.420> impressive<00:02:12.900> than

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
less impressive than

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.370 
less impressive than
this<00:02:13.760> improvement<00:02:14.180> because<00:02:14.630> here<00:02:15.020> we're

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
this improvement because here we're

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.080 
this improvement because here we're
seeing<00:02:15.560> more<00:02:15.860> like<00:02:16.040> pure<00:02:16.280> clock<00:02:16.550> speed<00:02:16.849> and

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
seeing more like pure clock speed and

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.170 
seeing more like pure clock speed and
the<00:02:17.319> performance<00:02:18.319> of<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.500> chip<00:02:19.180> accounting

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
the performance of the chip accounting

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.660 
the performance of the chip accounting
for<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.780> performance<00:02:21.260> Delta<00:02:21.620> next<00:02:22.489> we've<00:02:22.640> got

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
for the performance Delta next we've got

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.059 
for the performance Delta next we've got
Sony<00:02:23.120> Vegas<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:23.750> when<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:23.989> comes<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.590> rendering

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
Sony Vegas so when it comes to rendering

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.640 
Sony Vegas so when it comes to rendering
video<00:02:25.630> you<00:02:26.630> throw<00:02:26.870> more<00:02:27.050> cores<00:02:27.349> out<00:02:27.530> the

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
video you throw more cores out the

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.620 
video you throw more cores out the
problem<00:02:28.130> in<00:02:28.280> this<00:02:28.700> case<00:02:28.910> we<00:02:29.090> didn't<00:02:29.300> seem<00:02:29.450> as

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
problem in this case we didn't seem as

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.940 
problem in this case we didn't seem as
much<00:02:29.660> of<00:02:29.930> an<00:02:30.020> improvement<00:02:30.290> as<00:02:30.560> we<00:02:30.709> would<00:02:30.860> have

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
much of an improvement as we would have

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.370 
much of an improvement as we would have
liked<00:02:31.190> but<00:02:31.430> remember<00:02:31.850> guys<00:02:31.970> bulldozer<00:02:32.900> cores

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
liked but remember guys bulldozer cores

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.010 
liked but remember guys bulldozer cores
were<00:02:33.680> not<00:02:33.860> full<00:02:34.340> cores<00:02:34.790> in<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.150> same<00:02:35.690> way<00:02:35.840> that

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
were not full cores in the same way that

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.650 
were not full cores in the same way that
tubing<00:02:36.470> cores<00:02:36.739> weren't<00:02:37.100> okay<00:02:37.700> so<00:02:38.270> this

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
tubing cores weren't okay so this

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.540 
tubing cores weren't okay so this
improvement<00:02:39.140> is<00:02:39.440> again<00:02:40.100> much<00:02:40.519> more

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
improvement is again much more

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.759 
improvement is again much more
impressive<00:02:41.269> because<00:02:41.390> we<00:02:41.750> threw<00:02:42.050> more<00:02:42.440> cores

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
impressive because we threw more cores

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.559 
impressive because we threw more cores
at<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.040> problem<00:02:43.459> and<00:02:43.580> didn't<00:02:44.120> see<00:02:44.209> much<00:02:44.330> of<00:02:44.480> an

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
at the problem and didn't see much of an

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.000 
at the problem and didn't see much of an
improvement<00:02:44.870> last<00:02:45.200> time<00:02:45.440> around<00:02:45.560> but<00:02:45.860> with

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
improvement last time around but with

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.970 
improvement last time around but with
the<00:02:46.130> 8350<00:02:47.060> we<00:02:47.510> are<00:02:47.630> seeing<00:02:47.930> as<00:02:48.170> much<00:02:48.560> as<00:02:48.800> about

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
the 8350 we are seeing as much as about

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.740 
the 8350 we are seeing as much as about
a<00:02:49.040> 15<00:02:49.519> to<00:02:49.700> 20<00:02:50.030> percent<00:02:50.180> performance

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
a 15 to 20 percent performance

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.930 
a 15 to 20 percent performance
difference<00:02:51.350> versus<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.190> last<00:02:52.370> generation

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
difference versus the last generation

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.690 
difference versus the last generation
chip<00:02:53.209> now<00:02:53.690> moving<00:02:54.049> on<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.350> Cinebench<00:02:54.890> OpenGL

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
chip now moving on to Cinebench OpenGL

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.270 
chip now moving on to Cinebench OpenGL
so<00:02:55.970> this<00:02:56.180> is<00:02:56.390> leveraging<00:02:57.049> the<00:02:57.440> graphics<00:02:58.010> card

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
so this is leveraging the graphics card

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.460 
so this is leveraging the graphics card
to<00:02:58.580> achieve<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.150> 3d<00:02:59.450> rendering<00:02:59.600> process

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
to achieve the 3d rendering process

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.170 
to achieve the 3d rendering process
that's<00:03:00.890> going<00:03:01.250> on<00:03:01.370> here<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.760> we're<00:03:01.880> seeing<00:03:02.090> a

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
that's going on here and we're seeing a

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.750 
that's going on here and we're seeing a
significant<00:03:02.870> tangible<00:03:03.620> improvement<00:03:04.130> from<00:03:04.370> 81

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
significant tangible improvement from 81

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.920 
significant tangible improvement from 81
50<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.209> 80<00:03:05.360> 350<00:03:06.019> once<00:03:06.650> again<00:03:07.100> over<00:03:07.610> 10%<00:03:08.299> whereas

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
50 to 80 350 once again over 10% whereas

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.600 
50 to 80 350 once again over 10% whereas
last<00:03:09.290> generation<00:03:09.980> we<00:03:10.100> really<00:03:10.400> didn't<00:03:10.580> see

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
last generation we really didn't see

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.600 
last generation we really didn't see
that<00:03:10.790> improvement<00:03:11.330> so<00:03:11.890> without<00:03:12.890> oh<00:03:13.100> yes<00:03:13.340> okay

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
that improvement so without oh yes okay

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.910 
that improvement so without oh yes okay
so<00:03:13.670> let's<00:03:13.970> finish<00:03:14.090> up<00:03:14.299> without<00:03:14.660> CPU<00:03:15.200> again<00:03:15.650> we

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
so let's finish up without CPU again we

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.530 
so let's finish up without CPU again we
see<00:03:16.100> going<00:03:16.310> from<00:03:16.489> six<00:03:16.730> cores<00:03:17.000> to<00:03:17.150> eight<00:03:17.269> cores

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
see going from six cores to eight cores

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.270 
see going from six cores to eight cores
really<00:03:18.230> didn't<00:03:18.500> yield<00:03:18.650> much<00:03:18.859> last<00:03:19.130> time

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
really didn't yield much last time

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.430 
really didn't yield much last time
around<00:03:19.640> whereas<00:03:19.910> now<00:03:20.150> we're<00:03:20.660> seeing<00:03:20.900> again<00:03:21.049> a

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
around whereas now we're seeing again a

around whereas now we're seeing again a
tangible<00:03:21.920> about<00:03:22.190> 15%<00:03:23.030> improvement<00:03:23.090> now<00:03:23.870> it's

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
tangible about 15% improvement now it's

the<00:03:28.250> 8150<00:03:29.030> however<00:03:29.420> I<00:03:29.720> think<00:03:29.989> now<00:03:30.410> that<00:03:30.440> we're

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
the 8150 however I think now that we're

the 8150 however I think now that we're
seeing<00:03:31.010> a<00:03:31.250> much<00:03:31.459> bigger<00:03:31.700> generational<00:03:32.390> gap<00:03:32.540> in
