 It's going to be a long time without worrying. 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.990

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.480

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.320
 good even if you're already used to it 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.450
 I see here almost wire vacancies 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.400
 It really only seems like it has to 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.470
 appear that there is no way to hide 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.620
 yet we will see what will come up but 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.560
 your front but meanwhile the quality 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.330
 bc is always out in front is 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.280
 It's really cool, even our 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.250
 there are advantages as it is giving 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.200
 The result is followed by pain 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.640
 again earned thanks for 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.130
 preference for deposited trust 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.320
