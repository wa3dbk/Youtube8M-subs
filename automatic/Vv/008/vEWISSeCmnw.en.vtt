00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.820
 hello people how are you going to welcome me 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.500
 channel leave your mom already in this case 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.540
 I want to explain something that comes to me 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.059
 asking for a while ago for several videos that 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.360
 come watching is the subject of the archives 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.800
 scopes videos of scales harmonized the 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.199
 prime ask me the files some 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.340
 they are in another word format in format 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:24.109
 to avoid tried then I do until 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.490
 A while back I took the trouble 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.439
 every Monday night of 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.480
 answer one by one all 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.730
 subscribers and the people who wrote to me 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.859
 I sent them the email every Monday of 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.109
 night own steps and I was sent to 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:37.489
 ask for the file on Tuesday I had to 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:39.739
 but until the other week and that I have 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.379
 so now I made a question a lot 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.449
 simpler you enter this video that 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.920
 coincidentally I am explaining this 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.499
 question of how you will make the files 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.749
 here at the foot of the video where he says see more 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:52.399
 in information not inside the video 

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:54.469
 in the video I'm going to put some 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.049
 little signs that will link others 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.569
 videos but at the bottom of the video I'm going to 

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:01.249
 leave three links those links have 

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:02.479
 that are clouds of an immense cloud I 

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:04.280
 I have all the files and you 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.630
 they quietly choose the file and what 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.990
 download 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:12.140
 are going to find can see here with this 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.119
 question are three are three folders in 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.680
 this video was here the video was good 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.420
 of presentation so now they're going to 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.670
 find at the foot of this video that they are 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.350
 who are watching now are not found 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.810
 with three folders one that is the one of 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.360
 exercises where all the 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.299
 files of him in word would be in agreement 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.189
 inverted arpeggios of the right hand 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.600
 series of fingers all the exercises that 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.750
 you may have seen in the videos 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.280
 my other folder contains all the 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.250
 graphics of the rhythms as well as what 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.979
 had you ever requested what 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.070
 can see quietly can go 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.409
 watching to be charged 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.530
 you can see us 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:53.090
 I do not know what happens also because 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.189
 bolero example 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.960
 the rhythm of songs both two of 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.490
 chacarera all the variants and that 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.200
 expected to fall and then put in 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.439
 download if you want and download it 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.640
 automatically here they have it but what 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.259
 You can see them quietly 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.119
 directly from here, you do not have to 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.399
 download on the computer and the 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.810
 third that are the songs that do not 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.480
 well but of the tangos de astor that 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.250
 ravages and that in this folder many me 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.140
 they say I can not open it on my machine 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.180
 why are they all for a 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.379
 program called guitar pro in the 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.060
 guitar but you have to have it installed 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:26.239
 previously on the computer 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.180
 I do not know if we open here and for example this 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.590
 piece of libertango we download here 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.450
 we are seeing that I download 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.010
 download I still have it in the computer 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.950
 no but suppose I want it 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.340
 download this the process is not true 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.129
 discharge 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.010
 I close here I already have it and I already have it 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:44.930
 on my machine and now that I put them to 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.430
 open and I will open with the program 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.290
 of glitter but I know that the guitar pro 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.270
 you have to have them installed on your 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.880
 computer 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:57.000
 I opened I downloaded download directly 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.930
 'libertango' I give him play 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.930
 and there it is 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.360
 that is the process people 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.940
 three folders as I tell you the folder 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.069
 the graphics and rhythms the folder with the 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.740
 harmonized scales that is the video the 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.660
 file that asks us the most and they are good 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.250
 all the other files including each 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.069
 once we go adding some file 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.840
 I will also always place it in 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.420
 some of these three rhythm folders 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.920
 of exercises or harmonies where they do 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.380
 all the harmony exercises of 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.150
 technique and the folder with the songs 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.190
 usually it being from pieces acts 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.260
 of my rules and those issues and 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.320
 many more than at the same time adding 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.880
