00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
master galaxy as well to get that but

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.139 
master galaxy as well to get that but
this<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.829> another<00:00:44.040> thing<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.250> need<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.460> do<00:00:44.670> so

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
this is another thing you need to do so

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.540 
this is another thing you need to do so
inevitably<00:00:45.960> you're<00:00:46.800> going<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.039> have<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.370> grind

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
inevitably you're going to have to grind

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.400 
inevitably you're going to have to grind
for<00:00:47.820> star<00:00:48.090> bits<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.840> best<00:00:49.020> one<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.230> do

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
for star bits and the best one to do

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.630 
for star bits and the best one to do
that<00:00:49.559> as<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.860> mentioned<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.250> couple<00:00:50.340> times

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
that as I mentioned a couple times

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.160 
that as I mentioned a couple times
before<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:52.850> do<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.000> second<00:00:54.420> star<00:00:54.750> of

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
before is to do the second star of

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.439 
before is to do the second star of
melting<00:00:55.890> master<00:00:56.160> galaxy<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.610> stroll<00:00:57.120> down

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
melting master galaxy a stroll down

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.319 
melting master galaxy a stroll down
rolling<00:00:57.960> Lane<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.980> can<00:00:59.100> also<00:00:59.250> do<00:00:59.460> green<00:01:00.059> star

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
rolling Lane you can also do green star

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.260 
rolling Lane you can also do green star
3<00:01:00.690> if<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.899> want<00:01:00.989> but<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:02.039> not<00:01:02.579> big<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.210> a

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
3 if you want but it's not big of a

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.119 
3 if you want but it's not big of a
difference

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
difference

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.730 
difference

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
plant over here have a checkbook on it

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.039 
plant over here have a checkbook on it
and<00:01:17.490> since<00:01:18.149> you<00:01:18.299> want<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.600> be<00:01:18.689> getting<00:01:18.810> those

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
30 starters at the beginning every time

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.520 
30 starters at the beginning every time
you<00:01:21.119> want<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.299> skip<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.810> check<00:01:22.020> one<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.380> way

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
you want to skip the check one that way

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.919 
you want to skip the check one that way
whenever<00:01:22.829> you<00:01:23.070> die<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.939> start<00:01:24.509> back<00:01:24.750> from<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
whenever you die you start back from the

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:26.600 
whenever you die you start back from the
beginning<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.530> can<00:01:25.649> get<00:01:25.770> those<00:01:25.950> 30<00:01:26.280> star

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
beginning and you can get those 30 star

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.590 
beginning and you can get those 30 star
bits<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.659> then<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:28.939> go<00:01:29.939> through<00:01:30.149> the<00:01:30.240> galaxy

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
bits and then just go through the galaxy

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.059 
bits and then just go through the galaxy
if<00:01:30.899> normal<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:32.840> grab<00:01:33.840> as<00:01:34.020> many<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.679> star

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:35.069 
if normal and grab as many of the star

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:38.539 
if normal and grab as many of the star
bit<00:01:35.250> crystals<00:01:35.610> as<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.850> can<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:37.399> voila

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
bit crystals as you can and voila

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.300 
bit crystals as you can and voila
this<00:01:38.789> is<00:01:39.049> easily<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.319> best<00:01:40.590> place<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.920> grind

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
this is easily the best place to grind

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.169 
this is easily the best place to grind
for<00:01:41.459> starburst<00:01:41.759> it's<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.080> game<00:01:43.289> and<00:01:44.179> if

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
for starburst it's in the game and if

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.059 
for starburst it's in the game and if
you<00:01:45.330> do<00:01:45.479> well<00:01:45.689> here<00:01:45.929> you<00:01:46.020> can<00:01:46.140> typically<00:01:46.470> get

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:47.069 
you do well here you can typically get

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.219 
you do well here you can typically get
around<00:01:47.630> 150<00:01:48.709> every<00:01:49.709> run

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
around 150 every run

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.919 
around 150 every run
so<00:01:52.700> yeah<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:53.880> keep<00:01:54.119> doing<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.569> over<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
so yeah just keep doing this over and

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:57.039 
so yeah just keep doing this over and
over<00:01:55.110> now<00:01:55.649> thing<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.220> keep<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.459> mind<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.909> that

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
over now thing to keep in mind is that

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.779 
over now thing to keep in mind is that
whenever<00:01:58.049> you're<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.289> the<00:01:58.409> galaxy<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.159> can

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
whenever you're in the galaxy you can

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.440 
whenever you're in the galaxy you can
only<00:02:00.000> hold<00:02:00.360> up<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.950> 999<00:02:01.950> star<00:02:02.549> bits<00:02:02.819> so<00:02:03.360> you

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
only hold up to 999 star bits so you

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.179 
only hold up to 999 star bits so you
can't<00:02:03.689> just<00:02:04.110> keep<00:02:04.319> going<00:02:04.709> until<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.069> have

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
can't just keep going until you have

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.430 
can't just keep going until you have
enough<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.670> get<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.390> toad<00:02:06.599> bank<00:02:06.899> up<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:08.060> 9999

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
enough to get the toad bank up to 9999

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.009 
enough to get the toad bank up to 9999
so<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.500> will<00:02:10.799> eventually<00:02:11.100> have<00:02:11.579> to<00:02:11.880> leave<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
so you will eventually have to leave the

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.509 
so you will eventually have to leave the
galaxy<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:14.120> have<00:02:15.120> those<00:02:15.299> go<00:02:15.569> into<00:02:15.810> your<00:02:15.900> total

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
galaxy and have those go into your total

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:22.309 
galaxy and have those go into your total
possession<00:02:17.519> but<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:19.910> thing<00:02:20.910> is<00:02:20.940> in<00:02:21.660> order<00:02:22.139> to

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
possession but the thing is in order to

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.800 
possession but the thing is in order to
have<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.400> actually<00:02:23.760> happen<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.329> have<00:02:24.600> to

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
have that actually happen you have to

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.240 
have that actually happen you have to
grab<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:25.200> Stars<00:02:25.470> just<00:02:25.769> like<00:02:25.889> how<00:02:26.040> with<00:02:26.160> the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
grab the Stars just like how with the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.530 
grab the Stars just like how with the
comet<00:02:26.549> medal<00:02:26.819> whenever<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.209> collect<00:02:27.480> the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
comet medal whenever you collect the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.360 
comet medal whenever you collect the
combo<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.109> have<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.410> collect<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.739> star<00:02:29.010> for

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
combo you have to collect the star for

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.860 
combo you have to collect the star for
it<00:02:29.459> to<00:02:29.549> actually<00:02:29.639> count<00:02:30.480> towards<00:02:30.810> your

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
it to actually count towards your

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.840 
it to actually count towards your
possession<00:02:31.350> star<00:02:31.680> bits<00:02:31.859> in<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.100> same<00:02:32.340> way<00:02:32.639> and

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
possession star bits in the same way and

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.490 
possession star bits in the same way and
you<00:02:35.850> can<00:02:36.150> actually<00:02:36.180> make<00:02:36.870> that<00:02:37.049> count<00:02:37.260> by

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
you can actually make that count by

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.720 
you can actually make that count by
using<00:02:37.650> super<00:02:38.010> God<00:02:38.160> I'm<00:02:38.310> going<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.489> show<00:02:38.639> off

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
using super God I'm going to show off

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.759 
using super God I'm going to show off
the<00:02:38.850> super<00:02:39.120> guide<00:02:39.269> fissure<00:02:39.660> right<00:02:39.840> here<00:02:40.200> is<00:02:40.590> I

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
the super guide fissure right here is I

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:41.960 
the super guide fissure right here is I
haven't<00:02:40.920> show<00:02:41.100> enough<00:02:41.310> before<00:02:41.459> might<00:02:41.760> as<00:02:41.850> well

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
haven't show enough before might as well

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.129 
haven't show enough before might as well
do<00:02:42.329> that<00:02:42.359> as<00:02:42.660> well

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:43.139 
do that as well

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:45.199 
do that as well
so<00:02:43.799> that's<00:02:44.040> another<00:02:44.340> thing<00:02:44.730> that's<00:02:44.880> coming

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
so that's another thing that's coming

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:45.840 
so that's another thing that's coming
out<00:02:45.329> this

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
out this

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.630 
out this
video<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:47.380> again<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.980> super<00:02:48.100> guide<00:02:48.370> feature

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
video and again the super guide feature

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.070 
video and again the super guide feature
does<00:02:49.000> is<00:02:49.270> that<00:02:49.360> it<00:02:49.540> beats<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:50.220> level<00:02:51.220> for<00:02:51.520> you

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
does is that it beats a level for you

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.300 
does is that it beats a level for you
and<00:02:53.080> allows<00:02:53.380> you<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:53.740> progress<00:02:53.890> in<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.280> game

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
and allows you to progress in the game

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.850 
and allows you to progress in the game
however<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:55.240> items<00:02:56.110> that<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:56.470> super<00:02:56.740> guy

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
however the items that the super guy

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.330 
however the items that the super guy
collects<00:02:57.340> will<00:02:58.060> not<00:02:58.480> count<00:02:59.040> but<00:03:00.040> that<00:03:00.190> can<00:03:00.310> be

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
collects will not count but that can be

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.340 
collects will not count but that can be
kind<00:03:00.580> of<00:03:00.610> confusing<00:03:01.420> because<00:03:01.810> I<00:03:01.930> just<00:03:02.110> said

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
kind of confusing because I just said

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.920 
kind of confusing because I just said
that<00:03:02.680> this<00:03:03.070> can<00:03:03.340> allow<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.210> service<00:03:04.540> that<00:03:04.780> you

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
that this can allow the service that you

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.870 
that this can allow the service that you
collected<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:05.710> actually<00:03:05.980> count<00:03:06.250> towards<00:03:06.700> your

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
collected to actually count towards your

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.070 
collected to actually count towards your
total<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:08.470> that<00:03:09.090> is<00:03:10.090> true<00:03:10.450> however<00:03:10.810> the

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
total and that is true however the

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.930 
total and that is true however the
starboard<00:03:11.470> set<00:03:11.620> is<00:03:11.740> picking<00:03:12.130> up<00:03:12.310> in<00:03:12.550> this

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
starboard set is picking up in this

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.360 
starboard set is picking up in this
particular<00:03:13.650> run-through<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:14.740> can<00:03:14.860> see<00:03:15.070> it

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
particular run-through you can see it

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.420 
particular run-through you can see it
actually<00:03:15.790> does<00:03:16.060> show<00:03:17.020> the<00:03:17.380> computer<00:03:18.070> play

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
actually does show the computer play

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.550 
actually does show the computer play
through<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.730> level<00:03:18.760> and<00:03:19.270> you<00:03:19.360> can<00:03:20.200> see<00:03:20.320> it's

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
through the level and you can see it's

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.050 
through the level and you can see it's
collecting<00:03:20.890> star<00:03:21.130> bits<00:03:21.310> with<00:03:21.460> the<00:03:21.490> star<00:03:21.910> but

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
collecting star bits with the star but

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.250 
collecting star bits with the star but
this<00:03:22.720> computer<00:03:22.930> player<00:03:23.470> is<00:03:24.720> selecting<00:03:25.720> did

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
this computer player is selecting did

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.930 
this computer player is selecting did
not<00:03:26.410> count<00:03:26.620> towards<00:03:26.950> your<00:03:26.980> total<00:03:27.220> however<00:03:27.670> the

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
not count towards your total however the

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.150 
not count towards your total however the
100<00:03:28.570> or<00:03:28.690> so<00:03:28.900> that<00:03:29.140> I<00:03:29.200> picked<00:03:29.530> up<00:03:29.680> on<00:03:29.830> my<00:03:29.860> own

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
100 or so that I picked up on my own

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.270 
100 or so that I picked up on my own
will<00:03:30.640> count<00:03:30.970> once<00:03:31.420> this<00:03:31.570> thing<00:03:32.160> finishes<00:03:33.160> the

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
will count once this thing finishes the

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:40.710 
will count once this thing finishes the
star<00:03:34.560> picks<00:03:35.560> it<00:03:35.740> up<00:03:36.900> so<00:03:38.160> yeah<00:03:39.160> just<00:03:39.520> let<00:03:39.610> it<00:03:39.760> do

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
star picks it up so yeah just let it do

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.270 
star picks it up so yeah just let it do
its<00:03:40.750> thing<00:03:40.990> and<00:03:42.270> then<00:03:43.950> what<00:03:44.950> would<00:03:45.100> normally

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
its thing and then what would normally

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.710 
its thing and then what would normally
happened<00:03:45.760> if<00:03:45.880> you<00:03:45.970> don't<00:03:46.090> actually<00:03:46.360> get<00:03:46.630> the

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
happened if you don't actually get the

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.390 
happened if you don't actually get the
star<00:03:46.930> in<00:03:47.050> your<00:03:47.110> own<00:03:47.170> is<00:03:47.500> they'll<00:03:47.710> have<00:03:47.980> a

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
star in your own is they'll have a

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.310 
star in your own is they'll have a
Bronze<00:03:48.790> Star<00:03:49.240> come<00:03:49.450> out<00:03:49.630> but<00:03:49.930> since<00:03:50.140> I've

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
Bronze Star come out but since I've

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.710 
Bronze Star come out but since I've
already<00:03:50.440> done<00:03:50.860> this<00:03:51.010> on<00:03:51.220> my<00:03:51.370> own<00:03:51.400> before<00:03:51.730> of

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
already done this on my own before of

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.490 
already done this on my own before of

point of this video the point is to show
how<00:04:02.410> you<00:04:02.470> driver<00:04:02.800> star<00:04:03.160> bits<00:04:03.370> and<00:04:03.580> that<00:04:03.790> is<00:04:03.940> how

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
how you driver star bits and that is how

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.230 
how you driver star bits and that is how
just<00:04:04.420> go<00:04:04.960> through<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.290> obstacle<00:04:05.440> course<00:04:06.240> over

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
just go through the obstacle course over

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.110 
just go through the obstacle course over
and<00:04:07.390> over<00:04:07.630> to<00:04:07.810> have<00:04:07.990> 999<00:04:08.950> then<00:04:09.370> use<00:04:09.700> the<00:04:09.820> super

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
and over to have 999 then use the super

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.850 
and over to have 999 then use the super
guide<00:04:10.270> or<00:04:10.480> beat<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:10.960> star<00:04:11.170> on<00:04:11.380> your<00:04:11.410> own<00:04:11.650> if

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
guide or beat the star on your own if

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.740 
guide or beat the star on your own if
you<00:04:11.950> want<00:04:11.980> and<00:04:12.400> then<00:04:13.150> just<00:04:13.420> keep<00:04:13.570> repeating

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
you want and then just keep repeating

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.620 
you want and then just keep repeating
the<00:04:14.080> process<00:04:14.110> until<00:04:14.560> you<00:04:15.130> have<00:04:15.340> enough<00:04:15.720> to

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
the process until you have enough to

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.630 
the process until you have enough to
deposit<00:04:18.440> into<00:04:18.620> the<00:04:18.740> tote<00:04:18.920> bank<00:04:19.220> and<00:04:19.460> then

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
deposit into the tote bank and then

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.890 
deposit into the tote bank and then
eventually<00:04:20.000> your<00:04:20.720> goal<00:04:20.900> is<00:04:21.200> to<00:04:21.230> get<00:04:22.600> 9999<00:04:23.600> star

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
eventually your goal is to get 9999 star

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.860 
eventually your goal is to get 9999 star
bits<00:04:24.110> in<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:25.160> toad<00:04:25.370> Bank<00:04:25.640> which<00:04:26.600> I<00:04:26.750> actually
