want<00:00:14.119> to<00:00:14.179> do<00:00:14.299> the<00:00:14.690> Leapfrog<00:00:15.139> when<00:00:15.589> we're<00:00:15.740> going

00:00:15.819 --> 00:00:15.829 
want to do the Leapfrog when we're going

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:19.000 
want to do the Leapfrog when we're going
into<00:00:15.889> more<00:00:16.670> wooded<00:00:17.030> areas<00:00:17.390> it's<00:00:18.230> very<00:00:18.320> easy<00:00:18.710> to

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
into more wooded areas it's very easy to

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.530 
into more wooded areas it's very easy to
get<00:00:19.160> off<00:00:19.370> bearing<00:00:19.970> or

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:20.540 
get off bearing or

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.420 
get off bearing or
get<00:00:21.020> off<00:00:21.140> track<00:00:21.530> as<00:00:21.830> you're<00:00:22.070> going<00:00:22.250> around

trees<00:00:22.880> and<00:00:23.060> obstacles<00:00:23.570> by<00:00:24.110> using<00:00:24.320> a<00:00:24.560> partner

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
trees and obstacles by using a partner

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.820 
trees and obstacles by using a partner
we're<00:00:25.190> able<00:00:25.310> to<00:00:25.700> direct<00:00:26.270> us<00:00:26.450> left<00:00:27.380> or<00:00:27.620> right<00:00:27.800> or

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
we're able to direct us left or right or

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.490 
we're able to direct us left or right or
on<00:00:28.130> bearing<00:00:28.550> for<00:00:29.090> about<00:00:29.300> maybe<00:00:29.570> 50<00:00:30.050> feet<00:00:30.230> or<00:00:30.350> so

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
on bearing for about maybe 50 feet or so

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.499 
on bearing for about maybe 50 feet or so
and<00:00:30.710> then<00:00:31.250> the<00:00:31.460> second<00:00:31.789> person<00:00:31.880> will<00:00:32.150> come<00:00:32.329> up

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
and then the second person will come up

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.950 
and then the second person will come up
to<00:00:33.020> pass<00:00:33.350> us<00:00:33.620> and<00:00:33.829> leapfrog<00:00:34.490> ahead<00:00:35.240> and<00:00:35.720> then

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
to pass us and leapfrog ahead and then

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.830 
to pass us and leapfrog ahead and then
we'll<00:00:35.990> direct<00:00:36.470> them<00:00:36.820> to<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:38.210> proper<00:00:38.239> bearing

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
we'll direct them to the proper bearing

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.630 
we'll direct them to the proper bearing
the<00:00:39.079> bearing<00:00:39.230> on<00:00:39.530> the<00:00:39.680> compass<00:00:40.040> and<00:00:40.220> I'm<00:00:40.310> gonna

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640
