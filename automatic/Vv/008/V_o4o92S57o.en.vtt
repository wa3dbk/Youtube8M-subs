00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.490
 hello to all so today we're going 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.290
 talk about the 10 x 10 the famous 10 sets of 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.970
 10 rehearsals that come up all the time 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.320
 on the carpet whose nicks 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.090
 specialists tell us that it's 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.420
 basic training training 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.590
 par excellence for hypertrophy so 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.080
 obviously not if I talk about it is that 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.239
 it's not true as usual then the 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.320
 10 x 10 what is it exactly 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.870
 it's ten sets of 10 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.550
 petitions on a single fiscal year by 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.339
 muscle after that workout 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.540
 for hypertrophy would be complete and 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.949
 no we're out at the top 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.140
 so if I take an example the 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.820
 pectorals I do say series of ten to 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.519
 bench press and my session for the 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.309
 pectorals is complete then where does it come from 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.769
 this popularity in France and we owe it to 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.390
 gilles cometti in quotation marks to have 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.770
 popularized this type of training at 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.020
 through his many works 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.600
 modern methods of bodybuilding and 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.670
 further afield by charles poliquin 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.290
 coaching the Olympic athlete who has 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.970
 also advocated this type of training 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.320
 under the name of german volume training 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.280
 so the difference between these two 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.840
 people 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.940
 it is that gilles cometti recommends it to 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.380
 75% of its maxi which is all 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.760
 simply impossible to achieve 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.580
 while every policy the 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.740
 advise to 60% of his maxi what is 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.120
 there quite feasible then 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.580
 could it be anecdote when I passed 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.680
 my be1 suez that do not even exist 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.110
 unfortunately no longer today in 2006 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.050
 it was obviously necessary to show the 10 x 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.010
 10 as incredible technique 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.140
 hypertrophy especially for the four 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.280
 reco plasmic officers I refer you 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.450
 again the video on the 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.010
 inflatable for those interested 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.890
 to understand that hypertrophy 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:55.310
 plasma sarko does not exist is just 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.450
 an invention to lie outside like 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.659
 usually in bodybuilding 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.800
 it's pretty common enough and so it 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.390
 obviously needed to stand out this 10 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.700
 x 10 to have his exam if they have any 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.130
 shoulders of 10 x 10 6 we said 10 x 9 or 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.110
 10 times pink or first name of the petition 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.369
 others we did not have his degree as 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.000
 if it was going to change something 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.690
 so it's pretty funny so that's where 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.690
 comes the 10 x 10 in its form 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.690
 original 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.200
 the 10 x 10 in its original form for 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.000
 those who read meuse ebooks and 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.500
 including the notion of maple loss 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.940
 the number of series to do the same 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.190
 Exercise is a technique 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.420
 inconceivable training when one 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.900
 wants to progress in the medium and long 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.620
 term I refer you one more time 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.030
 of my articles 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.400
 the best bodybuilding program 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.530
 question mark for those that 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.880
 interested in understanding how 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.630
 build the best program of 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.680
 bodybuilding compared to oneself so with 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.000
 the years begin glimpse that this 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.700
 was not a very good program for 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.070
 progress even the reverse has been several 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.480
 evolutions so the first one was from 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.050
 divide celine's name over several 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.240
 drill 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.860
 such a basic workout do by 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.690
 example for the pectorals four series 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.160
 of developed-lying three sets of 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.050
 inclined doper and three sets of spread 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.210
 lying what is however clearly 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.070
 more logical to progress in a way 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.230
 visual and therefore muscularly 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.690
 this allows following the muscles of 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.710
 work from multiple angles 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.730
 and if it's not a lang muscle 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.680
 to have several requests 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.990
 muscle by partially deactivating 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.120
 some muscles by invoking others 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.910
 more voluntarily I will come back in 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.430
 an upcoming video on these notions a 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.920
 uncomplicated here but who are 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.900
 however very simple we could see also 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.230
 at the weights reister a few 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.970
 derivatives in particular the 10 x 2 10 x 3 for 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.440
 work explosivity what's 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.200
 designs very well when you want 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.880
 develop its speed its explosiveness 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.590
 then on heavy loads 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.060
 we could see in the middle of 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.489
 the industry the science way more 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.090
 General muse to decision making goal 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.120
 of strength 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.750
 the 10 x 4 said once simple ten times 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.400
 which compensates for a sand all in these 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.080
 voltages during the series by one more 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.239
 many series have arrived at 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.070
 same tonnage 15.4 choose by 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.959
 example if we do 10 x 4 with a 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.030
 load a little heavier it allows in 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.950
 general to progress a little bit more 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.600
 quickly in strength a little less in 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.120
 muscle volume in muscle gain 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:19.970
 but still remains effective for 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.970
 progress and therefore take muscle 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.389
 this 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.590
 maybe with my friend she's saber on 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.270
 the own son I advise you to go 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.099
 watch it is important to 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.949
 understand that below 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:36.979
 apart from all these number factors 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:38.599
 of repetitions of number of sets of 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.590
 number of exercises per muscle which 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:40.729
 first and foremost to take 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.919
 minister take strength and 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.659
 progress so much so that it is obvious that 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.830
 progress in the right range of 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.090
 repetition with the right number 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.610
 of exercises and the good number of series 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.860
 for each exercise end it's more 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.539
 effective for gaining muscle but he 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.189
 there is nothing worse actually than 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.960
 do four times 10 to 80 kg at 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:58.520
 bench press all year long and then 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.229
 to hope to gain muscle when one 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.770
 always the same we are always 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.889
 the same 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.830
 it's as simple as that 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:08.509
 that these cycles of progressions the 10x 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.919
 10 modified by buddy x 4 it takes five to 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:11.110
 ten times are conceive very well 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.039
 as a progression cycle 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.529
 when you do not progress anymore with 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:16.819
 traditional cycles those that that 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:18.370
 interest I will send you another one 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:20.180
 times but ebooks and their 22 videos 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.740
 available stiffened Coyah points such 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.590
 tells us how to build his 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.669
 progression cycle in detail with all 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.009
 the factors of progression that will 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.270
 with but its 10 x 10 derivatives get 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:32.750
 design very well as cycle of 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.310
 progression from a moment and he 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.409
 is obvious that the more one has a level 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.089
 advanced and more harmful progression are 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:39.919
 complex our margin of progression is 

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:42.440
 reduced and sometimes we have to do 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.509
 call to cycles that we would have 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.409
 not thought we will not have to imagine 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:47.389
 when you were a beginner or 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:49.310
 intermediate like those capable with 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:50.479
 many of my students who are not 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.339
 still on earth cycles like that but 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:56.389
 others do what they have to a very 

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:59.349
 good level now finally for 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:02.060
 conclude this video on the 10 x 10 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:05.270
 days to put its disadvantages so a 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.860
 alone angle between working quotes 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.990
 the impossibility of setting up 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.409
 cycles of session progressions in 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.029
 meeting 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:12.439
 finally a monotony of even 

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:14.990
 training to always do the same 

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:16.250
 always the same thing that's why I 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.430
 advise you if you really want 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.189
 use the 10 x 10 its variants that 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.389
 we saw together in this video 

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:25.279
 in order to set up your cycles of 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:27.500
 progressions and therefore to take 

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:29.839
 muscle gradually by force small to 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.650
 small and so finally came so from 

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:33.020
 progress 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:36.009
 so thank you first as usual for 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.110
 everyone who will share my video 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:39.580
 my work my photos etc and we get 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.869
 found as usual the week 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.869
 next need a new video
