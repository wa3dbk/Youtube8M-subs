paper and just for comparison and I'm
going<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.269> compare<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.779> against<00:00:31.230> my<00:00:31.619> sanitaire

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
okay so method pretty good but it had

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.639 
okay so method pretty good but it had
some<00:01:40.710> trouble<00:01:41.780> picking<00:01:42.780> up<00:01:42.929> from<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.380> fine

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
some trouble picking up from the fine

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.340 
some trouble picking up from the fine
more<00:01:44.399> powdered<00:01:45.210> chip<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:47.310> pieces<00:01:47.819> and<00:01:48.350> now

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
more powdered chip to pieces and now

00:01:49.350 --> 00:03:03.300 
more powdered chip to pieces and now
I'll<00:01:50.219> do<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.640> sanitary

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.160 

okay<00:03:04.310> so<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:08.000> sanitaire<00:03:08.569> definitely<00:03:09.020> did

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
okay so the sanitaire definitely did

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.839 
okay so the sanitaire definitely did
better<00:03:09.410> it<00:03:11.890> you<00:03:12.890> didn't<00:03:13.099> have<00:03:13.220> to<00:03:13.340> pass<00:03:13.550> over

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
better it you didn't have to pass over

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.059 
better it you didn't have to pass over
at<00:03:14.120> multiple<00:03:14.690> times<00:03:14.989> to<00:03:15.290> pick<00:03:15.470> up<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.770> finer

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
at multiple times to pick up the finer

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.520 
at multiple times to pick up the finer
bit<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:19.420> pick<00:03:20.420> things<00:03:20.630> up<00:03:20.870> a<00:03:21.020> bit<00:03:21.050> quicker

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
bit and pick things up a bit quicker

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.510 
bit and pick things up a bit quicker
than<00:03:21.830> the<00:03:22.069> Dirt<00:03:22.610> Devil<00:03:22.640> and<00:03:24.069> it<00:03:25.069> did<00:03:25.220> a<00:03:25.250> better

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
than the Dirt Devil and it did a better

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.090 
than the Dirt Devil and it did a better
job<00:03:25.940> of<00:03:25.970> deep<00:03:26.330> cleaning<00:03:26.569> and<00:03:27.610> now<00:03:29.860> I'll<00:03:30.860> test

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
job of deep cleaning and now I'll test

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.590 
job of deep cleaning and now I'll test
it<00:03:31.310> with<00:03:31.489> the<00:03:32.060> paper<00:03:33.130> pieces<00:03:34.209> I'm<00:03:35.209> not<00:03:35.390> going

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
it with the paper pieces I'm not going

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.500 
it with the paper pieces I'm not going
to<00:03:35.660> do<00:03:35.780> too<00:03:35.810> many<00:03:36.170> because<00:03:36.910> I'm<00:03:37.910> pretty<00:03:38.180> sure

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
to do too many because I'm pretty sure

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.150 
to do too many because I'm pretty sure
this<00:03:38.660> is<00:03:38.720> guaranteed<00:03:39.350> to<00:03:39.560> clog<00:03:39.800> the<00:03:39.980> Dirt

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
this is guaranteed to clog the Dirt

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:49.059 
this is guaranteed to clog the Dirt
Devil<00:03:44.140> and<00:03:45.140> I<00:03:45.769> already<00:03:46.160> vacuumed<00:03:46.850> up<00:03:47.830> lots<00:03:48.830> of

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
Devil and I already vacuumed up lots of

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.509 
Devil and I already vacuumed up lots of
paper<00:03:49.819> pieces<00:03:50.330> in<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.569> sanitaire<00:03:51.519> larger

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
paper pieces in the sanitaire larger

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.449 
paper pieces in the sanitaire larger
chunks<00:03:53.330> on<00:03:53.510> this<00:03:53.720> and<00:03:53.989> it<00:03:54.080> it<00:03:54.709> took<00:03:54.980> it<00:03:55.190> better

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
chunks on this and it it took it better

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.870 
chunks on this and it it took it better
than<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:55.970> kirby<00:03:56.360> even<00:03:57.340> which<00:03:58.340> I<00:03:58.489> thought<00:03:58.700> was

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
than the kirby even which I thought was

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.840 
than the kirby even which I thought was
kind<00:03:59.150> of<00:03:59.360> interesting<00:04:00.610> considering<00:04:01.610> the

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
kind of interesting considering the

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:08.620 
kind of interesting considering the
sanitaire<00:04:02.420> has<00:04:02.630> a<00:04:02.660> smaller<00:04:04.330> has<00:04:05.330> smaller<00:04:07.630> has

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
sanitaire has a smaller has smaller has

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.420 
sanitaire has a smaller has smaller has
smaller<00:04:09.220> passageways<00:04:10.220> or<00:04:10.489> openings<00:04:11.650> so<00:04:12.650> start

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
smaller passageways or openings so start

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:38.300 
smaller passageways or openings so start
with<00:04:13.549> this<00:04:13.760> one

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.760 

okay<00:04:39.310> so<00:04:39.370> like<00:04:40.330> some<00:04:40.840> of<00:04:40.960> it<00:04:41.110> made<00:04:41.350> it<00:04:41.500> into

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
okay so like some of it made it into

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.370 
okay so like some of it made it into
there<00:04:44.400> so<00:04:45.400> you<00:04:45.460> see<00:04:45.880> a<00:04:46.210> lot<00:04:46.660> of<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:46.870> paper<00:04:47.080> got

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
there so you see a lot of the paper got

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.060 
there so you see a lot of the paper got
stuck<00:04:47.800> up<00:04:48.370> at<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.610> top<00:04:49.350> and<00:04:50.350> make<00:04:50.620> it<00:04:50.800> into

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
stuck up at the top and make it into

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:57.560 
stuck up at the top and make it into
there<00:04:52.290> so<00:04:53.290> I<00:04:53.650> would<00:04:54.070> say<00:04:54.280> that<00:04:54.310> was<00:04:54.610> a<00:04:54.640> fail

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.670 

considering<00:04:58.570> that<00:04:58.690> it<00:04:58.840> kind<00:04:59.080> of<00:04:59.140> did<00:04:59.320> clogged

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
considering that it kind of did clogged

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.600 
considering that it kind of did clogged
up<00:04:59.950> or<00:05:00.220> it<00:05:00.340> got<00:05:00.870> stuck<00:05:01.870> in<00:05:02.050> there<00:05:02.260> at<00:05:02.350> least<00:05:02.610> and

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
up or it got stuck in there at least and

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:26.559 
up or it got stuck in there at least and
we'll<00:05:03.730> do<00:05:03.940> an<00:05:04.870> ax<00:05:04.930> tear

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:26.569 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:31.639 

hey<00:05:27.569> I'll<00:05:28.289> turn<00:05:28.559> it<00:05:28.709> over<00:05:30.319> see<00:05:31.319> that<00:05:31.499> any

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:31.649 
hey I'll turn it over see that any

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:35.329 
hey I'll turn it over see that any
pieces<00:05:32.009> got<00:05:32.369> stuck<00:05:32.759> in<00:05:32.939> there<00:05:33.089> or<00:05:33.209> not<00:05:34.339> doesn't

00:05:35.329 --> 00:05:35.339 
pieces got stuck in there or not doesn't

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:44.919 
pieces got stuck in there or not doesn't
look<00:05:35.610> like<00:05:35.849> it<00:05:36.649> I'll<00:05:37.649> pull<00:05:37.889> the<00:05:38.039> cover<00:05:38.309> off

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:44.929 

00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:48.999 

nothing<00:05:45.929> it<00:05:46.589> all<00:05:46.800> went<00:05:47.550> into<00:05:48.029> the<00:05:48.239> bag

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 
nothing it all went into the bag

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:55.070 
nothing it all went into the bag
no<00:05:50.009> clogs<00:05:50.459> or<00:05:50.789> anything<00:05:52.639> sanitary<00:05:53.639> won<00:05:54.080> both

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
no clogs or anything sanitary won both

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.019 
no clogs or anything sanitary won both
rounds<00:05:56.360> least<00:05:57.360> I<00:05:57.509> think<00:05:57.809> so
