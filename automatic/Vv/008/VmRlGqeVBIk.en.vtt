of<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.430> salt<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.820> gonna<00:01:20.970> stay<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.780> solution

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
of the salt is gonna stay in a solution

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
bit more do not be stingy with the salt

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.520

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.320 

the<00:02:07.320> idea<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.039> get<00:02:08.160> enough<00:02:08.459> juice<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:09.179> come

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
the idea is to get enough juice to come

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.690 
the idea is to get enough juice to come
up<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.629> side<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.709> jar<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.250> completely

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
up the side of the jar and completely

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.069 
up the side of the jar and completely
cover<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.180> lemons

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:14.079 
cover the lemons

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:19.479 
cover the lemons
this<00:02:15.079> can<00:02:15.290> take<00:02:15.819> up<00:02:16.819> to<00:02:17.030> two<00:02:17.209> days<00:02:18.459> every<00:02:19.459> day

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
this can take up to two days every day

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.989 
this can take up to two days every day
return<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.299> push<00:02:20.450> them<00:02:20.599> down<00:02:20.859> and<00:02:21.909> if<00:02:22.909> you

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:22.999 
return and push them down and if you

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:24.339 
return and push them down and if you
still<00:02:23.299> don't<00:02:23.450> get<00:02:23.599> enough<00:02:23.840> lemon<00:02:24.109> juice<00:02:24.230> you

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
still don't get enough lemon juice you

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:25.809 
still don't get enough lemon juice you
can<00:02:24.499> add<00:02:24.680> fresh<00:02:24.980> lemon<00:02:25.280> juice<00:02:25.430> from<00:02:25.609> other

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
can add fresh lemon juice from other

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.069 
can add fresh lemon juice from other
lemons<00:02:27.819> so<00:02:28.819> once<00:02:29.030> you've<00:02:29.209> pressed<00:02:29.629> out<00:02:29.870> pretty
