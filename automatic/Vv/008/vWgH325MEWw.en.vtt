00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
steps like five hundred million times I

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.249

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
think it works

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.590 
think it works
me<00:01:28.590> personally<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:29.189> don't<00:01:29.340> have<00:01:29.520> time<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.360> rinse

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
me personally I don't have time to rinse

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.170 
me personally I don't have time to rinse
and<00:01:30.840> then<00:01:31.049> put<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.320> gel<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:32.070> then<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.970> put

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
and then put the gel on and then to put

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.789 
and then put the gel on and then to put
the<00:01:33.270> light<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.450> my<00:01:33.689> mouth<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:34.140> two<00:01:34.259> minutes

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
the light in my mouth for two minutes

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.679 
the light in my mouth for two minutes
and<00:01:34.920> then<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.670> do<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.820> same<00:01:36.119> thing<00:01:36.360> over<00:01:36.540> again

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
and then to do the same thing over again

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.170 
and then to do the same thing over again
for<00:01:37.110> five<00:01:37.320> hundred<00:01:37.470> times<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.220> don't<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.700> time

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
for five hundred times I don't have time

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.109 
for five hundred times I don't have time
for<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.960> just<00:01:40.140> don't<00:01:40.320> I'm<00:01:40.710> sorry<00:01:41.159> but<00:01:42.090> I

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
for that I just don't I'm sorry but I

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.060 
for that I just don't I'm sorry but I
think<00:01:42.240> if<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.630> have<00:01:42.869> time<00:01:43.200> for<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.799> think

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
think if you have time for this I think

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.100 
think if you have time for this I think
it<00:01:44.340> really<00:01:44.610> really<00:01:44.790> does<00:01:45.270> work<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.899> think

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
it really really does work and I think

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.350 
it really really does work and I think
it<00:01:46.229> does<00:01:46.500> give<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.220> results<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.000> have<00:01:48.149> time

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
it does give you results you have time

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.940 
it does give you results you have time

vivid<00:03:33.700> ones<00:03:33.940> because<00:03:34.540> they're<00:03:34.840> not<00:03:34.959> that

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
vivid ones because they're not that

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.630 
vivid ones because they're not that
expensive<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:35.950> I<00:03:36.010> think<00:03:36.220> I'm<00:03:36.310> only<00:03:36.430> like

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.690 
with the price number on the screen but

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
one I believe is ten dollars on it comes

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.210 
one I believe is ten dollars on it comes
with<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:13.810> rinse<00:04:14.080> the<00:04:14.410> gel<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:14.890> a<00:04:15.010> mouth<00:04:15.190> guard

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
with the rinse the gel and a mouth guard

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.180 
with the rinse the gel and a mouth guard
you<00:04:15.970> can<00:04:16.000> get<00:04:16.359> just<00:04:16.690> the<00:04:16.900> gel<00:04:17.260> that's<00:04:17.620> cheaper

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
you can get just the gel that's cheaper

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.400 
you can get just the gel that's cheaper
than<00:04:18.340> this<00:04:18.489> I<00:04:18.700> think<00:04:18.910> it's<00:04:19.030> like<00:04:19.209> maybe<00:04:20.080> five

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
than this I think it's like maybe five

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.100 
than this I think it's like maybe five
or<00:04:20.440> six<00:04:20.890> dollars<00:04:21.100> not<00:04:21.520> really<00:04:21.789> sure<00:04:22.030> how<00:04:22.900> but

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
or six dollars not really sure how but

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.860 
or six dollars not really sure how but
it's<00:04:23.229> the<00:04:23.320> wrong

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
it's the wrong

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.260 
it's the wrong
Green<00:04:24.080> but<00:04:24.710> I<00:04:24.860> know<00:04:25.250> it's<00:04:25.669> less<00:04:26.000> expensive

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
Green but I know it's less expensive

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.400 
Green but I know it's less expensive
than<00:04:26.780> this<00:04:26.990> one

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
than this one

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.780 
than this one
I<00:04:27.440> really<00:04:27.740> like<00:04:27.919> about<00:04:27.949> it<00:04:28.250> is<00:04:28.400> that<00:04:28.639> it

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
I really like about it is that it

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.520 
I really like about it is that it
doesn't<00:04:29.000> mean<00:04:29.240> much<00:04:29.330> he's<00:04:29.540> sensitive<00:04:29.900> at<00:04:30.199> all

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
doesn't mean much he's sensitive at all

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.100 
doesn't mean much he's sensitive at all
