hey<00:00:04.589> folks<00:00:04.830> just<00:00:05.100> doing<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.400> quick<00:00:06.240> video<00:00:06.600> about

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
hey folks just doing a quick video about

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.070 
hey folks just doing a quick video about
some<00:00:07.350> batteries<00:00:07.740> about<00:00:07.950> these<00:00:08.099> 18<00:00:08.750> 650s<00:00:09.750> that

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
some batteries about these 18 650s that

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.290 
some batteries about these 18 650s that
I<00:00:10.170> picked<00:00:10.410> up<00:00:10.559> most<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.639> these<00:00:11.700> batteries<00:00:11.940> are

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
I picked up most of these batteries are

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.330 
I picked up most of these batteries are
made<00:00:12.420> in<00:00:12.630> China<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:13.230> there<00:00:13.559> are<00:00:13.710> lithium-ion

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
made in China and there are lithium-ion

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.599 
made in China and there are lithium-ion
batteries<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:16.260> you<00:00:16.379> need<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.590> be<00:00:16.710> careful

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
batteries and and you need to be careful

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:18.859 
batteries and and you need to be careful
with<00:00:17.670> these<00:00:17.850> batteries<00:00:18.029> that<00:00:18.420> are<00:00:18.480> easy<00:00:18.720> to

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
with these batteries that are easy to

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.590 
with these batteries that are easy to
overcharge<00:00:19.380> they're<00:00:20.160> easy<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.520> understand<00:00:21.420> if

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
overcharge they're easy to understand if

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.679 
overcharge they're easy to understand if
you<00:00:21.720> mishandle<00:00:22.050> them<00:00:22.350> or<00:00:22.590> if<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.769> mix

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
you mishandle them or if you mix

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.740 
you mishandle them or if you mix
batteries<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.840> different<00:00:25.199> current<00:00:25.590> or

batteries of different current or
different<00:00:27.750> levels<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:28.140> charged<00:00:28.640> like<00:00:29.640> you

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
different levels of charged like you

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.460 
different levels of charged like you
have<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.910> half<00:00:30.119> dad<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> full<00:00:30.689> battery<00:00:30.840> you

have a half dad and a full battery you

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.610 
have a half dad and a full battery you
put<00:00:31.650> them<00:00:31.769> together<00:00:33.350> they'll<00:00:34.350> try<00:00:34.559> to

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
put them together they'll try to

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.900 
put them together they'll try to
transfer<00:00:35.040> energy<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.399> each<00:00:35.489> other<00:00:35.640> they<00:00:35.790> can

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
transfer energy to each other they can

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.150 
transfer energy to each other they can
get<00:00:36.059> very<00:00:36.300> hot<00:00:36.540> very<00:00:36.809> quickly<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.770> they<00:00:38.129> can

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
get very hot very quickly and they can

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.280 
get very hot very quickly and they can
be<00:00:38.340> pretty<00:00:38.460> hazardous<00:00:38.760> I'm<00:00:39.660> not<00:00:39.840> an<00:00:39.930> expert<00:00:40.230> so

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
be pretty hazardous I'm not an expert so

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.690 
be pretty hazardous I'm not an expert so
if<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.860> want<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.160> start<00:00:41.399> playing<00:00:41.489> around

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
if you want to start playing around

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.280 
if you want to start playing around
these<00:00:41.910> types<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.210> batteries<00:00:42.390> go<00:00:43.079> on<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
these types of batteries go on the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.529 
these types of batteries go on the
internet<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.829> get<00:00:44.610> information<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.270> read<00:00:45.420> it

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
internet and get information and read it

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.900 
internet and get information and read it
for<00:00:45.660> yourselves<00:00:46.190> but<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.370> one<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.789> things

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
for yourselves but the one of the things

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.900 
for yourselves but the one of the things
I<00:00:47.969> wanted<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.239> post<00:00:48.750> about<00:00:48.899> was<00:00:49.850> these<00:00:50.850> are

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
I wanted to post about was these are

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.459 
I wanted to post about was these are
some<00:00:51.120> ultra<00:00:51.390> fires<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.840> ordered<00:00:52.170> an<00:00:52.260> ultra

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
some ultra fires and I ordered an ultra

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.869 
some ultra fires and I ordered an ultra
fire<00:00:52.620> flashlights<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.219> came<00:00:53.550> with<00:00:53.699> these

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
fire flashlights that came with these

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.270 
fire flashlights that came with these
and<00:00:54.180> they<00:00:54.390> came<00:00:54.539> with<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.780> charger<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
and they came with a charger and the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.599 
and they came with a charger and the
charger<00:00:57.020> looked<00:00:58.020> pretty<00:00:58.230> bad<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.680> looked<00:00:59.190> like

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
charger looked pretty bad it looked like

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.810 
charger looked pretty bad it looked like
a<00:00:59.640> 7th<00:01:00.000> grade<00:01:00.260> science<00:01:01.260> fair<00:01:01.469> project<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.160> I

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
a 7th grade science fair project and I

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.179 
a 7th grade science fair project and I
don't<00:01:03.149> use<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.359> because<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:04.049> charger<00:01:04.769> itself

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
don't use it because the charger itself

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.730 
don't use it because the charger itself
didn't<00:01:05.850> have<00:01:06.380> protection<00:01:07.380> circuit

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
didn't have protection circuit

or under current but these batteries if

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.800 
or under current but these batteries if
you<00:01:12.180> take<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.420> look<00:01:12.659> at<00:01:12.840> them<00:01:13.070> they<00:01:14.070> say<00:01:14.400> that

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
you take a look at them they say that

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.899 
you take a look at them they say that
they<00:01:15.810> have<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:16.259> charging<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.310> recharging<00:01:17.820> or

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
pricey right there and if you take a

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.249 
pricey right there and if you take a
look<00:01:22.439> at<00:01:22.560> these<00:01:22.650> batteries<00:01:23.159> they<00:01:24.000> do<00:01:24.060> have<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
look at these batteries they do have the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.469 
look at these batteries they do have the
circuit<00:01:25.590> they<00:01:26.310> have<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.670> circuit<00:01:27.000> added<00:01:27.360> to

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
circuit they have the circuit added to

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.460 
circuit they have the circuit added to
the<00:01:27.570> bottom<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.020> battery<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.380> the

the bottom of the battery on the
negative<00:01:28.829> side<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.540> if<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.659> take<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> look<00:01:31.020> at

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
negative side and if you take a look at

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.679 
negative side and if you take a look at
them<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.680> compare<00:01:32.040> them<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.689> unprotected

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
them and you compare them to unprotected

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.960 
them and you compare them to unprotected
batteries<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:35.130> can<00:01:35.159> see<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.790> they're<00:01:35.939> a

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
batteries you can see that they're a

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.330 
batteries you can see that they're a
little<00:01:36.150> bit<00:01:36.390> taller<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:37.979> result

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
little bit taller and that is a result

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.420 
little bit taller and that is a result
so<00:01:39.150> as<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.360> can<00:01:39.450> see<00:01:39.600> in<00:01:39.689> them<00:01:40.380> oh<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.400> a

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
so as you can see in them oh that is a

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.870 
so as you can see in them oh that is a
result<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.299> protection<00:01:42.840> circuit<00:01:43.759> you<00:01:44.759> can

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
result of the protection circuit you can

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.690 
result of the protection circuit you can
see<00:01:45.030> it's<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.210> little<00:01:45.420> bit<00:01:45.540> longer<00:01:46.399> so<00:01:47.399> now<00:01:47.670> I

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
see it's a little bit longer so now I

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.069 
see it's a little bit longer so now I
got<00:01:48.000> pretty<00:01:48.270> good<00:01:48.329> performance<00:01:48.840> out<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.960> these

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
that there were some problems with fakes

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.270 
that there were some problems with fakes
out<00:02:21.480> there<00:02:21.540> but<00:02:21.960> I<00:02:22.230> got<00:02:22.650> four<00:02:22.860> of<00:02:22.920> they<00:02:23.070> looked

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
out there but I got four of they looked

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.910 
out there but I got four of they looked
the<00:02:23.340> same<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.760> was<00:02:23.880> using<00:02:24.030> them<00:02:24.210> in<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.920> power

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
the same and I was using them in a power

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.350 
the same and I was using them in a power
bank<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.340> I<00:02:26.430> didn't<00:02:26.640> have<00:02:26.730> any<00:02:26.850> problems<00:02:27.240> with

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
bank and I didn't have any problems with

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.960 
bank and I didn't have any problems with
them<00:02:27.740> the<00:02:28.740> power<00:02:28.920> bank<00:02:29.250> did<00:02:29.430> charge<00:02:29.700> quickly

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
them the power bank did charge quickly

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.950 
them the power bank did charge quickly
and<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.420> did<00:02:30.570> run<00:02:30.720> out<00:02:30.890> reasonably<00:02:31.890> quick<00:02:32.960> but

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
and it did run out reasonably quick but

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.620 
and it did run out reasonably quick but
it<00:02:34.050> started<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:34.440> lose<00:02:34.650> performance<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.850> so<00:02:36.600> I

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
it started to lose performance and so I

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.940 
it started to lose performance and so I
got<00:02:36.870> them<00:02:36.990> out<00:02:37.110> I<00:02:37.170> looked<00:02:37.530> at<00:02:37.650> I'm<00:02:37.770> going<00:02:37.860> to

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
got them out I looked at I'm going to

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.990 
got them out I looked at I'm going to
compare<00:02:38.190> them<00:02:38.280> these<00:02:38.430> other<00:02:38.610> batteries<00:02:38.910> you

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
compare them these other batteries you

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.680 
compare them these other batteries you
can<00:02:39.120> see<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.480> button<00:02:40.110> tops<00:02:40.320> look<00:02:40.620> different

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
can see the button tops look different

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.510 
can see the button tops look different
and<00:02:42.690> I<00:02:42.810> saw<00:02:43.020> that<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.380> bottoms<00:02:43.800> were

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
and I saw that the bottoms were

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.250 
and I saw that the bottoms were
different<00:02:45.110> OOP<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:47.480> saw<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.540> bottoms<00:02:49.080> were

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
different OOP I saw the bottoms were

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.080 
different OOP I saw the bottoms were
different<00:02:49.650> this<00:02:50.190> one's<00:02:50.370> marked<00:02:50.580> ultra<00:02:50.910> fine

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
different this one's marked ultra fine

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.020 
different this one's marked ultra fine
it's<00:02:51.300> not<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.810> then<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:53.100> saw<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.850> they're

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
it's not and then I saw that they're

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.970 
it's not and then I saw that they're
different<00:02:54.420> lengths<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.020> then<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.590> realized

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
different lengths and then I realized

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.040 
different lengths and then I realized
that<00:02:56.070> these<00:02:56.310> do<00:02:56.700> not<00:02:56.730> have<00:02:57.300> a<00:02:57.330> protection

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
that these do not have a protection

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.360 
that these do not have a protection
circuit<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.560> they<00:02:58.620> were<00:02:58.680> sold<00:02:59.040> through

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
circuit and they were sold through

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.100 
circuit and they were sold through
Amazon<00:03:00.090> as<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:01.290> protected<00:03:01.920> battery<00:03:02.900> so<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:03.930> was<00:03:04.080> a

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
Amazon as a protected battery so I was a

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.199 
Amazon as a protected battery so I was a
little<00:03:04.260> irritated<00:03:04.410> about<00:03:04.740> it<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.130> think<00:03:05.910> I<00:03:06.060> paid

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
little irritated about it I think I paid

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.610 
little irritated about it I think I paid
about<00:03:06.330> 10<00:03:06.540> bucks<00:03:06.720> for<00:03:06.900> four<00:03:07.080> batteries<00:03:07.410> so

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
about 10 bucks for four batteries so

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.600 
about 10 bucks for four batteries so
it's<00:03:07.709> about<00:03:07.800> two<00:03:07.950> dollars<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.250> fifty<00:03:08.310> cents

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
it's about two dollars and fifty cents

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.730 
it's about two dollars and fifty cents
apiece<00:03:09.020> realized<00:03:10.020> it<00:03:10.170> was<00:03:10.260> too<00:03:10.410> good<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.620> be

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
apiece realized it was too good to be

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.060 
apiece realized it was too good to be
true<00:03:10.860> but<00:03:12.260> what<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:13.320> can<00:03:13.500> tell<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:13.709> is<00:03:13.830> I'll
