00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
the espresso machine but you don't see

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.519 
the espresso machine but you don't see
how<00:00:28.470> big<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.640> here<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.119> put<00:00:30.810> my<00:00:30.960> Cuisinart

that's a regular coffee machine so if
you'll<00:00:40.200> you'll<00:00:40.739> see<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.280> basically<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
you'll you'll see it basically the

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.660 
you'll you'll see it basically the
coffee<00:00:42.719> machine<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> little<00:00:43.379> bit<00:00:43.469> taller

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
coffee machine is a little bit taller

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.639 
coffee machine is a little bit taller
obviously<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.660> jurors<00:00:46.140> gonna<00:00:46.320> be<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.469> little

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
obviously the jurors gonna be a little

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.729 
obviously the jurors gonna be a little
longer<00:00:46.860> but<00:00:48.079> it's<00:00:49.079> almost<00:00:49.260> kind<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.500> like<00:00:49.620> you

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
longer but it's almost kind of like you

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.439 
longer but it's almost kind of like you
could<00:00:49.860> take<00:00:50.010> two<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.489> these<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.850> put<00:00:51.059> them<00:00:51.210> if

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
could take two of these and put them if

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.139 
could take two of these and put them if
you<00:00:51.539> had<00:00:51.660> two<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.960> these<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.820> put<00:00:53.820> them<00:00:54.000> in

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
you had two of these and put them in

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.069 
you had two of these and put them in
front<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.449> one<00:00:54.570> another<00:00:54.600> it's<00:00:55.110> about<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.710> same

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
front of one another it's about the same

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.450 
front of one another it's about the same
depth<00:00:58.079> look<00:00:58.440> put<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.520> front<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:01.460> it's

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
depth look put it in front of it it's

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:12.170 
depth look put it in front of it it's
actually<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.850> very<00:01:03.090> narrow<00:01:03.539> unit<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:11.090> with<00:01:12.090> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
actually a very narrow unit so with the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.969 
actually a very narrow unit so with the
wife<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.630> was<00:01:12.810> kind<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.590> know<00:01:13.710> Jen's

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
wife that was kind of you know Jen's

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.620 
wife that was kind of you know Jen's
biggest<00:01:14.369> thing<00:01:14.549> was<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.939> don't<00:01:15.060> want<00:01:15.450> an

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
biggest thing was I don't want an

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.070 
biggest thing was I don't want an
expressive<00:01:16.080> station<00:01:16.920> taking<00:01:17.880> up<00:01:18.060> half<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
expressive station taking up half of the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.320 
expressive station taking up half of the
kitchen<00:01:19.500> counter<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.880> thought<00:01:21.180> was

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
kitchen counter so that I thought was

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330 
kitchen counter so that I thought was
really<00:01:21.509> really<00:01:21.780> cool<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.680> second<00:01:23.070> thing<00:01:23.220> is

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
really really cool the second thing is

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.640 
really really cool the second thing is
here<00:01:23.580> these<00:01:23.729> spouts<00:01:24.150> right<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.990> hardly<00:01:25.500> ever

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
here these spouts right so I hardly ever

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.070 
here these spouts right so I hardly ever
use<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.400> because<00:01:26.549> truthfully<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.479> get<00:01:28.049> a

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
use that because truthfully I get a

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.410 
use that because truthfully I get a
little<00:01:28.290> lazy<00:01:28.530> I'm<00:01:29.040> not<00:01:29.490> very<00:01:29.729> good<00:01:29.820> at<00:01:30.150> waiting

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
little lazy I'm not very good at waiting

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.870 
little lazy I'm not very good at waiting
and<00:01:30.840> I've<00:01:31.680> seen<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.220> from<00:01:32.369> time<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.850> time

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
and I've seen that from time to time

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.080 
and I've seen that from time to time
when<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.540> use<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.110> for<00:01:34.409> steam<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:35.640> will<00:01:35.850> turn

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
when I use this for steam this will turn

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.109 
when I use this for steam this will turn
it<00:01:36.210> off<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.689> it'll<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.170> kind<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.500> pop<00:01:37.770> off<00:01:38.119> so

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
it off and it'll just kind of pop off so

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.600 
it off and it'll just kind of pop off so
that<00:01:39.810> I'm<00:01:40.110> not<00:01:40.140> necessarily<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.920> big<00:01:41.159> big<00:01:41.369> fan

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
that I'm not necessarily a big big fan

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.249 
that I'm not necessarily a big big fan
of<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.000> just<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.360> terms<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.689> laziness<00:01:43.020> I

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
of and just in terms of laziness I

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.920 
of and just in terms of laziness I
figured<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.619> know<00:01:43.649> what<00:01:44.040> I'm<00:01:44.130> gonna<00:01:44.220> do<00:01:44.369> this

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
figured you know what I'm gonna do this

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.510 
figured you know what I'm gonna do this
instead<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.229> comes<00:01:46.680> with<00:01:46.950> right<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.399> that's

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
instead it comes with right so that's

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.800 
instead it comes with right so that's
the<00:01:47.729> regular<00:01:48.060> one<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.540> would<00:01:48.659> have

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
the regular one that you would have

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.950 
the regular one that you would have
right<00:01:48.960> there<00:01:49.700> instead<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.850> comes<00:01:51.180> with<00:01:51.479> this

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
right there instead it comes with this

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.389 
right there instead it comes with this
thing<00:01:53.090> and<00:01:54.530> you<00:01:55.530> just<00:01:55.680> kind<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:55.920> put<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.189> in

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
thing and you just kind of put it in

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.109 
thing and you just kind of put it in
there<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.659> now<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.710> tube<00:01:59.070> would<00:01:59.250> go<00:01:59.460> into<00:01:59.700> a

actually very easy we're gonna be using

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.470 
actually very easy we're gonna be using
this<00:02:12.620> cup<00:02:13.620> right<00:02:13.800> here<00:02:13.830> right<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:15.180> this<00:02:15.330> is<00:02:15.450> a

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
this cup right here right so this is a

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.920 
this cup right here right so this is a
poem<00:02:15.780> for<00:02:16.110> veena<00:02:17.150> twelve<00:02:18.150> hours<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:18.600> you<00:02:18.780> can
