 soon teachers will go through several 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.579
 municipal schools to achieve more 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.680

 councilors is yet another attempt to 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.119
 anticipate the full implementation of 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.890
 career plan announced by 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.540
 town hall

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.750
 of teachers in the municipal network here 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.460
 from Curitiba 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.920
 according to the city hall half of 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.960
 schools did not take lessons yesterday 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.640
 that should be repeated today 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.310
 Let's go back and talk to Ricardo Freitas. 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.290
 now to find out what the orientation is 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:02.790
 for parents of students ricardo sou is the 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.299
 recommendation of the union of 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.060
 teachers is for parents to call 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.270
 schools to know if you will have a class today 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.270
 or not and so that they can not 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.490
 lose trip 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.100
 still according to the union the strike 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.950
 can take on an even larger dimension 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.320
 that strikers go to schools that do not 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.470
 joined the strike yesterday and will try to 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.960
 convince teachers to join 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.570
 them if this happens the number of 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:36.630
 schools can increase even more 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.630
 this day is 1 68
