00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
spawn and it's just really sucks and the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.270

killstreaks<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.080> control<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.799> feels

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
killstreaks that you control it feels

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.340 
killstreaks that you control it feels
like<00:01:11.490> they<00:01:11.640> go<00:01:11.850> way<00:01:12.090> too<00:01:12.150> fast<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:12.930> back<00:01:13.200> in

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
like they go way too fast so back in

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.810 
like they go way too fast so back in
modern<00:01:13.590> warfare<00:01:13.619> 3<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:14.280> for<00:01:14.430> instance<00:01:14.520> we

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
modern warfare 3 like for instance we

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.520 
modern warfare 3 like for instance we
had<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.030> reaper<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.869> would<00:01:15.990> shoot<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.409> and

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
had the reaper you would shoot it and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.530 
had the reaper you would shoot it and
that<00:01:17.159> bullets<00:01:17.520> would<00:01:17.610> go<00:01:17.759> kind<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.060> slow<00:01:18.299> but

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
that bullets would go kind of slow but

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.390 
that bullets would go kind of slow but
you<00:01:18.659> can<00:01:18.810> still<00:01:18.960> get<00:01:19.110> kills<00:01:19.380> with<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.189> if

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
you can still get kills with it so if

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.070 
you can still get kills with it so if
you<00:01:20.549> saw<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.790> big<00:01:21.090> ass<00:01:21.299> red<00:01:21.570> mark<00:01:21.810> coming

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
you saw that big ass red mark coming

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.679 
you saw that big ass red mark coming
your<00:01:22.290> way<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:23.070> had<00:01:23.280> time<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.850> run<00:01:24.060> around<00:01:24.210> and

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
your way you had time to run around and

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.469 
your way you had time to run around and
and<00:01:25.080> duck<00:01:25.710> for<00:01:25.920> cover<00:01:25.979> for<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> second<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.060> that

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
and duck for cover for a second and that

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.569 
and duck for cover for a second and that
was<00:01:27.659> part<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.049> game<00:01:28.290> but<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:29.070> black<00:01:29.250> ops<00:01:29.460> 2

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
was part of the game but in black ops 2

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.490 
was part of the game but in black ops 2
here<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.970> seems<00:01:30.180> like<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.570> just<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:31.049> no<00:01:31.290> go

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
here it seems like that is just a no go

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.940 
here it seems like that is just a no go
no<00:01:31.530> matter<00:01:31.829> what<00:01:32.360> really<00:01:33.360> sucks<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:33.960> also<00:01:34.500> it

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
no matter what really sucks so also it

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.399 
no matter what really sucks so also it
seems<00:01:35.189> like<00:01:35.369> everybody<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.570> camping<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.380> the

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
seems like everybody is camping in the

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.800 
seems like everybody is camping in the
game<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:38.310> just<00:01:38.640> absolutely<00:01:39.240> ridiculous

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
game it's just absolutely ridiculous

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.179 
game it's just absolutely ridiculous
well<00:01:39.990> let's<00:01:40.140> say<00:01:40.290> everybody<00:01:40.439> but<00:01:41.009> if<00:01:41.070> you're

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
well let's say everybody but if you're

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.160 
well let's say everybody but if you're
playing<00:01:41.340> 6v6<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:42.119> got<00:01:42.270> five<00:01:42.479> people<00:01:42.659> camping

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
playing 6v6 you got five people camping

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.420 
playing 6v6 you got five people camping
with<00:01:43.350> one<00:01:43.590> dude<00:01:43.799> running<00:01:44.009> around<00:01:44.280> with<00:01:44.369> a

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
with one dude running around with a

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.280 
with one dude running around with a
shotgun<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.600> can't<00:01:45.899> really<00:01:45.960> complain

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
shotgun so you can't really complain

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.560 
shotgun so you can't really complain
about<00:01:46.470> camping<00:01:46.979> but<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.280> seems<00:01:47.490> like<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.030> many

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
about camping but it seems like so many

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.810 
about camping but it seems like so many
people<00:01:48.960> are<00:01:49.049> doing<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.649> it's<00:01:50.399> just<00:01:50.640> I

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
people are doing it and it's just I

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.880 
people are doing it and it's just I
don't<00:01:50.909> know<00:01:51.060> why<00:01:51.299> people<00:01:51.329> feel<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.470> need<00:01:52.500> to

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
don't know why people feel the need to

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.770 
don't know why people feel the need to
camp<00:01:53.130> more<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.460> treyarch<00:01:53.939> than<00:01:54.180> they<00:01:54.299> do<00:01:54.360> and

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
camp more in treyarch than they do and

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.170 
camp more in treyarch than they do and
infinity<00:01:55.320> ward<00:01:55.530> games<00:01:55.740> but<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.340> seems<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.060> me

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
infinity ward games but it seems to me

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.870 
infinity ward games but it seems to me
like<00:01:57.210> that's<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.840> case<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.610> infinitely<00:01:59.610> more

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
like that's the case and infinitely more

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.670 
like that's the case and infinitely more
just<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.420> don't<00:02:00.509> know<00:02:00.719> what<00:02:00.960> they<00:02:01.110> do<00:02:01.170> but

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
just I don't know what they do but

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.350 
just I don't know what they do but
people<00:02:02.070> seem<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.310> rush<00:02:02.579> around<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.969> little<00:02:03.149> bit

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
people seem to rush around a little bit

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.539 
people seem to rush around a little bit
more<00:02:03.570> in<00:02:03.719> their<00:02:03.840> game<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.380> Treyarch<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.369> don't

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
more in their game so Treyarch I don't

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.100 
more in their game so Treyarch I don't
know<00:02:05.670> what<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.060> can<00:02:06.210> do<00:02:06.299> better<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.810> make<00:02:06.960> that

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
know what you can do better to make that

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.080 
know what you can do better to make that
happen<00:02:07.170> I'm<00:02:07.710> not<00:02:07.920> blaming<00:02:08.340> on<00:02:08.429> treyarch<00:02:08.819> but

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
happen I'm not blaming on treyarch but

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.570 
happen I'm not blaming on treyarch but
it<00:02:09.360> seems<00:02:09.869> like<00:02:09.989> that's<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.470> case<00:02:10.649> with<00:02:10.950> with

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
it seems like that's the case with with

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.290 
it seems like that's the case with with
their<00:02:11.760> games<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.420> people<00:02:12.690> can't

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
their games that people can't

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.900 
their games that people can't
more<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:14.440> gun<00:02:14.680> seemed<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.130> really<00:02:15.280> suck<00:02:15.700> with

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
more the gun seemed to really suck with

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.180 
more the gun seemed to really suck with
the<00:02:16.030> exception<00:02:16.480> of<00:02:16.570> a<00:02:16.690> few<00:02:16.720> guns<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.380> pdw-57

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
the exception of a few guns the pdw-57

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.400 
the exception of a few guns the pdw-57
and<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:20.230> mp7<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:21.280> I've<00:02:21.940> heard<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.480> m27<00:02:23.080> but<00:02:23.380> I

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
and the mp7 and I've heard the m27 but I

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.230 
and the mp7 and I've heard the m27 but I
used<00:02:23.710> that<00:02:23.800> gun<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.370> I<00:02:24.550> wasn't<00:02:24.850> very<00:02:25.030> good

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
used that gun and I wasn't very good

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.330 
used that gun and I wasn't very good
with<00:02:25.570> it<00:02:25.780> so<00:02:25.990> I'm<00:02:26.470> not<00:02:26.710> too<00:02:26.890> sure<00:02:27.040> what<00:02:27.220> they're

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
with it so I'm not too sure what they're

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.370 
with it so I'm not too sure what they're
talking<00:02:27.700> about<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:28.270> spawning<00:02:28.600> system<00:02:29.140> seems

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
talking about the spawning system seems

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.920 
talking about the spawning system seems
like<00:02:29.530> it<00:02:29.710> absolutely<00:02:30.100> sucks<00:02:30.490> so<00:02:30.790> if<00:02:31.270> I<00:02:31.600> kill

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
like it absolutely sucks so if I kill

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.480 
like it absolutely sucks so if I kill
somebody<00:02:32.170> they're<00:02:32.380> gonna<00:02:32.560> spawn<00:02:32.920> towards<00:02:33.340> me

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
somebody they're gonna spawn towards me

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.970 
somebody they're gonna spawn towards me
so<00:02:33.730> with<00:02:34.240> this<00:02:34.420> with<00:02:34.960> this<00:02:34.990> map<00:02:35.320> meltdown<00:02:35.740> I

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
so with this with this map meltdown I

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.380 
so with this with this map meltdown I
know<00:02:36.100> pretty<00:02:36.610> good<00:02:36.820> where<00:02:36.970> people<00:02:37.240> are<00:02:37.300> gonna

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
know pretty good where people are gonna

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.040 
know pretty good where people are gonna
be<00:02:37.540> spawning<00:02:37.840> at<00:02:38.160> so<00:02:39.160> if<00:02:39.340> they<00:02:39.490> kill<00:02:39.790> me<00:02:39.940> then<00:02:40.660> I

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
be spawning at so if they kill me then I

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.620 
be spawning at so if they kill me then I
can<00:02:41.260> spawn<00:02:41.530> back<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:42.130> hopefully<00:02:43.060> they<00:02:43.510> don't

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
can spawn back and hopefully they don't

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.780 
can spawn back and hopefully they don't
know<00:02:43.840> where<00:02:44.020> I'm<00:02:44.110> at<00:02:44.290> but<00:02:44.770> if<00:02:44.860> I<00:02:44.980> kill<00:02:45.220> them<00:02:45.490> and

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
know where I'm at but if I kill them and

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.670 
know where I'm at but if I kill them and
I<00:02:46.180> know<00:02:46.240> where<00:02:46.510> they're<00:02:46.630> gonna<00:02:46.720> spawn<00:02:47.080> usually

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
I know where they're gonna spawn usually

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.920 
I know where they're gonna spawn usually
I<00:02:47.860> can<00:02:48.100> run<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.550> that<00:02:48.670> spot<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.180> shoot<00:02:49.780> them

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
I can run to that spot and shoot them

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.230 
I can run to that spot and shoot them
again<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:50.500> hopefully<00:02:51.280> they<00:02:51.550> won't<00:02:51.760> know<00:02:51.940> but

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
again and hopefully they won't know but

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.290 
again and hopefully they won't know but
so<00:02:52.600> if<00:02:52.900> I<00:02:53.170> if<00:02:53.590> somebody<00:02:54.190> kills<00:02:54.430> me<00:02:54.580> it's

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
so if I if somebody kills me it's

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.790 
so if I if somebody kills me it's
usually<00:02:55.570> going<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:55.930> spawn<00:02:56.200> me<00:02:56.380> look<00:02:56.470> like<00:02:56.620> my

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
usually going to spawn me look like my

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.410 
usually going to spawn me look like my
back<00:02:57.100> to<00:02:57.310> them<00:02:57.460> right<00:02:57.640> in<00:02:57.790> front<00:02:58.060> of<00:02:58.150> them<00:02:58.270> or

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
back to them right in front of them or

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.290 
back to them right in front of them or
some<00:02:58.600> shit<00:02:58.810> like<00:02:58.840> that<00:02:58.990> and<00:02:59.520> I'm<00:03:00.520> instantly

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
some shit like that and I'm instantly

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.090 
some shit like that and I'm instantly
dead<00:03:01.540> again<00:03:01.840> so<00:03:02.080> it's<00:03:02.230> really<00:03:02.410> fucking<00:03:02.890> stupid

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
dead again so it's really fucking stupid

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.630 
dead again so it's really fucking stupid
and<00:03:04.090> also<00:03:04.690> there's<00:03:05.170> only<00:03:05.500> an<00:03:05.710> basically<00:03:06.310> an

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
and also there's only an basically an

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.520 
and also there's only an basically an
assault<00:03:07.300> kill<00:03:07.540> streak<00:03:07.780> like<00:03:07.930> we<00:03:08.080> had<00:03:08.230> modern

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
assault kill streak like we had modern

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.830 
assault kill streak like we had modern
warfare<00:03:08.680> 3<00:03:08.860> now<00:03:09.730> I<00:03:09.760> know<00:03:10.030> this<00:03:10.300> is<00:03:10.480> usually

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
warfare 3 now I know this is usually

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.900 
warfare 3 now I know this is usually
what<00:03:10.990> they've<00:03:11.170> done<00:03:11.350> with<00:03:11.410> treyarch<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.250> in

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
what they've done with treyarch and in

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.310 
what they've done with treyarch and in
modern<00:03:13.180> warfare<00:03:13.330> 3<00:03:13.480> that<00:03:13.780> was<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:13.960> first<00:03:14.170> time

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
modern warfare 3 that was the first time

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.840 
modern warfare 3 that was the first time
they<00:03:14.470> had<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.740> specialist<00:03:15.220> kill<00:03:15.400> streaks<00:03:15.640> and

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
they had the specialist kill streaks and

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.910 
they had the specialist kill streaks and
like<00:03:16.000> supports<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:16.690> stuff<00:03:16.870> like<00:03:16.990> that<00:03:17.050> so<00:03:17.440> we

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
like supports and stuff like that so we

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.560 
like supports and stuff like that so we
can't<00:03:18.160> get<00:03:18.310> any<00:03:18.489> more<00:03:18.700> perks<00:03:19.000> like<00:03:19.120> we<00:03:19.360> could

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
can't get any more perks like we could

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.870 
can't get any more perks like we could
before<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.200> infinity<00:03:21.040> ward's<00:03:21.310> modern

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
before and infinity ward's modern

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.050 
before and infinity ward's modern
warfare<00:03:22.060> 3<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:23.470> once<00:03:24.220> you<00:03:24.370> die<00:03:24.580> your<00:03:24.820> kill

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
warfare 3 so once you die your kill

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.970 
warfare 3 so once you die your kill
streaks<00:03:25.300> over<00:03:25.510> so<00:03:26.410> if<00:03:26.590> you're<00:03:26.709> trying<00:03:26.890> to

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
streaks over so if you're trying to

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.890 
streaks over so if you're trying to
build<00:03:27.190> up<00:03:27.280> a<00:03:27.370> kill<00:03:27.489> streak<00:03:27.610> and<00:03:27.850> you<00:03:27.910> die<00:03:28.090> it's

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
build up a kill streak and you die it's

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.000 
build up a kill streak and you die it's
pretty<00:03:29.080> much<00:03:29.170> done<00:03:29.230> with<00:03:29.560> you<00:03:29.650> guys<00:03:29.770> start

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
pretty much done with you guys start

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.770 
pretty much done with you guys start
over<00:03:30.220> again<00:03:30.280> so<00:03:30.850> that's<00:03:31.510> an<00:03:31.660> advantage

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
over again so that's an advantage

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.960 
over again so that's an advantage
sometimes<00:03:32.380> but<00:03:32.860> that's<00:03:32.890> also<00:03:33.190> a<00:03:33.310> disadvantage

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
sometimes but that's also a disadvantage

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.150 
sometimes but that's also a disadvantage
to<00:03:34.180> people<00:03:34.480> who<00:03:34.690> would<00:03:35.380> like<00:03:35.560> to<00:03:35.590> get<00:03:35.920> their

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
to people who would like to get their

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.860 
to people who would like to get their
kill<00:03:36.400> streaks<00:03:36.670> and<00:03:36.910> also<00:03:37.330> we<00:03:37.450> can't<00:03:37.660> get<00:03:37.780> the

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
kill streaks and also we can't get the

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.690 
kill streaks and also we can't get the
perks<00:03:38.020> like<00:03:38.140> we<00:03:38.350> did<00:03:38.500> before<00:03:38.590> that<00:03:39.340> was<00:03:39.489> pretty

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
perks like we did before that was pretty

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.270 
perks like we did before that was pretty
much<00:03:39.850> fun<00:03:40.120> there's<00:03:40.780> too<00:03:40.959> much<00:03:41.140> stuff<00:03:41.380> to<00:03:41.590> me<00:03:41.860> it

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
much fun there's too much stuff to me it

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.970 
much fun there's too much stuff to me it

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019

thing is the game seems like it freezes
all<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.320> time<00:04:11.530> i<00:04:11.739> don't<00:04:11.920> know<00:04:11.980> if<00:04:12.010> this<00:04:12.160> is

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
all the time i don't know if this is

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.030 
all the time i don't know if this is
just<00:04:12.370> for<00:04:12.670> me<00:04:12.730> i<00:04:13.060> doubt<00:04:13.630> it<00:04:13.870> because<00:04:14.410> i've<00:04:14.800> had

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
just for me i doubt it because i've had

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.259 
just for me i doubt it because i've had
a<00:04:15.070> couple<00:04:15.160> other<00:04:15.550> people<00:04:15.850> say<00:04:16.030> that<00:04:16.209> it's

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
a couple other people say that it's

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.570 
a couple other people say that it's
happened<00:04:16.690> to<00:04:16.750> them<00:04:16.870> also<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.890> game<00:04:18.130> seems<00:04:18.430> to

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
happened to them also the game seems to

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.430 
happened to them also the game seems to
freeze<00:04:18.820> whenever<00:04:19.239> it's<00:04:19.419> like<00:04:19.600> connecting<00:04:20.109> to

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
freeze whenever it's like connecting to

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.219 
freeze whenever it's like connecting to
a<00:04:21.190> lobby<00:04:21.850> or<00:04:22.120> whatever<00:04:22.450> and<00:04:22.720> it<00:04:22.900> just<00:04:23.080> sits

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
a lobby or whatever and it just sits

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.050 
a lobby or whatever and it just sits
there<00:04:23.289> and<00:04:23.410> freeze

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
there and freeze

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.480 
there and freeze
and<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.330> goes<00:04:24.540> forever<00:04:24.900> before<00:04:25.800> it's<00:04:26.130> actually

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
and it goes forever before it's actually

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.090 
and it goes forever before it's actually
fixed<00:04:26.880> so<00:04:27.810> those<00:04:28.110> are<00:04:28.139> pretty<00:04:28.560> much<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:28.800> cause

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
fixed so those are pretty much the cause

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.010 
fixed so those are pretty much the cause
i<00:04:29.310> can<00:04:29.490> think<00:04:29.610> about<00:04:29.730> this<00:04:30.000> game<00:04:30.270> which<00:04:30.600> kind

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
i can think about this game which kind

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.810 
i can think about this game which kind
of<00:04:31.110> ruins<00:04:31.470> it<00:04:31.590> for<00:04:31.620> me<00:04:31.800> so<00:04:32.070> i'm<00:04:32.160> not<00:04:32.280> sure<00:04:32.340> now

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
of ruins it for me so i'm not sure now

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.350 
of ruins it for me so i'm not sure now
the<00:04:32.880> last<00:04:33.240> thing<00:04:33.450> that<00:04:33.919> kind<00:04:34.919> of<00:04:35.120> makes<00:04:36.120> me

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
the last thing that kind of makes me

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.000 
the last thing that kind of makes me
feel<00:04:36.570> good<00:04:36.840> about<00:04:36.960> this<00:04:37.200> game<00:04:37.440> there's<00:04:37.740> couple

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
everybody at once that's really good for

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.140
