 The next Trailer is listed as H ... by Honest 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:12.330
 the storytelling of Halo, the scope of World of Warcraft 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.290
 and the Borderlands cooperative fun ... ... may come eventually ... 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.439
 but until then prepare for a game with a rating of 77 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.360
 Play through the video game with beautiful picture 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.520
 full of decoration Chi by Kia And of an MMO with hardly any of the social functions. 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.820
 Shooting multiplayer and with zero matchmaking 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.380
 and the single player game with around a week value of occasional content 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.590
 but if you can stay for a long time this FPS ... 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.590
 MMO RPG promises to solve all those problems with three more lucrative letters ... 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.720
 DLC 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.440
 Chachin! 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.100
 Become a guardian of the galaxy 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.960
 no no not those who are cool with personalities 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.860
 These guys 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.040
 presenting three races that have zero difference and three classes that make a 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.700
 very slight difference once every few minutes 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.700
 explore the solar system with an even smaller version of Peter Dinklage 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.260
 in the worst performance of a good actor since Bill Murray appeared in Ghostbusters 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.360
 "So this was the gadget that is supposed to feed the destructive form of energy ..." 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.360
 Try to get excited 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.270
 with a completely bored Tyrion Lannister while he delivers explanation 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.670
 "The more we learn about the photos, the more I understand why the friend XO is so worried" 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.540
 "During the collapse 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.680
 they transformed the planet Mercury into a machine in days ... " 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.500
 can I skip this? 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.000
 "We need to enter the black curtain" 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.840
 "We need a door for Ted" 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.060
 Be patient while he does something 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.540
 "This will take some time" "when they enter here they will enter into command" 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.049
 "Make sure you're ready" 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.480
 "Well, if they do not come yet, they'll come now" 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.580
 yyyy ... eeh, yes, that's all ... I'm sorry Dingle-Bot ... you suck 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.060
 Embark on a single player campaign 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.660
 about the protection of the sick magical space orb 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.219
 and if for some reason you want to know more about that silly story 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:06.299
 unlocks the full queue by collecting special cards, 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.019
 Leave the game, enter Bungie.net, 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.960
 and reads page after page of background story 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.319
 seriously? nobody is going to do that 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.019
 experience the real game when your Guardian reaches level 20 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.459
 when you go to fight against the forces of evil 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.760
 to fight system forces random number generator circuit 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.980
 When getting the best items will not depend on your skill or the rudeness of your enemies. 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.879
 in the game is for fucking color codes because of how good the kitchen items are 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.518
 green, what the fuck? I do not care if they have to patch it or not 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.539
 add this to make the beta better 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.460
 Fuck Quick Dark !! GHURRRR 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.500
 so you climb into the wagon while everyone whines and complains about a game we still can not stop playing 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.650
 full of stunning visual effects of incredible music and addictive gameplay 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.889
 but when you know that your game cost more than the GDP of many countries to develop 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:56.529
 it's better that you at least let me sell items with other players 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.140
 How hard is it to do that from the beginning? Fuck! 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.860
 ESTELARIZAN 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:01.940

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.840
 Cortana 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.700
 and Master Chief 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.299
 Border Halo-Lands of Warcraft Online 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.060
 I have no idea why I keep playing this! 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.410

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.140
 "I'll find you and I'll hug you" 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.140
 "Leeewwwtt" 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.120
 "Very Kawai to live, very sugoi to die" 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.760
 "That's what she said!" 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.019
 "If you knock me down I should become more powerful than you can possibly imagine" 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.410
 "Objection"
