but<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.910> course<00:01:32.970> I've<00:01:33.480> developed<00:01:33.900> one<00:01:34.260> of<00:01:34.380> my

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
but of course I've developed one of my

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.790 
but of course I've developed one of my
own<00:01:34.650> theories<00:01:35.190> I<00:01:36.320> believe<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.350> Josh<00:01:37.770> was

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
own theories I believe that Josh was

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.650 
own theories I believe that Josh was
just<00:01:38.190> overwhelmed<00:01:38.700> but<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.030> fact<00:01:39.300> that<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
just overwhelmed but the fact that the

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.390 
just overwhelmed but the fact that the
months<00:01:39.960> were<00:01:40.080> passing<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:40.710> quickly<00:01:41.190> that<00:01:41.220> he

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
months were passing so quickly that he

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.710 
months were passing so quickly that he
wasn't<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.090> be<00:01:42.180> finished<00:01:42.360> with<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
wasn't going to be finished with the

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.260 
wasn't going to be finished with the
game<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.140> time<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.710> he<00:01:43.830> went<00:01:43.980> quiet<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.640> he

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
game in time so he went quiet and he

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.610 
game in time so he went quiet and he
felt<00:01:45.510> there<00:01:45.660> was<00:01:45.750> no<00:01:45.870> reason<00:01:46.230> to<00:01:46.260> update

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
felt there was no reason to update

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.870 
felt there was no reason to update
anyone<00:01:46.950> because<00:01:47.250> he<00:01:47.340> was<00:01:47.430> boarding<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.760> so

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
anyone because he was boarding it so

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.800 
anyone because he was boarding it so
hard<00:01:48.350> that's<00:01:49.350> my<00:01:49.650> theory<00:01:49.920> because<00:01:50.520> really<00:01:51.390> he

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
hard that's my theory because really he

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.300 
hard that's my theory because really he
did<00:01:52.020> say<00:01:52.320> he<00:01:52.530> was<00:01:52.620> working<00:01:52.980> i'm<00:01:53.070> going<00:01:53.220> to

did say he was working i'm going to

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.020 
did say he was working i'm going to
