00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
this but space simulation yeah this is

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.570 
this but space simulation yeah this is
untold<00:00:18.359> universe<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:19.500> untold<00:00:19.949> universe<00:00:20.369> is

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580

might be in the future and yeah keep
that<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.550> mind<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:26.880> very<00:00:27.180> early<00:00:27.480> access

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
that in mind this is very early access

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.509 
that in mind this is very early access
there's<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.529> lot<00:00:28.680> that's<00:00:28.859> not<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.250> game<00:00:29.490> a

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
there's a lot that's not in the game a

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.849 
there's a lot that's not in the game a
lots<00:00:29.820> gonna<00:00:29.939> change<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.630> be<00:00:30.869> upgraded<00:00:31.439> etc

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
lots gonna change and be upgraded etc

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.709 
lots gonna change and be upgraded etc
etc<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.460> know<00:00:32.610> take<00:00:32.820> my<00:00:32.969> first<00:00:33.329> impression

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
etc so you know take my first impression

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.420 
etc so you know take my first impression
with<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> grain<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.050> salt<00:00:34.170> if<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.530> will<00:00:34.739> anyway

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
with a grain of salt if you will anyway

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.430 
with a grain of salt if you will anyway
so<00:00:35.489> until<00:00:35.940> universe<00:00:36.390> basically<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.200> core

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
so until universe basically the core

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.830 
so until universe basically the core
gameplay<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.280> crafting<00:00:39.059> up<00:00:39.210> difference<00:00:39.719> I

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
gameplay is crafting up difference I

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.569 
gameplay is crafting up difference I
guess<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.079> could<00:00:40.110> say<00:00:40.260> basis<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.100> making

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
guess you could say basis and making

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.610 
guess you could say basis and making
these<00:00:41.670> different<00:00:42.120> machines<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.350> can

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
these different machines so that you can

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.740 
these different machines so that you can
create<00:00:43.860> better<00:00:44.250> spaceships<00:00:44.969> or<00:00:45.120> just

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
create better spaceships or just

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.240 
create better spaceships or just
spaceships<00:00:46.079> in<00:00:46.230> general<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.980> game<00:00:47.160> actually

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
spaceships in general this game actually

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.100 
spaceships in general this game actually
reminds<00:00:47.700> me<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.059> mod<00:00:48.360> or<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> couple<00:00:49.020> of

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
reminds me of a mod or a couple of

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.170 
reminds me of a mod or a couple of
modifications<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:50.010> minecraft<00:00:50.610> where<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.030> can

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
modifications to minecraft where you can

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.610 
modifications to minecraft where you can
create<00:00:51.360> spaceships<00:00:51.930> or<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.199> can<00:00:52.379> actually

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
create spaceships or you can actually

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.220 
create spaceships or you can actually
create<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:53.100> mining<00:00:53.699> rigs<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.300> so<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.079> game

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
create a mining rigs and so this game

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.510 
create a mining rigs and so this game
kind<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.469> takes<00:00:55.620> elements<00:00:55.860> from<00:00:56.280> those

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
kind of takes elements from those

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.279 
kind of takes elements from those
modifications<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.270> Minecraft<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:58.140> kind

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
modifications of Minecraft and just kind

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.840 
modifications of Minecraft and just kind
of<00:00:58.320> puts<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.620> into<00:00:58.739> its<00:00:58.949> game<00:00:59.160> but<00:00:59.460> yeah<00:00:59.579> like<00:00:59.789> I

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
of puts it into its game but yeah like I

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.549 
of puts it into its game but yeah like I
said<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.180> doesn't<00:01:00.210> have<00:01:00.480> any<00:01:00.600> PvE<00:01:00.930> elements<00:01:01.469> so

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
said it doesn't have any PvE elements so

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.260

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.359 
shooting lasers pew pew photon rockets I
don't<00:01:22.200> know<00:01:22.259> sadly<00:01:22.830> during<00:01:23.130> my<00:01:23.220> first

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
don't know sadly during my first

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.740 
don't know sadly during my first
impression<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.820> didn't<00:01:24.030> find<00:01:24.150> any<00:01:24.420> players

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
impression I didn't find any players

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.270 
impression I didn't find any players
playing<00:01:25.020> right<00:01:25.259> now<00:01:25.290> but<00:01:25.860> what<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.009> can<00:01:26.250> tell

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
playing right now but what I can tell

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.950 
playing right now but what I can tell
you<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.759> some<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.330> physics<00:01:27.720> are

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
you is that some of the physics are

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.289 
you is that some of the physics are
really<00:01:28.680> bogged<00:01:28.860> down<00:01:28.979> your<00:01:29.159> machine

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
really bogged down your machine

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.280 
really bogged down your machine
hopefully<00:01:30.299> there<00:01:30.420> will<00:01:30.540> be<00:01:30.600> options<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.140> turn

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
hopefully there will be options to turn

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.480 
hopefully there will be options to turn
that<00:01:31.409> down<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:31.740> right<00:01:31.890> now<00:01:32.040> there's<00:01:32.250> very

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
that down but right now there's very

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.520 
that down but right now there's very
limited<00:01:32.759> graphical<00:01:33.390> settings<00:01:33.570> however<00:01:34.470> I

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
limited graphical settings however I

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.840 
limited graphical settings however I
can't<00:01:34.740> say<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.100> doesn't<00:01:35.400> look<00:01:35.490> horrible

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
can't say that it doesn't look horrible

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.340 
can't say that it doesn't look horrible
and<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.090> does<00:01:36.270> run<00:01:36.479> okay<00:01:36.840> just<00:01:37.110> some<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.290> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
and it does run okay just some of the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.270 
and it does run okay just some of the
physics<00:01:37.650> whenever<00:01:37.920> you're<00:01:38.040> destroying

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
physics whenever you're destroying

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.310 
physics whenever you're destroying
blocks<00:01:38.610> makes<00:01:39.210> everything<00:01:39.600> kind<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.960> choppy

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
blocks makes everything kind of choppy

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.800 
blocks makes everything kind of choppy
but<00:01:40.770> yeah<00:01:40.890> if<00:01:41.100> minecraft<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.759> square<00:01:42.240> then

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
but yeah if minecraft is square then

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.719 
but yeah if minecraft is square then
this<00:01:43.020> game<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.560> rectangle<00:01:44.159> it's<00:01:44.549> kind<00:01:44.700> of

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
this game is rectangle it's kind of

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.190 
this game is rectangle it's kind of
interesting<00:01:44.939> how<00:01:45.210> all<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.600> blocks<00:01:45.930> are

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
interesting how all the blocks are

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.929 
interesting how all the blocks are
rectangular<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:47.130> shape<00:01:47.159> making<00:01:47.579> everything

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
rectangular in shape making everything

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.249 
rectangular in shape making everything
just<00:01:48.210> like<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.659> know<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> little<00:01:48.960> bit<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.200> a

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
just like it you know a little bit of a

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.990 
just like it you know a little bit of a
unique<00:01:49.710> twist<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.280> whole<00:01:50.430> block<00:01:50.759> art

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
unique twist to the whole block art

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.789 
unique twist to the whole block art
style<00:01:51.270> because<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.110> know<00:01:52.140> long<00:01:52.409> blocks

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
style because it's you know long blocks

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.200 
style because it's you know long blocks
I<00:01:52.979> don't<00:01:53.130> know<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:53.820> something<00:01:53.970> i<00:01:54.119> noticed

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
I don't know it's something i noticed

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.060 
I don't know it's something i noticed
and<00:01:54.659> i<00:01:54.689> think<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:54.990> was<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.140> cool<00:01:55.320> idea<00:01:55.500> there's

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
and i think it was a cool idea there's

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.889 
and i think it was a cool idea there's
also<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.369> first<00:01:56.670> person<00:01:56.939> shooter<00:01:57.149> element<00:01:57.780> to

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
also a first person shooter element to

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.690 
also a first person shooter element to
the<00:01:58.020> game<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.530> do<00:01:58.680> have<00:01:58.829> like<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.009> little<00:01:59.369> laser

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
the game you do have like a little laser

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.719 
the game you do have like a little laser
shooter<00:02:00.570> thing<00:02:01.020> up<00:02:01.290> good<00:02:01.860> shoot<00:02:02.130> blocks<00:02:02.460> with

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
shooter thing up good shoot blocks with

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.580 
shooter thing up good shoot blocks with
our<00:02:02.759> people<00:02:03.299> but<00:02:03.630> truly<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.170> true<00:02:04.350> combat

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
our people but truly the true combat

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.319 
our people but truly the true combat
comes<00:02:04.950> from<00:02:05.219> piloting<00:02:05.729> different<00:02:06.000> vehicles

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
comes from piloting different vehicles

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.670 
comes from piloting different vehicles
and<00:02:06.540> what<00:02:06.659> i<00:02:06.689> would<00:02:06.869> love<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.259> see<00:02:07.409> from<00:02:07.560> this

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
and what i would love to see from this

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.499 
and what i would love to see from this
game<00:02:07.890> would<00:02:08.580> be<00:02:08.640> different<00:02:09.209> kind<00:02:09.420> of

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
game would be different kind of

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.150 
game would be different kind of
spaceships<00:02:10.050> bigger<00:02:10.530> Longer<00:02:10.979> more

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
spaceships bigger Longer more

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.740 
spaceships bigger Longer more
customization<00:02:11.910> i<00:02:12.060> would<00:02:12.239> like<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.420> see<00:02:12.569> maybe

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
customization i would like to see maybe

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.490 
customization i would like to see maybe
even<00:02:13.020> not<00:02:13.230> even

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
even not even

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.440 
even not even
spaceships<00:02:13.980> maybe<00:02:14.460> if<00:02:14.610> we<00:02:14.640> could<00:02:14.910> get<00:02:15.060> like

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
spaceships maybe if we could get like

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.660 
spaceships maybe if we could get like
boats<00:02:15.990> of<00:02:16.230> some<00:02:16.440> kind<00:02:16.710> if<00:02:17.100> we<00:02:17.160> can<00:02:17.280> get<00:02:17.370> like

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
boats of some kind if we can get like

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.760 
boats of some kind if we can get like
walking<00:02:18.210> machines<00:02:18.600> or<00:02:18.840> armored<00:02:19.230> mex<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.620> don't

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
walking machines or armored mex I don't

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.050 
walking machines or armored mex I don't
know<00:02:19.830> honestly<00:02:20.190> I<00:02:20.490> would<00:02:20.700> love<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.850> see<00:02:21.030> all

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
know honestly I would love to see all

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.280 
know honestly I would love to see all
sorts<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.450> different<00:02:21.600> kind<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:21.930> vehicles<00:02:22.230> from

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
sorts of different kind of vehicles from

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.170 
sorts of different kind of vehicles from
this<00:02:22.470> game<00:02:22.620> if<00:02:22.830> we<00:02:23.040> could<00:02:23.340> have<00:02:23.460> like<00:02:23.640> giant

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
this game if we could have like giant

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.940 
this game if we could have like giant
Cruiser<00:02:24.630> ships<00:02:24.900> in<00:02:25.110> space<00:02:25.260> that'd<00:02:25.620> be<00:02:25.770> cool

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
Cruiser ships in space that'd be cool

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.850 
Cruiser ships in space that'd be cool
too<00:02:26.160> but<00:02:26.880> overall<00:02:27.210> flying<00:02:27.840> was<00:02:28.260> just<00:02:28.620> only<00:02:28.770> a

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
too but overall flying was just only a

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.260 
too but overall flying was just only a
little<00:02:29.100> bit<00:02:29.250> awkward<00:02:29.370> but<00:02:29.850> apparently

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
little bit awkward but apparently

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.820 
little bit awkward but apparently
there's<00:02:30.450> going<00:02:30.570> to<00:02:30.630> be<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.750> fixed<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:31.440> sort<00:02:31.680> of

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
there's going to be a fixed to sort of

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:32.990 
there's going to be a fixed to sort of
the<00:02:31.890> physics<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.400> everything<00:02:32.700> like<00:02:32.820> you

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
the physics and everything like you

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.120 
the physics and everything like you
should<00:02:33.270> be<00:02:33.420> able<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.780> crash<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.350> explode<00:02:34.770> and

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
should be able to crash and explode and

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.860 
should be able to crash and explode and
destroy<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.970> terrain<00:02:36.240> around<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.690> whenever

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
destroy the terrain around you whenever

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.440 
destroy the terrain around you whenever
you<00:02:37.020> do<00:02:37.200> fall<00:02:37.440> from<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.070> sky<00:02:38.330> hopefully<00:02:39.330> we

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
you do fall from the sky hopefully we

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.910 
you do fall from the sky hopefully we
will<00:02:39.600> get<00:02:39.750> more<00:02:39.959> physics<00:02:40.410> updates<00:02:40.770> and

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
will get more physics updates and

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.840 
will get more physics updates and
everything<00:02:41.190> hopefully<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:41.580> becomes

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
everything hopefully this becomes

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.400 
everything hopefully this becomes
actually<00:02:42.150> like<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.300> solid<00:02:42.870> kind<00:02:43.050> of<00:02:43.110> shooter

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
actually like a solid kind of shooter

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.050 
actually like a solid kind of shooter
experience<00:02:44.070> or<00:02:44.220> at<00:02:44.400> least<00:02:44.610> an<00:02:44.730> action

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
experience or at least an action

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.580 
experience or at least an action
experience<00:02:45.450> because<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.080> crafting<00:02:46.440> and

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
experience because the crafting and

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.110 
experience because the crafting and
everything<00:02:46.890> is<00:02:46.950> not<00:02:47.070> exactly<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.489> strong<00:02:47.880> point

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
everything is not exactly a strong point

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.420 
everything is not exactly a strong point
it's<00:02:48.390> PvE<00:02:48.720> element<00:02:49.350> yeah<00:02:49.770> it's<00:02:49.920> not<00:02:50.070> exactly

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
it's PvE element yeah it's not exactly

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.070 
it's PvE element yeah it's not exactly
there<00:02:50.640> it's<00:02:50.760> no<00:02:50.880> Minecraft<00:02:51.420> but<00:02:51.570> as<00:02:52.020> a

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
there it's no Minecraft but as a

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.020 
there it's no Minecraft but as a
multiplayer<00:02:52.800> game<00:02:52.830> even<00:02:53.670> maybe<00:02:53.820> with<00:02:54.000> a

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
multiplayer game even maybe with a

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.760 
multiplayer game even maybe with a
competitive<00:02:54.540> mindset<00:02:54.840> I<00:02:55.110> could<00:02:55.260> see<00:02:55.380> guilds

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
competitive mindset I could see guilds

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.890 
competitive mindset I could see guilds
making<00:02:56.130> bases<00:02:56.520> on<00:02:56.700> certain<00:02:56.970> planets<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.510> kind

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
making bases on certain planets and kind

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.810 
making bases on certain planets and kind
of<00:02:57.989> holding<00:02:58.320> certain<00:02:58.620> parts<00:02:58.890> of<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.160> solar

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
of holding certain parts of a solar

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.460 
of holding certain parts of a solar
systems<00:03:00.239> I<00:03:00.390> don't<00:03:00.570> know<00:03:00.630> stop<00:03:00.840> stop<00:03:01.200> something

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
systems I don't know stop stop something

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.630 
systems I don't know stop stop something
like<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:01.800> I<00:03:01.920> think<00:03:02.160> stuff<00:03:02.310> like<00:03:02.370> that<00:03:02.459> would

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
like that I think stuff like that would

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.850 
like that I think stuff like that would
be<00:03:02.730> cool<00:03:02.940> but<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.660> know<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:03.959> is<00:03:03.989> a<00:03:04.140> niche<00:03:04.530> game

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
be cool but you know it is a niche game

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.410 
be cool but you know it is a niche game
and<00:03:05.190> at<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.520> same<00:03:05.670> time<00:03:05.910> even<00:03:06.209> though<00:03:06.270> its

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
and at the same time even though its

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.000 
and at the same time even though its
niche<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:06.810> still<00:03:07.020> kind<00:03:07.230> of<00:03:07.290> flourishes<00:03:07.770> on<00:03:07.800> a

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
niche it still kind of flourishes on a

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.370 
niche it still kind of flourishes on a
multiplayer<00:03:08.550> presence<00:03:08.970> so<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.930> needs<00:03:10.200> some

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
multiplayer presence so it needs some

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.110 
multiplayer presence so it needs some
attention<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.830> need<00:03:10.980> some<00:03:11.160> more<00:03:11.580> players<00:03:11.850> it

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
attention to need some more players it

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
attention to need some more players it
definitely<00:03:12.390> needs<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.540> player<00:03:12.690> base<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.050> as

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
definitely needs a player base and as

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.870 
definitely needs a player base and as
you<00:03:13.230> see<00:03:13.380> from<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.739> footage<00:03:14.040> here<00:03:14.550> it's<00:03:14.730> not

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
you see from the footage here it's not

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.160 
you see from the footage here it's not
terribly<00:03:15.420> exciting<00:03:15.780> because<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:16.020> actually

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
terribly exciting because I actually

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.990 
terribly exciting because I actually
couldn't<00:03:16.470> find<00:03:16.680> any<00:03:16.830> player<00:03:17.040> so<00:03:17.310> this<00:03:17.730> game

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
couldn't find any player so this game

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.310 
couldn't find any player so this game
definitely<00:03:18.180> has<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.540> reliance<00:03:19.019> on<00:03:19.140> its

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
start of the game really boring and I

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.020 
start of the game really boring and I
think<00:03:26.310> its<00:03:26.400> end<00:03:26.549> game<00:03:26.670> has<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:26.850> lot<00:03:27.000> of

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
think its end game has a lot of

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.130 
think its end game has a lot of
potential<00:03:27.330> but<00:03:27.480> it's<00:03:27.690> definitely<00:03:27.810> gonna<00:03:28.049> need

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
potential but it's definitely gonna need

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.050 
potential but it's definitely gonna need
to<00:03:28.350> be<00:03:28.470> wider<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:28.980> bigger<00:03:29.040> but<00:03:29.640> then<00:03:29.760> again<00:03:29.850> we

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
to be wider and bigger but then again we

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.820 
to be wider and bigger but then again we
saw<00:03:30.180> how<00:03:30.299> minecraft<00:03:30.720> started<00:03:31.049> right<00:03:31.200> like<00:03:31.560> we

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830

the<00:03:37.980> huge<00:03:38.310> plethora<00:03:38.670> of<00:03:38.730> mods<00:03:38.970> so<00:03:39.299> this<00:03:39.780> game

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
the huge plethora of mods so this game

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.229 
the huge plethora of mods so this game
has<00:03:40.170> infinite<00:03:40.650> potential<00:03:41.160> I<00:03:41.340> think<00:03:42.030> it's<00:03:42.120> off

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
has infinite potential I think it's off

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.930 
has infinite potential I think it's off
to<00:03:42.390> a<00:03:42.420> rocky<00:03:42.690> start<00:03:42.900> but<00:03:43.470> it's<00:03:44.310> definitely<00:03:44.640> a

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
to a rocky start but it's definitely a

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.160 
to a rocky start but it's definitely a
little<00:03:45.090> bit<00:03:45.299> more<00:03:45.390> interesting<00:03:45.840> than<00:03:46.049> the

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
little bit more interesting than the

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.470 
little bit more interesting than the
