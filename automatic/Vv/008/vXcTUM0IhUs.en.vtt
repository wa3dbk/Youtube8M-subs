00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello welcome to hardware advice in 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.610
 this video the update of the 1800 euro 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.820
 gaming computers june 2014 as a processor 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.759
 the intel core i7 4290 came with four times 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.060
 40 gigahertz he has a day of 4 4 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.460
 gigahertz 88 watt tdp an integrated 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.480
 Graphikinheit your km took that 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.220
 means he had a free one 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.619
 multiplier too free to overclock 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.689
 and hyperthreading that means everyone 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.820
 came as a white what so theoretical 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.009
 8 core of the processor very very good for 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.420
 Overclock suitable number of for gamers 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.460
 the next three to five years yet 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.829
 thick enough if he gets too weak 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.680
 you can overclock him as a processor 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.780
 cooler the mining 3 it is a very 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.160
 strong and big processor cooler and 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.379
 with that is quiet and operate 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.770
 overclocking possible and as mainboard that 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.340
 asus maximus 7 hero with the internet 90 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.300
 chipset 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.510
 it has usb3 sata 3 43 ram banks pci 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.430
 express 3.0 a two-wheeler and a 10.1 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.859
 soundchip it has many gaming features 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.350
 is to overclock and has so 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:09.180
 pretty much the best wave ii currently under 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.130
 Europe only 122 x usb 2 hdmi vga and dvi 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.130
 for the integrated graphics unit of the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.340
 processors four times usb 3 a lan socket 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.930
 and 6 3 5 mm pawls as well as a toast 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.000
 link for the soundchip one as 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.540
 Memory 16 gigabytes crucial 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.930
 ballistix port ddr3 1600 c9 is right 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.580
 fast 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.590
 it's a through it which means you can 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.079
 operate in the dual channel mode and 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.700
 16gb winter time alone for gaming something 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.229
 exaggerated and dares so in the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.920
 For the time being, do not worry about the 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.500
 making drum as the ssd 512 gb cuddly 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.509
 mx 100 it's a number fast ssd 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.090
 a little faster than the crucial m 500 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.399
 and 512 gb should work for most 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.220
 then still enough as a data port the 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.600
 two gigabytes of desktop hdd it is one 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.970
 became average fast hard disk 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.189
 and 2 terabyte should be for almost really 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.579
 each sufficient as a graphics card the 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.159
 three gigabytes in 3d geforce gtx 480 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.619
 it's a very overclocked gtx 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.360
 What did she or one of the strongest ones do ? 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.039
 graphics cards currently on the market 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.140
 and then not it to the huge cooler 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.819
 too loud she should be any current 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.140
 game one at the highest settings 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.180
 can represent liquid 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.400
 In addition, there are still hot from the media 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.270
 stocks for free and the power supply that 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.590
 550 watt peak power process has 80 plus 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.400
 Gold water is it is very 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.200
 energy saving 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.459
 it fits modular one will not 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.830
 You do not lose the cables anymore 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.020
 needs and 550 watts are for the pc 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.510
 more than enough there is still a dvd burner 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.580
 from asus unheils housing the rectal 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.770
 Design the fein a4 in pc games 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.690
 hardware edition it is pretty bad 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.370
 offers a lot of space and is on the 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.050
 but specialized in volume insulation 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.970
 Of course you are allowed to decide for yourself 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.890
 which she wanted to accept and still as 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.350
 Cradle three times the be quiet 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.970
 silent wings 2 they are very high quality 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.730
 high quality and have a super performance 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.470
 slot strength ratio and there were 5 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.940
 volt and 7 volts set off with it 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.570
 To turn the ventilation even slower 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.370
 can let 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.140
 I recommend it but first with the fan 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.459
 to control the mainboard then thank you 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.480
 i watch for myself i hope that 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.760
 everyone liked you 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.019
 if there is video older than two months in 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.250
 the description will look there on the 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.630
 click on each link 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.820
 this I would always to the latest 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.820
 version then until the next video
