all right so tell us about skip fire and

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.459 
all right so tell us about skip fire and
HP<00:01:06.420> 2g<00:01:06.840> well<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:09.289> variable<00:01:10.289> displacement

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:10.469 
HP 2g well it's a variable displacement

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:14.060 
HP 2g well it's a variable displacement
for<00:01:11.189> semis<00:01:12.020> diesel<00:01:13.020> mm-hmm<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:13.890> we're

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
for semis diesel mm-hmm so we're

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.190 
for semis diesel mm-hmm so we're
shutting<00:01:14.429> off<00:01:14.579> so<00:01:14.939> nurs<00:01:15.149> rotating<00:01:15.749> cylinders

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
shutting off so nurs rotating cylinders

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.550 
shutting off so nurs rotating cylinders
of<00:01:16.229> fire<00:01:16.619> okay<00:01:17.579> still<00:01:18.479> keeps<00:01:18.749> the<00:01:18.869> turbo

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
of fire okay still keeps the turbo

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.209 
of fire okay still keeps the turbo
moving<00:01:20.039> the<00:01:20.249> air<00:01:20.520> still<00:01:20.880> goes<00:01:21.119> through<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:22.219 
moving the air still goes through the

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:26.300 
moving the air still goes through the
engine<00:01:23.219> that<00:01:24.119> air<00:01:24.810> expands<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.950> cylinder

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
engine that air expands in that cylinder

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.989 
engine that air expands in that cylinder
that<00:01:26.640> just<00:01:26.939> fired<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.350> pushes<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.520> piston

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:29.999 
that just fired so it pushes that piston

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:32.270 
that just fired so it pushes that piston
okay<00:01:30.719> so<00:01:30.780> it's<00:01:30.960> really<00:01:31.109> important<00:01:31.679> if<00:01:31.799> you're

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
okay so it's really important if you're

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.169 
okay so it's really important if you're
going<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.429> do<00:01:32.579> something<00:01:32.609> that<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.030> got<00:01:33.149> to

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
going to do something that you got to

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:34.730 
going to do something that you got to
keep<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.479> turbo<00:01:33.780> spooled<00:01:34.109> up<00:01:34.259> because<00:01:34.560> what<00:01:34.679> a

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
keep a turbo spooled up because what a

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.770 
keep a turbo spooled up because what a
big<00:01:34.920> truck<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.729> needs<00:01:35.969> the<00:01:36.060> turbo<00:01:36.390> charge<00:01:36.600> of

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
big truck it needs the turbo charge of

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.239 
big truck it needs the turbo charge of
booster<00:01:37.109> pull<00:01:37.319> if<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.890> get<00:01:38.009> on<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.219> throttle

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:38.249 
booster pull if you get on the throttle

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:39.709 
booster pull if you get on the throttle
and<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.789> wasn't<00:01:39.090> spooled<00:01:39.299> up<00:01:39.390> could<00:01:39.569> have<00:01:39.659> a

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
and it wasn't spooled up could have a

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:41.209 
and it wasn't spooled up could have a
hesitation<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.469> can<00:01:40.619> take<00:01:40.829> care<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.039> all

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 
hesitation so you can take care of all

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.099 
hesitation so you can take care of all
that<00:01:41.340> right<00:01:41.549> that's<00:01:41.729> right<00:01:41.909> okay<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.719> I<00:01:42.960> guess

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
that right that's right okay and I guess

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:45.410 
that right that's right okay and I guess
this<00:01:43.590> goes<00:01:43.799> right<00:01:44.069> into<00:01:44.249> the<00:01:44.520> standard<00:01:44.909> 9<00:01:45.119> pin

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
this goes right into the standard 9 pin

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.700 
this goes right into the standard 9 pin
connector<00:01:45.869> under<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.170> dash<00:01:46.350> which<00:01:46.590> is

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
connector under the dash which is

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.410 
connector under the dash which is
standard<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.369> need<00:01:47.460> big<00:01:47.639> trucks<00:01:47.880> that's

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
standard of need big trucks that's

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.599 
standard of need big trucks that's
correct<00:01:48.719> so<00:01:49.100> how<00:01:50.100> long<00:01:50.280> does<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.429> take<00:01:50.579> to

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:50.609 
correct so how long does it take to

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:52.819 
correct so how long does it take to
install<00:01:50.850> something<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.679> we<00:01:52.679> usually

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
install something like this we usually

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.649 
install something like this we usually
figure<00:01:53.280> about<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.639> two<00:01:53.880> hour<00:01:54.090> time<00:01:54.600> period

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
figure about a two hour time period

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.340 
figure about a two hour time period
total<00:01:55.530> okay

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
total okay

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.960 
total okay
you<00:01:56.680> know<00:01:56.799> we<00:01:56.920> test<00:01:57.220> the<00:01:57.400> vehicle<00:01:57.760> to<00:01:57.790> make

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
you know we test the vehicle to make

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.510 
you know we test the vehicle to make

interrupting<00:02:15.250> silmas<00:02:15.610> I<00:02:15.760> see<00:02:16.090> you've<00:02:16.209> got<00:02:16.270> a

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
interrupting silmas I see you've got a

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.400 
interrupting silmas I see you've got a
computer<00:02:16.600> here<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:16.870> got<00:02:16.989> something<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.230> show

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
computer here you got something to show

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.160 
computer here you got something to show
me<00:02:17.440> yeah<00:02:18.040> on<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.700> screen<00:02:18.970> here<00:02:19.239> we<00:02:19.390> have<00:02:19.810> a

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
me yeah on the screen here we have a

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.870 
me yeah on the screen here we have a
normal<00:02:21.069> fire<00:02:22.319> so<00:02:23.319> a<00:02:23.350> normal<00:02:23.739> fire<00:02:24.160> comes<00:02:24.520> down

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
normal fire so a normal fire comes down

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.510 
normal fire so a normal fire comes down
the<00:02:25.450> Pistons<00:02:25.870> cycles<00:02:26.350> down<00:02:26.590> fuel<00:02:26.980> comes<00:02:27.280> in

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
the Pistons cycles down fuel comes in

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.400 
the Pistons cycles down fuel comes in
Sparks<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.120> they<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.840> exhaust<00:02:29.230> goes<00:02:29.470> out<00:02:29.739> ok

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
Sparks and they the exhaust goes out ok

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.530 
Sparks and they the exhaust goes out ok
the<00:02:32.410> next<00:02:32.440> fire<00:02:32.980> would<00:02:33.250> be<00:02:33.280> on<00:02:33.640> mine<00:02:34.030> would<00:02:34.390> be

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
the next fire would be on mine would be

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.259 
the next fire would be on mine would be
a<00:02:34.569> skip<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.440> it<00:02:36.040> would<00:02:36.160> skip<00:02:36.550> and<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:37.090> air

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
a skip and it would skip and the air

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.170 
a skip and it would skip and the air
would<00:02:37.480> still<00:02:37.810> come<00:02:38.080> in<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:39.580> air<00:02:39.790> wouldn't

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
would still come in that air wouldn't

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.270 
would still come in that air wouldn't
have<00:02:40.300> any<00:02:40.480> fuel<00:02:40.750> in<00:02:40.959> it<00:02:41.080> that<00:02:41.590> error<00:02:41.860> hits<00:02:42.130> a

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
have any fuel in it that error hits a

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.140 
have any fuel in it that error hits a
2300<00:02:43.060> degree<00:02:43.800> cylinder<00:02:44.800> it's<00:02:45.250> hot<00:02:45.489> it<00:02:45.819> just

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
2300 degree cylinder it's hot it just

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.229 
2300 degree cylinder it's hot it just
got<00:02:46.269> fired<00:02:46.600> that<00:02:47.019> air<00:02:47.200> expands<00:02:48.120> pushing<00:02:49.120> the

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
got fired that air expands pushing the

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.920 
got fired that air expands pushing the
piston<00:02:49.390> now<00:02:49.959> this<00:02:50.319> is<00:02:50.380> technology<00:02:50.920> from<00:02:51.930> 1816

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
piston now this is technology from 1816

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.750 
piston now this is technology from 1816
which<00:02:53.170> was<00:02:53.380> called<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.769> Stirling<00:02:54.220> engine<00:02:54.370> oh

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
which was called the Stirling engine oh

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.699 
which was called the Stirling engine oh
yeah<00:02:55.150> I've<00:02:55.269> read<00:02:55.450> about<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:55.840> so<00:02:56.260> basically

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
yeah I've read about that so basically

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.559 
yeah I've read about that so basically
you<00:02:56.799> taken<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.190> cold<00:02:57.400> air<00:02:57.640> putting<00:02:58.299> it<00:02:58.450> in<00:02:58.510> a

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
you taken the cold air putting it in a

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.210 
you taken the cold air putting it in a
hot<00:02:58.690> cylinder<00:02:59.110> even<00:02:59.350> though<00:02:59.470> there's<00:02:59.680> no<00:02:59.830> fuel

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
hot cylinder even though there's no fuel

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.920 
hot cylinder even though there's no fuel
and<00:03:00.820> of<00:03:00.940> course<00:03:01.090> there's<00:03:01.209> no<00:03:01.269> spark<00:03:01.540> plug<00:03:01.750> on<00:03:01.870> a

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
and of course there's no spark plug on a

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.960 
and of course there's no spark plug on a
diesel<00:03:02.290> but<00:03:02.410> you've<00:03:02.560> got<00:03:02.739> ignition<00:03:03.610> from<00:03:03.850> the

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
diesel but you've got ignition from the

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.729 
diesel but you've got ignition from the
heat<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.180> oppression<00:03:04.840> you're<00:03:05.440> saying<00:03:05.650> you

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
heat and oppression you're saying you

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.370 
heat and oppression you're saying you
bring<00:03:05.980> in<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.250> air<00:03:06.820> it's<00:03:07.120> cold<00:03:07.480> it's<00:03:08.019> the<00:03:08.170> warm

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
bring in the air it's cold it's the warm

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.870 
bring in the air it's cold it's the warm
summer<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:08.890> it<00:03:08.950> actually<00:03:09.070> expands<00:03:09.579> enough<00:03:09.790> to

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
summer and it actually expands enough to

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.670 
summer and it actually expands enough to
push<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.150> piston<00:03:10.299> down<00:03:10.570> that's<00:03:10.989> correct<00:03:11.260> so

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
push the piston down that's correct so

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.949 
push the piston down that's correct so
gives<00:03:11.950> you<00:03:12.040> some<00:03:12.190> power<00:03:12.370> there<00:03:12.700> right<00:03:13.120> ok<00:03:13.630> so

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
gives you some power there right ok so

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.620 
gives you some power there right ok so
what<00:03:14.109> if<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.290> guys<00:03:14.440> going<00:03:14.829> up<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.070> hill<00:03:15.630> let's

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
what if the guys going up the hill let's

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.030 
what if the guys going up the hill let's
say<00:03:16.720> he's<00:03:16.870> cruising<00:03:17.350> and<00:03:17.530> you're

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
say he's cruising and you're

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.789 
say he's cruising and you're
interrupting<00:03:18.459> cylinders<00:03:19.470> then<00:03:20.470> he<00:03:20.560> hits<00:03:20.709> a

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
interrupting cylinders then he hits a

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:21.840 
interrupting cylinders then he hits a
hill<00:03:20.950> does<00:03:21.100> you<00:03:21.190> have<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.340> do<00:03:21.489> anything<00:03:21.670> I've

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
hill does you have to do anything I've
