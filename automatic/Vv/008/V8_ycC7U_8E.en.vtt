Budapest this one it's maybe not the the
best<00:00:21.630> possible<00:00:22.289> line<00:00:22.769> but<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.310> leads<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.760> a

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
best possible line but it leads to a

them<00:01:47.040> also<00:01:47.280> preparing<00:01:47.880> Bishop<00:01:48.299> before<00:01:48.780> I

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
them also preparing Bishop before I

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.060 
them also preparing Bishop before I

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
could have played Bishop before

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.690 
could have played Bishop before
immediately<00:01:51.380> maybe<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.590> Sun<00:01:52.920> would<00:01:53.579> have

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
immediately maybe the Sun would have

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.420 
immediately maybe the Sun would have
been<00:01:53.850> better<00:01:57.320> ok<00:01:58.320> but<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.979> nice<00:01:59.159> position

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
been better ok but it is a nice position

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.590 
been better ok but it is a nice position
now<00:01:59.969> I'm<00:02:00.890> looking<00:02:01.890> at<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.159> long<00:02:02.490> diagonal

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.440 

the<00:02:06.600> knight<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:07.049> c6<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.710> not<00:02:07.979> covered

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
the knight on c6 is not covered

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.030 
the knight on c6 is not covered
so<00:02:10.450> very<00:02:10.689> likely<00:02:10.989> there<00:02:11.409> are<00:02:11.439> some<00:02:11.709> technical

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
so very likely there are some technical

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:20.039 
so very likely there are some technical
possibilities<00:02:13.709> like<00:02:14.709> 96<00:02:15.810> 96<00:02:18.930> something<00:02:19.930> like

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
possibilities like 96 96 something like

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.539 
possibilities like 96 96 something like
that<00:02:20.230> even<00:02:20.560> light<00:02:20.859> b5<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.540> sublime<00:02:22.540> goodness<00:02:23.549> he

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
that even light b5 a sublime goodness he

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.559 
that even light b5 a sublime goodness he
needs<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.939> protect<00:02:25.319> c7<00:02:26.319> all<00:02:26.439> the<00:02:26.590> time<00:02:27.299> now<00:02:28.299> but

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
needs to protect c7 all the time now but

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:36.750 
needs to protect c7 all the time now but
again<00:02:29.109> I<00:02:29.319> can<00:02:29.620> I<00:02:29.799> can<00:02:30.040> also<00:02:30.189> use<00:02:30.639> the<00:02:30.849> hell<00:02:35.760> yeah

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760

of the way I could have taken on left
five<00:03:14.680> mm-hmm<00:03:15.480> this<00:03:16.480> was<00:03:16.720> much<00:03:16.960> easier<00:03:16.990> but<00:03:17.620> ok

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
five mm-hmm this was much easier but ok

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.770 
five mm-hmm this was much easier but ok
this<00:03:18.070> is<00:03:18.250> as<00:03:18.670> good<00:03:18.760> as<00:03:19.000> well<00:03:19.150> it's<00:03:19.450> just<00:03:19.660> an

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
this is as good as well it's just an

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:33.510 
this is as good as well it's just an
exchange<00:03:20.790> who<00:03:21.790> basically<00:03:22.210> have<00:03:22.570> nothing

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.180 

hmm

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
hmm

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.160 
hmm
yeah<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:35.940> should<00:03:36.180> have<00:03:36.300> just<00:03:36.330> taken<00:03:36.720> on<00:03:37.020> their

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
yeah I should have just taken on their

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:46.990 
yeah I should have just taken on their
five<00:03:38.750> this<00:03:39.750> would<00:03:39.930> have<00:03:40.230> been<00:03:40.290> much<00:03:40.530> easier

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.180 

King<00:03:47.630> edge<00:03:47.780> one<00:03:48.050> was<00:03:48.290> because<00:03:48.650> I<00:03:48.680> thought<00:03:48.830> okay

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
King edge one was because I thought okay

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.780 
King edge one was because I thought okay
Bishop<00:03:49.490> t4<00:03:49.910> as<00:03:50.060> a<00:03:50.090> possible<00:03:50.690> idea<00:03:51.500> me<00:03:52.070> okay<00:03:52.310> h5

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
Bishop t4 as a possible idea me okay h5

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.910 
Bishop t4 as a possible idea me okay h5
now<00:03:53.060> I<00:03:53.090> can<00:03:53.330> take<00:03:53.540> it<00:03:53.870> was<00:03:54.830> lost<00:03:55.100> anyway<00:03:55.550> check

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.130 

are<00:04:00.920> you<00:04:01.070> being<00:04:01.250> subject<00:04:01.760> with<00:04:01.910> okay<00:04:02.600> he

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
are you being subject with okay he

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.400 
are you being subject with okay he
needed<00:04:03.470> to<00:04:03.590> take<00:04:03.770> with<00:04:03.980> the<00:04:04.130> porn<00:04:04.840> not<00:04:05.840> blunder

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
needed to take with the porn not blunder

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:15.520 
needed to take with the porn not blunder
another<00:04:06.890> piece<00:04:11.050> black<00:04:12.050> resigned<00:04:12.920> a<00:04:14.530> disaster

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
another piece black resigned a disaster

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.710 
another piece black resigned a disaster
here<00:04:15.740> but<00:04:16.489> then<00:04:16.730> the<00:04:17.329> main<00:04:17.510> point<00:04:17.870> is<00:04:18.019> that

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
here but then the main point is that

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.090 
here but then the main point is that
well<00:04:20.720> a<00:04:21.230> fight<00:04:21.859> is<00:04:22.100> still<00:04:22.310> ok<00:04:22.610> but<00:04:22.880> be<00:04:23.620> 6v6<00:04:24.620> is

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
well a fight is still ok but be 6v6 is

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.070 
well a fight is still ok but be 6v6 is
just<00:04:25.370> a<00:04:26.560> just<00:04:27.560> a<00:04:27.710> big<00:04:27.890> positional<00:04:28.460> error

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
just a just a big positional error

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.360 
just a just a big positional error
because<00:04:30.080> you<00:04:30.230> never<00:04:30.440> get<00:04:30.740> rid<00:04:30.919> of<00:04:30.950> the<00:04:31.160> night

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
because you never get rid of the night

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.440 
because you never get rid of the night
and<00:04:31.850> this<00:04:32.150> is<00:04:32.330> something<00:04:32.480> to<00:04:33.430> think<00:04:34.430> about<00:04:34.580> if

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
and this is something to think about if

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.250 
and this is something to think about if
you<00:04:36.190> would<00:04:37.190> play<00:04:37.490> that<00:04:37.730> sin<00:04:37.940> night<00:04:38.120> 86<00:04:38.750> or<00:04:38.960> 97

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
you would play that sin night 86 or 97

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.490 
you would play that sin night 86 or 97
you<00:04:39.950> have<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:40.820> idea<00:04:41.120> to<00:04:41.300> play<00:04:41.510> c6<00:04:42.050> if<00:04:42.290> the

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
you have the idea to play c6 if the

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.200 
you have the idea to play c6 if the
night<00:04:42.680> ever<00:04:42.950> comes<00:04:43.280> to<00:04:43.580> d5<00:04:44.510> and<00:04:44.720> now<00:04:46.180> with<00:04:47.180> the

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
night ever comes to d5 and now with the

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.180 
night ever comes to d5 and now with the
night<00:04:47.480> on<00:04:47.690> earth<00:04:47.720> on<00:04:48.230> d5<00:04:48.970> this<00:04:49.970> always<00:04:51.190> should

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
night on earth on d5 this always should

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.230 
night on earth on d5 this always should
should<00:04:52.820> use<00:04:53.030> this<00:04:53.240> function<00:04:53.720> there's<00:04:54.560> always

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
should use this function there's always

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.290 
should use this function there's always
this<00:04:56.240> pressure<00:04:56.750> here<00:04:57.140> so<00:04:57.350> that<00:04:57.530> c6<00:04:58.100> is<00:04:59.000> never

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
this pressure here so that c6 is never

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.820 
this pressure here so that c6 is never
possible<00:04:59.570> on<00:05:00.460> of<00:05:01.460> this<00:05:01.700> one<00:05:02.410> he<00:05:03.410> has<00:05:03.530> a<00:05:03.560> really

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
possible on of this one he has a really

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.680 
possible on of this one he has a really
hard<00:05:04.130> time<00:05:04.370> to<00:05:04.669> prepare<00:05:05.090> that<00:05:06.160> maybe<00:05:07.160> 97<00:05:08.090> 96

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
hard time to prepare that maybe 97 96

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.780 
hard time to prepare that maybe 97 96
you<00:05:08.870> can<00:05:09.050> prepare<00:05:09.410> but<00:05:09.620> it's<00:05:09.770> it's<00:05:10.010> it's<00:05:10.610> a

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
you can prepare but it's it's it's a

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.860 
you can prepare but it's it's it's a
very<00:05:11.000> weak<00:05:11.270> structure<00:05:13.210> and<00:05:14.210> then<00:05:14.360> the<00:05:14.540> game<00:05:14.720> it

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
very weak structure and then the game it

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:21.100 
very weak structure and then the game it
was<00:05:16.479> going<00:05:17.479> downhill<00:05:17.780> really<00:05:18.440> quickly<00:05:20.110> down

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
was going downhill really quickly down

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.990 
was going downhill really quickly down
here<00:05:21.669> it's<00:05:22.669> difficult<00:05:23.030> to<00:05:23.510> suggest<00:05:23.990> a<00:05:24.140> movie<00:05:24.260> i

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
here it's difficult to suggest a movie i

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.530 
here it's difficult to suggest a movie i
also<00:05:26.000> have<00:05:26.450> have<00:05:26.930> this<00:05:27.169> additional<00:05:27.440> IDM<00:05:28.100> to

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
also have have this additional IDM to

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.570 
also have have this additional IDM to
further<00:05:29.540> increase<00:05:29.780> the<00:05:30.169> pressure<00:05:30.350> i<00:05:30.770> think

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
further increase the pressure i think

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.090 
further increase the pressure i think
it's<00:05:31.790> very<00:05:31.910> likely<00:05:32.120> that<00:05:32.710> black<00:05:33.710> will<00:05:33.919> lose

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
it's very likely that black will lose

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:40.570 
it's very likely that black will lose
her<00:05:34.370> upon<00:05:36.400> also<00:05:37.400> bad<00:05:37.790> piece<00:05:38.890> get<00:05:39.890> simply<00:05:40.310> a<00:05:40.340> bad

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
her upon also bad piece get simply a bad

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.690 
her upon also bad piece get simply a bad
structure<00:05:41.060> out<00:05:41.120> of<00:05:41.210> the<00:05:41.419> opening<00:05:41.720> +<00:05:41.990> b<00:05:42.229> 6<00:05:42.700> okay

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
structure out of the opening + b 6 okay

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.630 
structure out of the opening + b 6 okay
thanks<00:05:44.210> for<00:05:44.240> watching
