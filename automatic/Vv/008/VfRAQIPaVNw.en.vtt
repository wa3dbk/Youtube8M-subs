and<00:01:32.850> what<00:01:33.120> do<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.240> see<00:01:33.420> happening<00:01:33.570> inside<00:01:34.080> our

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
and what do you see happening inside our

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.320 
and what do you see happening inside our
Bowl<00:01:34.410> here

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
Bowl here

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.720 
Bowl here
what's<00:01:36.930> our<00:01:37.050> temperature<00:01:37.440> there

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.990 

what<00:01:40.420> do<00:01:40.480> you<00:01:40.510> see<00:01:40.660> there<00:01:41.400> 100<00:01:42.400> is<00:01:42.610> tip

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
quiz time when you boil water at sea

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.730 
quiz time when you boil water at sea
level<00:04:58.040> and<00:04:58.430> you<00:04:59.030> apply<00:04:59.330> as<00:04:59.960> much<00:05:00.260> heat<00:05:00.530> to<00:05:00.650> it

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
level and you apply as much heat to it

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.050 
level and you apply as much heat to it
as<00:05:00.830> you<00:05:00.890> can<00:05:01.160> and<00:05:01.430> you<00:05:01.520> raise<00:05:01.850> the<00:05:02.030> temperature

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
as you can and you raise the temperature

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.710 
as you can and you raise the temperature
above<00:05:02.630> 100<00:05:03.110> degrees<00:05:03.140> Celsius<00:05:03.820> yeah<00:05:04.820> so<00:05:05.510> if<00:05:05.600> you

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
above 100 degrees Celsius yeah so if you
