00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
plant these finding of our new say goes

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.889 
plant these finding of our new say goes
we're<00:02:03.810> all<00:02:03.990> done<00:02:04.259> it's<00:02:04.500> three<00:02:04.740> on<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:05.040> side

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
we're all done it's three on this side
