00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
come up here to the bow we get those

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.170 
come up here to the bow we get those
fluorescent<00:02:18.890> lights<00:02:19.099> reflecting<00:02:19.819> off<00:02:19.970> the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
fluorescent lights reflecting off the

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.240 
fluorescent lights reflecting off the
top<00:02:21.340> you<00:02:22.340> look<00:02:22.520> at<00:02:22.610> all<00:02:22.700> that<00:02:22.849> gloss<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.950> part

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
top you look at all that gloss and part

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.460 
top you look at all that gloss and part
of<00:02:25.280> that<00:02:25.370> gloss<00:02:25.640> comes<00:02:25.940> from<00:02:26.270> from<00:02:26.840> removing

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
of that gloss comes from from removing

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.310 
of that gloss comes from from removing
the<00:02:27.650> oxidation<00:02:28.430> which<00:02:29.390> leaves<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.930> surface

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
the oxidation which leaves the surface

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.809 
the oxidation which leaves the surface
all<00:02:30.500> textured<00:02:31.070> you<00:02:31.430> restore<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.030> smooth<00:02:32.450> sore

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
all textured you restore a smooth sore

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:41.270 
all textured you restore a smooth sore
listen<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.930> get<00:02:34.079> your<00:02:34.290> gloss<00:02:34.499> back

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.090 

and<00:02:41.790> of<00:02:42.030> course<00:02:42.240> a<00:02:42.420> smooth<00:02:42.750> surface<00:02:43.050> will<00:02:43.500> last

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
and of course a smooth surface will last

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.860 
and of course a smooth surface will last
longer<00:02:44.430> when<00:02:44.670> exposed<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.300> elements<00:02:45.390> a

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
longer when exposed to the elements a

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.790 
longer when exposed to the elements a
lot<00:02:46.200> longer<00:02:46.350> than<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.740> textured<00:02:47.250> surface<00:02:48.800> let

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
lot longer than a textured surface let

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.350 
lot longer than a textured surface let
me<00:02:49.890> go<00:02:50.040> through<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.280> here<00:02:50.460> get<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.820> bottom<00:02:51.180> now

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
me go through it here get the bottom now

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.170 
me go through it here get the bottom now
and<00:02:51.750> these<00:02:52.740> stripes<00:02:53.070> are<00:02:53.280> gel<00:02:53.520> coat<00:02:53.790> so<00:02:54.000> that's

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
and these stripes are gel coat so that's

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.740 
and these stripes are gel coat so that's
pigmented<00:02:54.800> polyester<00:02:55.800> resin<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:57.390> can<00:02:57.570> see

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
pigmented polyester resin you can see

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.570 
pigmented polyester resin you can see
the<00:02:57.870> reflection<00:02:58.020> coming<00:02:58.770> off<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.040> white<00:02:59.250> hole

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
the reflection coming off the white hole

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.460 
the reflection coming off the white hole
now<00:02:59.820> before<00:03:00.390> there<00:03:00.510> was<00:03:00.630> nothing<00:03:01.080> it<00:03:01.200> was<00:03:01.260> just

dull<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:07.080> I<00:03:07.350> also<00:03:08.100> showed<00:03:08.490> some<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.820> these<00:03:09.030> gel

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
dull and I also showed some of these gel

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.500 
dull and I also showed some of these gel

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
now you can actually see the tiled floor

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:35.390 
now you can actually see the tiled floor
reflecting<00:03:28.530> off<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.790> side<00:03:30.030> of<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.270> hole<00:03:34.190> if<00:03:35.190> I

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
reflecting off the side of the hole if I

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.570 
reflecting off the side of the hole if I
walk<00:03:35.640> up<00:03:35.880> here<00:03:36.500> again<00:03:37.500> you<00:03:37.650> can<00:03:37.680> see<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:38.280> tile

of this white gel coat finish okay then
to<00:03:54.180> do<00:03:54.360> this<00:03:54.570> work<00:03:55.670> we<00:03:56.670> use<00:03:56.820> rotary<00:03:57.180> buffers

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
to do this work we use rotary buffers

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.770 
to do this work we use rotary buffers
with<00:03:58.019> wool<00:03:58.260> pads<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:59.400> the<00:04:00.000> initial<00:04:00.330> step<00:04:00.630> we

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
with wool pads and the initial step we

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.410 
with wool pads and the initial step we
did<00:04:00.959> with<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.380> marine<00:04:01.709> 31<00:04:02.280> gel<00:04:02.790> coat<00:04:03.060> heavy

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
did with the marine 31 gel coat heavy

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.870 
did with the marine 31 gel coat heavy
cut<00:04:03.750> oxidation<00:04:04.530> cleaner<00:04:04.860> that's<00:04:05.730> an

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
cut oxidation cleaner that's an

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.630 
cut oxidation cleaner that's an
aggressive<00:04:06.120> compound<00:04:06.870> and<00:04:07.340> then<00:04:08.340> for<00:04:08.580> the

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
aggressive compound and then for the

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.850 
aggressive compound and then for the
follow-up<00:04:09.120> we<00:04:09.720> use<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:10.079> marine<00:04:10.320> 31

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
follow-up we use the marine 31

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.670 
follow-up we use the marine 31
all-in-one<00:04:11.549> gel<00:04:11.910> coat<00:04:12.180> polish<00:04:12.720> and<00:04:12.930> wax<00:04:13.079> and

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
all-in-one gel coat polish and wax and

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.580 
all-in-one gel coat polish and wax and
that's<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.160> one-step<00:04:14.700> cleaner<00:04:15.090> wax<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:15.780> it<00:04:16.380> has

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
that's a one-step cleaner wax and it has

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.610 
that's a one-step cleaner wax and it has
enough<00:04:17.280> cut<00:04:17.669> to<00:04:18.269> remove<00:04:18.540> any<00:04:18.750> of<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.079> residual

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
enough cut to remove any of the residual

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.979 
enough cut to remove any of the residual
haze<00:04:19.919> left<00:04:20.310> by<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.489> first<00:04:20.760> compounding<00:04:21.630> step

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
haze left by the first compounding step

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.040 
haze left by the first compounding step
and<00:04:22.850> throughout<00:04:23.850> the<00:04:24.030> process<00:04:24.240> we<00:04:24.690> use<00:04:24.840> both

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
and throughout the process we use both

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.800 
and throughout the process we use both
Spurs<00:04:25.440> and<00:04:25.830> pad<00:04:26.490> washers<00:04:27.000> to<00:04:27.240> keep<00:04:27.360> our<00:04:27.540> pads

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
Spurs and pad washers to keep our pads

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.680 
Spurs and pad washers to keep our pads
clean<00:04:28.460> that<00:04:29.460> makes<00:04:29.729> all<00:04:30.120> the<00:04:30.270> products<00:04:30.570> you're

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
clean that makes all the products you're

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.570 
clean that makes all the products you're
using<00:04:30.720> a<00:04:30.990> lot<00:04:31.110> more<00:04:31.140> effective<00:04:31.800> also<00:04:32.100> makes

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
using a lot more effective also makes

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.450 
using a lot more effective also makes
buffing<00:04:33.210> easier<00:04:33.570> and<00:04:33.780> it<00:04:34.560> makes<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:34.979> wipe<00:04:35.160> off

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
buffing easier and it makes the wipe off

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.350 
buffing easier and it makes the wipe off
easier<00:04:36.169> anyway<00:04:37.169> so<00:04:37.410> that's<00:04:37.740> a<00:04:38.130> that's<00:04:38.669> our<00:04:38.910> bow

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
easier anyway so that's a that's our bow

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.280 
easier anyway so that's a that's our bow
