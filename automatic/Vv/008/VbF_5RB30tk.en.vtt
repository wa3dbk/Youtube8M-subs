this is the rolling pin I use it's just
a<00:00:04.920> short<00:00:05.250> one<00:00:05.490> but<00:00:05.700> it's<00:00:06.359> made<00:00:06.600> for<00:00:07.109> fondant

used<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.269> use<00:00:12.420> my<00:00:12.540> wooden<00:00:12.840> rolling<00:00:13.019> pin<00:00:13.290> in<00:00:13.410> it

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
used to use my wooden rolling pin in it

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.780 
used to use my wooden rolling pin in it
just<00:00:13.769> doesn't<00:00:14.070> have<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.190> same<00:00:14.280> effect<00:00:14.429> than

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
just doesn't have the same effect than

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.609 
just doesn't have the same effect than
it<00:00:14.880> used<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.150> stick<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.450> lot<00:00:15.660> you'll<00:00:16.410> also

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
it used to stick a lot you'll also

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.880 
it used to stick a lot you'll also
notice<00:00:16.980> on<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.730> ends<00:00:18.330> there<00:00:18.960> these<00:00:19.170> rubber

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
notice on the ends there these rubber

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.480 
notice on the ends there these rubber
bands<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:21.769> see<00:00:22.769> if<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:22.949> can<00:00:23.100> see<00:00:23.279> there

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
bands and see if you can see there

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.509 
bands and see if you can see there
that's<00:00:24.180> how<00:00:24.480> thick<00:00:24.900> your<00:00:25.859> icing<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.340> going<00:00:26.460> to

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
that's how thick your icing is going to

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.769 
that's how thick your icing is going to
be<00:00:26.640> if<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.880> leave<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.180> rubber<00:00:27.330> band<00:00:27.599> on

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
be if you leave the rubber band on

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.800 
be if you leave the rubber band on
that's<00:00:28.019> like<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.320> height<00:00:28.920> limiter<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:30.240> that's

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
that's like a height limiter so that's

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.389 
that's like a height limiter so that's
really<00:00:30.960> quite<00:00:31.170> thin<00:00:31.470> i<00:00:31.500> usually<00:00:32.009> use<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
really quite thin i usually use the

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.950 
really quite thin i usually use the
purple<00:00:32.759> ones<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.239> that's<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.660> think<00:00:33.690> my

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
purple ones and that's I think my

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.410 
purple ones and that's I think my
fondant<00:00:34.350> ends<00:00:34.559> up<00:00:34.739> being<00:00:35.550> because<00:00:35.969> as<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.390> can

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
fondant ends up being because as you can

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.479 
fondant ends up being because as you can
see<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.960> will<00:00:37.079> stop<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.680> rolling<00:00:38.219> pin<00:00:38.340> from

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
see it will stop the rolling pin from

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.549 
see it will stop the rolling pin from
going<00:00:38.790> any<00:00:38.910> lower<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.239> your<00:00:39.690> your<00:00:40.079> item<00:00:40.440> will

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
going any lower and your your item will

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.340 
going any lower and your your item will
be<00:00:40.760> evenly<00:00:41.760> rolled<00:00:42.329> out<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.079> same

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
be evenly rolled out and to the same

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
surface with the cornstarch I used to

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.569 
surface with the cornstarch I used to
use<00:01:54.630> icing<00:01:55.409> sugar<00:01:55.590> but<00:01:55.920> I'm<00:01:56.100> trying<00:01:56.460> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
cornstarch because apparently that works

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.030 
cornstarch because apparently that works
better<00:01:59.460> so<00:01:59.729> we'll<00:01:59.880> see<00:02:00.500> then<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.619> kind<00:02:01.950> of

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
better so we'll see then I kind of

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.190 
better so we'll see then I kind of
flatten<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.549> out<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.270> set<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.750> rolling<00:02:04.079> it

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
flatten it out and I set to rolling it

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.190 
flatten it out and I set to rolling it
as<00:02:05.189> you're<00:02:05.520> rolling<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:06.299> want<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.719> lift<00:02:06.960> it

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
as you're rolling you want to lift it

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.570 
as you're rolling you want to lift it
every<00:02:07.469> now<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.680> again<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:07.979> see<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.250> sticking

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
every now and again you see it sticking

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.230 
every now and again you see it sticking
so

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
so

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.920 
so
you<00:02:09.300> need<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.630> know<00:02:10.340> if<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.610> need<00:02:11.820> more<00:02:12.600> corn

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
you need to know if you need more corn

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.570 
you need to know if you need more corn
starch<00:02:13.230> or<00:02:13.320> icing<00:02:13.680> sugar<00:02:13.800> on<00:02:14.010> your<00:02:14.040> surface

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.910 

some<00:02:17.660> cornstarch<00:02:18.660> on<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.110> top<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:19.380> just<00:02:19.680> rub

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
some cornstarch on the top you just rub

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.190 
some cornstarch on the top you just rub
it<00:02:19.950> off<00:02:20.100> it's<00:02:20.340> fine<00:02:20.550> so<00:02:21.480> you'll<00:02:21.870> take<00:02:21.900> this

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
it off it's fine so you'll take this

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.610 
it off it's fine so you'll take this
damn<00:02:22.440> thin<00:02:22.740> dab<00:02:23.580> it<00:02:23.730> in<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:23.940> corn<00:02:24.150> starch<00:02:24.620> kind

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
damn thin dab it in the corn starch kind

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.710 
damn thin dab it in the corn starch kind
of<00:02:25.680> DAB<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.100> off<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.700> just<00:02:26.910> want<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.180> get<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.570> so

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
of DAB it off you just want to get it so

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.320 
of DAB it off you just want to get it so
it's<00:02:27.900> not<00:02:28.140> super<00:02:28.860> sticky<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.790> can<00:02:29.940> even<00:02:30.060> dust

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
it's not super sticky you can even dust

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.450 
it's not super sticky you can even dust
some<00:02:30.570> on<00:02:30.720> here<00:02:30.960> deliberately<00:02:31.680> because<00:02:32.190> that

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
some on here deliberately because that

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.000 
some on here deliberately because that
makes<00:02:32.640> your<00:02:32.820> surface<00:02:33.180> not<00:02:33.360> super<00:02:33.720> sticky<00:02:34.050> then

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
makes your surface not super sticky then

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.010 
makes your surface not super sticky then
you<00:02:35.160> line<00:02:35.370> up<00:02:35.400> your<00:02:35.550> stem<00:02:35.910> use<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.630> gentle

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
you line up your stem use a gentle

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.380 
you line up your stem use a gentle
rocking<00:02:37.860> motion<00:02:38.250> you'll<00:02:38.640> press<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:39.030> design

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
rocking motion you'll press the design

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.880 
rocking motion you'll press the design
in<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:40.190> then<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.340> line<00:02:41.490> up<00:02:41.520> your<00:02:41.700> cutter<00:02:42.000> and

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
in and then you line up your cutter and

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
in and then you line up your cutter and
cut<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.070> shape<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:48.500> there<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.680> go<00:02:49.860> it's<00:02:50.790> your

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
cut the shape and there you go it's your

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.750 
cut the shape and there you go it's your
shape<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.920> you'll<00:02:53.040> just<00:02:53.190> keep<00:02:53.370> doing<00:02:53.640> that

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
shape and you'll just keep doing that

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.950 
shape and you'll just keep doing that
until<00:02:53.940> your<00:02:54.770> piece<00:02:55.770> of<00:02:55.980> fondant<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:56.810> full<00:02:57.810> of

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
until your piece of fondant is full of

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:05.820 
until your piece of fondant is full of
holes

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.910 

then<00:03:06.830> you<00:03:06.980> lift<00:03:07.160> it<00:03:07.310> up<00:03:07.430> shake<00:03:08.000> off<00:03:08.240> any<00:03:08.420> excess

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
then you lift it up shake off any excess

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.949 
then you lift it up shake off any excess
cornstarch<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:10.390> you'll<00:03:11.390> just<00:03:11.540> need<00:03:11.690> it<00:03:11.870> up

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
cornstarch and you'll just need it up

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.740 
cornstarch and you'll just need it up
again<00:03:12.260> if<00:03:12.860> your<00:03:13.459> fund<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:13.910> starts<00:03:14.209> to<00:03:14.330> dry<00:03:14.569> out

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
again if your fund and starts to dry out

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.380 
again if your fund and starts to dry out
and<00:03:15.050> crack<00:03:15.110> and<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.740> texture<00:03:16.160> changes<00:03:16.670> you

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
and crack and the texture changes you

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.570 
and crack and the texture changes you
can<00:03:17.890> literally<00:03:18.890> put<00:03:19.010> your<00:03:19.069> finger<00:03:19.400> in<00:03:19.520> the

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
can literally put your finger in the

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.340 
can literally put your finger in the
water<00:03:19.730> and<00:03:19.880> dab<00:03:20.209> a<00:03:20.450> tiny<00:03:20.780> bit<00:03:20.959> of<00:03:21.050> water<00:03:21.080> on

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
water and dab a tiny bit of water on

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.590 
water and dab a tiny bit of water on
just<00:03:21.650> to<00:03:21.709> replace<00:03:21.920> some<00:03:22.190> moisture<00:03:22.610> and<00:03:22.790> need

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
just to replace some moisture and need

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.020 
just to replace some moisture and need
that<00:03:23.840> through<00:03:24.640> but<00:03:25.640> it<00:03:25.959> should<00:03:27.459> be<00:03:28.459> fine<00:03:28.700> for<00:03:28.760> a

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
that through but it should be fine for a

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.729 
that through but it should be fine for a
good<00:03:29.180> few<00:03:29.420> uses<00:03:29.660> especially<00:03:30.380> if<00:03:30.440> you<00:03:30.530> use<00:03:30.560> a

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
good few uses especially if you use a

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.150 
good few uses especially if you use a
small<00:03:31.130> lump<00:03:31.340> to<00:03:31.580> start<00:03:31.850> with<00:03:32.770> ok<00:03:33.770> I'm<00:03:33.920> going<00:03:34.040> to

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
bigger pattern so we'll roll it out and

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.750 
bigger pattern so we'll roll it out and
this<00:03:46.550> one<00:03:46.790> I'm<00:03:47.000> using<00:03:47.030> this<00:03:47.900> stamp<00:03:48.610> just<00:03:49.610> got

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
this one I'm using this stamp just got

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.430 
this one I'm using this stamp just got
quite<00:03:49.970> a<00:03:50.000> big<00:03:50.180> pattern<00:03:50.600> on<00:03:50.900> so<00:03:51.940> get<00:03:52.940> some

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
quite a big pattern on so get some

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.990 
quite a big pattern on so get some
cornstarch<00:03:54.440> in<00:03:54.890> there<00:03:55.190> just<00:03:55.489> as<00:03:55.700> it<00:03:55.819> doesn't

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
cornstarch in there just as it doesn't

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.910 
cornstarch in there just as it doesn't
stick<00:03:56.450> and<00:03:56.750> dust<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:57.380> surface<00:03:59.350> if<00:04:00.350> the<00:04:00.500> if<00:04:00.890> the

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
stick and dust the surface if the if the

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.309 
stick and dust the surface if the if the
stamp<00:04:01.400> details<00:04:02.150> are<00:04:02.510> going<00:04:02.690> to<00:04:02.780> stick<00:04:03.080> in<00:04:03.290> your

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
stamp details are going to stick in your

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.949 
stamp details are going to stick in your
fondant<00:04:03.800> then<00:04:03.980> it<00:04:04.100> starts<00:04:04.489> to<00:04:04.690> tear<00:04:05.690> it<00:04:05.810> when

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
fondant then it starts to tear it when

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.770 
fondant then it starts to tear it when
you<00:04:06.050> pull<00:04:06.200> it<00:04:06.319> apart<00:04:07.300> so<00:04:08.300> we<00:04:08.690> have<00:04:08.840> our<00:04:08.870> surface

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
you pull it apart so we have our surface

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.550 
you pull it apart so we have our surface
make<00:04:11.780> sure<00:04:11.810> it's<00:04:12.110> nicely<00:04:12.350> pressed<00:04:12.799> in<00:04:13.130> there

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
make sure it's nicely pressed in there

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.740 
make sure it's nicely pressed in there
you<00:04:15.560> go<00:04:18.070> only<00:04:19.070> cut<00:04:19.280> a<00:04:19.310> circle

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
you go only cut a circle

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.990 
you go only cut a circle
so<00:04:21.590> if<00:04:21.650> you<00:04:21.799> squeeze<00:04:22.220> it<00:04:22.400> slightly<00:04:22.670> as<00:04:22.880> you

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
so if you squeeze it slightly as you

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.580 
so if you squeeze it slightly as you
pick<00:04:23.150> it<00:04:23.240> up<00:04:23.330> sometimes<00:04:23.900> it<00:04:24.080> grabs<00:04:24.350> it<00:04:24.560> and

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
pick it up sometimes it grabs it and

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.700 
pick it up sometimes it grabs it and
lifts<00:04:25.010> it<00:04:25.100> at<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.370> same<00:04:25.580> time<00:04:25.930> but<00:04:26.930> clearly

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
lifts it at the same time but clearly

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:37.540 
lifts it at the same time but clearly
not<00:04:27.860> always<00:04:35.230> with<00:04:36.230> circles<00:04:36.710> I<00:04:36.800> like<00:04:36.950> to<00:04:37.130> spin

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
not always with circles I like to spin

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.910 
not always with circles I like to spin
the<00:04:37.730> cutter<00:04:37.970> and<00:04:38.510> with<00:04:39.170> other<00:04:39.320> shapes<00:04:39.620> I<00:04:39.770> like

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
the cutter and with other shapes I like

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.320 
the cutter and with other shapes I like
to<00:04:40.040> give<00:04:40.190> it<00:04:40.280> a<00:04:40.310> little<00:04:40.400> wiggle<00:04:40.730> just<00:04:41.090> to<00:04:41.210> make

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
to give it a little wiggle just to make

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.850 
to give it a little wiggle just to make
sure<00:04:41.360> it's<00:04:41.510> made<00:04:41.750> a<00:04:41.780> clean<00:04:42.110> cut<00:04:42.440> all<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:42.770> way

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
sure it's made a clean cut all the way

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.860 
sure it's made a clean cut all the way
through<00:04:42.890> to<00:04:43.160> the<00:04:43.400> to<00:04:44.150> the<00:04:44.180> counter<00:04:44.720> without

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
through to the to the counter without

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.980 
through to the to the counter without
any<00:04:45.170> little<00:04:45.620> bits<00:04:45.860> around<00:04:46.040> the<00:04:46.280> edge<00:04:46.990> so

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
any little bits around the edge so

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.400 
any little bits around the edge so
there's<00:04:48.230> your<00:04:48.700> textured<00:04:49.700> circles<00:04:50.510> it<00:04:51.140> doesn't

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
there's your textured circles it doesn't

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.600 
there's your textured circles it doesn't
matter<00:04:51.470> those<00:04:51.680> off-center<00:04:52.280> it's<00:04:52.370> going<00:04:52.550> to

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
matter those off-center it's going to

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.710 
matter those off-center it's going to
have<00:04:52.700> something<00:04:52.850> on<00:04:53.030> top<00:04:55.270> I'll<00:04:56.270> do<00:04:56.419> one<00:04:56.600> more

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720
