00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:10.050
 and how are they 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:14.490
 Well now let's see a video of 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:17.300
 how to raise our crazy ways this 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.480
 it means lower the recovery for 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:25.279
 to be able to do more things like 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:27.600
 how to install some roms or do the 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.300
 whites what they mean 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.270
 cleanings of our of our system 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.870
 for obviously as I say install rooms 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.040
 make backup of our roms or the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.040
 restoration of them 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.969
 but well let's start and as we see 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.969
 in the past video 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.480
 be a root user if not if they have not 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.360
 seen here they will look like this one 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.660
 globito around here that says I do not know 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.990
 how to do sir one is going to click and 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.630
 will take them to the video 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:09.329
 this time, let's see how 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:14.520
 well in fact here it is since we are 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:17.659
 partners routes and says superior 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.659
 it does not focus well but 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:24.369
 superuser to see if it's been a bit of 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:24.369
 zoom 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.450
 there says superuser good but in this 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.470
 occasion that does not matter to us good yes 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.900
 matter but well I say this let's see 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.660
 as more than anything beyond the recovery 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.570
 we will not happen to pass the file that 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:54.930
 the reference of the video that is this one of 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:57.030
 here that says pick up and ass by mod 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.920
 obviously only works for galaxies 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.440
 in versions l 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.930
 and good 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.050
 and let's start 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.600
 as we saw last let's root 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.770
 enter the new pick up and pressing the 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.940
 home key and the power key is here 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.940
 both at the same time 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.830
 and we hope 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.260
 until you 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.409
 enter the recovery mode 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.520
 that is from here we let go until 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:45.220
 appear is this window 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.290
 and once here in 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.900
 I said last nerve we slid with 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.630
 Volume keys down and up 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.980
 obviously right down and we're going to 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.920
 choose the second option 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.920
 update for music art to see if it focuses 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.519
 before predicting that the second 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:11.200
 we go down with the volume keys 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.200
 here and we give the home key 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.220
 8 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.370
 we went down weeks declared okey once 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.040
 inside let's choose the file in my 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.750
 case from the second or we come back 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.750
 to go down let's see if it focuses 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:35.130
 this one that says recovery we can 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:37.610
 we go down and we give it to him and we choose it with the 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.610
 home key 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.940
 is going to do this mister cover and was going to 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.680
 finish is a very fast and good process 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.860
 I believe that the series of rebounds eastern 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.640
 out 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.230
 for the power system and restart 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.500
 confirm that the 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.570
 recovery 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.480
 I'll pass the video so that it is not so 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:03.210
 long back with you and to be 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.500
 nothing else just wait and come back with 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:08.990
 you and good and 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.480
 here is the file and here are the 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:16.160
 chivas forgive forgive me already started 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:20.410
 as you can see it's just starting 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.410
 the search for files and everything is not 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.460
 and how are we going to realize that 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:30.289
 the recovery of it is based 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:32.869
 way we enter we give home and power 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:35.040
 we wait for the recovery and 

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:38.570
 let's go 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.570
 both of the plan at the same time 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.499
 if you do not want to press again 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.870
 Yes now 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.189
 we wait 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:14.370
 now inside and as you can see once 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:16.090
 that I entered this position do not appear anymore 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.889
 options 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.220
 to see to see if I want it to focus a 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.220
 little more 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:32.120
 As you can see there are options for 

00:05:30.799 --> 00:05:33.430
 whites 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.840
 and 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:39.410
 for also 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.380
 and install the roms and in fact to crise 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:46.870
 up clockwork mod 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:49.550
 and this is version 5.0 points 2.5 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.969
 points 6 forgiveness 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.869
 Y 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:56.039
 and well this means that our 

00:05:53.869 --> 00:05:59.449
 mode and this one would not be collected are 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:02.479
 bleached and we can install the rom 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:04.909
 and well that would be all I hope that you 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:07.550
 have liked and simply a vision 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:10.339
 more than I'll be uploading videos of the 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.139
 once this is done so that the 

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:14.300
 install one of the pages well because 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:18.499
 that's the correct term to flash the 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:22.309
 roms and also for this apps that are 

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:24.499
 to get the most out of it 

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:26.809
 to our android for root users 

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:28.550
 is also receiving for those who do not 

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:32.050
 be three I do not know what makes dare to do 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:37.240
 this process that is not something so 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:40.720
 how dangerous that it brings a lot 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:43.180
 let's say risk but if there is something 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.460
 of risk but as you can see it is not something like that 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.060
 so much 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:50.840
 so broadly bony 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:54.919
 and they will take advantage of your cell phone 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:57.889
 your galaxy and in the first place is 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:59.630
 receiving more roms and applications for 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:02.770
 broken dreams ' also for those who 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:05.150
 they are not routes but good 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:08.200
 that's all I hope you liked 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.200
 and see you in the next
