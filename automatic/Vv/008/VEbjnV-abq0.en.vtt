00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
in really good shape and then I went

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.470 
in really good shape and then I went
ahead<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.930> painted<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:38.340> backs<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.969> all<00:00:39.360> of

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
ahead and painted the backs of all of

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.160 
ahead and painted the backs of all of
these<00:00:39.600> tanks<00:00:40.020> black<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.730> the<00:00:41.730> bottoms<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.750> all

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
these tanks black and the bottoms of all

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.560 
these tanks black and the bottoms of all
of<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.410> tanks<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.430> textured<00:00:45.030> paint<00:00:45.270> color

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
of the tanks that textured paint color

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.729 
of the tanks that textured paint color
so<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.800> they<00:00:47.550> will<00:00:47.789> be<00:00:48.420> exactly<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.350> same<00:00:49.379> as

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
so that they will be exactly the same as

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.260 
so that they will be exactly the same as
the<00:00:50.489> four<00:00:50.730> tanks<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.629> are<00:00:51.690> down<00:00:52.320> below<00:00:52.559> them

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
the four tanks that are down below them

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.000 
the four tanks that are down below them

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
the inside of those tanks before I fill

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.260 
the inside of those tanks before I fill
them<00:02:11.180> with<00:02:11.420> water<00:02:11.930> but<00:02:12.890> we<00:02:13.280> are<00:02:13.610> on<00:02:13.820> the<00:02:14.030> home

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
them with water but we are on the home

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.990 
them with water but we are on the home
stretch<00:02:14.630> here<00:02:14.830> it's<00:02:15.830> been<00:02:15.980> about<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.220> year<00:02:16.310> of

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
stretch here it's been about a year of

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.530 
stretch here it's been about a year of
planning<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.260> building<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:20.090> get<00:02:20.240> to<00:02:20.420> this

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
planning and building to get to this

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.290 
planning and building to get to this
point<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:21.080> it's<00:02:22.040> pretty<00:02:22.280> exciting<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.940> see<00:02:23.210> it

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
point and it's pretty exciting to see it

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.420 
point and it's pretty exciting to see it
come<00:02:23.540> together<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:24.140> think<00:02:24.560> this<00:02:25.040> is<00:02:25.100> going<00:02:25.340> to

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
come together I think this is going to

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.630 
come together I think this is going to
be<00:02:25.550> perfect<00:02:26.210> I<00:02:26.740> level<00:02:27.740> height<00:02:27.980> for<00:02:28.340> most

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
be perfect I level height for most

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.300 
be perfect I level height for most
people<00:02:29.000> that<00:02:29.030> walk<00:02:29.420> into<00:02:30.410> this<00:02:30.530> fish<00:02:30.830> room<00:02:31.100> I'm

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
people that walk into this fish room I'm

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.600 
people that walk into this fish room I'm
about<00:02:31.610> six<00:02:31.910> feet<00:02:32.120> tall<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:34.160> top<00:02:34.340> of<00:02:34.400> the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
about six feet tall and the top of the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.380 
about six feet tall and the top of the
tank<00:02:34.820> is<00:02:35.090> almost<00:02:35.740> six<00:02:36.740> feet<00:02:36.860> so<00:02:37.580> that's<00:02:38.210> going

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
tank is almost six feet so that's going

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.570 
tank is almost six feet so that's going
to<00:02:38.450> work<00:02:38.600> out<00:02:38.810> really<00:02:39.080> nice<00:02:39.440> I<00:02:39.770> do<00:02:40.010> need<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:40.400> get

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
to work out really nice I do need to get

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.140 
to work out really nice I do need to get
the<00:02:40.730> LED<00:02:41.090> lights<00:02:41.360> installed<00:02:41.890> up<00:02:42.890> top<00:02:43.250> here<00:02:43.310> so

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
the LED lights installed up top here so

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.370 
the LED lights installed up top here so
that<00:02:44.330> we<00:02:44.360> have<00:02:44.540> plenty<00:02:44.720> of<00:02:44.900> light<00:02:45.050> entering

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
that we have plenty of light entering

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.670 
that we have plenty of light entering
the<00:02:45.890> aquariums<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.640> I<00:02:47.510> probably<00:02:47.930> will<00:02:48.380> work

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
the aquariums and I probably will work

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.990 
the aquariums and I probably will work
on<00:02:49.060> getting<00:02:50.290> some<00:02:51.290> light<00:02:51.770> shields<00:02:52.460> to<00:02:52.670> block

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
on getting some light shields to block

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.780 
on getting some light shields to block
some<00:02:53.660> of<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.960> the<00:02:54.410> excess<00:02:54.890> sources<00:02:55.430> of<00:02:55.460> light

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
some of the the excess sources of light

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.760 
some of the the excess sources of light
so<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:56.150> you<00:02:56.390> don't<00:02:56.570> get<00:02:56.780> tons<00:02:57.560> of

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
so that you don't get tons of

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.760 
so that you don't get tons of
reflections<00:02:58.430> going<00:02:59.420> on<00:02:59.600> down<00:02:59.870> here<00:02:59.900> but<00:03:00.560> as

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
reflections going on down here but as

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.250 
reflections going on down here but as
long<00:03:00.950> as<00:03:01.070> I<00:03:01.160> can<00:03:01.220> blast<00:03:01.640> enough<00:03:02.090> light<00:03:02.360> like<00:03:03.080> I

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
long as I can blast enough light like I

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.770 
long as I can blast enough light like I
am<00:03:03.470> down<00:03:03.740> here<00:03:03.880> there<00:03:04.880> shouldn't<00:03:05.210> be<00:03:05.300> too<00:03:05.630> much
