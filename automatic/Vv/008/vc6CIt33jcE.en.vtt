irrigation<00:01:30.229> variegation<00:01:31.009> yeah<00:01:31.790> it<00:01:31.880> would

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
irrigation variegation yeah it would

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.330 
irrigation variegation yeah it would
fertilize<00:01:32.360> liquid<00:01:33.079> fertilizer<00:01:33.590> so<00:01:34.040> we're<00:01:34.189> not

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
fertilize liquid fertilizer so we're not

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.850 
fertilize liquid fertilizer so we're not
organic<00:01:35.150> but<00:01:35.420> we<00:01:35.509> are<00:01:35.630> pesticide-free<00:01:36.290> why

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
a little higher than we were ready for

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.760 
a little higher than we were ready for
at<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:22.190> time

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
but then we you know decided the cost is

per hour and we know this because we

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.190

the year before and we know what our

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
outside and inside temperatures were so

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.020 
outside and inside temperatures were so

it looks great and it seems great
because<00:03:50.530> it's<00:03:50.650> got<00:03:50.770> all<00:03:50.860> those<00:03:51.010> different

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
your BTU costs you have to figure out

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.610 
your BTU costs you have to figure out

surface<00:04:07.450> area<00:04:07.690> caused<00:04:08.110> by<00:04:08.320> that<00:04:08.440> corrugation

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
surface area caused by that corrugation

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.000 
surface area caused by that corrugation
that's<00:04:10.060> going<00:04:10.480> to<00:04:10.570> increase<00:04:11.080> your<00:04:11.320> heat<00:04:11.740> loss

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
that's going to increase your heat loss

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.520 
that's going to increase your heat loss
in<00:04:12.310> in<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.240> wintertime<00:04:13.510> so<00:04:13.690> that's<00:04:14.170> going<00:04:14.440> to

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
in in the wintertime so that's going to

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.680 
in in the wintertime so that's going to
cost<00:04:14.740> you<00:04:14.980> more<00:04:15.190> propane<00:04:15.640> which<00:04:16.299> means<00:04:16.600> you

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
cost you more propane which means you

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.570 
cost you more propane which means you
have<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:16.900> grow<00:04:16.989> more<00:04:17.169> crops<00:04:17.290> this<00:04:18.040> past<00:04:18.340> winter

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
have to grow more crops this past winter

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.250 
have to grow more crops this past winter
it<00:04:18.880> was<00:04:19.330> down<00:04:19.600> into<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:20.109> the<00:04:20.650> single<00:04:21.280> digits

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
it was down into the the single digits

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.880 
it was down into the the single digits
and<00:04:23.260> we<00:04:24.130> were<00:04:24.190> able<00:04:24.280> to<00:04:24.520> keep<00:04:25.530> about<00:04:26.530> 20

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
and we were able to keep about 20

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.300 
and we were able to keep about 20
degrees<00:04:27.220> above<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:29.470> outside<00:04:29.800> temperature<00:04:30.190> in

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
progressively gets colder and if a cloud

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.860 
progressively gets colder and if a cloud
deck<00:04:39.729> comes<00:04:39.999> in<00:04:40.180> so<00:04:40.330> we<00:04:40.419> can't<00:04:40.629> get<00:04:40.780> any

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:41.999 
deck comes in so we can't get any
sunshine<00:04:41.050> but<00:04:41.319> the<00:04:41.409> minute<00:04:41.590> the<00:04:41.650> Sun<00:04:41.710> comes

foot level we're measuring temperatures

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:54.779 
foot level we're measuring temperatures
up<00:04:52.029> this<00:04:52.360> level<00:04:52.719> so<00:04:53.529> when<00:04:53.919> it<00:04:54.039> goes<00:04:54.159> up<00:04:54.189> to<00:04:54.400> 60

up this level so when it goes up to 60
we're<00:04:54.969> going<00:04:55.240> boy<00:04:56.139> it's<00:04:56.289> good<00:04:56.409> thing<00:04:56.499> we<00:04:56.590> don't

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
we're going boy it's good thing we don't

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.929 
we're going boy it's good thing we don't
have<00:04:56.740> to<00:04:56.889> go<00:04:56.979> out<00:05:01.259> no<00:05:02.259> no<00:05:02.710> we<00:05:03.340> stop<00:05:03.639> worrying

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:03.939 
have to go out no no we stop worrying

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:06.239 
have to go out no no we stop worrying
about<00:05:04.029> the<00:05:04.210> snow<00:05:04.389> load<00:05:04.680> when<00:05:05.680> the<00:05:05.770> snow<00:05:05.949> starts

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:06.249 
about the snow load when the snow starts

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:08.129 
about the snow load when the snow starts
sliding<00:05:06.610> off<00:05:06.729> and<00:05:07.389> we<00:05:07.479> just<00:05:07.509> don't<00:05:07.900> worry

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
sliding off and we just don't worry

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.830 
sliding off and we just don't worry
about<00:05:08.169> it<00:05:08.409> snow<00:05:09.310> load<00:05:09.520> the<00:05:10.090> only<00:05:10.300> thing<00:05:10.719> we

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
about it snow load the only thing we

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.149 
about it snow load the only thing we
worry<00:05:11.020> about<00:05:11.080> the<00:05:11.349> snow<00:05:11.560> is<00:05:11.740> when<00:05:11.889> you<00:05:12.009> walk

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:12.159 
worry about the snow is when you walk

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:13.679 
worry about the snow is when you walk
out<00:05:12.370> the<00:05:12.400> door<00:05:12.550> that<00:05:12.729> it<00:05:12.969> doesn't<00:05:13.270> slide<00:05:13.479> and

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:13.689 
out the door that it doesn't slide and

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:17.010 
out the door that it doesn't slide and
land<00:05:13.810> on<00:05:13.930> your<00:05:14.020> head<00:05:15.419> now<00:05:16.419> we're<00:05:16.659> building

this<00:05:17.139> greenhouse<00:05:17.770> is<00:05:18.310> that<00:05:19.169> summer<00:05:20.169> heat

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:20.439 
this greenhouse is that summer heat

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:22.950 
this greenhouse is that summer heat
doesn't<00:05:21.310> bother<00:05:21.639> the<00:05:21.819> plants<00:05:22.210> the<00:05:22.719> way<00:05:22.840> you'd

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
doesn't bother the plants the way you'd

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.219 
doesn't bother the plants the way you'd
think<00:05:23.550> we<00:05:24.550> walk<00:05:24.759> in<00:05:25.000> here<00:05:25.029> it's<00:05:25.300> 120<00:05:25.960> degrees

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
think we walk in here it's 120 degrees

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:28.290 
think we walk in here it's 120 degrees
and<00:05:26.500> she<00:05:26.650> and<00:05:26.770> I<00:05:26.800> go<00:05:26.979> okay<00:05:27.279> get<00:05:27.789> your<00:05:27.939> kool-aid

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
and she and I go okay get your kool-aid

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.850 
and she and I go okay get your kool-aid
out<00:05:28.509> get<00:05:28.750> your<00:05:28.900> lunch<00:05:29.139> and<00:05:29.349> get<00:05:29.500> out<00:05:29.620> of<00:05:29.650> here

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
out get your lunch and get out of here

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.499 
out get your lunch and get out of here
because<00:05:29.919> it's<00:05:30.159> too<00:05:30.279> hot<00:05:30.490> the<00:05:31.029> plants<00:05:31.360> just

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:31.509 
because it's too hot the plants just

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:33.540 
because it's too hot the plants just
live<00:05:31.839> right<00:05:32.080> through<00:05:32.379> it<00:05:32.529> and<00:05:32.710> temperature

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
live right through it and temperature

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.309 
live right through it and temperature
isn't<00:05:33.729> really<00:05:34.089> the<00:05:34.240> determining<00:05:34.900> factor

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 
isn't really the determining factor

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:36.659 
isn't really the determining factor
whether<00:05:35.439> plants<00:05:35.860> grow<00:05:36.069> well<00:05:36.099> it's<00:05:36.490> how

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
whether plants grow well it's how

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.869 
whether plants grow well it's how
intense<00:05:37.330> the<00:05:37.539> sunshine<00:05:37.990> is<00:05:38.199> and<00:05:38.610> outside<00:05:39.610> in

00:05:39.869 --> 00:05:39.879 
intense the sunshine is and outside in

intense the sunshine is and outside in
the<00:05:39.999> wind<00:05:40.210> or<00:05:40.539> in<00:05:40.870> the<00:05:40.960> fast-moving<00:05:41.379> air<00:05:41.800> as<00:05:42.009> we

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
call it here they dry so fast that the

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.089 
call it here they dry so fast that the
sunshine<00:05:46.750> is<00:05:46.900> really<00:05:47.139> hard<00:05:47.349> on<00:05:47.469> but<00:05:47.650> in<00:05:47.800> here

sunshine is really hard on but in here
they<00:05:48.819> don't<00:05:49.060> drive<00:05:49.479> very<00:05:49.659> fast<00:05:49.930> you<00:05:50.680> haven't

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
they don't drive very fast you haven't

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:52.980 
they don't drive very fast you haven't
found<00:05:51.039> anything<00:05:51.370> that's<00:05:51.759> burned<00:05:52.120> why<00:05:52.599> see<00:05:52.810> our

plants over there on that edge because
of<00:05:58.960> it<00:05:59.050> and<00:05:59.469> we<00:05:59.560> have<00:05:59.710> this<00:05:59.860> because

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
of it and we have this because

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.119 
of it and we have this because
comparison<00:06:01.240> all<00:06:01.389> day<00:06:01.539> long<00:06:01.719> we<00:06:02.289> can<00:06:02.500> tell<00:06:02.710> that

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:03.129 
comparison all day long we can tell that

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:06.069 
we've done we've done what was that soil

no<00:06:07.930> we<00:06:08.050> were<00:06:08.439> doing<00:06:08.649> a<00:06:08.740> growth<00:06:08.949> chest<00:06:09.339> one<00:06:09.610> on

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:09.759 
no we were doing a growth chest one on

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:13.409 
no we were doing a growth chest one on
the<00:06:10.330> tomatoes<00:06:10.779> tomatoes<00:06:11.319> in<00:06:11.949> the<00:06:12.339> first<00:06:12.610> bench

the tomatoes tomatoes in the first bench

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:15.360 
the tomatoes tomatoes in the first bench
over<00:06:13.689> here<00:06:13.719> doesn't<00:06:14.289> grow<00:06:14.469> as<00:06:14.740> well<00:06:15.009> as<00:06:15.219> the

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
over here doesn't grow as well as the

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.279 
over here doesn't grow as well as the
center<00:06:15.669> two<00:06:15.819> benches<00:06:16.240> because<00:06:16.810> it's<00:06:17.139> too

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
center two benches because it's too

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:18.990 
center two benches because it's too
close<00:06:17.409> to<00:06:17.649> that<00:06:17.680> extreme<00:06:18.129> temperature<00:06:18.639> too

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
close to that extreme temperature too

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.869 
close to that extreme temperature too
hot<00:06:19.180> and<00:06:19.300> too<00:06:19.360> cold<00:06:19.589> without<00:06:20.589> cooling<00:06:20.949> it<00:06:21.279> you

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:21.879 
hot and too cold without cooling it you

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:24.869 
hot and too cold without cooling it you
find<00:06:22.240> that<00:06:22.479> the<00:06:22.779> the<00:06:23.439> plants<00:06:24.370> haven't<00:06:24.699> ever

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:24.879 
find that the the plants haven't ever

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:26.369 
find that the the plants haven't ever
been<00:06:25.029> stressed<00:06:25.539> except<00:06:25.930> where<00:06:26.110> you<00:06:26.229> have

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:26.379 
been stressed except where you have

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:28.230 
been stressed except where you have
close<00:06:26.860> to<00:06:27.039> polycarbonate<00:06:27.729> or<00:06:27.939> the<00:06:28.029> clear

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
close to polycarbonate or the clear

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.899 
close to polycarbonate or the clear
material<00:06:28.750> yeah<00:06:28.960> it's<00:06:29.379> been<00:06:29.560> amazing<00:06:29.909> that's

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:30.909 
material yeah it's been amazing that's

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:32.909 
material yeah it's been amazing that's
you<00:06:31.330> know<00:06:31.419> part<00:06:31.629> of<00:06:31.750> what<00:06:31.810> you<00:06:31.990> do<00:06:32.139> in<00:06:32.500> growing

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 
you know part of what you do in growing

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:35.249 
you know part of what you do in growing
crops<00:06:33.250> well<00:06:33.520> as<00:06:33.729> you<00:06:33.879> keep<00:06:34.569> the<00:06:34.689> extremes<00:06:35.080> away

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:35.259 
crops well as you keep the extremes away

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:37.320 
crops well as you keep the extremes away
from<00:06:35.500> and<00:06:35.949> that's<00:06:36.069> what<00:06:36.279> sollux<00:06:36.669> does<00:06:36.909> so<00:06:37.149> well

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
from and that's what sollux does so well

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.350 
from and that's what sollux does so well
is<00:06:37.960> that<00:06:38.020> it's<00:06:38.770> all<00:06:38.979> indirect<00:06:39.490> lighting

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
is that it's all indirect lighting

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.540 
is that it's all indirect lighting
and<00:06:40.479> it's<00:06:41.259> a<00:06:41.349> lot<00:06:41.590> of<00:06:41.710> indirect<00:06:42.099> lighting<00:06:42.310> when

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
and it's a lot of indirect lighting when

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.820 
and it's a lot of indirect lighting when
it's<00:06:42.729> in<00:06:42.939> July<00:06:43.240> here<00:06:43.599> it's<00:06:43.990> really<00:06:44.319> bright<00:06:44.560> but

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:44.830 
it's in July here it's really bright but

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.950 
it's in July here it's really bright but
it's<00:06:45.729> indirect<00:06:46.210> and<00:06:46.330> doesn't<00:06:46.539> burn<00:06:46.659> the<00:06:46.689> crops

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 
it's indirect and doesn't burn the crops

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.110 
it's indirect and doesn't burn the crops
so<00:06:47.439> we<00:06:47.590> don't<00:06:47.770> have<00:06:47.919> holes<00:06:48.340> in<00:06:48.550> our<00:06:48.669> leaves<00:06:48.879> or

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 
so we don't have holes in our leaves or

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.450 
so we don't have holes in our leaves or
dried<00:06:49.360> dried<00:06:49.810> plants<00:06:50.169> burnt<00:06:50.379> leaves<00:06:50.560> its

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
dried dried plants burnt leaves its

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.879 
dried dried plants burnt leaves its
consequent<00:06:51.849> we<00:06:51.939> don't<00:06:52.120> have<00:06:52.590> stress<00:06:55.259> so<00:06:56.259> then

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:56.889 
consequent we don't have stress so then

00:06:56.889 --> 00:06:59.730 
consequent we don't have stress so then
your<00:06:57.400> look<00:06:58.150> would<00:06:58.569> you<00:06:58.599> you'd<00:06:59.050> purchase<00:06:59.560> Sol

00:06:59.730 --> 00:06:59.740 
your look would you you'd purchase Sol

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.850 
your look would you you'd purchase Sol
Sol<00:07:00.069> X<00:07:00.280> again<00:07:00.639> for<00:07:00.909> your<00:07:01.060> other<00:07:01.210> greenhouses

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.050 
have you got a look at Sol X because

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.019 
have you got a look at Sol X because
it's<00:07:14.229> just<00:07:14.529> a<00:07:14.740> different<00:07:15.400> way<00:07:15.490> to<00:07:15.520> grow<00:07:15.759> things

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:16.029 
it's just a different way to grow things

it's just a different way to grow things
your<00:07:16.240> roses<00:07:16.629> are<00:07:16.779> probably<00:07:17.139> better<00:07:17.409> you

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:18.039 
your roses are probably better you

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:19.439 
your roses are probably better you
