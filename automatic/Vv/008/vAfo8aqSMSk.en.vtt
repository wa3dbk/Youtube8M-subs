00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 hello everyone I'm styling in 1987 and today 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.280
 I made a video about things 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.889
 interesting that surely many of 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.920
 you do not know about animals the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.929
 people and so on when they listen to what 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.199
 I'm going to tell you they're going to keep the 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.380
 open mouth and they will not be able to believe it 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:24.150
 good let's start I hope you enjoy it 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:29.130
 this is a multiplication between 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:33.420
 numbers 111 million 111 thousand 111 x 111 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.700
 million 111 thousand 111 you will say that 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.430
 it's a simple multiplication but not 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.930
 it's like that now I'll do this account with the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.360
 calculator and they will stay 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.950
 surprised with the result that is going 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.579
 to give good we solve 111 million 111 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.850
 one thousand 111 multiplied by 111 million 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.399
 111,111 is equal to 'aa' to 'aa-' 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.899
 Believe it or not, that is the result 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.260
 if you do not believe me 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.600
 see for yourselves 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.510
 awesome not good let's move on to another 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.640

 sneeze with eyes wide open 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.490
 they heard nobody is able to do that 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.500
 since it is a reflection of our body 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.860
 they knew that phosphorus was invented after 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.890
