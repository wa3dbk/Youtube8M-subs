to reheat if your car is going to feel

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.639 
to reheat if your car is going to feel

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
the same you know there's a lot of

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.100 
the same you know there's a lot of
factors<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:51.299> know<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.509> turn<00:01:51.869> three<00:01:52.049> and

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
factors and you know that turn three and

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.660 
factors and you know that turn three and
four<00:01:52.320> was<00:01:52.500> awful<00:01:52.770> tricky<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.130> didn't<00:01:53.399> know<00:01:53.490> if

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
four was awful tricky I didn't know if

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.490 
four was awful tricky I didn't know if
you<00:01:54.240> know<00:01:54.360> if<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.509> was<00:01:54.630> going<00:01:54.810> fast<00:01:55.079> enough<00:01:55.229> on

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
you know if I was going fast enough on

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.109 
you know if I was going fast enough on
the<00:01:55.619> top<00:01:55.829> there<00:01:56.100> just<00:01:56.399> didn't<00:01:56.939> seem<00:01:56.969> like

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
the top there just didn't seem like

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.490 
the top there just didn't seem like
there<00:01:57.329> was<00:01:57.390> anything<00:01:57.630> else<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.020> get<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.170> hold<00:01:58.380> of

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
there was anything else to get a hold of

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.679 
there was anything else to get a hold of
so<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:59.579> know<00:01:59.670> tried<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.000> beat<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.180> as<00:02:00.360> long<00:02:00.540> as

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
so you know tried to beat it as long as

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.270 
so you know tried to beat it as long as
I<00:02:00.780> could<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.619> know<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:01.950> don't<00:02:02.100> want<00:02:02.219> to

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
I could and you know you don't want to

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.889 
I could and you know you don't want to
get<00:02:02.399> yourself<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:02.820> trouble<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.600> then<00:02:03.780> bounce

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
get yourself in trouble and then bounce

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.510 
get yourself in trouble and then bounce
off<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.290> fence<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.710> knock<00:02:04.860> tire<00:02:05.130> down<00:02:05.310> either

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
off the fence and knock tire down either

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.639 
off the fence and knock tire down either
so<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.450> got<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.630> be<00:02:06.689> somewhat<00:02:07.020> cautious<00:02:07.170> and

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
so you got to be somewhat cautious and

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.229 
so you got to be somewhat cautious and
that's<00:02:08.129> probably<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.520> biggest<00:02:08.610> factor<00:02:09.060> in

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
that's probably the biggest factor in

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.450 
that's probably the biggest factor in
the<00:02:09.360> yellows<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.840> a

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
the yellows is a

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.700 
the yellows is a
