00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
understand what was going on and then I

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.990 
understand what was going on and then I
came<00:00:43.230> out<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.739> check<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:44.190> first<00:00:44.579> flush<00:00:44.789> system

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.940 
came out to check to first flush system
and<00:00:45.450> found<00:00:46.489> that<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:48.050> second<00:00:49.050> arm<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.770> the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
and found that the second arm of the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.889 
and found that the second arm of the
first<00:00:50.190> flush<00:00:50.430> system<00:00:50.640> has<00:00:51.449> fallen<00:00:51.780> over<00:00:53.899> again

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
first flush system has fallen over again

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.600 
first flush system has fallen over again
as<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.230> mentioned<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.680> video<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.010> didn't<00:00:56.460> glue

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
as I mentioned the video I didn't glue

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.779 
as I mentioned the video I didn't glue
anything<00:00:56.910> because<00:00:57.300> I'm<00:00:57.449> still<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:58.199> testing

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
anything because I'm still just testing

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:00.979 
anything because I'm still just testing
so<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.820> was<00:01:00.090> fine<00:01:00.329> but<00:01:00.539> when<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.719> looked

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
so that was fine but when I looked

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.490 
so that was fine but when I looked
inside<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:02.039> didn't<00:01:02.820> see<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.270> water<00:01:03.600> bottle

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
inside I didn't see the water bottle

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.429 
inside I didn't see the water bottle
that<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.739> had<00:01:04.949> put<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.220> there<00:01:05.400> as<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.549> float<00:01:05.939> to

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
that I had put in there as a float to

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.510 
that I had put in there as a float to
stop<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.650> floaties<00:01:08.540> so<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.930> did<00:01:10.920> take<00:01:11.100> off<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
stop the floaties so I did take off the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.510 
stop the floaties so I did take off the
the<00:01:11.939> end<00:01:12.210> cap<00:01:12.450> here<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.869> just<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.770> whole<00:01:14.040> bunch

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
the end cap here and just a whole bunch

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.820 
the end cap here and just a whole bunch
of<00:01:14.729> dirty<00:01:15.060> water<00:01:15.360> just<00:01:15.689> flooded<00:01:16.229> out<00:01:16.380> which

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
of dirty water just flooded out which

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.100 
of dirty water just flooded out which
was<00:01:17.070> great<00:01:17.430> because<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.030> water<00:01:18.270> up<00:01:18.540> here<00:01:18.930> is

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
was great because the water up here is

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.679 
was great because the water up here is
nice<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.680> clean<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.250> then<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.240> thought<00:01:21.450> well<00:01:21.630> I

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
nice and clean and then I thought well I

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.749 
nice and clean and then I thought well I
wonder<00:01:21.960> how<00:01:22.080> dirty<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.590> water<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.369> took

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
wonder how dirty this water is so I took

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.539 
wonder how dirty this water is so I took
this<00:01:23.970> cap<00:01:24.210> off<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.810> I'm<00:01:25.110> not<00:01:25.799> as<00:01:25.950> much<00:01:26.220> but

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
this cap off and I'm not as much but

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.399 
this cap off and I'm not as much but
quite<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.090> bit<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.330> dirty<00:01:27.509> water<00:01:27.780> came<00:01:28.140> out<00:01:28.290> of

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
quite a bit of dirty water came out of

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.440 
quite a bit of dirty water came out of
there<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.430> know<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.240> first

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
there to it so I know that the first

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.050 
there to it so I know that the first
flush<00:01:30.750> system<00:01:31.200> works<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:32.460> doing<00:01:32.670> exactly

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
flush system works so it's doing exactly

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.910 
flush system works so it's doing exactly
what<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.299> supposed<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.600> do<00:01:33.750> but<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.500> bottle

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
what it's supposed to do but the bottle

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.060 
what it's supposed to do but the bottle
didn't<00:01:35.189> float<00:01:35.689> so<00:01:36.689> what<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.900> did<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.920> got<00:01:37.950> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
didn't float so what I did is I got a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.260 
didn't float so what I did is I got a
scrap<00:01:38.460> piece<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.680> tubing<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.890> PVC<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.090> had

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
scrap piece of tubing a PVC that I had

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.240 
scrap piece of tubing a PVC that I had
leftover<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.680> put<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:43.950> down<00:01:44.100> on<00:01:44.220> the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
leftover and I just put it down on the

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.639 
leftover and I just put it down on the
bottom<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.509> pipe<00:01:45.720> up<00:01:45.930> at<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.140> bottle<00:01:46.530> in

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
bottom of the pipe up at the bottle in

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.350 
bottom of the pipe up at the bottle in
and<00:01:46.890> then<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.100> put<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.399> inside<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.909> bottom

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
and then I put this inside the bottom

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.999 
and then I put this inside the bottom
which<00:01:49.200> which<00:01:49.759> push<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:51.000> further<00:01:51.240> inside

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009

put<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.899> camera<00:02:01.110> down<00:02:01.259> because<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.310> going

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
put the camera down because it's going

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.980 
put the camera down because it's going
to<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.700> difficult<00:02:02.880> but<00:02:03.180> I'm<00:02:03.270> going<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.450> put<00:02:03.600> as

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
to be difficult but I'm going to put as

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.340 
to be difficult but I'm going to put as
this<00:02:04.439> in<00:02:04.710> first<00:02:05.540> I'm<00:02:06.540> going<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.750> put<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.110> on

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
this in first I'm going to put this on

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.740 
this in first I'm going to put this on
and<00:02:07.770> then<00:02:08.670> I'm<00:02:08.759> going<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.910> put<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.119> end<00:02:09.239> cap<00:02:09.509> on

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
and then I'm going to put the end cap on

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.620 
and then I'm going to put the end cap on
and<00:02:10.050> what

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
and what

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.080 
and what
this<00:02:10.780> rain<00:02:11.080> it'll<00:02:11.950> probably<00:02:12.220> take<00:02:12.550> maybe<00:02:12.880> a

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
this rain it'll probably take maybe a

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.260 
this rain it'll probably take maybe a
couple<00:02:13.420> minutes<00:02:13.690> to<00:02:13.960> fill<00:02:13.990> up<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.380> pipe

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
couple minutes to fill up the pipe

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.030 
couple minutes to fill up the pipe
okay<00:02:16.270> get<00:02:16.630> it<00:02:16.720> assembled<00:02:17.020> I<00:02:17.530> still<00:02:17.800> have<00:02:17.920> this

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
okay get it assembled I still have this

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.310 
okay get it assembled I still have this
as<00:02:18.250> it's<00:02:18.460> so<00:02:18.580> it's<00:02:18.700> still<00:02:18.880> dripping<00:02:19.060> out<00:02:19.390> slow

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
as it's so it's still dripping out slow

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.830 
as it's so it's still dripping out slow
drip<00:02:20.590> hopefully<00:02:21.520> the<00:02:21.670> bottles<00:02:22.060> coming<00:02:22.330> up<00:02:22.570> now

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
drip hopefully the bottles coming up now

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.720 
drip hopefully the bottles coming up now
and<00:02:23.830> floating<00:02:24.490> it<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.790> top<00:02:26.340> as<00:02:27.340> we<00:02:27.520> hear

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
and floating it to the top as we hear

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.090 
and floating it to the top as we hear
that<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.180> pitch<00:02:28.420> change<00:02:28.870> we<00:02:29.680> know<00:02:29.830> that<00:02:30.010> the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
that the pitch change we know that the

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.850 
that the pitch change we know that the
bottle<00:02:30.460> almost<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:32.040> elbow<00:02:33.040> here<00:02:34.860> that

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
bottle almost to the elbow here that

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.650 
bottle almost to the elbow here that
nice<00:02:36.160> clean<00:02:37.260> rainwater<00:02:38.260> I<00:02:38.710> was<00:02:39.700> asked<00:02:40.240> if<00:02:40.360> I

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
nice clean rainwater I was asked if I

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.870 
nice clean rainwater I was asked if I
need<00:02:40.870> what<00:02:41.290> what<00:02:41.470> I<00:02:41.500> need<00:02:41.770> to<00:02:41.860> do<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.160> purify<00:02:42.850> it

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
need what what I need to do to purify it

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.510 
need what what I need to do to purify it
and<00:02:43.270> I<00:02:43.450> my<00:02:44.050> response<00:02:44.500> was<00:02:44.740> I<00:02:44.980> don't<00:02:45.040> plan<00:02:45.460> on

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
and I my response was I don't plan on

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.110 
and I my response was I don't plan on
purifying<00:02:46.330> it<00:02:46.630> I<00:02:47.560> think<00:02:48.460> it's<00:02:48.610> great<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:49.000> way

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
purifying it I think it's great the way

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.280 
purifying it I think it's great the way
it<00:02:49.240> is<00:02:49.420> oh<00:02:49.770> here<00:02:50.770> comes<00:02:50.800> a<00:02:51.010> model<00:02:51.340> there<00:02:51.730> we<00:02:51.850> go

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
it is oh here comes a model there we go

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.350 
it is oh here comes a model there we go
there<00:02:53.290> it<00:02:53.410> is<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.870> it's<00:02:56.050> on<00:02:56.230> its<00:02:56.290> way<00:02:56.590> up<00:02:57.360> it's

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
there it is and it's on its way up it's

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.020 
there it is and it's on its way up it's
working

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
working

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.520 
working
look<00:03:01.030> at<00:03:01.180> that<00:03:01.690> probably<00:03:02.110> a<00:03:02.140> lot<00:03:02.230> of<00:03:02.320> highs

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
look at that probably a lot of highs

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.960 
look at that probably a lot of highs
it's<00:03:02.710> going<00:03:02.980> to<00:03:03.040> get<00:03:03.160> to<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.550> water<00:03:03.700> is<00:03:03.850> going

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
it's going to get to the water is going

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.970 
it's going to get to the water is going
to<00:03:04.030> come<00:03:04.090> on<00:03:04.270> and<00:03:05.170> it<00:03:05.380> would<00:03:05.470> continue<00:03:05.830> to

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
to come on and it would continue to

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:13.530 
to come on and it would continue to
float<00:03:06.280> up<00:03:06.750> on<00:03:07.750> as<00:03:08.440> I<00:03:08.560> can<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:12.700> float<00:03:12.910> up<00:03:13.120> as<00:03:13.330> the

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
float up on as I can to float up as the

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.620 
float up on as I can to float up as the
water<00:03:13.780> level<00:03:14.080> increases<00:03:15.990> obviously<00:03:18.390> there<00:03:19.390> it

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
water level increases obviously there it

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.980 
water level increases obviously there it
goes

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
goes

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.810 
goes
you're<00:03:20.950> going<00:03:21.100> to<00:03:21.190> raise<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.460> up<00:03:21.520> a<00:03:21.640> little

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
you're going to raise it up a little

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.530 
you're going to raise it up a little
more

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:33.350 

it<00:03:27.540> is<00:03:27.720> floating<00:03:28.410> on<00:03:28.680> this<00:03:28.800> way<00:03:29.010> up<00:03:29.190> okay<00:03:32.210> so<00:03:33.210> as

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
it is floating on this way up okay so as

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.910 
it is floating on this way up okay so as
I<00:03:33.570> was<00:03:33.750> saying<00:03:33.810> so<00:03:34.170> that<00:03:34.290> looks<00:03:34.440> like<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.680> works

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
I was saying so that looks like it works

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.890 
I was saying so that looks like it works
great<00:03:35.220> put<00:03:35.430> a<00:03:35.460> little<00:03:35.610> spacing<00:03:36.150> below<00:03:36.420> so<00:03:36.720> gets

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
great put a little spacing below so gets

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.740 
great put a little spacing below so gets
around<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.230> elbow<00:03:38.000> so<00:03:39.000> as<00:03:39.180> I<00:03:39.420> would<00:03:39.600> say<00:03:39.720> I

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
around the elbow so as I would say I

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.840 
around the elbow so as I would say I
don't<00:03:40.020> plan<00:03:40.140> on<00:03:40.200> filters<00:03:40.680> how<00:03:40.860> purifying<00:03:41.670> my

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
don't plan on filters how purifying my

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.700 
don't plan on filters how purifying my
water<00:03:42.120> because<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.540> things<00:03:42.750> great<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.590> way

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
water because the things great the way

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.340 
water because the things great the way
it<00:03:43.860> is<00:03:44.010> however<00:03:44.820> I<00:03:45.090> would<00:03:45.810> follow<00:03:46.020> the

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
it is however I would follow the

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.190 
it is however I would follow the
directions<00:03:46.890> on<00:03:47.310> having<00:03:48.150> pouring<00:03:48.570> just<00:03:49.110> a

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
directions on having pouring just a

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.050 
directions on having pouring just a
little<00:03:49.440> bit<00:03:49.530> of<00:03:49.590> going<00:03:49.860> to<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.040> water<00:03:50.250> letting

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
little bit of going to the water letting

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.660 
little bit of going to the water letting
it<00:03:51.180> settle<00:03:51.510> so<00:03:52.050> it<00:03:52.170> can<00:03:52.290> air<00:03:52.470> out<00:03:52.650> and<00:03:53.400> then<00:03:53.550> you

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
it settle so it can air out and then you

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.000 
it settle so it can air out and then you
think<00:03:54.000> what<00:03:54.180> if<00:03:54.300> we<00:03:54.420> were<00:03:54.540> about<00:03:54.840> in<00:03:55.740> straight

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
think what if we were about in straight

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.510 
think what if we were about in straight
rain<00:03:56.220> water<00:03:56.460> that<00:03:57.080> man<00:03:58.080> I<00:03:58.110> love<00:03:58.620> rain<00:03:58.980> water<00:03:59.220> is

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
rain water that man I love rain water is

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.200 
rain water that man I love rain water is
so<00:03:59.850> good<00:04:00.210> tasting<00:04:01.400> there<00:04:02.400> we<00:04:02.490> go<00:04:02.580> so<00:04:03.000> there's

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
so good tasting there we go so there's

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.550 
so good tasting there we go so there's
the<00:04:03.360> first<00:04:03.510> flash<00:04:03.780> system<00:04:03.990> Hondo<00:04:04.350> go<00:04:04.410> ahead

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
the first flash system Hondo go ahead

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.650 
the first flash system Hondo go ahead
and<00:04:04.830> close<00:04:05.130> this<00:04:05.310> back<00:04:05.520> up<00:04:05.760> cause<00:04:06.240> I<00:04:06.360> want<00:04:06.510> to

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
and close this back up cause I want to

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.640 
and close this back up cause I want to
test<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:08.160> overflow<00:04:09.170> so<00:04:10.170> we're<00:04:10.320> going<00:04:10.410> to<00:04:10.470> put

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
test the overflow so we're going to put

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.900 
test the overflow so we're going to put
we're<00:04:10.860> going<00:04:10.980> to<00:04:11.040> put<00:04:11.160> this<00:04:11.250> up<00:04:11.460> the<00:04:11.550> tube<00:04:11.730> back

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
we're going to put this up the tube back

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.580 
we're going to put this up the tube back
on<00:04:12.180> I'm<00:04:12.690> just<00:04:12.780> going<00:04:12.960> to<00:04:13.020> hold<00:04:13.170> it<00:04:13.260> on<00:04:13.350> with<00:04:13.560> a

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
on I'm just going to hold it on with a

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.210 
on I'm just going to hold it on with a
couple<00:04:14.310> zip<00:04:14.640> ties<00:04:14.850> and<00:04:15.300> and<00:04:16.260> then<00:04:16.560> we'll<00:04:17.010> see

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
couple zip ties and and then we'll see

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.110 
couple zip ties and and then we'll see
how<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.400> overflow<00:04:17.850> works<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:20.430> overflow<00:04:20.940> is

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
how the overflow works the overflow is

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.350 
how the overflow works the overflow is
working<00:04:21.570> great

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
working great

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.050 
working great
however<00:04:24.360> we<00:04:25.260> are<00:04:25.470> getting<00:04:25.890> a<00:04:26.190> little<00:04:26.550> bit<00:04:26.850> of

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
however we are getting a little bit of

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.640 
however we are getting a little bit of
overflow<00:04:27.800> up<00:04:28.800> here<00:04:29.610> out<00:04:29.880> of<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.240> vent<00:04:30.540> so<00:04:31.080> I've

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
overflow up here out of the vent so I've

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.270 
overflow up here out of the vent so I've
got<00:04:32.300> actual<00:04:33.300> piece<00:04:33.450> of<00:04:33.630> PVC<00:04:33.810> to<00:04:34.260> have<00:04:34.410> left

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
got actual piece of PVC to have left

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.030 
got actual piece of PVC to have left
over<00:04:35.580> I'm<00:04:36.030> just<00:04:36.090> going<00:04:36.390> to<00:04:36.480> add<00:04:36.630> it<00:04:36.780> to<00:04:36.810> this<00:04:37.050> go

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
over I'm just going to add it to this go

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.160 
over I'm just going to add it to this go
up<00:04:38.220> a<00:04:38.280> little<00:04:38.370> bit<00:04:38.520> further<00:04:38.760> and<00:04:39.300> we'll<00:04:39.780> see<00:04:40.050> if

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
up a little bit further and we'll see if

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.990 
up a little bit further and we'll see if
that<00:04:40.320> solves<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.919> problem<00:04:40.950> I<00:04:43.070> took<00:04:44.070> just<00:04:44.790> a

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
that solves the problem I took just a

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.050 
that solves the problem I took just a
scrap<00:04:45.660> piece<00:04:45.990> of<00:04:46.020> PVC<00:04:46.350> I<00:04:47.070> didn't<00:04:47.700> cut<00:04:47.880> it

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
scrap piece of PVC I didn't cut it

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.690 
scrap piece of PVC I didn't cut it
that's<00:04:48.390> just<00:04:48.600> how<00:04:48.810> long<00:04:49.020> the<00:04:49.320> scrap<00:04:49.620> was<00:04:49.919> and<00:04:50.250> I

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
that's just how long the scrap was and I

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.080 
that's just how long the scrap was and I
added<00:04:51.240> a<00:04:51.510> connection<00:04:52.380> to<00:04:52.530> it<00:04:52.680> here<00:04:52.919> and<00:04:53.790> it

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
added a connection to it here and it

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.840 
added a connection to it here and it
took<00:04:54.390> care<00:04:54.540> of<00:04:54.600> the<00:04:54.690> problem<00:04:55.400> it<00:04:56.400> just<00:04:56.430> needs

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
took care of the problem it just needs

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.210 
took care of the problem it just needs
to<00:04:56.880> be<00:04:57.000> a<00:04:57.030> little<00:04:57.390> bit<00:04:57.480> higher<00:04:57.690> than<00:04:58.320> this<00:04:58.860> here

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
to be a little bit higher than this here

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.930 
to be a little bit higher than this here
so<00:04:59.430> I<00:04:59.460> would<00:04:59.730> probably<00:04:59.940> say<00:05:00.390> a<00:05:00.890> foot<00:05:01.890> or<00:05:02.160> so<00:05:02.669> up

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
so I would probably say a foot or so up

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.210 
so I would probably say a foot or so up
above<00:05:03.300> here<00:05:03.960> and<00:05:04.080> then<00:05:04.590> you<00:05:04.740> won't<00:05:04.890> have<00:05:05.040> the

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
above here and then you won't have the

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.440 
above here and then you won't have the
leaking<00:05:05.550> come<00:05:05.700> out<00:05:05.850> of<00:05:05.970> there<00:05:06.090> but<00:05:06.270> that

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
leaking come out of there but that

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.659 
leaking come out of there but that
certainly<00:05:07.260> took<00:05:07.380> care<00:05:07.560> of<00:05:07.590> the<00:05:07.710> problem<00:05:07.919> all

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
certainly took care of the problem all

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.700 
certainly took care of the problem all
the<00:05:09.090> water<00:05:09.300> is<00:05:09.660> coming<00:05:10.140> out<00:05:10.350> through<00:05:10.620> the

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
the water is coming out through the

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.030 
the water is coming out through the
overflow<00:05:11.570> things<00:05:12.570> are<00:05:12.720> looking<00:05:12.960> great<00:05:13.260> I'm

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
overflow things are looking great I'm

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.990 
overflow things are looking great I'm
excited<00:05:14.760> it's<00:05:15.030> raining<00:05:15.950> life<00:05:16.950> couldn't<00:05:17.730> be

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
excited it's raining life couldn't be

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.600 
excited it's raining life couldn't be
much<00:05:18.360> better<00:05:18.780> than<00:05:19.020> this<00:05:19.320> and<00:05:19.620> if<00:05:20.490> I

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
much better than this and if I

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.159 
much better than this and if I
complained<00:05:21.090> it<00:05:21.450> wouldn't<00:05:21.810> do<00:05:21.900> any<00:05:21.930> good

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
complained it wouldn't do any good

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:23.110 
complained it wouldn't do any good
anyway

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
anyway

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.000

the scrap piece of PVC to get the bottle

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.879 
the scrap piece of PVC to get the bottle
around<00:05:34.650> the<00:05:34.890> corner

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889

judgment up there to make it tall this
is<00:05:39.580> again<00:05:39.789> why<00:05:39.999> I<00:05:40.030> didn't<00:05:40.449> glue<00:05:40.629> everything<00:05:41.129> so

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:42.129 
is again why I didn't glue everything so

is again why I didn't glue everything so
I<00:05:42.189> can<00:05:42.249> make<00:05:42.490> these<00:05:42.639> adjustments<00:05:43.949> awesome

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419
