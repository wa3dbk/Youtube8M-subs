00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 there are good kids also today 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.980
 still good and flew again to the channel 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.920
 with the inactivity that always happens to me 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.440
 I do not have a fucking time and your 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.080
 noise and will see if today like this this week 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.870
 upload two videos or something like that I already have one 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.590
 prepared and nothing 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.590
 you see 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.020
 today I come to bring a tutorial worth a 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:34.190
 tutorial that is very 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.769
 the truth and good 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.160
 and this will serve both youtube 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:43.100
 youtube like everyone is worth and is 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.760
 on how to avoid civilian configure 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.760
 okay your channel 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.370
 and these are my accounts but I do not have my 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.380
 channel so you do not think that I subscribe 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.830
 with all my channel is worth 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.500
 and let's see channel and here will be my 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.780
 previous bad channel 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.340
 and it does not look and so it's configured 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.060
 before so you'll see what it would look like 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.060
 predetermined 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.030
 but it 's the same 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.500
 what we have to do is very simple 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.399
 we give this pencil 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.399
 to this the second 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.160
 we give it here in channel configuration 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.320
 do not change navigation on the channel is 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.960
 very simple and here we have to give 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.550
 activate and without these three will appear 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.010
 clicks probably because we 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.960
 we remove or it depends on the tastes if 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.030
 you want them to put the afip but that 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.030
 we are what you want I do not enter only 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.850
 remove because I do not like good at 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.270
 better to subscribe to give line but 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.159
 not only put a lot because if not the 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.350
 people are very gossip is 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.460
 and this also what you want new 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.460
 comments on the channel 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.180
 to see how long it takes the crap to get in 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.040
 good and here then ya g 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.640
 finally the look is saved and here 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.300
 we all have the trailer and here the 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.090
 lists 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.350
 now let's explain what management 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.709
 you imagine we would not have it 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:28.310
 because this is not because I believe this in 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:31.190
 my previous carbon here is worth entering 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.900
 that appear this was going to be empty that 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.940
 line we're all going to put here and we're going to 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.130
 watch popular videos these are the languages 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.230
 that have more visits of your channel worth 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.250
 will propose here this is should explain 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.890
 each videos uploaded in order of 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.840
 upload favorite videos that videos 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.180
 you make down favorites like 1a 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.769
 feed we go videos published the same 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.319
 video before what happens is that I'm at 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.750
 chance live now that if you're in 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:00.489
 direct good that is pretty scratched 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.750
 next events that is not something that 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.420
 many of you visit the truth events 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.430
 finished that neither 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.170
 a playlist created 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.329
 these are all lists of 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.909
 reproduction of textures and that begin 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:19.109
 to leave the analysts of appear the 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:21.060
 why you videos you have ordered and 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.600
 list for example a series then it 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.030
 start to see from 0 1 to 20 days 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.850
 and a playlist because tula is 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.140
 a playlist and you put title 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.490
 random games and has put the eye 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.370
 erasing 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:37.370
 behind serious erasing empty the 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.380
 saved playlists the 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.900
 twine let's go the same as before 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.420
 playlists the same as before 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.480
 he also comes out saying the same thing later 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.360
 here the subscriptions what to those who 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.940
 you are subscribed a group of people to 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.190
 what for example this that I have my 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.380
 channel to clicks will be promoted then here 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.540
 Well, it puts us here but in a big way 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.800
 other recent activities the 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.800
 leaders who have been laymen beech 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:10.990
 seen and most recent publications and 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:10.990
 here it is like this 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.150
 and for example let's create a list 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.060
 to receive it has been clear to us because 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.000
 there are people who are not clear about 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.470
 people that cost little that is not a 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.740
 playlist Let's see here 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.740
 for example 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:36.020
 and good kids here we leave everything and 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.520
 we have finished we have our channel 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.480
 nice beautiful and cheap already with this 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.280
 organize the one million subscribers 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:48.360

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:51.990
