android<00:00:40.440> 2.1<00:00:40.920> at<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.280> time<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.239> now<00:00:42.360> a

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
android 2.1 at that time this is now a

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.270 
android 2.1 at that time this is now a
gingerbread<00:00:42.840> version<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.590> we<00:00:43.950> heard<00:00:44.100> already

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
gingerbread version and we heard already

the<00:00:44.550> news<00:00:44.790> that<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.570> seems<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.470> stir<00:00:47.370> kinda

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
the news that it seems that a stir kinda

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.850 
the news that it seems that a stir kinda
ditched<00:00:47.910> honeycomb<00:00:48.630> or<00:00:48.870> kind<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.260> kind<00:00:49.710> of

shifted<00:00:50.400> the<00:00:50.550> release<00:00:50.880> date<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.510> device

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
shifted the release date for this device

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.600 
shifted the release date for this device
and<00:00:52.110> that's<00:00:52.470> why<00:00:52.590> we<00:00:52.620> can<00:00:52.860> see<00:00:53.070> only<00:00:53.250> a

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
and that's why we can see only a

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.160 
and that's why we can see only a
gingerbread<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.540> two<00:00:54.690> point<00:00:54.930> three<00:00:54.989> point

around the device we have our headset
jack<00:01:20.130> over<00:01:20.490> here<00:01:20.880> there's<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.569> power<00:01:21.810> button

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429

little reset button that looks to me

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.199 
little reset button that looks to me
like<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.780> speakers<00:01:28.289> as<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:29.069> mini<00:01:29.340> hdmi<00:01:29.940> and

I<00:02:39.670> think<00:02:40.120> it's<00:02:40.299> like<00:02:40.450> 499<00:02:41.019> US<00:02:41.439> dollars<00:02:42.810> so<00:02:43.810> this

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
I think it's like 499 US dollars so this

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.410 
I think it's like 499 US dollars so this
is<00:02:43.959> really<00:02:44.230> fast<00:02:44.650> graphics<00:02:45.159> look<00:02:45.310> great<00:02:46.060> and

is really fast graphics look great and
yeah<00:02:47.170> this<00:02:47.319> tablet<00:02:47.739> should<00:02:47.920> be<00:02:48.069> in<00:02:48.159> the<00:02:48.280> market

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430

I<00:02:48.700> think<00:02:48.730> in<00:02:49.260> q3<00:02:50.260> this<00:02:50.620> year<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:52.919> in<00:02:53.919> terms<00:02:54.879> of

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
I think in q3 this year and in terms of

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.740 
I think in q3 this year and in terms of
pricing<00:02:56.049> think<00:02:56.620> this<00:02:56.859> starts<00:02:57.340> below<00:02:57.879> 350

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
pricing think this starts below 350

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.140 
pricing think this starts below 350
years<00:02:59.079> dollars<00:02:59.650> so<00:03:00.340> it'd<00:03:00.489> definitely<00:03:00.730> be<00:03:01.000> a

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
years dollars so it'd definitely be a

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.020 
years dollars so it'd definitely be a
bargain<00:03:01.599> that's<00:03:02.109> the<00:03:02.290> new<00:03:02.500> acer<00:03:03.489> iconia<00:03:03.639> tab
