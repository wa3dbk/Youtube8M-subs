sound<00:04:08.640> fantastic<00:04:09.349> they're<00:04:10.349> never<00:04:10.500> going<00:04:10.709> to

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
sound fantastic they're never going to

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.559 
sound fantastic they're never going to
break<00:04:10.980> down<00:04:11.250> on<00:04:11.549> you<00:04:11.670> and<00:04:12.569> they<00:04:12.720> just<00:04:12.930> look

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
break down on you and they just look

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:31.969 
break down on you and they just look
cool<00:04:28.580> what<00:04:29.580> would<00:04:29.760> you<00:04:29.910> say<00:04:30.680> give<00:04:31.680> you<00:04:31.830> that

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
cool what would you say give you that

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:57.050 
cool what would you say give you that
kind<00:04:32.160> of<00:04:32.340> decision<00:04:38.750> today<00:04:39.750> I<00:04:40.220> expected<00:04:56.060> I'm

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
kind of decision today I expected I'm

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.490 
kind of decision today I expected I'm
running<00:04:57.389> a<00:04:57.449> couple<00:04:57.720> of<00:04:57.810> pedals<00:04:58.080> on<00:04:58.199> the<00:04:58.289> floor

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
running a couple of pedals on the floor

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:11.500 
running a couple of pedals on the floor
so<00:04:58.680> I<00:04:58.710> usually<00:04:59.280> get<00:04:59.400> my<00:04:59.460> lead<00:04:59.820> sound<00:05:00.210> with<00:05:08.180> I

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:34.560 

think<00:05:12.510> when<00:05:12.720> it<00:05:12.810> comes<00:05:13.020> to

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.050 

yeah<00:05:35.570> think<00:05:36.170> of<00:05:36.230> you<00:05:36.410> the<00:05:37.250> Bryant's<00:05:37.910> fish

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
yeah think of you the Bryant's fish

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.750 
yeah think of you the Bryant's fish
quite<00:05:38.270> like<00:05:38.540> I<00:05:38.570> didn't<00:05:38.900> tip<00:05:41.830> yeah<00:05:42.830> totally

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
quite like I didn't tip yeah totally

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.730 
quite like I didn't tip yeah totally
that's<00:05:44.390> the<00:05:44.510> beautiful<00:05:44.750> thing<00:05:44.900> about<00:05:45.050> it<00:05:45.470> it

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
that's the beautiful thing about it it

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
that's the beautiful thing about it it
does<00:05:46.220> so<00:05:46.490> much<00:05:46.670> more<00:05:46.730> than<00:05:47.420> what<00:05:47.960> you'd<00:05:48.080> get<00:05:48.290> in

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
does so much more than what you'd get in

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.590 
does so much more than what you'd get in
a<00:05:49.900> simple<00:05:50.900> amplifier<00:05:51.130> you've<00:05:52.130> got<00:05:52.280> way<00:05:52.520> more

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
a simple amplifier you've got way more

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.720 
a simple amplifier you've got way more
controls<00:05:53.600> to<00:05:53.900> change<00:05:54.350> it<00:05:54.620> just<00:05:54.830> a<00:05:55.430> little<00:05:55.580> any

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:55.730 
controls to change it just a little any

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.040 
controls to change it just a little any
kind<00:05:56.030> of<00:05:56.150> sound<00:05:56.330> that<00:05:56.390> you<00:05:56.510> want<00:05:56.720> and<00:05:56.990> the

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
kind of sound that you want and the

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:03.610 
kind of sound that you want and the
clean<00:05:57.290> sound<00:05:57.530> this<00:05:57.740> is<00:05:57.800> just<00:06:01.840> we<00:06:02.840> try<00:06:03.020> channels

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
clean sound this is just we try channels

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.860 
clean sound this is just we try channels
all<00:06:03.740> we<00:06:04.280> did<00:06:04.460> and<00:06:05.030> that<00:06:05.060> does<00:06:05.300> good<00:06:05.450> luck<00:06:05.660> the

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
all we did and that does good luck the

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:14.860 
all we did and that does good luck the
the<00:06:06.170> ac/dc<00:06:06.620> thing<00:06:07.010> really<00:06:07.190> well<00:06:12.970> I<00:06:13.970> think

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
the ac/dc thing really well I think

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.750 
the ac/dc thing really well I think
probably<00:06:15.110> what<00:06:15.440> I'll<00:06:15.560> do<00:06:15.860> I'll<00:06:16.310> probably<00:06:16.520> run

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
probably what I'll do I'll probably run

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.630 
probably what I'll do I'll probably run
it<00:06:16.940> with<00:06:17.590> the<00:06:18.590> crunch<00:06:18.860> channel<00:06:18.980> and<00:06:19.550> I'll

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:19.640 
it with the crunch channel and I'll

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.390 
it with the crunch channel and I'll
probably<00:06:19.820> click<00:06:20.300> in<00:06:20.480> Edel<00:06:21.290> to<00:06:22.070> get<00:06:22.250> that

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
probably click in Edel to get that

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.390 
probably click in Edel to get that
overdrive<00:06:22.910> sound<00:06:24.940> channels<00:06:27.100> yeah<00:06:28.100> I<00:06:28.130> think

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
overdrive sound channels yeah I think

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:36.630 
overdrive sound channels yeah I think
I'll<00:06:28.670> do<00:06:28.970> some<00:06:29.000> tinkering<00:06:29.540> some<00:06:29.900> tinkering

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:36.640 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.410 

some<00:06:37.640> thanks<00:06:38.270> for<00:06:38.510> Jen<00:06:38.690> good
