of the video you got two settings here

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.520 
of the video you got two settings here
infinite<00:01:22.719> and<00:01:23.380> macro<00:01:24.509> macro<00:01:25.509> obviously<00:01:26.439> you

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
infinite and macro macro obviously you

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.359 
infinite and macro macro obviously you
know<00:01:26.619> how<00:01:26.710> that<00:01:26.770> works<00:01:28.289> you<00:01:29.289> want<00:01:29.499> to<00:01:29.740> slide

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
know how that works you want to slide

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.410 
know how that works you want to slide
this<00:01:30.789> to<00:01:31.299> the<00:01:31.450> center<00:01:31.780> to<00:01:32.700> start<00:01:33.700> out<00:01:33.850> it's

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
this to the center to start out it's

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.539 
this to the center to start out it's
kinda<00:01:34.630> hard<00:01:34.719> to<00:01:34.810> do<00:01:35.020> after<00:01:36.009> you<00:01:36.100> do<00:01:36.219> it<00:01:36.249> you

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
kinda hard to do after you do it you

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.660 
kinda hard to do after you do it you
know<00:01:36.869> ten<00:01:37.869> thousand<00:01:38.259> times<00:01:38.409> starts<00:01:39.310> to<00:01:39.399> smooth

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
know ten thousand times starts to smooth

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.929 
know ten thousand times starts to smooth
out<00:01:39.789> so<00:01:40.090> you<00:01:40.179> can<00:01:40.329> do<00:01:41.079> it<00:01:41.200> with<00:01:41.289> one<00:01:41.710> finger<00:01:41.950> the

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
out so you can do it with one finger the

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:44.279 
out so you can do it with one finger the
first<00:01:43.090> couple<00:01:43.389> times<00:01:43.450> I<00:01:43.630> did<00:01:43.780> I<00:01:43.810> had<00:01:44.049> to<00:01:44.139> deal

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
first couple times I did I had to deal

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.010 
first couple times I did I had to deal
with<00:01:44.319> two<00:01:44.499> fingers<00:01:45.600> once<00:01:46.600> you<00:01:46.659> got<00:01:46.780> a<00:01:46.810> set

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
with two fingers once you got a set

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.289 
with two fingers once you got a set
Center<00:01:47.350> you<00:01:48.130> can<00:01:48.280> test<00:01:48.549> your<00:01:48.729> distance<00:01:49.149> with

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
Center you can test your distance with

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.319 
Center you can test your distance with
your<00:01:49.420> hand<00:01:49.659> to<00:01:49.840> see<00:01:50.020> how<00:01:50.259> far<00:01:50.499> you<00:01:50.679> can<00:01:50.709> go<00:01:51.009> out

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
your hand to see how far you can go out

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.899 
your hand to see how far you can go out
on<00:01:52.329> the<00:01:52.569> video<00:01:53.100> before<00:01:54.100> it<00:01:54.310> starts<00:01:54.609> to<00:01:54.729> blur

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
on the video before it starts to blur

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.239 
on the video before it starts to blur
and<00:01:55.179> then<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:56.200> closer<00:01:56.439> you<00:01:56.590> move<00:01:56.799> it<00:01:56.979> to<00:01:57.009> the

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:57.249 
and then the closer you move it to the

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:59.069 
and then the closer you move it to the
infinite<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:58.119> further<00:01:58.359> out<00:01:58.539> your<00:01:58.719> subject

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
infinite the further out your subject
