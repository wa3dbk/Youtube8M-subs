it up and trying to get the end up the
ground<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.760> dragon<00:00:57.330> it<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.780> an

engine that's been through a lifetime of
work<00:00:59.850> already<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.510> now<00:01:00.780> we've<00:01:01.080> brought<00:01:01.380> it

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
work already and now we've brought it

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.320 
work already and now we've brought it
out<00:01:01.650> here<00:01:01.710> these<00:01:02.309> guys<00:01:02.550> are<00:01:02.760> probably<00:01:02.880> used<00:01:03.239> to

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
out here these guys are probably used to

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.630 
out here these guys are probably used to
using<00:01:03.540> big<00:01:03.840> v8<00:01:04.229> sand<00:01:04.620> super<00:01:04.920> duties<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.370> think

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
using big v8 sand super duties I think

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.980 
using big v8 sand super duties I think
they're<00:01:05.790> going<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.940> be<00:01:06.090> shocked<00:01:06.390> at<00:01:06.600> how<00:01:06.750> this

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
they're going to be shocked at how this

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.950 
they're going to be shocked at how this
this<00:01:07.500> vehicle<00:01:07.950> pulls<00:01:08.190> guys<00:01:08.790> will<00:01:09.180> do<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:09.720> I

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
this vehicle pulls guys will do it but I

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:23.820
