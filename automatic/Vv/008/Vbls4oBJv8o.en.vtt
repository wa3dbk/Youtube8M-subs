up<00:05:51.860> as<00:05:51.979> well<00:05:52.009> because<00:05:52.520> there<00:05:52.669> have<00:05:52.819> been<00:05:52.909> a<00:05:53.029> lot

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
up as well because there have been a lot

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.760 
up as well because there have been a lot

00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 
meetups so while I find this to be a

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:00.610 
meetups so while I find this to be a
dull<00:05:59.000> episode<00:05:59.509> just<00:05:59.870> out<00:06:00.050> of<00:06:00.139> the<00:06:00.199> main<00:06:00.349> story

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
dull episode just out of the main story

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:02.509 
it's most certainly we've watchable but

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:05.890 
it's most certainly we've watchable but
until<00:06:03.229> next<00:06:03.379> time<00:06:03.710> to<00:06:04.310> the<00:06:04.400> staff<00:06:04.900> quit
