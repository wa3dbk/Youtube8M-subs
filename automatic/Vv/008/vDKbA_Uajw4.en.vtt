00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:12.579
 but now let's see another example 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:16.899
 why we will play more his techniques and theology of prosperity 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.699
 now let's go up from countless chapters 3 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.599
 another aspect of this doctrine of 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.580
 basically buy from ten 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.140
 negotiate with God to get some benefit 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.600
 many people have the idea that if you bring your tithes your offerings 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.330
 if you make sacrifices 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.190
 I had your home and donate church money things like that. 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.160
 I want to help account reach the head. 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.220
 the tv is very interesting today observing in the context a little bigger 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.410
 historic 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.080
 as many of today's evangelical churches are doing exactly the same 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.930
 thing 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.100
 that Protestants criticize the Catholic Church 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.060
 500 years ago 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.020
 one of the strongest criticisms of Martin Luther 500 years ago was the 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.740
 sale of indulgences 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.590
 the idea is that the person could use money to gain a weight factor 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.409
 henrique who according to him many of the evangelical health churches 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.330
 what good is 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.380
 to criticize a doctrine without the Catholic Church when the church in India 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.800
 who ends up doing the same thing 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.119
 said the people who can bring the money 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:30.420
 make offer 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.729
 bring the tithes and will achieve the beauty you want 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.060
 balloon preach doctrines 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.060
 he met a person who very much wanted a blessing from God 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.710
 a man called a night-shift 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.310
 king of moments of fear and food 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.250
 Malan was the one who found bullet that know that bullet that wanted this very much 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.229
 the balloon paulo freire prepare seven altars 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.570
 to sacrifice various animals over the local authorities and I go 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.210
 evoke the name of god 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.870
 and let's decide what you want 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.660
 did the first time 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.359
 nothing but did not give the beauty he wanted 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:12.049
 was extended seven more altars more sacrifices 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.509
 and again 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:17.749
 in the third time seven altars more sacrifices 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:19.519
 and one more time 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.539
 did not reach 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:23.939
 what to say I wanted 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.689
 bullet who was relying on a preacher 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.589
 technology posterity 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:31.909
 but this is the balance that sends normal here 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:34.759
 Why can not they be confirmed? 

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:39.190
 before the keirrison we find here the problem is that they do not fit 23 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.139
 what I found now 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:45.329
 by this club he spoke tip to seven altars 7 9 17 shipyards 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:49.219
 then talking the same thing to the dress 14 15 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:51.579
 29 and 30 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.059
 but the question 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:55.049
 what happened 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.319
 with this preacher of prosperity theology 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.369
 the end of the story countless 31 

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:06.639
 God used his own people and the people of Israel in a media war 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:07.549
 media 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.399
 it's on this day 

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:12.359
 numbers 31 dresses with eight 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.359
 said that among the dead was also balaram 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.619
 son of Dalva 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:21.579
 the one who preached the theology of prosperity 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.559
 the bullet that went into the scene when 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:28.859
 God Blessings Through His Sacrifice Chassis 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.930
 but somebody's steering all right I do not want to set fire to george I do not want 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.949
 back to the number brings his thing 

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:38.709
 not gibbous 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.460
 more 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.479
 I could not see sopranos 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:45.779
 that if we really are to create the tithe 

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:49.429
 God will open the windows of heaven and bless us twice 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.299
 three tenths without words 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.410
 of this type 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.869
 Let's see what it says. 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:58.869
 you have probably heard this verse several times 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:01.239
 the leader said 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.819
 bring bulls and we said the treasure hunt 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.219
 to have birth in my house and by several ministers 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.829
 says the Lord of hosts 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.029
 I can not open the windows right and not spill on the next step 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:16.289
 without measure 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.289
 nobody will deny that this is part 

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:22.639
 but we have to refrain from knowing the bible 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.790
 and understand that some things of asphalt certain people 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.969
 and not necessarily for us 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:33.119
 an example of this I can show a good progress of the bible that says that 

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:36.490
 to prepare for 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.590
 now you're going to do this than give up your house 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.999
 date to finish 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:43.490
 stay for the next world cup 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.289
 I think not me, I'm not doing it either. 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:50.770
 all my house or comfort a shack that leaves the river in the size it 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:51.770
 is not happy 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.770
 because we do not deserve and training 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:58.199
 surely it was nothing for us 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.510
 so the bible has promises given these and other people 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.360
 years have not been made 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.800
 God promised Abraham would have given a great maternal family 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.259
 henrique sotero that other families also have to understand 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:15.059
 God said when you spoke to me. 

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:18.409
 did not guarantee what I would have many descendants 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:21.300
 what would I have a land of my own descendants 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.540
 He said that to white and you have no right to pay a pledge made by 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.570
 someone else and will try to apply that is what it says 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.469
 malachias three decades 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:33.470
 it's part 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.550
 of the Old Testament 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.630
 was spoken and 400 years before the birth of Jesus Christ 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:43.110
 was told by God to the people said to drop a little physical 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.169
 in a physical land in the territory that dressed in erez 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.530
 when they had returned from captivity 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.710
 I was suffering in that land. 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.819
 and day 23 to join this service to me including me 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:56.740
 we demand 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.479
 which were part of the asset management unit 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:02.189
 and you will be blessed 

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:03.229
 but we do not see it 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:08.629
 nothing of a promise with the commandment that applies years nowadays
