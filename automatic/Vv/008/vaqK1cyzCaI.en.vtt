00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.879
 hello there will be a video about today 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.059
 headphones repair them now I'll start with the fact that 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.710
 I bought here such headphones 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.450
 chinese beats audio but it's chinese 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.680
 fake from some heard that here 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.960
 there are such chinese fake bizi 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.750
 have good sound quality and 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.430
 low price course music i don't them 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.859
 expected to listen just wanted 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.380
 use as headset here here 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.140
 such 4-pin phone jack 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.680
 smartphones but as for these 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.450
 Headphones of such Chinese bits look 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.170
 They are in principle quite good here such 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.200
 glossy plastic and you gotty pb 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.120
 As for the wire is so flat that 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.710
 concerns their quality the quality of course 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.010
 leaves much to be desired that is here 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.860
 You can look here the wire is this 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.530
 the wire is not glued is not soldered that is, it is 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.500
 just taken out and also inserted 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.109
 back that is such a disgusting 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.210
 quality 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:06.990
 as for the sound quality, it is 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.770
 just awful there is music in them just 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.450
 impossible plot about sound quality 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.860
 Here I have such a more accurate 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:20.130
 headset from smartphone nokia x2 house 7 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.540
 Now if you listen to music in these in this 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.930
 headset in these headphones 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.200
 then the sound leaves much to be desired 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.009
 just like a barrel from a terrible but if 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.170
 listen to the same music in these headphones 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:37.170
 the sound is just like an ass that is to listen 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.990
 just impossible while listening 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.970
 music just a desire to tear off 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.299
 never again nothing 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.100
 Now hear these headphones simply 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.369
 they are terrible move only trash 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.939
 throw a waste of money 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.520
 I told them just because I donâ€™t 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:00.570
 need new headphones I have decided here 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.460
 found such pioneers are they old them 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.189
 bent over the wire and they do not work 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.399
 so I decided to fix them for this 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:11.480
 I bought such rhythm headphones for 40 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.360
 rubles and here from them I will remove a wire 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.310
 and solder to these headphones in principle 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.680
 solder here is nothing complicated 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.659
 how simple I already know this top 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.930
 part of the plastic of these pioneers 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:27.049
 she removed can be hooked with a nail here 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.299
 such two latches on top this is removed 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:32.629
 parts and have access to the dynamics that is 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:35.120
 war with these headphones wires solder 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:38.000
 and take from here these rhythmics 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.590
 wire and why are these headphones just for the sake of 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.840
 interest still wanted to compare 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.209
 where is the sound quality even look and 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.150
 better or worse 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.940
 rhythmix and costs 40 rubles these beats 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.739
 audio 270 rubles right now for 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.870
 interest see where is the quality 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.030
 the sound is better though of course understandable and 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.160
 so on both headphones the quality 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.510
 will be just disgusting but here 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.940
 just for the sake of interest now compare 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.260
 I listened to music in different headphones 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.690
 these beats audio 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.730
 as I said sound just 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.849
 disgusting them only trash 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.359
 throw in the headset from nokia 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:20.480
 the sound is also bad but at least it's better than 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:23.660
 in these faces and that's about 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:27.230
 headphones from these rhythm for 40 rubles here 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.660
 These bizi cost 270 rubles, but these 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.340
 rhythm 40 rubles quality 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.139
 sounds better than here in these battles 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.230
 Of course the sound quality too 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:38.180
 disgusting i would say bad but 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.480
 better than in these faces 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.700
 worth 270 rubles here these costs 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.329
 40 rubles of course I do not advise them 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.819
 buy 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:49.340
 I bought them then it is solely because 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.739
 wire I certainly prefer 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.230
 still listening to music with headphones 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:57.709
 sennheiser I say such a friend 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.930
 snooping I want to hear music 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.799
 high quality with good sound 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.239
 Well, in general, now we will re-solder 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.549
 disassemble these rhythm and headphones here 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:12.169
 solder on 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:14.449
 the pioneers will now proceed to tpo it 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:18.199
 her wires with these pioneers 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:22.159
 these are by the way the pioneers are pretty good 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:24.280
 headphones remove silicone tips 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:26.650
 with these rhythmics and thieves 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.570
 we break them in the way that they are 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.800
 we don't need we only need 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:35.380
 only wire you are well here like this 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.169
 here is the speaker of it 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:42.669
 we unsolder it we no longer need us 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:44.860
 you need to turn on the wire that 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.680
 Concerns more speakers from headphones 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.050
 rhythmics stayed here too thought kindly 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.540
 do not disappear you can use them 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.720
 so small is installed inside 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.590
 a magnet which is also useful for example 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.010
 on screwdriver 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.780
 to make the screwdriver magnetic and more comfortable 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.970
 it was to unscrew the screws that collected 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.460
 Such Chinese screwdriver they are completely 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:10.650
 Not at least some use is not magnetized 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:13.210
 there will be more from these speakers from remixes 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.060
 speakers on the headphones I already solder 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.400
 I can advise you to pay attention when 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.580
 soldering what for example here at us apparently 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.350
 there is such a label sapan wacom red 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.930
 such a label that is from this side 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:30.490
 comes right channel and the second contact 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:33.580
 total just do not advise to confuse contacts 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.770
 there may be poor sound quality 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.710
 so look where it comes from 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.930
 channel and where is the total here these headphones already 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.940
 soldered and can be closed like this 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:50.350
 plastic insert this earpiece 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:53.289
 Now so back snap on the channel 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:55.479
 found them on the silicone earpiece 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:58.030
 tip this vomer rhythmics but they're in 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:01.090
 principle with these headphones to each other 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:03.640
 fit 2 i have the earpiece already assembled left 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.490
 just check these headphones for this 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:11.880
 specially prepared 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:16.000
 smartphone now let's see how urgent 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:18.190
 These headphones work and play here 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.039
 This is not a difficult headphone repair and 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.180
 extending the life of the nose I'm these headphones 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:24.310
 bought something 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.860
 Now I do not pam-pam for 1000 rubles in well 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.229
 principle and such a normal decent 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.750
 sound quality and these headphones are still 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:34.330
 say live here so elementary 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.930
 repair if someone liked something 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.460
 like it of course 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.479
 fit into the channel well if it is not for you 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:46.190
 liked it then put dizlaik all 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:46.190
 thanks for watching everyone bye
