superior side okay you can also see it
in<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.990> other<00:00:31.710> half<00:00:32.070> head<00:00:32.309> oh<00:00:36.680> okay<00:00:37.710> oh<00:00:37.920> no<00:00:38.280> I'm

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
in the other half head oh okay oh no I'm

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.770 
in the other half head oh okay oh no I'm
just<00:00:38.399> praying<00:00:38.820> yes<00:00:39.030> okay<00:00:40.520> so<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:42.329> rest<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
just praying yes okay so the rest of the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.520 
just praying yes okay so the rest of the
sinuses<00:00:43.460> the<00:00:44.460> inferior<00:00:45.149> sagittal<00:00:45.780> sinus<00:00:46.260> I

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
sinuses the inferior sagittal sinus I

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.900 
sinuses the inferior sagittal sinus I
can't<00:00:46.800> pin<00:00:47.100> because<00:00:47.370> it's<00:00:47.550> somewhere<00:00:47.850> here

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
can't pin because it's somewhere here

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
can't pin because it's somewhere here
right<00:00:48.300> below<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.690> brain<00:00:48.899> but<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.980> dumps<00:00:50.969> its

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
right below the brain but it dumps its

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.930 
right below the brain but it dumps its
blood<00:00:52.829> into<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.690> straight<00:00:54.690> sinus<00:00:55.910> okay

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
blood into the straight sinus okay

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.180 
blood into the straight sinus okay
straight<00:00:57.809> thing<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.320> comes<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:58.680> here<00:00:58.980> and

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
straight thing so it comes in here and

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.069 
straight thing so it comes in here and
then<00:00:59.370> straight<00:00:59.760> this<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.510> straight<00:01:00.539> sighs

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
then straight this is a straight sighs

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.820 
then straight this is a straight sighs
this<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.100> confluence<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.120> sinus<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:04.619> is

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
this is the confluence of sinus this is

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.969 
this is the confluence of sinus this is
the<00:01:05.040> transverse<00:01:05.729> sinus<00:01:06.689> these<00:01:07.680> are<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the transverse sinus these are the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.630 
the transverse sinus these are the
sigmoid<00:01:08.610> sinus<00:01:09.320> right<00:01:10.320> here<00:01:10.590> right<00:01:11.189> here

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
sigmoid sinus right here right here

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.359 
sigmoid sinus right here right here
this<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.630> cavernous<00:01:13.290> sinus<00:01:13.340> yeah<00:01:14.340> I

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
this is the cavernous sinus yeah I

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.039 
this is the cavernous sinus yeah I
usually<00:01:14.549> put<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.119> up<00:01:15.210> here<00:01:15.360> because<00:01:15.509> I'm<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.840> put

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
usually put it up here because I'm I put

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.560 
usually put it up here because I'm I put
it<00:01:16.200> right<00:01:16.229> there<00:01:16.350> no<00:01:16.710> one<00:01:16.860> season<00:01:17.420> so<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.450> always

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
it right there no one season so I always

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.539 
it right there no one season so I always
putting<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.080> top<00:01:19.640> okay<00:01:20.689> cavernous

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
putting it on top okay cavernous

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.679 
putting it on top okay cavernous
transverse<00:01:24.049> sigmoid<00:01:25.189> straight<00:01:26.689> confluence

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
transverse sigmoid straight confluence

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.240 
transverse sigmoid straight confluence
of<00:01:27.979> sinus<00:01:29.479> okay<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:31.259> know<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.590> superior

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
of sinus okay and you know the superior

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.730 
of sinus okay and you know the superior
sagittal<00:01:32.520> sinus<00:01:32.909> up<00:01:33.540> there<00:01:33.780> now<00:01:34.439> let's<00:01:34.619> look

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
sagittal sinus up there now let's look

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.870 
sagittal sinus up there now let's look
at<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.100> cerebral<00:01:35.880> arterial<00:01:36.509> circle<00:01:36.990> okay

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
at the cerebral arterial circle okay

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.149 
at the cerebral arterial circle okay
here<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.060> internal<00:01:39.900> carotid<00:01:40.159> arteries

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
here is the internal carotid arteries

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.800 
here is the internal carotid arteries
that's<00:01:41.340> your<00:01:41.579> landmark<00:01:42.890> here's<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
that's your landmark here's the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.190 
that's your landmark here's the
posterior<00:01:45.810> communicating<00:01:47.090> artery<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.420> this

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
posterior communicating artery and this

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.780 
posterior communicating artery and this
is<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.979> posterior<00:01:50.689> cerebral<00:01:51.740> artery<00:01:52.790> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
is the posterior cerebral artery the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.819 
is the posterior cerebral artery the
rest<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.299> circle<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:56.490> front

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
rest of the circle is in front

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.499 
rest of the circle is in front
it's<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.950> anterior<00:01:59.549> part<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.780> again<00:02:01.140> here<00:02:01.649> is

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
it's the anterior part so again here is

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.770 
it's the anterior part so again here is
the<00:02:04.280> internal<00:02:05.280> carotid<00:02:05.520> artery<00:02:06.180> right<00:02:06.570> and

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
the internal carotid artery right and

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.350 
the internal carotid artery right and
that<00:02:06.869> just<00:02:07.110> up<00:02:07.259> at<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.979> turn<00:02:08.759> on<00:02:08.910> carotid

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
that just up at that and turn on carotid

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.900 
that just up at that and turn on carotid
artery<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.349> one<00:02:10.530> coming<00:02:10.979> up<00:02:11.099> in<00:02:11.280> front

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
artery the one coming up in front

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.600 
artery the one coming up in front
these<00:02:12.210> this<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:12.990> anterior<00:02:13.770> cerebral

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
these this is the anterior cerebral

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.140 
these this is the anterior cerebral
artery<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:16.350> ones<00:02:16.590> going<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.430> side

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
artery the ones going to the side

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.030 
artery the ones going to the side
branching<00:02:18.960> off<00:02:19.110> from<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.440> internal<00:02:19.860> carotid

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
branching off from the internal carotid

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.010 
branching off from the internal carotid
artery<00:02:20.640> is<00:02:20.940> what<00:02:22.730> middle<00:02:23.730> cerebral<00:02:24.180> artery<00:02:24.690> I

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
artery is what middle cerebral artery I

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.010 
artery is what middle cerebral artery I
can<00:02:25.440> hear<00:02:25.650> her<00:02:25.740> saying<00:02:26.330> very<00:02:27.330> good<00:02:27.570> so<00:02:27.990> you

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
can hear her saying very good so you

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.840 
can hear her saying very good so you
remember<00:02:28.260> when<00:02:28.350> you<00:02:28.470> put<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:28.770> in<00:02:28.890> here<00:02:29.250> then

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
remember when you put it in here then

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.390 
remember when you put it in here then
the<00:02:30.210> internal<00:02:30.960> carotid<00:02:31.290> arteries<00:02:31.890> match<00:02:32.130> up

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
the internal carotid arteries match up

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.370 
the internal carotid arteries match up
oh<00:02:32.750> oh<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.590> basilar<00:02:35.160> artery<00:02:36.110> based<00:02:37.110> on<00:02:37.290> our

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
oh oh the basilar artery based on our

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.430 
oh oh the basilar artery based on our
best<00:02:37.500> listener<00:02:38.070> and<00:02:38.310> then<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.840> vertebral

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
best listener and then the vertebral

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:48.890 
best listener and then the vertebral
arteries<00:02:47.450> where<00:02:48.450> did<00:02:48.570> you

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
arteries where did you

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.510 
arteries where did you
why<00:02:49.230> don't<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:49.710> think<00:02:49.950> no<00:02:50.130> because<00:02:50.340> we<00:02:50.490> were

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
why don't you think no because we were

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.160 
why don't you think no because we were
having<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.180> conversation<00:02:51.330> about<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.930> again

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
having a conversation about it again

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.870 
having a conversation about it again
somehow<00:02:52.530> we<00:02:52.680> ended<00:02:52.920> up<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.250> we<00:02:53.490> cannot<00:02:53.820> find

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
somehow we ended up that we cannot find

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.440 
somehow we ended up that we cannot find
it<00:02:54.240> as<00:02:54.480> was<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:54.930> oh<00:02:55.530> no<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.940> better<00:02:57.120> tell

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
it as was that oh no you better tell

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.200 
it as was that oh no you better tell
your<00:02:57.720> group<00:02:58.020> that<00:02:58.590> there<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:59.220> is<00:02:59.460> this<00:02:59.850> ravine

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210

these<00:03:13.050> are<00:03:13.170> vertebral<00:03:13.680> arteries<00:03:14.070> coming<00:03:14.310> up

I<00:03:21.800> have<00:03:22.800> no<00:03:23.070> idea<00:03:23.610> Tibo<00:03:23.940> artery<00:03:24.240> comes<00:03:24.510> down<00:03:24.780> by

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
I have no idea Tibo artery comes down by

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.010 
I have no idea Tibo artery comes down by
the<00:03:25.020> vertebrae<00:03:25.560> that's<00:03:26.490> closer<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.390> net<00:03:27.720> I

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
the vertebrae that's closer to the net I

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.660 
the vertebrae that's closer to the net I
mean<00:03:28.709> I<00:03:28.980> wouldn't<00:03:29.970> even<00:03:30.060> try<00:03:30.950> and<00:03:31.950> so<00:03:32.520> they

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
mean I wouldn't even try and so they

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.820 
mean I wouldn't even try and so they
come<00:03:32.910> up<00:03:32.940> from<00:03:33.300> the<00:03:33.420> cerebral<00:03:33.810> vertebrae<00:03:34.560> and

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
come up from the cerebral vertebrae and

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.740 
come up from the cerebral vertebrae and
then<00:03:35.670> they<00:03:35.850> send<00:03:36.150> blood<00:03:36.360> through<00:03:36.690> the

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
then they send blood through the

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.840 
then they send blood through the
vertebral<00:03:37.560> arteries<00:03:38.040> so<00:03:38.220> they<00:03:38.340> start<00:03:38.640> to<00:03:38.760> you

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
vertebral arteries so they start to you

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.690 
vertebral arteries so they start to you
right<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:40.140> then<00:03:40.680> they<00:03:40.860> come<00:03:41.070> up<00:03:41.220> in<00:03:41.340> here<00:03:41.610> and

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
right and then they come up in here and

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.030 
right and then they come up in here and
they're<00:03:41.850> going<00:03:42.180> to<00:03:42.390> become<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:43.500> basilar

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
they're going to become the basilar

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.610 
they're going to become the basilar
artery<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.790> then<00:03:45.540> there<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:45.900> go<00:03:46.170> through<00:03:46.530> the

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
artery and then there you go through the

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.290 
artery and then there you go through the
circle<00:03:46.860> Willis<00:03:47.489> and<00:03:47.700> then<00:03:47.820> all<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.090> other

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
circle Willis and then all the other

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.870 
circle Willis and then all the other
branches<00:03:48.920> including<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.040> middle<00:03:50.340> cerebral

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
branches including the middle cerebral

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.220 
branches including the middle cerebral
artery

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
artery

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.290 
artery
better<00:03:52.770> explain<00:03:53.190> it<00:03:53.400> yeah<00:03:54.080> that's<00:03:55.080> it
