 [Millet Newsletter] 410. Spiritual World at Many Levels 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:14.240
 410. Spirit's World of Many Dimensions 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.380
 Once you have passed away, the time you know no longer exists. 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.970
 Our world has no clocks, chronographs and watches; your time on earth is irrelevant to us. 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:33.070
 Many souls are still paying attention to time after returning to us, but they are often disappointed, time is no longer meaningful, no longer available. 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:46.630
 We don't need to eat any food, but at the beginning, the soul usually finds it difficult to give up the need, so they give the opportunity to think about what they want to eat until they realize that food is unnecessary. 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.520
 Our world has multiple dimensions, the first level is for those who are troubled by going home. 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:01.080
 There are many souls like this. They are usually treated in the reception hall by souls who have compassion and kind energy when they are alive. 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:11.550
 Once the soul returns to our world, they will see their life in life. Many souls find it difficult to see the replay of their lives, but this is part of your return home. 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:18.020
 No one is trying to judge you. Actually, you are trying to judge yourself. Then, you start to accept your own bad work. 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:50.800
 For these souls, they are waiting for them to meet them in the world and in our world; usually when they meet, they will be told not to blame themselves for any grief or painful behavior. Usually they will realize that this may be industry, no People are judged for what they have done, but it is very difficult to judge themselves. Usually, after the soul has completed its own review, it is necessary to go to a quiet place and accept its own behavior. Here, they get those beautiful souls. Counseling, help them find peace in their hearts 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:58.980
 The next level is the life that has lived a good life in the world, without hurting anyone, and without the souls of the conflict-avoiding people. 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.930
 This is also the level of the souls who have repaid all their karma and are no longer returning to the world. 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:12.930
 Here, they started their own new life of assisting work in our world, and there are too many souls who are willing to do service work! 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.560
 There are many, many layers in our world. 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.910
 You don't wear clothes or body, you are pure consciousness, but you can see that you can use ideas to communicate with others. 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.930
 You don't need any self. Our world is a world without any secrets or lies. 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.960
 You are exposed, every thought of you is connected to the ultimate existence, or the energy you call God 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.670
 This energy is intimate with you, and He will teach you if you need it. 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:03:06.480
 Your soul is eternal. If you have completed your life in the world, you will start your own new life in our world, no longer return to the world. Our world is a world full of color and oscillation, completely Unlike the world, compared with our world, the earth looks pale; you have never seen the color in our world in the world, you can die today, spend the equivalent of 1000 years of spiritual time, but return to the world tomorrow. 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:15.130
 Many of you are afraid of death; don't be afraid that while you are going home, we are with you, you will never be alone, never will 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:23.010
 All the negatives you know will disappear. Usually you don't need a long time to pass the meditation on your life review. 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:30.900
 When you get home, you will experience love you have never experienced, even in your marriage or relationship. 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:39.750
 This is a kind of love that your soul is accepted by the ultimate existence. Many people have never experienced such love. They will completely immerse themselves in this experience. 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:47.340
 No one can escape death, but those who can try and live a real life in the world, one without criticism, hatred, fear, 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:56.460
 Suspicion and other emotional life, when they return to their real home, they go home with joy and peace. This is indeed a wonderful experience. 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:15.860
 Our world is not boring or dull, we are very active, there are many ways to entertain ourselves, and even those souls with very high vibrations in our world have fun times! You know, you will go back to your real home, and all the fantasies of our world will be shattered!
