00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
look to retain and turn that clock back

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.549 
look to retain and turn that clock back
with<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.280> renovage<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:57.030> again<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.660> peptide

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
with the renovage this again is peptide

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.500 
with the renovage this again is peptide
technology<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.520> really<00:00:59.670> addresses<00:01:00.090> on

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
technology that really addresses on

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.720 
technology that really addresses on
holding<00:01:00.870> those<00:01:01.020> youthful<00:01:01.289> components<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.309> lot

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
holding those youthful components a lot

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.729 
holding those youthful components a lot
longer<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.420> skin<00:01:03.660> surface<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.500> bar

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
longer on the skin surface the bar

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.770 
longer on the skin surface the bar
better<00:01:04.979> hydration<00:01:05.489> but<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.909> also<00:01:06.119> deals<00:01:06.600> with

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
better hydration but it also deals with

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.620 
better hydration but it also deals with
so<00:01:07.290> much<00:01:07.590> more<00:01:08.010> because<00:01:08.580> aging<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.180> not<00:01:09.360> just

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
so much more because aging is not just

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.109 
so much more because aging is not just
lines<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.140> wrinkles<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.710> else<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.580> is

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
lines and wrinkles what else is it it is

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.030 
lines and wrinkles what else is it it is
the<00:01:12.360> pores<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:13.049> going<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.350> address<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.799> pore

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
the pores it's going to address the pore

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.100 
the pores it's going to address the pore
size<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.640> keeping<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.060> skin<00:01:15.390> nice<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.630> firm

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
size and keeping that skin nice and firm

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.350 
size and keeping that skin nice and firm
it's<00:01:16.560> going<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.979> address<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> age<00:01:17.580> spots<00:01:18.119> by

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
it's going to address the age spots by

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.630 
it's going to address the age spots by
giving<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.960> more<00:01:19.650> youthful<00:01:19.860> tone<00:01:20.400> a

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
giving you a more youthful tone a

giving you a more youthful tone a
uniform<00:01:21.390> tone<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:22.020> addresses<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.680> redness

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
uniform tone it addresses the redness

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.580 
uniform tone it addresses the redness
because<00:01:24.060> again<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.509> really<00:01:24.900> helps<00:01:25.350> with<00:01:25.530> that

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
because again it really helps with that

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.490 
because again it really helps with that
appearance<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.670> skin<00:01:26.909> density<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.290> really

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
appearance of skin density and it really

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.230 
appearance of skin density and it really
helps<00:01:28.860> with<00:01:28.979> thin<00:01:29.220> crepey<00:01:29.460> looking<00:01:29.670> skin

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
helps with thin crepey looking skin

helps with thin crepey looking skin
because<00:01:30.540> again<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.020> plumps<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.530> up<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.860> it

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
because again it plumps it up and it

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.249 
because again it plumps it up and it
retains<00:01:32.640> more<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.570> youthful<00:01:34.049> look<00:01:34.229> to

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259

your skin so the youth precursor sturm

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.600 
your skin so the youth precursor sturm
look<00:01:37.170> at<00:01:37.290> what<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.500> does<00:01:37.650> in<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.890> skin<00:01:38.130> replica

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
look at what it does in the skin replica

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.850 
look at what it does in the skin replica
as<00:01:38.729> well<00:01:38.939> it's<00:01:39.420> able<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.869> really<00:01:40.290> address<00:01:40.560> that

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
as well it's able to really address that

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.679 
as well it's able to really address that
