00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello to all the friends we find ourselves 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.000
 today for a small series of 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.560
 christmas config so 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.200
 so if you feel like you 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.639
 do a little pc for christmas bah it will be 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.990
 the opportunity to draw some ideas and 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.710
 I also invite you to watch 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.350
 soiam videos so who does 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.580
 regularly configs me I do 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.980
 not necessarily exactly the same as 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.080
 him but but here it is 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.609
 config specialist at my guru so 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.160
 well I invite you especially if you 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.840
 have questions to ask him one and 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.460
 why not use config 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.820
 who are they who are really 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.100
 top 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.629
 so here we are going to leave on a 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.750
 first configuration whose crete has 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.219
 a configuration we will say really 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.360
 entry level really the cheapest 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.710
 possible 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.960
 so we did not expect to 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.190
 to gaming is really for 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.890
 someone who would like to do some 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.100
 office automation and 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.100
 and here is watching videos but 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:02.120
 it's office and that's all so we 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.390
 will go on a small intel I have 34 20 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.790
 it's a good processor I have it 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.030
 already used 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.700
 many times besides staying at the 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.619
 house in case 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.479
 there is not much to say about it 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.399
 it's even a processor where I 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.890
 could play with arma iii particular who 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.869
 is not bad good it's not madness 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.360
 but but that's the job and I 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.630
 find that for the price it's a pretty 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:33.220
 good cpu so here you can bet 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:35.170
 also leave on the on the gg 18,40 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.280
 also a little bit cheaper to 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.060
 save another one 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.259
 a good fifteen euros here is free 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.299
 to you to do as you feel I 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.240
 think the g34 twenty and a few more 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.549
 powerful and is most suited to this 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.979
 profile but it's a matter of taste 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.220
 Then I left on the hem and 6h 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.299
 80 mg p 33 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.399
 that's what language has in the input of 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.509
 range we are in chips 7h and 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.509
 so seduced h 80 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.880
 here are the us 3 and sata 6 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.960
 gigabits all we need after 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.360
 after that you are free 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.860
 to you according to your desires 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:20.760
 and the choice of your colors and so on 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.530
 but it's still coherent so there's this 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.360
 it takes one of the vga of the dvi 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.340
 good no two there is no hdmi 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.880
 but at this price we can not all him 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.880
 ask either 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.470
 if you want to change you can also 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.490
 go on gigabyte also that makes 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.160
 a few 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.650
 dh 80 m in the 6th 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.820
 33rd seeming veil after free to you 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.260
 really choose is that the one that 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.400
 please the most but but of all 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.120
 way it's pretty much all the same 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:54.840
 level 2 at the same level of equipment 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.400
 so that's it for the ram I went on 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.200
 decorate her revenge because she was 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.239
 not especially expensive are said we put 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.239
 4 gigas and so twice 2 gigas them 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.230
 I took the 1600 my guys because she 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.920
 is not so much more expensive than the 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.780
 1333 so much so as to avoid 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:18.090
 to deprive 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:20.850
 he has for 45 euros it remains correct I 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.180
 invite you to not bought from no name and 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:28.980
 it's for different reasons of 2 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:31.050
 here is quality and performance 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.970
 if benoit performance and no it's 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.230
 because we ask him but now 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.459
 as much buying brand does not cost 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.880
 so much more expensive and me you are 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.920
 you are guaranteed is quiet for 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.750
 the hard drive I left on a small 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.200
 name on a small seagate barracuda 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.269
 the interest that it is a hard drive in 3 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.459
 inch and a half to 7200 rpm 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:55.680
 that's classic a little cache 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:57.959
 of 64 mo of sata iii so here it is 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.700
 there is no there is no problem that's good 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.560
 hard drive even though some seagate 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:06.420
 worries in a short time it's not it's 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.920
 not it's not the drama for the torah the 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.320
 turn one more time it will be according to your 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.400
 moods you live your tastes me I 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.810
 left on something that was 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.090
 cheap so that's the cooler master and 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.470
 the 342 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.120
 it's a medium-sized box tower in me 3.6 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.520
 it's cheap it's cooler master on 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.110
 know it's quality 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.790
 here I took it after there is no 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.169
 badly other brands cheap there are the 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.949
 aerocool including raging tech too 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.199
 take care that makes you want 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.400
 the most but one but this case there and 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:40.020
 coherent I have already climbed several times 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:42.720
 it's worth its price in food 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:46.320
 I left on the Corsican rbs 350 so 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.630
 a 350 watts necessarily this is a 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:53.310
 good food is also still certain 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:55.320
 some others it's my choice 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.660
 there are others but you can 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.160
 proud to korÃ§a who generally founds 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.680
 very very good food so 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.880
 so here I listen I think we 're going 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.070
 we will stop there for this first 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.139
 configuration so we stop at 260 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.760
 euros 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:11.310
 free to you if you wanted to 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:18.389
 use it to add a small ssd 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:19.979
 32 gigabytes or a little more but 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.660
 of 60 because it does not cost so much 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.310
 more expensive but 64 giga you take a 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.810
 five disks in sata iii that makes you 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.460
 still add 40 euros is a 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.320
 sum when we know that our config to 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.370
 260 euros 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.320
 it will save you a little bit 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.639
 comfort of use after his sails 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.360
 ensuring the budget if it is really 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.139
 tight or not 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.800
 I did not put two graphics cards 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:40.659
 because because it was 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.879
 had no purpose of the config and then 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:44.889
 and that's that it would add a lot 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:45.819
 obliged so I stayed on this basis 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.740
 at 2.60 euros 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:49.840
 I hope that will suit you then we get 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.840
 found again very soon for the part 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.889
 two of his Christmas accomplices go I 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.979
 wish you a good evening have fun 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:55.979
 you well
