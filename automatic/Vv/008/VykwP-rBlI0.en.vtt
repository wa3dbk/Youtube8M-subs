00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
playing against badly written see what's

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.310 
playing against badly written see what's
right<00:00:16.020> then<00:00:16.289> this<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.949> chaos<00:00:17.699> on<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.510> acorn

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
right then this is chaos on the acorn

archimedes<00:00:19.529> by<00:00:21.289> ian<00:00:22.289> macleod<00:00:24.260> 1997<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.380> don't

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
archimedes by ian macleod 1997 I don't

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.529 
archimedes by ian macleod 1997 I don't
know<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> whole<00:00:26.400> lot<00:00:26.460> about<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:27.060> except<00:00:27.420> i

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
know a whole lot about this except i

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.200 
know a whole lot about this except i
think<00:00:27.810> it's<00:00:27.990> like<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.230> variation<00:00:29.039> on<00:00:29.210> asteroids

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
think it's like a variation on asteroids

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.089 
think it's like a variation on asteroids
and<00:00:30.689> apparently<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.230> play<00:00:31.470> upside<00:00:31.830> look<00:00:31.980> at

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
and apparently to play upside look at

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.389 
and apparently to play upside look at
this<00:00:32.219> well<00:00:32.850> there's<00:00:33.030> only<00:00:33.090> me<00:00:33.390> here<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:33.960> i

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
this well there's only me here so i

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.590 
this well there's only me here so i
thought<00:00:35.399> that's<00:00:35.640> how<00:00:35.850> i<00:00:35.880> thrust<00:00:36.239> middle

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
thought that's how i thrust middle

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:46.090 
thought that's how i thrust middle
button<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:37.020> thrust<00:00:39.050> earlier

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.450 

yeah<00:00:46.760> well<00:00:47.420> I<00:00:47.690> suppose<00:00:48.680> there's<00:00:48.980> a<00:00:49.039> 1<00:00:49.219> player

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
yeah well I suppose there's a 1 player

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.189 
yeah well I suppose there's a 1 player
mode<00:00:49.489> here<00:00:49.969> I've<00:00:50.149> just<00:00:50.359> hit<00:00:50.539> the<00:00:50.629> wrong<00:00:50.780> thing

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
mode here I've just hit the wrong thing

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.380 
mode here I've just hit the wrong thing
or<00:00:51.500> something<00:00:51.769> maybe<00:00:52.430> who<00:00:52.910> cares<00:00:53.210> I<00:00:53.359> don't

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
or something maybe who cares I don't

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.600 
or something maybe who cares I don't
care<00:00:53.719> if<00:00:53.780> player<00:00:54.079> 2<00:00:54.289> died<00:00:54.589> so<00:00:54.949> long<00:00:55.100> as<00:00:55.219> I<00:00:55.370> live

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
care if player 2 died so long as I live

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.430 
care if player 2 died so long as I live
I'm<00:00:55.940> that<00:00:56.300> selfish<00:00:58.870> loving<00:00:59.870> the<00:00:59.960> graphics

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
I'm that selfish loving the graphics

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.930 
I'm that selfish loving the graphics
though<00:01:00.620> I<00:01:00.649> mean<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:01.010> gameplay<00:01:01.430> is<00:01:01.579> totally

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
though I mean the gameplay is totally

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.190 
though I mean the gameplay is totally
asteroids<00:01:02.479> I<00:01:04.449> am<00:01:05.449> controlling<00:01:05.899> with<00:01:06.110> the

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
asteroids I am controlling with the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.889 
asteroids I am controlling with the
mouse<00:01:06.409> which<00:01:07.070> is<00:01:07.280> very<00:01:07.820> unusual<00:01:08.060> but<00:01:08.539> it<00:01:08.659> works

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
mouse which is very unusual but it works

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.560 
mouse which is very unusual but it works
really<00:01:09.440> well<00:01:09.649> you<00:01:10.280> just<00:01:10.520> slide<00:01:11.240> your<00:01:11.270> mouse

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
really well you just slide your mouse

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.660 
really well you just slide your mouse
left<00:01:11.780> and<00:01:11.990> right<00:01:12.140> to<00:01:12.320> rotate<00:01:12.830> so<00:01:13.130> you<00:01:13.190> got

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
left and right to rotate so you got

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.600 
left and right to rotate so you got
really<00:01:13.970> good<00:01:14.500> precision<00:01:15.500> on<00:01:15.770> that<00:01:15.979> middle

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
really good precision on that middle

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.490 
really good precision on that middle
button<00:01:16.909> to<00:01:17.119> thrust<00:01:17.479> right<00:01:18.289> button<00:01:19.509> 20<00:01:20.509> clubs

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
probably not getting the best view in

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.510 
probably not getting the best view in
terms<00:01:50.600> of<00:01:50.780> color<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.560> camera<00:01:51.979> really<00:01:52.280> when

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
terms of color the camera really when

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.670 
terms of color the camera really when
it's<00:01:52.700> like<00:01:52.939> bright<00:01:53.750> colors<00:01:53.780> against<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.469> dark

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
it's like bright colors against the dark

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.920 
it's like bright colors against the dark
background<00:01:55.310> with<00:01:55.670> this<00:01:55.850> camera<00:01:56.090> it<00:01:56.420> does<00:01:56.659> wash

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
background with this camera it does wash

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.980 
background with this camera it does wash
out<00:01:57.259> and<00:01:57.789> yes<00:01:58.789> i<00:01:59.000> know<00:01:59.060> i<00:01:59.270> would<00:01:59.600> get<00:01:59.750> a<00:01:59.780> better

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
out and yes i know i would get a better

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.440 
out and yes i know i would get a better
image<00:02:00.200> with<00:02:00.439> a<00:02:00.469> capture<00:02:00.860> card<00:02:00.890> but<00:02:01.430> i'm<00:02:02.270> not

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
image with a capture card but i'm not

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:11.850 
image with a capture card but i'm not
using<00:02:02.689> one<00:02:02.960> so<00:02:03.320> near<00:02:03.969> near<00:02:04.969> I<00:02:05.000> say

this this is impressing the hell out of
me<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:38.650> that's<00:02:38.770> not<00:02:38.980> necessarily<00:02:39.040> an<00:02:39.670> easy

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
me and that's not necessarily an easy

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:48.180 
me and that's not necessarily an easy
thing<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.180> do

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.130
