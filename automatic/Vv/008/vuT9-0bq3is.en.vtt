00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
go down let's go down the game is

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.540 
go down let's go down the game is
telling<00:00:51.149> us<00:00:51.210> where<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.480> go<00:00:52.010> the<00:00:53.010> game<00:00:53.190> always

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
tells us where to go we shouldn't let it

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.250 
tells us where to go we shouldn't let it
push<00:00:55.379> us<00:00:55.530> around<00:00:55.680> whoa<00:00:57.199> um<00:00:58.199> Oh<00:00:59.390> what<00:01:00.390> that's<00:01:01.050> a

this is my solution that's a that's a

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.800 
this is my solution that's a that's a
night<00:01:04.080> made<00:01:04.680> out<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.010> copper<00:01:05.909> clockwork<00:01:06.780> night

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810

mm-hmm I sand dragon I thought your

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.560 
mm-hmm I sand dragon I thought your
solution<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.760> everything<00:01:11.850> was<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.299> kill<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
solution to everything was to kill the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.230 
solution to everything was to kill the
Rose<00:01:12.750> bride<00:01:13.159> know<00:01:14.159> what<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.850> have<00:01:15.060> multiple

Rose bride know what is I have multiple

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.170 
Rose bride know what is I have multiple
solutions<00:01:15.720> hmm<00:01:16.939> somehow<00:01:17.939> they<00:01:18.150> always

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
solutions hmm somehow they always

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.930 
solutions hmm somehow they always
involve<00:01:18.930> killing

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
involve killing

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.900

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.260 
think what are we just supposed to run
is<00:05:01.050> like<00:05:01.260> the<00:05:01.410> Proteus<00:05:01.890> passes<00:05:02.340> we're<00:05:03.090> just

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
is like the Proteus passes we're just

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.200 
is like the Proteus passes we're just
supposed<00:05:03.420> to<00:05:03.600> survive<00:05:04.460> then<00:05:05.460> who<00:05:05.670> who<00:05:05.970> stole

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210
