00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.029
 hello today on our review 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:19.300
 company switching power supply 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:21.759
 master model ml320 mrs maximum 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.119
 output voltage of 30 volts and a current of 20 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.400
 ampere 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.949
 the model line is also present model 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.660
 30 10 m with a maximum output current of 10 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.919
 ampere 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.960
 This power supply is interesting in 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:33.820
 First of all, the fact that it is equipped with a block 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.390
 number keys for entering the weekend 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.160
 parameters 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.340
 a nice addition is having 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.500
 rs-232 interface kopecks of delivery 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.840
 includes a simple one for which 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.690
 allows you to control the power source and 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.800
 control its output parameters 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.140
 scope of this source 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.820
 the supply is quite wide it can 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.920
 use when repairing laptops 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.200
 mobile phones as well as charge 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.810
 powerful batteries by clicking on this 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.180
 link you can watch the video 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.590
 charge car battery 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.119
 capacity of 60 ampere hours using 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.009
 this power source 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.229
 and now let's go directly to 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.609
 device overview on the front panel 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.179
 LED indicators are placed 

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:15.939
 output current output voltage 

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:17.979
 control buttons mode indicator 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.369
 source voltage mode source 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:24.090
 current terminal for connecting load 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.719
 power button on the back 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.119
 cooling Fan 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:33.039
 power cable connector and rs-232 connector 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.899
 let's look inside the device on the main 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:38.340
 the board placed two huge areas 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:43.960
 the radiator on which are placed 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:46.180
 active output transistors 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.780
 there are also various filtering 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.000
 inductance and capacitance elements 1 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.340
 diode bridge since the source 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.869
 power is very powerful and water is included by 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.619
 two in parallel control board and 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.640
 indications 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.869
 In general, the quality of soldering and assembly is good 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.550
 Now we will focus on 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.069
 controls and operating modes 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.780
 power supply for this will be 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.640
 use a load resistor with 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.790
 established resistance of about five 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.260
 you an interesting feature of this 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.630
 power supply is the presence 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.080
 the numeric keypad in this says a 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.650
 previously set the output voltage 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.570
 output current in several ways 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:37.330
 for example, I need to discuss the output 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:40.780
 voltage is 20 3.3 volts I press at 23.3 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.000
 enter can also be adjusted weekend 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.239
 parameters using the appropriate 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.760
 buttons i just have you four buttons and up 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.870
 voltage, that is, plus 1 volt minus 1 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:56.519
 volt only 10 volts and 10 volts 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.519
 for example 23 5 thousand will stop 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:08.800
 or 20 volts the device is equipped with protection against 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.600
 short circuit 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.670
 for example create a short circuit on 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.640
 Outlet Pay attention to these 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.650
 LEDs order the unit right away 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.650
 switched to restriction mode only 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.640
 consider the voltage source mode 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.210
 let's start with a nominal 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.450
 voltage to pieces well, let's say the same 28 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.730
 now connect the load load 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:39.960
 I have a resistance of about 5 mm 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.960
 accordingly, it will be about 4 amps 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.700
 sets limits can on so 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.500
 Here is the load without, for example, now 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.660
 set only extracts when 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:02.420
 connected load 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:05.900
 for example, do not need 2 amps and and with 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.989
 keys + 1 minus 1 plus 10 minus 10 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.760
 I install the vampire and see me 2 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.920
 actually ganicheva output voltage 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.780
 to ensure this only well 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:22.130
 for example , I will set 3 amps too 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:28.639
 You can adjust the value of 1 amp 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:31.250
 and I do not under any circumstances, the current in 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:34.520
 chains will not exceed established 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:37.340
 the values â€‹â€‹of the power supply master she 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.720
 3020 mr is a great choice for lovers. 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.370
 and professionals 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.750
 due to the good ratio 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.000
 price quality 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.000
 and a wide range of output parameters
