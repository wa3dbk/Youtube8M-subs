and you're just going to mix everything

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.429 
and you're just going to mix everything
together<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:05.450> now<00:01:06.450> we<00:01:06.510> are<00:01:06.750> going<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.020> make<00:01:07.260> our

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.679 
together so now we are going to make our
ring<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.070> today<00:01:08.700> I'm<00:01:08.939> going<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.240> using<00:01:09.360> my

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
ring and today I'm going to be using my

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.539 
ring and today I'm going to be using my
KitchenAid<00:01:10.409> but<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.740> course<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.159> can<00:01:11.340> just

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
KitchenAid but of course you can just

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.070 
KitchenAid but of course you can just
use<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:12.390> hand<00:01:12.930> mixer<00:01:14.000> so<00:01:15.000> place<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.659> your<00:01:15.869> two

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
use a hand mixer so place in your two

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.010 
use a hand mixer so place in your two
room-temperature<00:01:16.860> egg<00:01:17.250> whites<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:18.030> you're

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
room-temperature egg whites and you're

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.510 
room-temperature egg whites and you're
just<00:01:19.200> going<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.380> beat<00:01:19.650> them<00:01:19.830> until<00:01:20.189> they<00:01:20.280> start

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
just going to beat them until they start

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.520 
just going to beat them until they start
to<00:01:20.640> get<00:01:20.759> foamy<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.299> gradually<00:01:21.990> add<00:01:22.200> your

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
to get foamy and gradually add your

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.039 
to get foamy and gradually add your
sugar

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.620 

so<00:01:28.859> as<00:01:29.039> you<00:01:29.219> can<00:01:29.340> see<00:01:29.399> it<00:01:29.909> got<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.149> little<00:01:30.450> bit

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
so as you can see it got a little bit

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:47.649 
so as you can see it got a little bit
more<00:01:30.840> fully<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.500> more<00:01:31.649> white

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.620 

so<00:01:48.350> soon<00:01:48.890> enough<00:01:49.189> it<00:01:49.460> should<00:01:49.640> be<00:01:49.880> very<00:01:50.210> white

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
so soon enough it should be very white

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.330 
so soon enough it should be very white
and<00:01:50.840> very<00:01:50.960> glossy<00:01:52.990> and<00:01:53.990> it<00:01:54.289> should<00:01:54.560> have<00:01:54.890> soft

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
and very glossy and it should have soft

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.819 
and very glossy and it should have soft
pinks<00:01:55.970> you<00:01:56.390> can't<00:01:56.720> bring<00:01:56.960> it<00:01:57.079> to<00:01:57.229> stiff<00:01:57.470> peaks

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
pinks you can't bring it to stiff peaks

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.609 
pinks you can't bring it to stiff peaks
but<00:01:58.189> I<00:01:58.250> find<00:01:58.610> that<00:01:58.820> having<00:01:59.060> soft<00:01:59.570> peaks<00:01:59.960> is<00:02:00.229> the

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
but I find that having soft peaks is the

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.620 
but I find that having soft peaks is the
best<00:02:01.220> consistency<00:02:02.090> it<00:02:02.360> should<00:02:02.509> look

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
best consistency it should look

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.080 
best consistency it should look
something<00:02:02.869> like<00:02:03.020> this<00:02:03.380> stiff<00:02:04.189> peaks<00:02:04.490> ISM<00:02:04.850> it's

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
something like this stiff peaks ISM it's

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.809 
something like this stiff peaks ISM it's
literally<00:02:05.390> super<00:02:05.990> stiff<00:02:06.289> but<00:02:06.890> I<00:02:06.950> like<00:02:07.460> the

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
literally super stiff but I like the

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.930 
literally super stiff but I like the
consistency<00:02:08.209> of<00:02:08.599> soft<00:02:09.110> peaks<00:02:09.459> so<00:02:10.459> you<00:02:10.550> just

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
consistency of soft peaks so you just

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.960 
consistency of soft peaks so you just
want<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.300> take<00:02:11.900> about<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.500> third<00:02:13.130> or<00:02:13.400> half<00:02:13.459> of

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
want to take about a third or half of

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.759 
want to take about a third or half of
your<00:02:14.239> almond<00:02:14.720> meal<00:02:14.840> mixture<00:02:15.349> and<00:02:15.590> you're

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
your almond meal mixture and you're

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.170 
your almond meal mixture and you're
going<00:02:15.950> to<00:02:15.980> place<00:02:16.220> that<00:02:16.250> into<00:02:16.700> your<00:02:16.760> meringue

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
going to place that into your meringue

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.759 
going to place that into your meringue
and<00:02:17.450> you're<00:02:17.690> just<00:02:17.840> going<00:02:17.989> to<00:02:18.019> fold<00:02:18.319> that<00:02:18.560> in

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
and you're just going to fold that in

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.080 
and you're just going to fold that in
and<00:02:19.010> you<00:02:19.790> want<00:02:19.970> to<00:02:20.090> try<00:02:20.330> not<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.720> deflate<00:02:21.230> the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
and you want to try not to deflate the

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.750 
and you want to try not to deflate the
meringue<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.590> this<00:02:24.590> process<00:02:25.069> is<00:02:25.250> called<00:02:25.549> the

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
meringue and this process is called the

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.509 
meringue and this process is called the
muck<00:02:25.970> or<00:02:26.209> a<00:02:26.299> notch<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:27.080> this<00:02:28.040> part<00:02:28.310> is

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
muck or a notch and this part is

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.370 
muck or a notch and this part is
seriously<00:02:28.910> where<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.239> can<00:02:29.390> mess<00:02:29.599> up<00:02:29.810> if<00:02:30.049> you

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
seriously where you can mess up if you

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.220 
seriously where you can mess up if you
over<00:02:30.950> mix<00:02:30.980> your<00:02:31.910> batter<00:02:31.940> molten<00:02:32.660> or<00:02:32.750> too<00:02:32.959> runny

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
over mix your batter molten or too runny

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.580 
over mix your batter molten or too runny
and<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:34.370> just<00:02:34.640> will<00:02:35.060> not<00:02:35.239> get<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.750> feet<00:02:36.019> if<00:02:36.230> you

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
and it just will not get the feet if you

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.039 
and it just will not get the feet if you
under<00:02:36.980> mix<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.700> will<00:02:38.150> get<00:02:38.330> too<00:02:38.540> rough<00:02:38.810> too

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
under mix it will get too rough too

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.500 
under mix it will get too rough too
bumpy<00:02:39.440> in<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.769> feet<00:02:40.010> won't<00:02:40.190> firm<00:02:40.579> as<00:02:40.819> well<00:02:41.180> so

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
bumpy in the feet won't firm as well so

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.839 
bumpy in the feet won't firm as well so
this<00:02:41.810> part<00:02:42.019> is<00:02:42.079> very<00:02:42.349> tricky

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
this part is very tricky

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.960 
this part is very tricky
I<00:02:44.410> think<00:02:45.410> that<00:02:45.680> after<00:02:46.160> a<00:02:46.190> while<00:02:46.519> of

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
I think that after a while of

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.150 
I think that after a while of
experimenting<00:02:47.840> with<00:02:47.989> macarons<00:02:48.620> you<00:02:48.980> will

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
experimenting with macarons you will

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.539 
experimenting with macarons you will
know<00:02:49.910> when<00:02:50.390> it<00:02:50.690> is<00:02:50.780> ready<00:02:51.260> so<00:02:51.650> just<00:02:51.680> continue

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
know when it is ready so just continue

00:02:52.549 --> 00:03:00.220 
know when it is ready so just continue
to<00:02:52.700> fold<00:02:52.940> everything<00:02:53.450> together<00:02:58.600> and<00:02:59.600> this<00:03:00.170> is

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
to fold everything together and this is

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.949 
to fold everything together and this is
about<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.769> consistency<00:03:01.190> you'd<00:03:01.730> like<00:03:02.000> it<00:03:02.209> at

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.819 

it<00:03:05.959> kind<00:03:06.170> of<00:03:06.319> just<00:03:06.590> drifts<00:03:07.010> down<00:03:08.109> so<00:03:09.109> what<00:03:09.680> I'm

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
it kind of just drifts down so what I'm

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.009 
it kind of just drifts down so what I'm
doing<00:03:09.859> here<00:03:10.220> is<00:03:10.489> just<00:03:10.730> placing<00:03:11.299> a<00:03:11.389> ziplock<00:03:11.750> bag

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
doing here is just placing a ziplock bag

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.309 
doing here is just placing a ziplock bag
over<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.500> glass<00:03:12.829> cup<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:14.090> I'm<00:03:14.540> gonna<00:03:14.840> fill<00:03:15.139> it

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
over a glass cup and I'm gonna fill it

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.729 
over a glass cup and I'm gonna fill it
with<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:16.220> batter<00:03:16.519> and<00:03:17.440> when<00:03:18.440> you're<00:03:18.590> done

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
with the batter and when you're done

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.050 
with the batter and when you're done
filling<00:03:18.980> you<00:03:19.160> with<00:03:19.280> a<00:03:19.310> batter<00:03:19.609> of<00:03:19.730> course

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
filling you with a batter of course

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.520 
filling you with a batter of course
you're<00:03:20.209> going<00:03:20.299> to<00:03:20.389> seal<00:03:20.600> it<00:03:20.780> and<00:03:20.810> cut<00:03:21.170> off<00:03:21.290> the

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
you're going to seal it and cut off the

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.370 
you're going to seal it and cut off the
tip<00:03:21.739> so<00:03:22.010> it's<00:03:22.160> ready<00:03:22.400> to<00:03:22.519> pipe<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:23.359> line<00:03:24.350> a

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
tip so it's ready to pipe and line a

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.020 
tip so it's ready to pipe and line a
baking<00:03:24.680> sheet<00:03:24.889> with<00:03:25.100> parchment<00:03:25.190> paper<00:03:25.700> and

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
baking sheet with parchment paper and

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.259 
baking sheet with parchment paper and
pipe<00:03:26.540> little<00:03:27.019> circles<00:03:27.680> I'm<00:03:28.220> actually<00:03:28.790> for

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
pipe little circles I'm actually for

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.479 
pipe little circles I'm actually for
this<00:03:29.389> video<00:03:29.720> I<00:03:29.780> made<00:03:30.109> pretty<00:03:30.470> big<00:03:30.739> ones<00:03:30.980> about

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
this video I made pretty big ones about

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.220 
this video I made pretty big ones about
two<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:31.910> a<00:03:31.970> half<00:03:32.090> inches<00:03:32.569> you<00:03:32.780> can<00:03:32.900> make<00:03:33.079> them

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
two and a half inches you can make them

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:41.780 
two and a half inches you can make them
any<00:03:33.350> size<00:03:33.799> you<00:03:34.040> want

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.550 

and<00:03:42.390> you<00:03:42.629> want<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.870> bang<00:03:43.049> them<00:03:43.290> on<00:03:43.409> your

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
and you want to bang them on your

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.309 
and you want to bang them on your
counter<00:03:43.739> so<00:03:44.640> that<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:45.239> air<00:03:45.450> bubbles<00:03:45.870> will<00:03:46.079> pop

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
counter so that the air bubbles will pop

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.170 
counter so that the air bubbles will pop
and<00:03:46.590> that<00:03:47.159> they<00:03:47.340> can<00:03:47.519> kind<00:03:47.700> of<00:03:47.819> get<00:03:48.000> their

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
and that they can kind of get their

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.899 
and that they can kind of get their
shape<00:03:51.230> make<00:03:52.230> sure<00:03:52.379> it<00:03:52.500> is<00:03:52.650> on<00:03:52.890> both<00:03:53.069> sides<00:03:53.129> and

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
shape make sure it is on both sides and

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.809 
shape make sure it is on both sides and
now<00:03:54.500> you<00:03:55.500> are<00:03:55.769> going<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.069> pre-heat<00:03:56.430> your<00:03:56.670> oven

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
now you are going to pre-heat your oven

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.180 
now you are going to pre-heat your oven
to<00:03:57.150> 300<00:03:57.840> degrees<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:58.200> make<00:03:58.560> sure<00:03:58.769> the<00:03:58.920> racks

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
to 300 degrees and make sure the racks

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.990 
to 300 degrees and make sure the racks
are<00:03:59.519> on<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.790> top<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.239> bottom<00:04:00.560> and<00:04:02.000> now

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
are on the top and the bottom and now

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.550 
are on the top and the bottom and now
you're<00:04:03.209> just<00:04:03.329> going<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.569> let<00:04:03.780> them<00:04:03.930> sit<00:04:03.989> so

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
you're just going to let them sit so

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.880 
you're just going to let them sit so
that<00:04:04.590> they<00:04:04.920> could<00:04:05.129> form<00:04:05.519> a<00:04:06.239> hard<00:04:06.989> coating<00:04:07.590> on

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
that they could form a hard coating on

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.800 
that they could form a hard coating on
top<00:04:08.280> so<00:04:08.760> that<00:04:08.790> it<00:04:09.060> will<00:04:09.150> be<00:04:09.239> dry<00:04:09.510> to<00:04:09.569> the<00:04:09.720> touch

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
top so that it will be dry to the touch

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.520 
top so that it will be dry to the touch
and<00:04:10.730> this<00:04:11.730> process<00:04:12.060> really<00:04:12.810> depends<00:04:13.290> on<00:04:13.379> the

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
and this process really depends on the

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.939 
and this process really depends on the
humidity<00:04:13.980> and<00:04:14.340> weather<00:04:14.760> of<00:04:15.169> that<00:04:16.169> day<00:04:16.560> so

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
humidity and weather of that day so

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:18.830 
humidity and weather of that day so
sometimes<00:04:17.459> it<00:04:17.639> takes<00:04:17.669> 10<00:04:18.120> minutes<00:04:18.359> sometimes

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
sometimes it takes 10 minutes sometimes

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.259 
sometimes it takes 10 minutes sometimes
it<00:04:19.229> takes<00:04:19.440> 20<00:04:19.859> minutes<00:04:20.250> 30<00:04:20.699> minutes<00:04:20.880> and

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
it takes 20 minutes 30 minutes and

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.140 
it takes 20 minutes 30 minutes and
sometimes<00:04:21.690> even<00:04:22.019> an<00:04:22.139> hour<00:04:22.380> so<00:04:23.340> just<00:04:23.910> make<00:04:24.120> sure

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
sometimes even an hour so just make sure

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.719 
sometimes even an hour so just make sure
that<00:04:24.380> when<00:04:25.380> they<00:04:25.530> are<00:04:25.560> done<00:04:25.860> resting<00:04:26.280> you'll

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
that when they are done resting you'll

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:28.760 
that when they are done resting you'll
be<00:04:26.940> able<00:04:27.000> to<00:04:27.240> touch<00:04:27.419> them<00:04:27.750> and<00:04:27.930> no<00:04:28.110> batter<00:04:28.380> will

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
be able to touch them and no batter will

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.409 
be able to touch them and no batter will
be<00:04:28.800> on<00:04:29.160> your<00:04:29.370> finger<00:04:31.550> so<00:04:32.550> now<00:04:32.729> we're<00:04:33.030> going<00:04:33.210> to

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
be on your finger so now we're going to

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.050 
be on your finger so now we're going to
place<00:04:33.690> them<00:04:33.930> in<00:04:34.139> the<00:04:34.350> oven<00:04:34.380> so<00:04:35.220> as<00:04:35.610> I<00:04:35.669> said

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
place them in the oven so as I said

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.540 
place them in the oven so as I said
before<00:04:36.090> place<00:04:37.020> them<00:04:37.229> on<00:04:37.380> the<00:04:37.410> top<00:04:37.740> and<00:04:38.070> bottom

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
before place them on the top and bottom

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.830 
before place them on the top and bottom
racks<00:04:39.030> of<00:04:39.360> your<00:04:39.539> oven<00:04:40.789> and<00:04:41.789> you're<00:04:42.660> going<00:04:42.780> to

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
racks of your oven and you're going to

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.510 
racks of your oven and you're going to
bake<00:04:43.050> them<00:04:43.320> for<00:04:43.620> nine<00:04:43.860> minutes<00:04:46.340> and<00:04:47.340> while

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
bake them for nine minutes and while

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.680 
bake them for nine minutes and while
they're<00:04:47.729> baking<00:04:47.940> we're<00:04:48.210> going<00:04:48.240> to<00:04:48.360> make<00:04:48.539> the

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
they're baking we're going to make the

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.629 
they're baking we're going to make the
chocolate<00:04:49.139> ganache<00:04:49.440> so<00:04:49.949> here<00:04:50.280> are<00:04:50.430> the

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
chocolate ganache so here are the

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:56.790 
chocolate ganache so here are the
ingredients<00:04:50.729> you'll<00:04:51.150> be<00:04:51.300> needing

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800
