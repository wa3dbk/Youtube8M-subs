00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
may not be absolutely flasher and it

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.969 
may not be absolutely flasher and it
might<00:01:54.240> be<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.390> little<00:01:54.570> bit<00:01:54.840> tweaked<00:01:55.170> on<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.590> but

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
might be a little bit tweaked on it but

would say five windows yeah that are all
the<00:01:59.790> same<00:01:59.970> size<00:02:00.299> at<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.200> same<00:02:01.409> size<00:02:01.680> shorter

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
the same size at the same size shorter

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.219 
the same size at the same size shorter
will<00:02:02.580> fish<00:02:02.820> but<00:02:03.510> they're<00:02:03.659> made<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.840> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
will fish but they're made to the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.800 
will fish but they're made to the
millimeter<00:02:04.470> right<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.760> if<00:02:06.060> they're<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.390> wish<00:02:06.630> by

millimeter right so if they're I wish by
five<00:02:07.080> millimeters<00:02:07.770> because<00:02:08.190> you're<00:02:08.340> not<00:02:08.580> a

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
five millimeters because you're not a

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.460 
five millimeters because you're not a
croissant<00:02:09.540> in<00:02:09.660> your<00:02:09.810> measurement<00:02:10.260> sure

there<00:02:27.200> was<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.319> deliberate<00:02:27.829> that<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:28.159> have<00:02:28.340> the

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
there was a deliberate that you have the

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.819 
there was a deliberate that you have the
frames<00:02:29.090> of<00:02:29.359> the<00:02:29.599> door<00:02:29.900> actually<00:02:30.109> lining<00:02:30.709> up

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
with the window frame as well because

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.990 
with the window frame as well because
wouldn't<00:02:33.170> look<00:02:33.230> so<00:02:33.409> busy<00:02:33.709> from<00:02:33.829> outside<00:02:34.219> yeah
