now the furthest body of land all the

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:21.590

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.740 

I<00:02:21.660> think<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.590> high<00:02:22.770> of<00:02:22.950> today<00:02:23.220> was<00:02:23.430> 65<00:02:24.060> degrees

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
I think the high of today was 65 degrees

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.540 
I think the high of today was 65 degrees
and<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.860> low<00:02:25.890> was<00:02:26.400> 51<00:02:27.770> so<00:02:28.770> I<00:02:28.800> know<00:02:29.100> if<00:02:29.370> you're

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
and the low was 51 so I know if you're

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.070 
and the low was 51 so I know if you're
in<00:02:29.670> one<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:29.910> those<00:02:30.950> chili<00:02:31.950> or<00:02:32.160> climates<00:02:33.080> that

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.600 
in one of those chili or climates that
probably<00:02:34.440> doesn't<00:02:34.650> mean<00:02:34.950> much<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.580> but

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
probably doesn't mean much to you but

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.630
