fret<00:00:27.660> it's<00:00:28.380> not<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:28.800> bad<00:00:29.119> what<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.150> probably

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.179 
fret it's not so bad what I probably
recommend<00:00:30.929> doing<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.470> writing<00:00:31.769> down<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
recommend doing is writing down the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.530 
recommend doing is writing down the
chords<00:00:32.520> because<00:00:32.700> there's<00:00:32.850> lots<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.180> different

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
chords because there's lots of different

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.420 
chords because there's lots of different
sections<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.469> chords<00:00:34.800> themselves<00:00:35.340> are

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
actually really easy but there's just a

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.100 
actually really easy but there's just a

no<00:02:16.070> substitute<00:02:16.580> for<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.850> C<00:02:17.030> minor<00:02:17.270> so<00:02:18.200> you

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
no substitute for the C minor so you

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.510 
no substitute for the C minor so you
better<00:02:18.440> get<00:02:18.590> it<00:02:18.710> down<00:02:18.860> because<00:02:19.070> it's<00:02:19.280> one<00:02:19.430> of
