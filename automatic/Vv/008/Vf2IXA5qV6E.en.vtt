00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.870
 still months past but the goal of 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.530
 this manipulation is to give a 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:32.419

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.929
 your calq and you unlock in 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.079

 little tab once twice 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.929
 so then you will take the 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.940
 first two copy calculations and you 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:54.559
 go drag them into this icon of 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.100
 folders to create a group we 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.839
 let's call details for example so 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.539

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:09.110

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.920
 we will click on the 2nd layer of 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.840
 group and the past in incrustation 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.670
 then we selected the 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.259
 first layer of the group and do when 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.990
 we read or pomy for those who are on 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.820
 bach or switch to negative mode of the 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.590
 crazy everything and now you go to 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.990
 spent in bright light 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.439
 it creates kinds of little everything 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.070
 like that and now the kermode group 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:37.039

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.840
 leave it by default and we do ok time 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.280
 there may be a change we have 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.679
