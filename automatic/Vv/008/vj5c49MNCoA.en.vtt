everyday<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:41.040> happens<00:01:41.720> but<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.020> my<00:01:43.170> last

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
everyday it happens but this is my last

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.920 
everyday it happens but this is my last
resort<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.100> if<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:45.030> doesn't<00:01:45.090> fix<00:01:45.689> my

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
resort and if this doesn't fix my

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.910 
resort and if this doesn't fix my
problem<00:01:46.640> then<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.759> isn't<00:01:47.939> easy<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.920> I

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
problem then it isn't easy you and I

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.859 
problem then it isn't easy you and I
hope<00:01:50.070> it's<00:01:50.280> not<00:01:50.430> but<00:01:51.060> there's<00:01:51.240> nothing<00:01:51.689> else

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
hope it's not but there's nothing else

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.920 
hope it's not but there's nothing else
that<00:01:52.049> can<00:01:52.470> be<00:01:52.530> possibly<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.610> culprit<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.210> here

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
that can be possibly the culprit so here

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.310 
that can be possibly the culprit so here
we<00:01:55.049> go<00:01:55.170> I'm<00:01:55.409> going<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.649> go<00:01:55.710> ahead<00:01:55.979> and
