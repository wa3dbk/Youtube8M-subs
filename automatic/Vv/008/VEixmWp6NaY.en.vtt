00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.180
 flanders 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.170

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.280
 very very very hospitable and very 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.670
 warm in the north it's not a 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.500
 legend 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.730
 so we said it's been a few months 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.620
 now that you're at losc 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.080
 it's been a few weeks now that 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.370
 you are titular how did it go 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.190
 it's 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.700
 this transition between the status of 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:11.360
 lining and is now the status of 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.720
 holder in the cages of losc good this 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.720
 happened 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:18.350
 the announced was abruptly 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.260
 eventually things went well 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.940
 past we will last smoothly since 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.570
 I had already played with my teammates 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.100
 on the ground so 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.110
 it's true that it's low it's a big 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.479
 great privilege I realize is 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.560
 honored holder 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.759
 today 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.749
 you made a few slaps in your 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.420
 career 

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:39.979
 we can say it without problem 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.750
 losc apps and it's the biggest club 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.969
 club where you have been holding as 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.579
 pro on will say that actually this is 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:50.959
 the most prestigious club and 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:52.969
 compared to the club I knew I 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:53.689
 discovers a club that evolves in a 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.030
 other dimension 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.369
 without offending the clubs of course 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.020
 through which I passed that with 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.459
 which I lived great moments and 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.619
 clubs that I will not forget no 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:04.640
 more obviously the losc that it goes 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.229
 take something 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.900
 France and so here is that level 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.400
 it's like some people can say 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.030
 players 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:22.269
 talking big clubs it was the 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.269
 bad to refuse a proposal from the losc 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.900
 you now have the opportunity 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.670
 to fetch the 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.170
 a place in the European Cup via the 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.159
 championship but also via the cup of 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.010
 France there you will face plabennec 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:48.450
 plabennec a club where you have never played 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.909
 but you know very well explains 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.840
 our why so I know very 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:55.300
 good because low 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.569
 the club is located about 10 15 km from 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.680
 brest already firstly secondly that 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.210
 I know very well because " 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.980
 a lot of players 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.230
 past the Brest stage evolves 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.580
 today after pennec so a lot 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.360
 from a lot of closeness we're going to say for 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.220
 me with this club 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.710
 so that plabennec players 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.530
 your already requested for already room and 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:21.290
 what gives us what obviously are waiting for us 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.820
 with a firm foot here they are happy 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.140
 they are on their cloud and that's 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.170
 totally incomprehensible and 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.600
 now there is a little more pressure 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.510
 to play a team of CFA that a team 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.460
 first division pressure no I 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.840
 I would not say that I think the cij 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.000
 annoying to get eliminated by more 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.710
 far from it can happen and 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.990
 now we know what to do 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.990
 especially to avoid this kind of trap 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.629
 another club that you know well and that we 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.650
 will soon face it is the paris 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.760
 saint-germain thursday le paris 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.090
 saint-germain that you know well because 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.980
 that you are from the Paris region and there 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.810
 without insulting the players of 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.750
 plabennec it's another caliber 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.430
 rhin because there are iliad there are 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.400
 world class players what is it 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.019
 to face a player like tan 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.319
 ibrahimovic what we only talk about in 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.449
 this moment 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.680
 objectively I was still I 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.419
 still been really impressed 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.449
 by his performance at the grand stadium in 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.600
 first leg match yeah there not 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.630
 specially 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.990
 by its goals but 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.700
 he did a lot of things in the 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.120
 building the game and for as much it 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.550

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.070
