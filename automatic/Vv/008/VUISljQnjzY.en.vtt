00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.680
 the whole connection is beautiful but 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.630
 my eye was drawn to some 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.330
 dresses that are red and black 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.790
 it reminded me and both renÃ© gruau 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.900
 who is a fashion administrator in 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.990
 40s 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.490
 and then also of tony vieira montes who 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.920
 was an excellent photographer 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.110
 illustrator there was this side 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.140
 artistic and then this side just line 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.060
 so in fact I left on one side 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.860
 working with lines but I did 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.300
 not fancy a game of classic minor 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.880
 like that I was afraid it would happen to 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.020
 bourgeois so I actually use gic 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.810
 dental that I soak in the liner 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.270
 black and in the lives of red miners 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.880
 is actually I'm creating lines around 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.350
 the eye that are both they are 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.350
 more lines than high liner 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.160
 it left illustrations of tony 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.140
 ramon test retro 80s I wanted 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.330
 adapt a little a cloakroom of a woman 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.850
 urban of now but to keep this 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.190
 abstract side this trait a little bit that they 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.990
 had red black we really got 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.460
 dropped in terms of embroidery because in 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.630
 did we want to make a leopard print 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.190
 but who want to deal with a 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.110
 ethnic way as we usually 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.140
 to see it but no longer something 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.030
 mechanical like some pins a little 90 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.900
 it's more in 3d with something more 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.709
 sculptural and more 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.709
 - planet 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.430
 is this true
