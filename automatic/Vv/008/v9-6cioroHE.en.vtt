00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
are just over two inches so it's the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.429 
are just over two inches so it's the
right<00:00:20.130> size<00:00:20.400> for<00:00:20.460> this<00:00:20.789> set<00:00:21.060> we<00:00:21.210> feel<00:00:21.390> now<00:00:22.350> if

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
right size for this set we feel now if

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.439 
right size for this set we feel now if
we<00:00:22.529> just<00:00:22.650> take<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.039> king<00:00:23.670> from<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.119> boxwood

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.130 
we just take the king from the boxwood
side<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.490> this<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.699> full<00:00:27.330> four<00:00:27.630> inch<00:00:27.810> King

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.890 
side and this is a full four inch King
and<00:00:28.699> we<00:00:29.699> see<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.179> quite<00:00:30.359> broad<00:00:30.630> based

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
and we see that it's quite broad based

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.690 
and we see that it's quite broad based
and<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.040> design<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.430> this

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
and this is the design of this

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.220 
and this is the design of this
particular<00:00:33.000> set<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.450> such<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.020> it's<00:00:34.170> a

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
particular set is such that it's a

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.470 
particular set is such that it's a
fairly<00:00:34.440> broad<00:00:34.680> base<00:00:35.010> but<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.280> narrows<00:00:36.000> quickly

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
fairly broad base but it narrows quickly

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.530 
fairly broad base but it narrows quickly
into<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.710> waste<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.370> speak<00:00:38.610> here<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.090> then

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
into the waste so to speak here and then

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.510 
into the waste so to speak here and then
just<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.899> off<00:00:40.410> at<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.800> top<00:00:40.829> for<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> final

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
just it off at the top for a final

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.090 
just it off at the top for a final
finish<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.750> we'll<00:00:42.870> see<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.290> design<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:44.040> a

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
finish and we'll see that design in a

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.330 
finish and we'll see that design in a
moment<00:00:44.399> I'll<00:00:44.520> just<00:00:44.550> replace<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:46.160> same<00:00:47.160> is

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
moment I'll just replace that same is

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.060 
moment I'll just replace that same is
