00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.740
 for pc 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:29.060
 because before I start I want to tell you 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.220
 that this is the version is not full the 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.320
 rhythm is the one that weighs 500 and some 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:39.010
 megabytes this is not starting 4 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:41.440
 gigabytes then this file 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.289
 but they will come down from the iso we have 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.769
 lowered torrent the only thing that occupies desert 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:50.879
 diamond a nation this link 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:50.879
 is in the description of the video 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.950
 I do not know anything 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.950
 they stick it 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.420
 let's wait for it to fall 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.920
 how 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.909
 two 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.790
 the main page awaits us 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.410
 seconds he asks us 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.980
 and we're going to do here in jumping 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.980
 advertising 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:45.720
 with all this 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.299
 then and from where they have downloaded it 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.480
 then we are going to click here 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.950
 where it says ftp recommended 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.140
 we click 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.640
 and here we are going to begin to lower the 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.900
 archive 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.900
 but the truth 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.399
 as the first one that says the weight 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.720
 ok then have it downloaded 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.090
 they go to where to where he was discharged 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.120
 in case of the state here they will be left 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.000
 this file knitted did 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.870
 those parts are not going to fit me 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.400
 I said because they buy it and partly because 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.400
 to have this file made 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.920
 which you have to see all the 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.920
 person works 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.730
 although we open it in heaps 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.330
 we wait 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.330
 what do we do now 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.780
 and that once the icon is open here 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.960
 great right click of the sites 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.950
 virtual and assemble image 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.950
 in the image 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.930
 and here riding on the risk of your game 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:35.810
 by clicking on it or the selection and the 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.810
 carrot and we 're going to assemble the image 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.650
 and we will open this window of 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.440
 installation 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.860
 to see if it works 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.860
 i 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.230
 I'm going to make a gameplay of the gameplay 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.610
 so they do not say although here to the place 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.070
 not because he tells me that if he wants 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:07.270
 delete I'm going to tell you that to not 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:11.500
 delete it ok I'm going to stop the video for 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.570
 record the gameplay what in the gameplay 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.900
