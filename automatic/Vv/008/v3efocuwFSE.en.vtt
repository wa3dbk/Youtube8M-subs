same<00:03:46.750> direction<00:03:47.519> sliding<00:03:48.519> it<00:03:48.639> over<00:03:48.850> so<00:03:49.389> that

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
same direction sliding it over so that

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.990 
same direction sliding it over so that
the<00:03:49.750> holes<00:03:49.959> are<00:03:50.200> showing<00:03:51.989> and<00:03:53.639> then<00:03:54.639> I'm<00:03:54.760> going

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
the holes are showing and then I'm going

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.280 
the holes are showing and then I'm going
to<00:03:55.060> thread<00:03:55.389> this<00:03:55.569> through<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.109> middle<00:03:56.350> hole

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:07.479 

and<00:04:00.440> the<00:04:00.950> hole<00:04:01.129> on<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.459> end<00:04:05.890> same<00:04:06.890> thing<00:04:07.220> with

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
and the hole on the end same thing with

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:13.210 
and the hole on the end same thing with
this<00:04:07.670> ribbon<00:04:07.970> on<00:04:08.150> the<00:04:08.269> bottom<00:04:11.860> down<00:04:12.860> through

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
this ribbon on the bottom down through

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:21.099 
this ribbon on the bottom down through
the<00:04:13.340> middle<00:04:19.180> and<00:04:20.180> then<00:04:20.329> back<00:04:20.540> up<00:04:20.570> through<00:04:21.079> the

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
the middle and then back up through the

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.530 
the middle and then back up through the
end<00:04:23.860> so<00:04:24.860> that<00:04:25.100> is<00:04:25.250> really<00:04:25.550> all<00:04:25.729> there<00:04:25.760> is<00:04:25.970> to<00:04:26.389> it

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
end so that is really all there is to it

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.629 
end so that is really all there is to it
I'm<00:04:26.780> just<00:04:26.960> going<00:04:27.169> to<00:04:27.320> keep<00:04:27.530> going<00:04:27.860> that<00:04:28.280> same

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
I'm just going to keep going that same

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.540 
I'm just going to keep going that same
way<00:04:28.880> and<00:04:29.210> what<00:04:30.020> I<00:04:30.080> usually<00:04:30.290> do<00:04:30.710> is<00:04:31.070> just<00:04:31.340> kind

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
way and what I usually do is just kind

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.219 
way and what I usually do is just kind
of<00:04:31.639> place<00:04:31.910> this<00:04:32.120> over<00:04:32.449> my<00:04:32.600> daughter's<00:04:32.960> head

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
of place this over my daughter's head

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.110 
of place this over my daughter's head
every<00:04:33.650> once<00:04:33.830> in<00:04:33.979> a<00:04:34.070> while<00:04:34.250> so<00:04:34.520> that<00:04:34.550> I<00:04:34.699> can<00:04:34.910> see

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
every once in a while so that I can see

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.090 
every once in a while so that I can see
how<00:04:35.330> long<00:04:35.900> it<00:04:36.110> is<00:04:36.199> getting<00:04:36.440> I<00:04:36.740> don't<00:04:36.800> want<00:04:37.039> to

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
how long it is getting I don't want to

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.820 
how long it is getting I don't want to
make<00:04:37.190> it<00:04:37.370> too<00:04:37.580> long<00:04:37.789> so<00:04:38.479> I<00:04:38.510> like<00:04:39.199> to<00:04:39.410> test<00:04:39.680> it

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
make it too long so I like to test it

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.650 
make it too long so I like to test it
out<00:04:39.949> every<00:04:40.250> once<00:04:40.430> in<00:04:40.550> a<00:04:40.639> while<00:04:40.820> and<00:04:41.180> then<00:04:41.360> I

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
out every once in a while and then I

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.629 
out every once in a while and then I
will<00:04:42.139> turn<00:04:42.320> this<00:04:42.500> back<00:04:42.710> on<00:04:42.919> when<00:04:43.160> we've<00:04:43.310> got<00:04:43.490> it

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
will turn this back on when we've got it

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.379 
will turn this back on when we've got it
the<00:04:43.760> length<00:04:43.940> that<00:04:44.240> we<00:04:44.360> want<00:04:44.570> it<00:04:46.060> okay<00:04:47.060> so<00:04:47.120> I'm

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
the length that we want it okay so I'm

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:50.110 
the length that we want it okay so I'm
on<00:04:47.510> the<00:04:47.660> very<00:04:47.900> last<00:04:48.260> pop<00:04:48.650> tab<00:04:49.010> I'm<00:04:49.789> just<00:04:49.940> going

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
on the very last pop tab I'm just going

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.820 
on the very last pop tab I'm just going
to<00:04:50.180> add<00:04:50.300> it<00:04:50.510> on<00:04:50.630> real<00:04:50.870> fast<00:04:51.139> the<00:04:51.440> same<00:04:51.650> way<00:04:51.800> I

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
to add it on real fast the same way I

00:04:51.830 --> 00:05:01.980 
to add it on real fast the same way I
did<00:04:51.979> the<00:04:52.160> others

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.110 

now<00:05:02.620> I'm<00:05:02.800> just<00:05:02.949> going<00:05:03.250> to<00:05:03.310> remove<00:05:03.910> these

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
now I'm just going to remove these

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.600 
now I'm just going to remove these
safety<00:05:04.600> pins<00:05:04.870> and<00:05:05.259> depending<00:05:06.100> on<00:05:06.190> what<00:05:06.370> type

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
safety pins and depending on what type

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.370 
safety pins and depending on what type
of<00:05:06.639> ribbon<00:05:06.970> you<00:05:07.210> used<00:05:07.509> is<00:05:07.780> probably<00:05:08.080> going<00:05:08.259> to

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
of ribbon you used is probably going to

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.200 
of ribbon you used is probably going to
be<00:05:08.500> pretty<00:05:08.740> frayed<00:05:09.130> so<00:05:09.460> you<00:05:09.520> may<00:05:09.729> want<00:05:09.910> to<00:05:10.000> trim

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
be pretty frayed so you may want to trim

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.559 
be pretty frayed so you may want to trim
those<00:05:10.389> ends<00:05:11.520> okay<00:05:12.520> to<00:05:12.580> place<00:05:12.940> this<00:05:13.150> on<00:05:13.360> your

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:13.569 
those ends okay to place this on your

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:15.480 
those ends okay to place this on your
head<00:05:13.780> you<00:05:14.080> can<00:05:14.229> just<00:05:14.410> put<00:05:14.860> it<00:05:14.979> where<00:05:15.099> you<00:05:15.130> want

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
head you can just put it where you want

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.309 
head you can just put it where you want
it<00:05:15.669> and<00:05:16.030> then<00:05:16.120> you've<00:05:16.389> got<00:05:16.569> this<00:05:16.720> little<00:05:17.020> tab

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:17.319 
it and then you've got this little tab

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:19.100 
it and then you've got this little tab
here<00:05:17.349> at<00:05:17.800> the<00:05:17.919> bottom<00:05:18.250> that<00:05:18.430> you<00:05:18.490> left<00:05:18.789> out

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
here at the bottom that you left out

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.870 
here at the bottom that you left out
take<00:05:20.110> one<00:05:20.410> of<00:05:20.590> the<00:05:20.740> strands<00:05:21.099> of<00:05:21.340> the<00:05:21.400> ribbon

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
take one of the strands of the ribbon

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.809 
take one of the strands of the ribbon
thread<00:05:22.720> it<00:05:22.840> through<00:05:23.050> that<00:05:23.319> tab<00:05:23.650> and<00:05:23.979> then<00:05:24.699> you

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819 
thread it through that tab and then you

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:31.860 
thread it through that tab and then you
can<00:05:25.000> tie<00:05:25.210> it<00:05:25.240> into<00:05:25.599> a<00:05:25.780> bow<00:05:30.360> if<00:05:31.360> you<00:05:31.539> want<00:05:31.750> to

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
can tie it into a bow if you want to

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.689 
can tie it into a bow if you want to
double<00:05:32.020> knot<00:05:32.229> it<00:05:32.620> you<00:05:32.770> can<00:05:33.009> but<00:05:33.340> that<00:05:33.490> should

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
double knot it you can but that should

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:36.480 
double knot it you can but that should
hold<00:05:33.819> pretty<00:05:34.090> securely<00:05:34.630> so<00:05:35.500> that<00:05:35.740> is<00:05:35.979> what<00:05:36.220> it

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
hold pretty securely so that is what it

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.400 
hold pretty securely so that is what it
looks<00:05:36.699> like<00:05:36.820> this<00:05:37.419> probably<00:05:37.690> isn't<00:05:38.020> the<00:05:38.289> best

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
looks like this probably isn't the best

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.339 
looks like this probably isn't the best
hairstyle<00:05:38.919> to<00:05:39.520> demonstrate<00:05:40.090> with<00:05:40.720> a<00:05:40.750> headband

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:41.349 
hairstyle to demonstrate with a headband

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:42.600 
hairstyle to demonstrate with a headband
but<00:05:41.590> we<00:05:41.740> really<00:05:41.979> didn't<00:05:42.220> think<00:05:42.250> about<00:05:42.460> that

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
but we really didn't think about that

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.060 
but we really didn't think about that
before<00:05:43.090> we<00:05:43.690> did<00:05:43.840> this<00:05:43.990> video<00:05:44.199> but<00:05:44.830> that'll

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
before we did this video but that'll

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:54.270 
before we did this video but that'll
give<00:05:45.220> you<00:05:45.310> the<00:05:45.430> general<00:05:45.669> idea

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.340 

you
