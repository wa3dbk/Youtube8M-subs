really<00:01:34.220> work<00:01:34.520> out<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:35.620> we<00:01:36.620> try<00:01:36.800> jumping<00:01:36.980> to

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
really work out so we try jumping to

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.380 
really work out so we try jumping to
that<00:01:37.220> fence<00:01:37.670> right<00:01:37.790> there<00:01:37.850> but<00:01:38.090> it<00:01:38.150> doesn't

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390
