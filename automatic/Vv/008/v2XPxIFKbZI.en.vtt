00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.230
 well then the first thing I'm going to 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.180
 do how are we going to use super 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.849
 bright and shocking we will use 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.110
 a base white quote below so that 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.110
 all colors are much more 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.639
 vibrant then the advance that I use 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.639
 It is a cream illuminated 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.740
 a little bit 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.740
 and one put on top of the bamboo bar 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.970
 you can also under my earth 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.830
 and I'm once going to work like 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.690
 illuminator because there I will not put 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:42.110
 shadows when you apply a little 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.830
 also as the internal part and also 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.830
 Down here 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.059
 now I'm going to use this palette of 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.699
 shadows that all colors have 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.250
 and I'm going to use a little broach 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.920
 illuminate brushes are blurring 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.230
 as well as loose hairs and 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.690
 you know and you 're going to drink the green tea glass 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.570
 that is a green like the lime is a 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.150
 very very very bright color 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.250
 and what I'm going to do is I 'm going to put 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.250
 this color over the entire rioja basin 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.590
 The intensity of the color depends on 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.750
 when you want then if they do not want 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.970
 very gentle makeup output 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.650
 you apply little and if you want a color 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.900
 so much more vibrant you are applying 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.560
 of a caguas so that the color is enhanced 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.560
 Much more 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.429
 let's try to climb a little bit towards 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.259
 the asean try to always have them 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.899
 here as enlightened then where 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.630
 you can see yourself ready as you can see I have 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.939
 here the color green but anyway 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.979
 I told myself the eyelid area clean in the 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.959
 area of ​​the eyelid to take a blue that is 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.000
 so super super vibrant as is the 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:58.730
 water and can take the same removes us 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.740
 it does not really matter 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.540
 we are going to that we are going to compact this 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.540
 color on all the mobile eyelid 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.400
 something like that 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.210
 can do the same in another 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.390
 and once we have applied this 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.040
 color what the field comes to think about it 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.010
 to blur with the green 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.530
 very soft just on the edges so that it does not 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.540
 there is a very hard separation and do not go 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.200
 in the transition of very beautiful colors 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.200
 blurred 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.519
 perfect now I'm not going to do to you is like 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.650
 take a tube of yanbal sugar that 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.450
 call sea and moon and bring these two 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.879
 super nice colors that are a blue 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.500
 king and a silver color will use this 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.299
 I'm going to start seeing him in 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.069
 depth in the makeup how much 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.930
 larger to angled brochita of these for 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.319
 blur and you will try to take a little 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.319
 from the blue 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.750
 to start placing only in the 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.940
 outer part of my eye 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.470
 A) Yes 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.470
 do not do the same my other 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.760
 and that is to start integrating this color 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.370
 about the basin of my eye let's try 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.840
 to keep this color alone solos only 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.459
 on the outside 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.720
 I'm going to take the same brush that 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.600
 we were blurring before 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.760
 and will help us eliminate this color with 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.600
 the green and with the lighter blue that 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.600
 we have put before 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.319
 and then we'll do a little bit of 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.640
 depth to makeup and what is going to 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.680
 do now is that it will start to illuminate 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.780
 certain points then it will take a 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.879
 Ear well it will take the same green 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.599
 that we put in the eye socket I'm going to 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:03.069
 put it here on the inside and I'm going to 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.859
 Press this heart to make it look good 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.939
 well vibrant later I'll try to 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.939
 join with the other colors 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.980
 you can apply a little more of this 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.989
 green like 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.989
 the line under the eyelashes 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.090
 and here after I will take a nice brush 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.070
 well, I'm going to hit with a blue 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.760
 more or less pigmented then I'll 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.860
 use this 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:35.050
 if it's a little bit clearer and I 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.050
 Apply over the entire line below 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.530
 now it's going to take the same dark blue 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.530
 what we used before 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.880
 and melo to put on the outside 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.000
 and if you want, also push a little 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.910
 more of this here to obscure what 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.970
 a little bit in the part of you what 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.740
 want like kia like this is without delineated the 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.199
 where we the beautiful combination between 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.990
 blue and green are like colors 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:16.030
 prices turquoise we did now let's go 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.030
 to start delineating to complete the 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.410
 makeup to outline I will use 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.740
 as you already know and who live a 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.169
 time 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.979
 I will start 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.979
 over here 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:42.700
 we are also going to try to delineate the 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.700
 part of inside of the eyes 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:52.509
 Today I like to always be like colistas 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.919
 outward because it lengthens the way 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:57.249
 of the eyes since we 're in a bit 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:58.089
 small then of the tail as of 

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:01.139
 the bottom 

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:04.069
 I'm going to take a tail out 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:04.069
 and up 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:10.229
 something like that and that's the complete 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:22.379
 and ready girls do not stay 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:22.379
 but we are super delineated 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.310
 to complement that look like the super 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.950
 dramatic I'm going to put on the eyelashes 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:31.740
 and I showed you how I do it 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:35.550
 I'm going to choose this one that you can see are 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.930
 so dramatic the casualties in getting a 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.830
 little bit to make it much easier 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:44.750
 apply them and then they will not communicate 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.750
 Here they are going to come back like this 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.030
 and these girls then I want to create the 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.159
 makeup of the eyes and I'm left with 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:09.379
 eyelashes and outlined and you can see 

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:11.150
 much more formed much more beautiful and 

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:13.430
 well do not like what I put in the 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.319
 scale because I turned the camera off but 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.030
 It was very simple as I had many 

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:20.400
 the eyes then chosen this 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:23.610
 processor that is like this is very pearls 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:26.160
 ticona brochita without angle apply on the 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.630
 contour of the face and this is for all 

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.289
 you know he used a mixture of two 

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:35.430
 lipsticks the first one is this that is like 

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:38.909
 like a coral color like rosarito and 

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:41.669
 then use the following soft 

00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:43.080
 terrible that they are lipsticks and as very 

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:45.869
 clarito so that it does not attract attention 

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.189
 both the skilful but on the leaves this has 

00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:49.099
 been all for this if you liked it
