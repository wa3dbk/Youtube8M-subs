kind of still stuck in your hair so
that's<00:01:11.100> obviously<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.760> cause<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.479> also<00:01:12.750> if<00:01:12.810> you

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
that's obviously a cause and also if you

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.600 
that's obviously a cause and also if you
don't<00:01:13.020> really<00:01:13.170> shampoo<00:01:13.590> regularly<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.400> can

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
don't really shampoo regularly that can

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.850 
don't really shampoo regularly that can
also<00:01:14.880> cause<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.930> buildup<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
also cause that buildup is the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.980 
also cause that buildup is the
combination<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.580> dead<00:01:17.850> skin<00:01:18.119> cells<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.720> oil

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
combination of dead skin cells and oil

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.719 
combination of dead skin cells and oil
that<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.290> trapped<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.979> your<00:01:20.009> hair<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.580> I'm
