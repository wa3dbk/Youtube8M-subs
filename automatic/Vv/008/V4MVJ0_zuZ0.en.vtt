setup I have two jokes of fermenting Lee
media<00:00:13.200> honey<00:00:13.469> wine<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.150> over<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.240> course<00:00:15.420> of

media honey wine and over the course of
several<00:00:15.929> weeks<00:00:16.859> training<00:00:17.279> two<00:00:17.640> months<00:00:18.090> what

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
several weeks training two months what

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.840 
several weeks training two months what
will<00:00:18.869> happen<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.890> those<00:00:20.250> batches<00:00:20.699> of

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
will happen is that those batches of

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.599 
will happen is that those batches of
mine<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:22.320> speaking<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.800> honey<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.340> water

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
mine and of speaking of honey and water

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.210 
mine and of speaking of honey and water
will<00:00:24.240> actually<00:00:24.300> change<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.560> color<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.130> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
will actually change in a color and the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.920 
will actually change in a color and the
texture<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.910> then<00:00:27.029> they'll<00:00:27.570> turn<00:00:27.720> into<00:00:27.869> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
texture and then they'll turn into the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.540 
texture and then they'll turn into the
why<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.080> might<00:00:28.320> not<00:00:28.500> make<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.680> kind<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.130> like<00:00:29.250> soup

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
why I might not make a kind of like soup

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.290 
why I might not make a kind of like soup
but<00:00:30.539> what<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.230> wanted<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.560> do<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:32.059> every<00:00:33.059> day<00:00:33.239> you

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
but what I wanted to do is every day you

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.569 
but what I wanted to do is every day you
wanted<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.750> take<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.899> picture<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.320> those<00:00:34.620> so

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
wanted to take a picture of those so

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.580 
wanted to take a picture of those so
over<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.149> course<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.780> couple<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.140> months<00:00:37.410> I

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
over the course of a couple of months I

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.709 
over the course of a couple of months I
can<00:00:38.100> turn<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.460> into<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.790> stop-motion<00:00:39.059> animation

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
can turn it into a stop-motion animation

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.380 
can turn it into a stop-motion animation
and<00:00:40.110> you'll<00:00:41.100> actually<00:00:41.370> see<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.090> color<00:00:42.300> change

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
and you'll actually see the color change

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.090 
and you'll actually see the color change
before<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.930> realize<00:00:43.379> it'll<00:00:43.590> be<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> microwave

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
before you realize it'll be a microwave

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.040 
before you realize it'll be a microwave
for<00:00:44.250> me<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.460> keep<00:00:45.000> track<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.570> fermenting

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
for me to keep track of the fermenting

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.770 
for me to keep track of the fermenting
process<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.399> nice<00:00:48.180> thing<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.420> look<00:00:48.600> at

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
process and just a nice thing to look at

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.840 
process and just a nice thing to look at
but<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.739> real<00:00:49.860> point<00:00:50.070> here<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.370> wanted<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.700> make

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
but the real point here I wanted to make

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.209 
but the real point here I wanted to make
is<00:00:51.410> something<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.500> have<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.680> do<00:00:52.890> if<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.070> want

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
to make it or and if you want to make a

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.920 
to make it or and if you want to make a

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
stop motion animation over the course of

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.400 
stop motion animation over the course of
time<00:00:58.199> like<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:59.239> whereas<00:01:00.239> like<00:01:00.840> I'm<00:01:01.020> taking<00:01:01.350> a

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
picture of South in one picture every

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.030 
picture of South in one picture every
day<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.899> could<00:01:04.049> do<00:01:04.170> more<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.409> could<00:01:04.619> do<00:01:04.739> maybe

day and I could do more I could do maybe

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.590 
day and I could do more I could do maybe
two<00:01:05.220> pictures<00:01:05.400> today<00:01:05.700> but<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:05.939> limited<00:01:06.450> myself

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
two pictures today but I limited myself

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.060 
two pictures today but I limited myself
to<00:01:06.810> one<00:01:06.960> picture<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> day<00:01:07.409> over<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.770> course<00:01:07.799> of

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
to one picture a day over the course of

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.500 
to one picture a day over the course of
a<00:01:08.189> couple<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.460> months<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:09.150> what<00:01:09.270> I've<00:01:09.360> done<00:01:09.390> is

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
a couple of months so what I've done is

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.850 
a couple of months so what I've done is
I've<00:01:09.630> set<00:01:09.900> myself<00:01:10.020> up<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.320> little<00:01:10.350> gig<00:01:10.710> with<00:01:10.830> my

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
I've set myself up a little gig with my

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.960 
I've set myself up a little gig with my
camera<00:01:11.330> can<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.420> see<00:01:12.630> ya<00:01:13.159> now<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.580> importance

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
camera can you see ya now the importance

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.219 
camera can you see ya now the importance
of<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.420> when<00:01:15.630> you're<00:01:15.750> taking<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:16.020> stop

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
of that is when you're taking a stop

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.100 
of that is when you're taking a stop
motion<00:01:16.350> animation<00:01:16.950> picture<00:01:17.659> you<00:01:18.659> have<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.840> try

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
motion animation picture you have to try

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.010 
motion animation picture you have to try
to<00:01:19.170> take<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.799> picture<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.970> same<00:01:21.390> exact

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
to take the picture in the same exact

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.429 
to take the picture in the same exact
spa<00:01:22.460> for<00:01:23.460> every<00:01:23.729> shot<00:01:24.030> if<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.600> don't<00:01:24.810> picture

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
spa for every shot if you don't picture

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.090 
spa for every shot if you don't picture
comes<00:01:25.710> out<00:01:25.830> very<00:01:25.860> young<00:01:26.840> jittery<00:01:27.860> so<00:01:28.860> I

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
comes out very young jittery so I

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.280 
comes out very young jittery so I
recommend<00:01:29.630> if<00:01:30.630> you're<00:01:30.750> doing<00:01:30.960> something<00:01:31.079> like

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
recommend if you're doing something like

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.929 
recommend if you're doing something like
that<00:01:31.470> she<00:01:31.650> set<00:01:31.920> some<00:01:32.130> kind<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.520> wouldn't

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
that she set some kind of it wouldn't

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.310 
that she set some kind of it wouldn't
you<00:01:33.090> got<00:01:33.299> there<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.810> can<00:01:33.930> lock<00:01:34.110> your

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
you got there so you can lock your

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.560 
you got there so you can lock your
camera<00:01:34.650> at<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.829> one<00:01:35.130> position<00:01:35.729> then<00:01:36.299> every

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
camera at the one position then every

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.600 
camera at the one position then every

because have a lot of different projects
going<00:01:53.009> on<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:54.270> camera<00:01:54.630> comes<00:01:54.840> out<00:01:55.219> and<00:01:56.219> i

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
going on so this camera comes out and i

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.940 
going on so this camera comes out and i
use<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:56.820> foot<00:01:57.110> so<00:01:58.110> what<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.320> means<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.799> i'm

use it on foot so what that means is i'm

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.830 
use it on foot so what that means is i'm
never<00:01:59.100> going<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.430> get<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.610> exactly<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.750> the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
never going to get it exactly in the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.600 
never going to get it exactly in the
same<00:02:01.079> exact<00:02:01.619> spot<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:02.130> can<00:02:02.250> look<00:02:02.369> at<00:02:02.520> this

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
same exact spot you can look at this

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.840 
same exact spot you can look at this
table<00:02:02.880> set<00:02:03.210> up<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.450> that

table set up in that

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.279 
table set up in that

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
made so it's pretty close what will

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.990 
made so it's pretty close what will
happen<00:02:08.560> is<00:02:08.649> as<00:02:08.830> I<00:02:09.220> look<00:02:09.369> at<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.520> pictures<00:02:09.850> will

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
happen is as I look at the pictures will

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.240 
happen is as I look at the pictures will
have<00:02:10.179> to<00:02:10.330> tweak<00:02:11.290> them<00:02:11.500> a<00:02:11.530> little<00:02:11.709> bit<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.130> make

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
have to tweak them a little bit to make

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.070
