00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
and one had teeth problems so we learned

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.929 
and one had teeth problems so we learned
quite<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.560> lot<00:01:40.650> about<00:01:40.829> diets<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.579> things<00:01:41.640> like

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.370 
quite a lot about diets and things like
that<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.899> when<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.350> do<00:01:43.470> go<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.890> island<00:01:44.280> and

that so when you do go to the island and

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.590 
that so when you do go to the island and
use<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.409> bit<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.649> common<00:01:46.740> sense<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.340> suppose<00:01:47.600> but

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
use a bit of common sense I suppose but

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.420 
use a bit of common sense I suppose but
