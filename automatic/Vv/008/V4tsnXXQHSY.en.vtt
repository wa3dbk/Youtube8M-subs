western<00:04:56.040> setting<00:04:56.670> and<00:04:56.910> take<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.510> lizards<00:04:57.870> out

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
western setting and take the lizards out

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.750 
western setting and take the lizards out
and<00:04:58.200> put<00:04:58.320> people<00:04:58.710> in<00:04:58.830> there<00:04:58.980> it's<00:04:59.160> not<00:04:59.310> obvious

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
and put people in there it's not obvious

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.540 
and put people in there it's not obvious
a<00:04:59.970> here<00:05:00.690> a<00:05:00.720> person<00:05:01.620> lies<00:05:01.860> about<00:05:02.130> being<00:05:02.190> a<00:05:02.520> hero

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
a here a person lies about being a hero

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.940 
a here a person lies about being a hero
goes<00:05:03.120> in<00:05:03.330> there<00:05:03.510> and<00:05:03.780> does<00:05:04.200> this<00:05:04.440> all<00:05:04.740> the

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
goes in there and does this all the

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.770 
goes in there and does this all the
stuff<00:05:05.060> accidentally<00:05:06.060> and<00:05:06.390> makes<00:05:06.570> himself

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
stuff accidentally and makes himself

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.450 
stuff accidentally and makes himself
look<00:05:06.990> like<00:05:07.110> a<00:05:07.230> hero<00:05:07.470> and<00:05:07.770> then<00:05:08.220> of<00:05:08.430> course

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
look like a hero and then of course

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.340 
look like a hero and then of course
people<00:05:08.820> find<00:05:09.180> out<00:05:09.330> that<00:05:09.390> he<00:05:09.630> really<00:05:09.900> isn't<00:05:10.050> and

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
people find out that he really isn't and

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.900 
people find out that he really isn't and
then<00:05:10.470> he<00:05:10.650> just<00:05:10.950> pretty<00:05:11.190> much<00:05:11.280> gets<00:05:11.490> shunned

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
then he just pretty much gets shunned

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.510 
then he just pretty much gets shunned
and<00:05:12.150> he<00:05:12.690> leaves<00:05:13.320> and<00:05:13.680> comes<00:05:13.950> back<00:05:14.190> and

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
and he leaves and comes back and

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.430 
and he leaves and comes back and
actually<00:05:15.090> becomes<00:05:15.570> a<00:05:15.660> hero<00:05:15.750> and<00:05:16.110> that's

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
actually becomes a hero and that's

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.750 
actually becomes a hero and that's
really<00:05:16.620> the<00:05:16.860> story<00:05:17.070> I<00:05:17.190> mean<00:05:17.430> I'm<00:05:17.550> not<00:05:17.700> really

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
really the story I mean I'm not really

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.790 
really the story I mean I'm not really
spoiling<00:05:18.210> anything<00:05:18.390> that<00:05:18.720> is<00:05:18.930> the<00:05:19.230> story<00:05:19.470> and

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
spoiling anything that is the story and

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.980 
spoiling anything that is the story and
uh<00:05:20.190> I<00:05:20.490> guess<00:05:20.880> I<00:05:21.000> am<00:05:21.120> spoiling<00:05:21.390> it<00:05:21.630> but<00:05:21.780> really

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
uh I guess I am spoiling it but really

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.290 
uh I guess I am spoiling it but really
that's<00:05:22.110> the<00:05:22.290> story<00:05:22.530> and<00:05:23.220> really<00:05:23.880> if<00:05:24.120> you're

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
that's the story and really if you're

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.910 
that's the story and really if you're
coming<00:05:24.480> into<00:05:24.690> this<00:05:24.870> movie<00:05:25.050> for<00:05:25.170> story<00:05:25.620> then

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
coming into this movie for story then

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.550 
coming into this movie for story then
you're<00:05:26.610> gonna<00:05:26.730> be<00:05:27.000> very<00:05:27.510> disappointed<00:05:28.050> i<00:05:28.380> mean

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
you're gonna be very disappointed i mean

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.560 
you're gonna be very disappointed i mean
the<00:05:28.650> characters<00:05:29.070> are<00:05:29.100> very<00:05:29.430> cool<00:05:29.730> very<00:05:29.760> well

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
the characters are very cool very well

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.960 
the characters are very cool very well
animated<00:05:30.930> and<00:05:31.260> have<00:05:31.680> very<00:05:31.890> good<00:05:32.310> voice<00:05:32.520> actors

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
animated and have very good voice actors

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.970 
animated and have very good voice actors
to<00:05:33.150> go<00:05:33.300> with<00:05:33.480> it<00:05:33.600> but<00:05:34.020> really<00:05:34.320> the<00:05:34.470> story<00:05:34.680> is

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
to go with it but really the story is

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.680 
to go with it but really the story is
pretty<00:05:35.370> generic<00:05:35.850> for<00:05:36.120> an<00:05:36.210> animated<00:05:36.540> film

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
pretty generic for an animated film

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.890 
pretty generic for an animated film
we've<00:05:37.230> seen<00:05:37.440> this<00:05:37.560> millions<00:05:37.980> of<00:05:38.100> times<00:05:38.220> before

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
we've seen this millions of times before

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.390 
we've seen this millions of times before
mine<00:05:39.900> are<00:05:40.110> negative<00:05:40.500> for<00:05:40.530> the<00:05:40.740> film<00:05:41.040> is<00:05:41.220> that

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
mine are negative for the film is that

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.740 
mine are negative for the film is that
the<00:05:41.550> movie<00:05:41.820> is<00:05:41.850> actually<00:05:42.030> a<00:05:42.300> little<00:05:42.390> bit<00:05:42.570> too

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
the movie is actually a little bit too

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.480 
the movie is actually a little bit too
long<00:05:42.990> for<00:05:43.260> an<00:05:43.320> animated<00:05:43.770> film<00:05:43.800> you<00:05:44.100> think<00:05:44.340> it

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
long for an animated film you think it

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.370 
long for an animated film you think it
would<00:05:44.580> be<00:05:44.730> probably<00:05:45.030> like<00:05:45.150> 90<00:05:45.630> 95<00:05:46.080> minutes

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
would be probably like 90 95 minutes

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.530 
would be probably like 90 95 minutes
long<00:05:46.620> but<00:05:46.830> it's<00:05:47.160> actually<00:05:47.250> 110<00:05:48.120> minutes<00:05:48.300> long

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
long but it's actually 110 minutes long

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.900 
long but it's actually 110 minutes long
which<00:05:48.570> is<00:05:48.900> really<00:05:49.590> really<00:05:49.890> long<00:05:50.160> for<00:05:50.490> most

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
which is really really long for most

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.970 
which is really really long for most
animated<00:05:51.390> films<00:05:51.900> out<00:05:52.080> there<00:05:52.290> I<00:05:52.440> mean<00:05:52.770> come<00:05:52.950> on

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980 
animated films out there I mean come on

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.380 
animated films out there I mean come on
how<00:05:53.220> to<00:05:53.280> train<00:05:53.550> your<00:05:53.580> dragon<00:05:53.700> was<00:05:54.090> probably

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
how to train your dragon was probably

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.870 
how to train your dragon was probably
closer<00:05:54.780> to<00:05:54.960> this<00:05:55.350> length<00:05:55.650> but<00:05:56.190> still<00:05:56.490> it<00:05:56.760> was

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
closer to this length but still it was

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.670 
closer to this length but still it was
it<00:05:57.090> I<00:05:57.450> didn't<00:05:57.750> think<00:05:57.780> it<00:05:58.020> was<00:05:58.080> actually<00:05:58.470> as

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
it I didn't think it was actually as

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.890 
it I didn't think it was actually as
boring<00:05:59.280> as<00:05:59.430> Rango<00:05:59.940> was<00:06:00.120> because<00:06:00.420> Rango<00:06:00.720> had

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
boring as Rango was because Rango had

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.570 
boring as Rango was because Rango had
some<00:06:01.260> scenes<00:06:01.620> here<00:06:01.980> and<00:06:02.100> there<00:06:02.220> that<00:06:02.490> were

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
some scenes here and there that were

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.190 
some scenes here and there that were
boring<00:06:02.820> not<00:06:03.060> saying<00:06:03.270> the<00:06:03.390> movie<00:06:03.630> the<00:06:04.020> whole

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
boring not saying the movie the whole

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.510 
boring not saying the movie the whole
movie<00:06:04.470> was<00:06:04.620> freaking<00:06:04.980> born<00:06:05.190> because<00:06:05.370> I

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
movie was freaking born because I

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.580 
movie was freaking born because I
thought<00:06:05.670> the<00:06:05.790> whole<00:06:05.820> movie<00:06:06.120> as<00:06:06.600> a<00:06:06.630> package<00:06:06.960> was

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
thought the whole movie as a package was

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.200 
thought the whole movie as a package was
just<00:06:07.800> really<00:06:08.280> fun<00:06:08.580> and<00:06:08.820> very<00:06:08.970> entertaining

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
just really fun and very entertaining

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.500 
just really fun and very entertaining
but<00:06:10.140> still<00:06:10.470> I<00:06:10.500> doubt<00:06:10.860> the<00:06:11.070> some<00:06:11.940> scenes<00:06:12.300> here

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510 
but still I doubt the some scenes here

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.850 
but still I doubt the some scenes here
there<00:06:12.720> could<00:06:12.750> have<00:06:12.960> been<00:06:13.020> cut<00:06:13.320> out<00:06:13.470> some<00:06:13.740> of

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
there could have been cut out some of

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.290 
there could have been cut out some of
them<00:06:13.980> could've<00:06:14.220> been<00:06:14.310> a<00:06:14.400> little<00:06:14.550> shorter<00:06:15.030> just

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
them could've been a little shorter just

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.820 
them could've been a little shorter just
to<00:06:15.420> make<00:06:15.570> it<00:06:15.600> a<00:06:15.750> little<00:06:15.930> bit<00:06:16.080> shorter<00:06:16.350> movie

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
to make it a little bit shorter movie

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.980 
to make it a little bit shorter movie
and<00:06:17.040> more<00:06:17.460> digestible<00:06:17.700> i<00:06:18.270> would<00:06:18.450> say<00:06:18.600> because

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
and more digestible i would say because

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.170 
and more digestible i would say because
you<00:06:19.380> know<00:06:19.470> when<00:06:19.710> this<00:06:19.890> movie<00:06:20.220> comes<00:06:20.460> on<00:06:20.550> DVD<00:06:20.820> if

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
you know when this movie comes on DVD if

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.390 
you know when this movie comes on DVD if
i<00:06:21.450> buy<00:06:21.690> it<00:06:21.720> on<00:06:21.930> DVD<00:06:22.230> or<00:06:22.410> blu-ray<00:06:22.650> i'll<00:06:23.010> be

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
i buy it on DVD or blu-ray i'll be

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.560 
i buy it on DVD or blu-ray i'll be
skipping<00:06:23.460> some<00:06:23.940> of<00:06:24.060> those<00:06:24.150> scenes<00:06:24.390> because

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
skipping some of those scenes because

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.660 
skipping some of those scenes because
they're<00:06:24.810> kind<00:06:25.050> of<00:06:25.110> boring<00:06:25.170> but<00:06:26.040> it<00:06:26.370> was<00:06:26.490> really

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:26.670 
they're kind of boring but it was really

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.150 
they're kind of boring but it was really
like<00:06:26.940> scare<00:06:27.420> scenes<00:06:27.780> like<00:06:27.930> maybe<00:06:28.170> 12<00:06:28.770> maybe

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 
like scare scenes like maybe 12 maybe

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.490 
like scare scenes like maybe 12 maybe
even<00:06:29.270> about<00:06:30.270> maybe<00:06:30.480> three<00:06:30.570> scenes<00:06:31.200> i<00:06:31.350> would

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
even about maybe three scenes i would

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.040 
even about maybe three scenes i would
say<00:06:31.680> and<00:06:31.920> that's<00:06:32.790> okay<00:06:33.120> and<00:06:33.270> also<00:06:33.390> some<00:06:33.900> of<00:06:33.930> the

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
say and that's okay and also some of the

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.990 
say and that's okay and also some of the
other<00:06:34.200> negatives<00:06:34.680> i<00:06:34.770> talked<00:06:34.980> about<00:06:35.100> like<00:06:35.580> some

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 
other negatives i talked about like some

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.670 
other negatives i talked about like some
of<00:06:36.090> the<00:06:36.150> jokes<00:06:36.330> fall<00:06:36.630> flat<00:06:36.870> and<00:06:37.140> also<00:06:37.530> the

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
of the jokes fall flat and also the

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.560 
of the jokes fall flat and also the
marketing<00:06:38.100> was<00:06:38.280> a<00:06:38.310> little<00:06:38.610> weird<00:06:38.880> for<00:06:39.390> this

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
marketing was a little weird for this

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.790 
marketing was a little weird for this
because<00:06:39.840> it<00:06:39.960> made<00:06:40.080> it<00:06:40.200> really<00:06:40.410> look<00:06:40.620> like<00:06:40.650> a

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
because it made it really look like a

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.620 
because it made it really look like a
Nickelodeon<00:06:41.550> movie<00:06:41.580> because<00:06:42.180> it<00:06:42.300> is<00:06:42.420> from

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:42.630 
Nickelodeon movie because it is from

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.780 
Nickelodeon movie because it is from
Nickelodeon<00:06:43.170> studios<00:06:43.380> but<00:06:44.250> really<00:06:44.550> it's

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:44.790 
Nickelodeon studios but really it's

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.270 
Nickelodeon studios but really it's
actually<00:06:45.210> very<00:06:45.240> mature<00:06:46.230> for<00:06:46.260> what<00:06:46.680> it<00:06:46.800> is<00:06:46.950> even

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 
actually very mature for what it is even

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.710 
actually very mature for what it is even
though<00:06:47.370> there's<00:06:47.610> some<00:06:47.850> fart<00:06:48.090> jokes<00:06:48.390> here<00:06:48.600> and

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 
though there's some fart jokes here and

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.390 
though there's some fart jokes here and
there<00:06:48.840> it's<00:06:49.320> still<00:06:49.560> much<00:06:49.830> more<00:06:49.860> mature<00:06:50.250> than

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
there it's still much more mature than

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.520 
there it's still much more mature than
you<00:06:50.580> would<00:06:50.790> think<00:06:50.820> and<00:06:51.270> I<00:06:51.750> really<00:06:51.840> like<00:06:52.320> that<00:06:52.350> I
