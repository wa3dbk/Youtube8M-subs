00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.310 

well<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.789> mean<00:00:18.180> at<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.720> toss<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:19.080> would<00:00:19.230> have

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
well I mean at the toss I would have

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.980 
well I mean at the toss I would have
taken<00:00:19.500> 143<00:00:20.250> definitely<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.150> thought<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.660> bolus

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
taken 143 definitely I thought a bolus

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.340 
taken 143 definitely I thought a bolus
volts<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.380> probably<00:00:23.720> all<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.869> them<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.170> thought

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
volts so probably all of them I thought

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.429 
volts so probably all of them I thought
we<00:00:25.500> rotated<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.949> bowler<00:00:26.160> via<00:00:26.400> 7<00:00:26.699> bowlers<00:00:27.050> and

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.659 

you<00:00:31.439> know<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.590> thought<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.859> ball<00:00:32.009> would<00:00:32.399> really

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
you know I thought the ball would really

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.170 
you know I thought the ball would really
well<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.210> restrict<00:00:33.510> them<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.630> 143<00:00:34.640> but<00:00:35.640> you

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
well to restrict them to 143 but you

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.340 
well to restrict them to 143 but you
know<00:00:36.270> any<00:00:36.420> total<00:00:36.690> has<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.899> be<00:00:36.989> chased<00:00:37.200> it's

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
know any total has to be chased it's

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.760 
know any total has to be chased it's
never<00:00:37.530> easy<00:00:37.710> Moomba<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.190> very<00:00:38.340> good<00:00:38.430> side<00:00:38.670> so

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
never easy Moomba is a very good side so

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.750 
never easy Moomba is a very good side so
you<00:00:40.770> know<00:00:40.860> you've<00:00:41.010> got<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.219> play<00:00:41.340> well<00:00:41.460> against

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
you know you've got to play well against

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.930 
you know you've got to play well against
them<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.300> was<00:00:42.390> nice<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.750> see<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.020> way<00:00:43.940> we

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940

them so it was nice to see the way we
chased<00:00:45.210> as<00:00:45.420> well<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.690> was<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.840> calmness<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.410> the

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.080 
chased as well it was a calmness in the
chase<00:00:46.710> there<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.039> professionalism<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.700> the

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
chase there the professionalism in the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.900 
chase there the professionalism in the
chase<00:00:48.300> there<00:00:48.690> was<00:00:48.780> no<00:00:48.899> panic<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.570> you<00:00:51.570> know<00:00:51.690> we

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
chase there was no panic and you know we

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.790 
chase there was no panic and you know we
we<00:00:53.910> got<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.180> job<00:00:54.360> done<00:00:54.510> which<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.379> terrific

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
we got the job done which is a terrific

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.689 
we got the job done which is a terrific
way<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.129> start<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.520> tone

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.920 

I<00:01:01.930> think<00:01:03.549> the<00:01:04.549> decision<00:01:04.970> to<00:01:05.059> bowl<00:01:05.239> probably

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
I think the decision to bowl probably

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.690 
I think the decision to bowl probably
would<00:01:06.200> have<00:01:06.380> in<00:01:06.500> any<00:01:06.619> case<00:01:06.890> probably<00:01:07.549> we

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
would have in any case probably we

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.249 
would have in any case probably we
wanted<00:01:08.090> to<00:01:08.150> chase<00:01:08.330> you<00:01:08.479> in<00:01:08.600> any<00:01:08.750> case<00:01:08.930> but<00:01:09.140> yeah

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
wanted to chase you in any case but yeah

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.920 
wanted to chase you in any case but yeah
the<00:01:09.380> decision<00:01:09.710> to<00:01:09.830> play<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.070> spinner<00:01:10.369> was<00:01:10.930> not

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
the decision to play the spinner was not

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.170 
the decision to play the spinner was not
play<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:12.229> spinner<00:01:12.470> was<00:01:12.790> was<00:01:13.790> one<00:01:13.940> we<00:01:14.060> took

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
play the spinner was was one we took

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.340 
play the spinner was was one we took
looking<00:01:14.479> at<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:14.630> conditions<00:01:15.020> you<00:01:15.110> know<00:01:15.200> the

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
looking at the conditions you know the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.990 
looking at the conditions you know the
wicket<00:01:16.100> had<00:01:16.189> been<00:01:16.310> under<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:16.700> covers<00:01:16.970> a

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
wicket had been under the covers a

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.980 
wicket had been under the covers a
little<00:01:17.330> bit<00:01:19.030> in<00:01:20.030> normal<00:01:20.390> situations<00:01:20.869> it's

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
little bit in normal situations it's

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.050 
little bit in normal situations it's
nice<00:01:21.140> to<00:01:21.350> have<00:01:21.500> an<00:01:21.680> Abba<00:01:22.100> spinning<00:01:22.789> spinning

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
nice to have an Abba spinning spinning

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.570 
nice to have an Abba spinning spinning
option<00:01:23.539> but<00:01:24.350> we<00:01:24.860> reckon<00:01:25.159> with<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.310> wicket

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
option but we reckon with the wicket

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.310 
option but we reckon with the wicket
Undercovers<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:26.210> we<00:01:26.270> had<00:01:26.390> Ashok<00:01:26.720> and<00:01:26.869> Shox

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
Undercovers and we had Ashok and Shox

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.840 
Undercovers and we had Ashok and Shox
been<00:01:27.470> boring<00:01:27.710> particularly<00:01:28.159> well<00:01:28.310> so<00:01:28.520> I<00:01:28.549> knew

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
been boring particularly well so I knew

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:29.980 
been boring particularly well so I knew
I<00:01:28.909> could<00:01:29.090> get<00:01:29.180> a<00:01:29.240> couple<00:01:29.390> of<00:01:29.570> those<00:01:29.690> order

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
I could get a couple of those order

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.590 
I could get a couple of those order
choke<00:01:30.380> as<00:01:30.560> well<00:01:30.710> so<00:01:30.950> yeah<00:01:31.700> it<00:01:31.789> took<00:01:31.820> a<00:01:32.030> hooker

choke as well so yeah it took a hooker
sort<00:01:32.780> of<00:01:32.869> last-minute<00:01:33.110> decision<00:01:33.679> to<00:01:33.860> go<00:01:34.220> in

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
sort of last-minute decision to go in

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.749

wicket we play which has a little bit of
pace<00:03:01.319> and<00:03:01.530> bounds<00:03:01.860> seems<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.730> suit<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:03.120> bowling

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
pace and bounds seems to suit a bowling

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.940 
pace and bounds seems to suit a bowling
attack<00:03:03.810> it<00:03:03.930> also<00:03:04.049> suits<00:03:04.319> our<00:03:04.440> batsman<00:03:04.860> you
