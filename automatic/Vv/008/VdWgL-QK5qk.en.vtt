transmission<00:00:29.460> mount<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.300> old<00:00:30.449> one

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
transmission mount this is the old one

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.340 
transmission mount this is the old one
if<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.740> notice<00:00:32.070> on<00:00:32.809> transmission<00:00:33.809> mount<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
if you notice on transmission mount the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.030 
if you notice on transmission mount the
material<00:00:35.340> should<00:00:35.730> be<00:00:35.790> firm<00:00:36.570> but<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.800> front

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
material should be firm but on the front

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.240 
material should be firm but on the front
of<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.219> mount<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:39.629> spongy<00:00:40.250> cracking

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
of this mount it's it's spongy cracking

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.619 
of this mount it's it's spongy cracking
and<00:00:41.460> that's<00:00:42.239> because<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:43.020> oil<00:00:43.590> buildup<00:00:44.160> has

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
and that's because the oil buildup has

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.690 
and that's because the oil buildup has
soaked<00:00:45.629> into<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.170> rubber<00:00:46.590> causing<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.579> to

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
soaked into the rubber causing it to

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.850 
soaked into the rubber causing it to
swell<00:00:47.850> crack<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.750> otherwise<00:00:49.230> be<00:00:49.559> unreliable
