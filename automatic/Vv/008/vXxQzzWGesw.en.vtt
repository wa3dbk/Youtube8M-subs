that lip and to suit then to smooth out

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.290 
that lip and to suit then to smooth out
the<00:04:56.100> stitch<00:04:56.340> marks<00:04:56.370> because<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:57.060> stitch

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
the stitch marks because the stitch

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.120 
the stitch marks because the stitch
marks<00:04:57.330> are<00:04:57.810> pretty<00:04:58.080> bumping<00:04:58.530> in<00:04:58.650> I<00:04:58.800> didn't

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
marks are pretty bumping in I didn't

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.909

like<00:04:59.280> how<00:04:59.460> it<00:04:59.490> looked<00:04:59.870> so<00:05:00.870> yeah<00:05:01.410> I<00:05:01.620> cut<00:05:01.889> a

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
like how it looked so yeah I cut a

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.710 
like how it looked so yeah I cut a
little<00:05:02.100> piece<00:05:02.220> of<00:05:02.580> leather<00:05:02.729> out<00:05:03.000> and<00:05:03.270> glued

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720

that<00:05:03.960> over<00:05:04.320> top<00:05:04.530> the<00:05:04.560> stitch<00:05:04.950> marks<00:05:04.979> I<00:05:05.340> think

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
that over top the stitch marks I think

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.300 
that over top the stitch marks I think
it<00:05:05.790> looks<00:05:06.030> like<00:05:06.690> the<00:05:06.870> lip<00:05:07.110> on<00:05:07.320> the<00:05:07.380> purple<00:05:07.979> ears

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
it looks like the lip on the purple ears

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.680 
it looks like the lip on the purple ears
which<00:05:08.639> is<00:05:08.790> awesome<00:05:09.650> once<00:05:10.650> again<00:05:10.830> it<00:05:11.340> clips<00:05:12.330> on

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
which is awesome once again it clips on

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.800 
which is awesome once again it clips on
I<00:05:13.139> I<00:05:13.470> always<00:05:13.770> paint<00:05:14.040> mine<00:05:14.190> the<00:05:14.340> color<00:05:14.780> and<00:05:15.780> the

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
I I always paint mine the color and the

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.200 
I I always paint mine the color and the
good<00:05:16.380> thing<00:05:16.560> is<00:05:16.590> when<00:05:16.889> you<00:05:16.950> clip<00:05:17.220> these<00:05:17.370> in<00:05:17.610> you

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
good thing is when you clip these in you

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.450 
good thing is when you clip these in you
can<00:05:18.360> always<00:05:18.570> pull<00:05:18.990> a<00:05:19.020> strand<00:05:19.440> of<00:05:19.560> hair<00:05:19.770> over
