00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
up here now you can boil them up to

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.880 
up here now you can boil them up to
different<00:00:47.250> levels<00:00:47.430> like<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.710> barely<00:00:49.710> any

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
different levels like that is barely any

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.500 
different levels like that is barely any
air<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.280> there<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.879> still<00:00:51.120> works<00:00:51.329> as<00:00:51.480> a

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
air in there and it still works as a

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.389 
air in there and it still works as a
punch<00:00:51.840> ball<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.649> know<00:00:52.770> what<00:00:52.980> we<00:00:53.190> had<00:00:53.370> a
