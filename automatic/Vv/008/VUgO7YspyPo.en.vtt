00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.849 

so<00:00:00.870> we<00:00:01.050> have<00:00:01.230> determined<00:00:01.410> by<00:00:02.190> both<00:00:02.750> observing

00:00:03.849 --> 00:00:03.859 
so we have determined by both observing

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:08.120 
so we have determined by both observing
and<00:00:05.270> by<00:00:06.270> measurements<00:00:06.779> that<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.620> neck<00:00:07.830> pitch

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
and by measurements that the neck pitch

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.830 
and by measurements that the neck pitch
angle<00:00:08.400> on<00:00:08.790> this<00:00:08.970> particular<00:00:09.300> instrument

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
angle on this particular instrument

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.730 
angle on this particular instrument
could<00:00:10.679> be<00:00:10.860> improved<00:00:11.540> so<00:00:12.540> what<00:00:13.380> are<00:00:13.469> we<00:00:13.559> going

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
could be improved so what are we going

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.099 
could be improved so what are we going
to<00:00:14.009> do<00:00:14.160> in<00:00:14.340> order<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.730> correct<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.299> we're

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
to do in order to correct that we're

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.370 
to do in order to correct that we're
going<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.470> have<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.800> remove<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.369> strings<00:00:17.699> and

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
going to have to remove the strings and

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.349 
going to have to remove the strings and
reset<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.859> neck<00:00:20.420> so<00:00:22.730> let's<00:00:23.730> loosen<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
reset the neck so let's loosen the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:33.799 
reset the neck so let's loosen the
strings<00:00:30.199> and<00:00:31.610> take<00:00:32.610> them<00:00:32.850> off<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.660> we

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
strings and take them off so that we

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:41.780 
strings and take them off so that we
have<00:00:34.170> access<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.219> neck<00:00:38.750> and<00:00:40.460> as<00:00:41.460> soon<00:00:41.640> as

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
have access to that neck and as soon as

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.680 
have access to that neck and as soon as
I<00:00:41.910> get<00:00:41.969> all<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.390> strings<00:00:42.719> finished<00:00:44.450> we'll<00:00:45.450> be

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
I get all the strings finished we'll be

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.770 
I get all the strings finished we'll be
right<00:00:46.200> back<00:00:46.500> with<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.640> next<00:00:47.969> part<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.600> the

right back with the next part of the
process<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.590> taking<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.789> neck<00:00:51.000> off<00:00:51.320> resetting

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
process of taking the neck off resetting

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
process of taking the neck off resetting
the<00:00:52.469> angle<00:00:53.449> with<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.600> use<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.110> shim<00:00:55.969> and

intonation and proper setup okay now we

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.289 
intonation and proper setup okay now we
have<00:01:10.500> our<00:01:10.740> strings<00:01:11.310> removed<00:01:11.790> from<00:01:12.090> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
have our strings removed from the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.130 
have our strings removed from the
fretboard<00:01:12.600> or<00:01:13.409> from<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.270> headstock<00:01:15.270> I'm<00:01:15.930> just

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
fretboard or from the headstock I'm just

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.440 
fretboard or from the headstock I'm just
gonna<00:01:16.380> roll<00:01:17.100> them<00:01:17.369> out<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.970> way<00:01:18.119> for<00:01:18.180> the

gonna roll them out of the way for the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.620 
gonna roll them out of the way for the
time<00:01:18.659> being<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.729> now<00:01:20.729> we<00:01:20.790> can<00:01:21.119> flip<00:01:21.420> our

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
time being and now we can flip our

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.520 
time being and now we can flip our
instruments<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:23.509> we're<00:01:24.509> going<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.720> remove

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.240

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
using our handy dandy screwdriver our

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.219 
using our handy dandy screwdriver our
neck<00:01:35.250> bolts<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:36.240> hold<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.720> neck<00:01:37.020> in

neck bolts that hold the neck in
position<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.820> instrument<00:01:42.920> we<00:01:43.920> don't<00:01:44.100> want

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
position on the instrument we don't want

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.660 
position on the instrument we don't want
to<00:01:44.369> take<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.939> off<00:01:45.240> when<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.049> string

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
to take this off when the string

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.960 
to take this off when the string
pressure<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:48.090> on<00:01:49.189> because<00:01:50.189> if<00:01:50.369> we<00:01:50.520> do<00:01:50.700> that

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
pressure is on because if we do that

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.810 
pressure is on because if we do that
nickel<00:01:51.329> just<00:01:51.540> rip<00:01:51.869> out<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.350> there<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.820> caused

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
nickel just rip out of there and caused

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.270 
nickel just rip out of there and caused
all<00:01:54.090> kinds<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.630> problems<00:01:54.799> now<00:01:55.799> we<00:01:55.860> know<00:01:56.250> that

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
all kinds of problems now we know that

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.950 
all kinds of problems now we know that
the<00:01:56.670> angle<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.590> sitting<00:01:59.420> tilted<00:02:00.420> too<00:02:00.750> much

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
the angle is sitting tilted too much

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.760 
the angle is sitting tilted too much
this<00:02:01.259> way

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
this way

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.580 
this way
so<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.280> order<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.579> correct<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.420> issue<00:02:03.590> we're

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
so in order to correct the issue we're

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.850 
so in order to correct the issue we're
going<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.860> want<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.250> shim<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:06.409> so<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.619> there's

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
going to want to shim it so that there's

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.330 
going to want to shim it so that there's
something<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.789> this<00:02:09.149> position<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:10.649> can<00:02:10.979> tilt

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
something in this position that can tilt

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.050 
something in this position that can tilt
that<00:02:11.610> neck

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
that neck

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.860 
that neck
back<00:02:12.290> just<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.620> little<00:02:14.400> tiny<00:02:15.150> bit<00:02:17.270> we<00:02:18.270> knew<00:02:18.599> from

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
back just a little tiny bit we knew from

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.449 
back just a little tiny bit we knew from
our<00:02:19.080> measurements<00:02:19.739> that<00:02:20.130> we<00:02:20.310> were

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
our measurements that we were

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.720 
our measurements that we were
approximately<00:02:21.300> four<00:02:21.930> hundredths<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:23.160> an<00:02:23.489> inch

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
approximately four hundredths of an inch

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.790 
approximately four hundredths of an inch
off<00:02:26.209> so<00:02:27.209> I'm<00:02:27.630> gonna<00:02:27.870> want<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.260> put<00:02:28.500> something

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
off so I'm gonna want to put something

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.120 
off so I'm gonna want to put something
in<00:02:29.250> there<00:02:29.519> that's<00:02:29.849> approximately<00:02:30.890> two<00:02:31.890> to

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
in there that's approximately two to

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.949 
in there that's approximately two to
three<00:02:32.180> hundredths<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.300> an<00:02:33.450> inch<00:02:34.760> thickness

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
three hundredths of an inch thickness

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:42.949 
three hundredths of an inch thickness
that<00:02:36.959> we<00:02:37.200> do<00:02:37.410> not<00:02:37.620> have<00:02:38.069> right<00:02:38.790> now<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:42.780> other

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
that we do not have right now the other

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.870 
that we do not have right now the other
option<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.800> we<00:02:44.010> could<00:02:44.280> shave<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:47.310> back<00:02:47.580> of

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
option is we could shave the the back of

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.680 
option is we could shave the the back of
the<00:02:48.239> neck<00:02:49.190> but<00:02:50.190> that's<00:02:50.400> more<00:02:50.640> radical<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:51.420> I'd

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
the neck but that's more radical and I'd

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.570 
the neck but that's more radical and I'd
rather<00:02:51.900> just<00:02:52.290> use<00:02:52.530> shims<00:02:52.860> because<00:02:53.310> we<00:02:53.430> can

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
rather just use shims because we can

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.979 
rather just use shims because we can
always<00:02:53.790> make<00:02:54.030> adjustments<00:02:54.630> with<00:02:54.750> shims

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
always make adjustments with shims

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.180 
always make adjustments with shims
without<00:02:57.989> modifying<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:59.040> original

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
without modifying the original

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.060 
without modifying the original
instrument
