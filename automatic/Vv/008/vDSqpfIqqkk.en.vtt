going<00:01:04.839> to<00:01:04.989> be<00:01:05.049> using<00:01:05.170> an<00:01:05.350> HMI<00:01:05.799> so<00:01:06.550> we're<00:01:06.670> going

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
going to be using an HMI so we're going

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.120 
going to be using an HMI so we're going
to<00:01:06.850> be<00:01:06.909> using<00:01:07.110> separate<00:01:08.110> instruments<00:01:08.710> to<00:01:08.890> like

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
to be using separate instruments to like

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.310 
to be using separate instruments to like
create<00:01:09.850> pools<00:01:10.240> of<00:01:10.420> light<00:01:10.570> if<00:01:10.690> you<00:01:10.810> will<00:01:10.990> okay

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320
