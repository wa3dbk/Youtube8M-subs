00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
history of computers it wasn't that long

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.609 
history of computers it wasn't that long
ago<00:01:19.000> that<00:01:19.509> they<00:01:19.630> were<00:01:19.660> in<00:01:19.869> sealed<00:01:20.229> airtight

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
ago that they were in sealed airtight

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.109 
ago that they were in sealed airtight
rooms<00:01:21.280> being<00:01:21.610> kept<00:01:21.790> cooled<00:01:22.000> by<00:01:22.090> air

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
most certainly that they weren't

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.960 
most certainly that they weren't
portable<00:01:26.440> well<00:01:26.890> as<00:01:27.040> computers<00:01:27.550> came<00:01:27.759> out<00:01:27.880> of

made from Stealth computer corporation

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.630 
made from Stealth computer corporation
and<00:01:46.240> they're<00:01:47.080> not<00:01:47.380> only<00:01:47.770> sealed<00:01:48.159> for<00:01:48.460> water

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
and they're not only sealed for water

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.100 
and they're not only sealed for water
resistance<00:01:48.790> and<00:01:49.330> dust<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:49.750> everything

resistance and dust and everything

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.950 
resistance and dust and everything
they're<00:01:50.260> also<00:01:50.790> impact<00:01:51.790> resistant<00:01:52.420> this<00:01:52.750> is

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
they're also impact resistant this is

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.590 
they're also impact resistant this is

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
their stealth warrior 2 notebook and you

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.460 
their stealth warrior 2 notebook and you
can<00:01:55.750> get<00:01:55.870> all<00:01:55.990> sorts<00:01:56.020> of<00:01:56.320> different

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
can get all sorts of different

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.290 
can get all sorts of different
configurations<00:01:56.740> but<00:01:57.490> if<00:01:57.610> you<00:01:57.729> have<00:01:57.850> a<00:01:57.880> basic

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
configurations but if you have a basic

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.700 
configurations but if you have a basic
look<00:01:58.450> at<00:01:58.630> it<00:01:58.750> everything<00:01:59.170> is<00:01:59.290> completely

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
look at it everything is completely

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.740 
look at it everything is completely
sealed<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.430> it's<00:02:00.760> got<00:02:00.909> rubber<00:02:01.180> all<00:02:01.420> around

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
sealed and it's got rubber all around

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.450 
sealed and it's got rubber all around
the<00:02:01.840> outside<00:02:02.200> pieces<00:02:02.500> and<00:02:02.799> also<00:02:02.920> a<00:02:03.100> rubber

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
the outside pieces and also a rubber

the outside pieces and also a rubber
sealed<00:02:03.820> screen<00:02:04.270> so<00:02:04.600> if<00:02:04.930> you<00:02:05.140> are<00:02:05.290> to<00:02:05.500> drop<00:02:05.799> this

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
sealed screen so if you are to drop this

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.969 
sealed screen so if you are to drop this
on<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.490> a<00:02:06.520> cement<00:02:07.420> surface<00:02:07.659> for<00:02:08.110> example<00:02:08.170> it's

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
on to a cement surface for example it's

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.410 
on to a cement surface for example it's
not<00:02:09.190> going<00:02:09.399> to<00:02:09.459> crack<00:02:09.760> or<00:02:10.060> it's<00:02:10.179> not<00:02:10.269> gonna

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420
