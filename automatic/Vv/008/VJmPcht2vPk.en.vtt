00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
and I'm using NSI liquid with my own mix

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.759 
and I'm using NSI liquid with my own mix
for<00:00:08.220> moon<00:00:08.370> nail<00:00:08.580> bed<00:00:08.820> I'm<00:00:09.540> just<00:00:09.900> going<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.230> put

with<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.490> design<00:00:29.730> I'm<00:00:30.150> using<00:00:30.570> Sara's

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
with this design I'm using Sara's

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.870 
with this design I'm using Sara's
glitters<00:00:31.590> again<00:00:31.860> because<00:00:32.490> they<00:00:32.610> are<00:00:32.640> so

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
glitters again because they are so

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
gorgeous and this one is holographic

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.720 
gorgeous and this one is holographic
rich<00:00:36.450> gold<00:00:36.780> which<00:00:37.710> when<00:00:38.100> mixed<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.550> there

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
rich gold which when mixed in there

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.840 
rich gold which when mixed in there
looks<00:00:38.910> like<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.350> this<00:00:40.350> one<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.800> just<00:00:41.220> chunky

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
looks like that this one is just chunky

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
to go right to the bottom of the nail

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.210 
to go right to the bottom of the nail
and<00:01:03.480> just<00:01:03.930> blending<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.440> silver<00:01:04.860> too<00:01:05.040> chunky

when<00:01:12.720> that's<00:01:12.869> dried<00:01:13.229> I'm<00:01:13.440> just<00:01:13.619> going<00:01:13.800> to

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
when that's dried I'm just going to

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:27.280 
when that's dried I'm just going to
encapsulate<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.880> with<00:01:15.240> some<00:01:15.660> organic<00:01:16.350> clay

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.610 

that<00:01:28.130> dry<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:28.700> then<00:01:28.880> I'm<00:01:29.030> going<00:01:29.150> to<00:01:29.270> file<00:01:29.480> it

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
that dry and then I'm going to file it

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.470 
that dry and then I'm going to file it
so<00:01:30.620> after<00:01:30.710> a<00:01:30.890> file<00:01:31.130> them<00:01:31.370> buff<00:01:31.400> me<00:01:31.910> nail<00:01:32.120> what

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.760 
so after a file them buff me nail what
I'm<00:01:32.600> using<00:01:32.810> for<00:01:33.260> the<00:01:33.800> 3d<00:01:34.280> as<00:01:34.810> radiant<00:01:35.810> light<00:01:35.990> by

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
I'm using for the 3d as radiant light by

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.580 
I'm using for the 3d as radiant light by
NSI<00:01:37.190> and<00:01:37.850> I'll<00:01:38.030> just<00:01:38.180> pour<00:01:38.330> a<00:01:38.390> bit<00:01:38.570> of<00:01:38.750> glitter

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
NSI and I'll just pour a bit of glitter

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.640 
NSI and I'll just pour a bit of glitter
in<00:01:39.800> there<00:01:39.980> just<00:01:40.130> to<00:01:40.310> make<00:01:40.430> it<00:01:40.460> a<00:01:40.610> bit<00:01:40.730> sparkly

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
in there just to make it a bit sparkly

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.240 
in there just to make it a bit sparkly
there's<00:01:42.650> the<00:01:42.770> fun<00:01:42.980> part<00:01:43.250> I<00:01:44.950> originally<00:01:45.950> did<00:01:46.130> me

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
there's the fun part I originally did me

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.400 
there's the fun part I originally did me
flowers<00:01:46.430> black<00:01:46.850> but<00:01:47.360> they<00:01:47.690> just<00:01:48.020> looked<00:01:48.260> like

that's<00:01:56.150> file<00:01:56.450> it<00:01:56.570> all<00:01:56.750> off<00:01:56.930> so<00:01:57.560> I<00:01:57.590> decided<00:01:57.740> to

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
that's file it all off so I decided to

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.780 
that's file it all off so I decided to
go<00:01:58.340> bit<00:01:58.520> overboard<00:01:59.000> with<00:01:59.120> the<00:01:59.300> 3d<00:02:00.460> it<00:02:01.460> wasn't

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
go bit overboard with the 3d it wasn't

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.570 
go bit overboard with the 3d it wasn't
my<00:02:01.850> first<00:02:02.000> choice<00:02:02.210> of<00:02:02.509> design<00:02:02.810> but<00:02:03.130> here<00:02:04.130> we<00:02:04.220> go

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
my first choice of design but here we go

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.810 
my first choice of design but here we go
Saamy<00:02:05.540> thumbnail<00:02:05.930> I<00:02:06.170> am<00:02:06.440> going<00:02:06.710> to<00:02:06.890> do<00:02:07.160> a<00:02:07.460> bow

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
Saamy thumbnail I am going to do a bow

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.670 
Saamy thumbnail I am going to do a bow
but<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:08.810> saw<00:02:09.050> -<00:02:09.110> not<00:02:09.920> your<00:02:10.040> average<00:02:10.220> bow<00:02:11.680> it's

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
but you saw - not your average bow it's

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.750 
but you saw - not your average bow it's
gonna<00:02:12.890> have<00:02:13.070> three<00:02:13.340> layers<00:02:13.520> in<00:02:13.850> it<00:02:14.830> so<00:02:15.830> as

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
gonna have three layers in it so as

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.229 
gonna have three layers in it so as
you'll<00:02:17.060> see<00:02:17.330> how<00:02:18.110> we'll<00:02:18.290> go<00:02:18.440> with<00:02:18.590> this<00:02:18.739> one<00:02:19.239> so

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
you'll see how we'll go with this one so

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.560 
you'll see how we'll go with this one so
just<00:02:20.270> push<00:02:20.780> them<00:02:20.959> out<00:02:21.110> at<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.320> side<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:23.360> then

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
just push them out at the side and then

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.090 
just push them out at the side and then
pressed<00:02:24.050> it<00:02:24.230> in<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:25.670> middle<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.830> then<00:02:27.950> when

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
pressed it in the middle and then when

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.890 
pressed it in the middle and then when
it's<00:02:28.250> drying<00:02:28.640> a<00:02:28.820> bit<00:02:29.000> just<00:02:29.209> push<00:02:29.450> it<00:02:29.600> out<00:02:29.720> a<00:02:29.780> bit

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
it's drying a bit just push it out a bit

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.550 
it's drying a bit just push it out a bit
more

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.680 

the<00:02:37.560> tricky<00:02:37.830> bit<00:02:38.069> is<00:02:38.250> trying<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.760> match<00:02:38.970> up<00:02:39.000> the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
the tricky bit is trying to match up the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.790 
the tricky bit is trying to match up the
other<00:02:39.900> side

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:52.199 

you

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.580 

that<00:02:53.209> lady's<00:02:53.510> done<00:02:53.750> we<00:02:54.379> get<00:02:54.640> another<00:02:55.640> ball<00:02:56.590> not

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
that lady's done we get another ball not

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.339
