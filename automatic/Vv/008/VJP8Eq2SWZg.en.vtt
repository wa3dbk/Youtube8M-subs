transfer<00:00:42.719> certain<00:00:43.200> information<00:00:43.649> which<00:00:44.160> could

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
transfer certain information which could

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.799 
transfer certain information which could
be<00:00:44.430> an<00:00:44.610> item<00:00:44.940> somewhere<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.420> map<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.780> a

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
be an item somewhere on the map to a

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.930 
be an item somewhere on the map to a
various<00:00:46.320> part<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.770> map<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.730> does

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
various part of a map and it does

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.459 
various part of a map and it does
basically<00:00:48.120> involves<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.780> moving<00:00:49.260> around

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
basically involves you moving around

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.590 
basically involves you moving around
more<00:00:49.680> often<00:00:49.860> because<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.670> feel<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.000> survival

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
more often because I feel that survival

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.240 
more often because I feel that survival
mode<00:00:51.780> could<00:00:52.079> turn<00:00:52.289> out<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.500> be<00:00:52.559> pretty<00:00:52.739> campy

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
mode could turn out to be pretty campy

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.920 
mode could turn out to be pretty campy
so<00:00:53.820> what<00:00:53.969> sort<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.210> enemies<00:00:54.600> are<00:00:54.750> we<00:00:54.809> gonna

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
so what sort of enemies are we gonna

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.840 
so what sort of enemies are we gonna
find<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.350> survival<00:00:55.829> mode<00:00:55.860> here<00:00:56.219> we<00:00:56.670> know<00:00:56.820> that

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
find in survival mode here we know that

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.670 
find in survival mode here we know that
in<00:00:57.149> zombies<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.809> they<00:00:57.930> have<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> limited

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
in zombies that they have a limited

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.610 
in zombies that they have a limited
amount<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.890> range<00:00:59.190> they<00:00:59.460> don't<00:00:59.640> walk<00:00:59.940> too<00:01:00.180> fast

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
amount of range they don't walk too fast

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.450 
amount of range they don't walk too fast
basically<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.710> best<00:01:01.829> players<00:01:02.160> will<00:01:02.309> get<00:01:02.430> a

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
basically the best players will get a

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.399 
basically the best players will get a
group<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.850> zombies<00:01:02.910> take<00:01:03.809> them<00:01:03.960> into<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.170> small

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
group of zombies take them into a small

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.010 
group of zombies take them into a small
area<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.769> map<00:01:05.040> do<00:01:05.549> laps<00:01:05.790> around<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.600> then<00:01:06.990> just

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
area of map do laps around and then just

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.719 
area of map do laps around and then just
easily<00:01:07.470> pick<00:01:07.710> them<00:01:07.860> off<00:01:08.010> one<00:01:08.189> by<00:01:08.220> one<00:01:08.400> it's

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
easily pick them off one by one it's

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.580 
easily pick them off one by one it's
fairly<00:01:09.030> slow-paced<00:01:09.600> want<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.020> get<00:01:10.140> into<00:01:10.470> it

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
fairly slow-paced want to get into it

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.429 
fairly slow-paced want to get into it
it's<00:01:11.310> not<00:01:11.580> too<00:01:11.820> much<00:01:12.000> hysteria<00:01:12.510> about<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.260> and

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
it's not too much hysteria about it and

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.840 
it's not too much hysteria about it and
it's<00:01:13.890> nice<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.130> controlled

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
it's nice and controlled

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.700 
it's nice and controlled
however<00:01:15.330> survival<00:01:15.900> mode<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.170> reckon<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.560> going

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
however survival mode I reckon is going

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.800 
however survival mode I reckon is going
to<00:01:16.770> be<00:01:16.860> very<00:01:17.100> very<00:01:17.400> different<00:01:17.729> rather<00:01:18.540> than

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
to be very very different rather than

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.719 
to be very very different rather than
moving<00:01:19.049> around<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.560> map<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.950> know<00:01:20.100> feeling

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
moving around the map you know feeling

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.219 
moving around the map you know feeling
quite<00:01:20.970> loose<00:01:21.240> quite<00:01:21.540> relaxed<00:01:21.990> you're<00:01:22.110> gonna

quite loose quite relaxed you're gonna

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.960

so<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.780> gonna<00:01:36.930> be<00:01:37.110> crazy<00:01:37.409> it's<00:01:37.799> gonna

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
so this is gonna be crazy it's gonna

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
otherwise people will do that in a

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.030 
otherwise people will do that in a

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
experience so what sort of things do we

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.359 
experience so what sort of things do we
have<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.719> attack<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.290> enemies<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:58.770> survival

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
have to attack the enemies in survival

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.910 
have to attack the enemies in survival
mode<00:01:59.399> well<00:01:59.969> in<00:02:00.090> zombies<00:02:00.479> we<00:02:00.630> had<00:02:00.780> traps<00:02:01.200> etc

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
mode well in zombies we had traps etc

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.800 
mode well in zombies we had traps etc
things<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.610> would<00:02:02.790> use<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.270> slow<00:02:03.630> down

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
things that would use to slow down

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.749 
things that would use to slow down
enemies<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.259> certain<00:02:04.619> areas<00:02:04.950> however<00:02:05.520> in

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
enemies in certain areas however in

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.520 
enemies in certain areas however in
survival<00:02:06.390> mode<00:02:06.420> they've<00:02:06.780> really<00:02:07.110> stepped<00:02:07.380> it

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
survival mode they've really stepped it

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.529 
survival mode they've really stepped it
up<00:02:07.619> they're<00:02:07.890> gonna<00:02:08.069> have<00:02:08.459> kill<00:02:09.030> streaks

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
up they're gonna have kill streaks

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.119 
up they're gonna have kill streaks
so<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.959> kill<00:02:10.140> streaks<00:02:10.379> found<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:10.830> multiplayer

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
so the kill streaks found in multiplayer

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.550 
so the kill streaks found in multiplayer
mode<00:02:11.280> will<00:02:11.879> also<00:02:12.000> be<00:02:12.300> found<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.750> survival<00:02:13.530> mode

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
mode will also be found in survival mode

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.150 
mode will also be found in survival mode

buy<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.210> map<00:02:54.540> pack<00:02:54.780> so<00:02:55.350> you're<00:02:55.470> gonna<00:02:55.590> get<00:02:55.830> three

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
buy a map pack so you're gonna get three

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.740 
buy a map pack so you're gonna get three
or<00:02:56.220> four<00:02:56.250> maps<00:02:56.730> these<00:02:57.150> are<00:02:57.360> also<00:02:57.600> can<00:02:57.690> be

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
or four maps these are also can be

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.360 
or four maps these are also can be
transferred<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.230> spec<00:02:58.590> ops<00:02:58.800> as<00:02:58.980> well<00:02:59.160> so

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
transferred to spec ops as well so

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.250 
transferred to spec ops as well so
you're<00:02:59.490> getting<00:02:59.760> three<00:03:00.030> or<00:03:00.060> four<00:03:00.450> spec<00:03:01.110> up

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
you're getting three or four spec up

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.500 
you're getting three or four spec up
survival<00:03:01.830> mode<00:03:01.980> map<00:03:02.280> alongside<00:03:02.640> multiplayer

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
survival mode map alongside multiplayer

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.540 
survival mode map alongside multiplayer
map<00:03:03.660> so<00:03:04.110> it's<00:03:04.260> very<00:03:04.350> different<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.890> zombies<00:03:05.370> in

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
map so it's very different to zombies in

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.220 
map so it's very different to zombies in
terms<00:03:05.820> of<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.120> maps<00:03:06.330> you<00:03:06.480> can<00:03:06.660> play<00:03:06.900> there's<00:03:07.170> a

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
terms of the maps you can play there's a

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.110 
terms of the maps you can play there's a
lot<00:03:07.380> more<00:03:07.500> variety<00:03:08.130> in<00:03:08.160> there<00:03:08.520> and<00:03:08.820> I<00:03:08.910> think

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
lot more variety in there and I think

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.640 
lot more variety in there and I think
the<00:03:09.210> way<00:03:09.330> they're<00:03:09.510> doing<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.900> maps<00:03:10.110> is<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.320> very

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
the way they're doing the maps is a very

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.620 
the way they're doing the maps is a very
very<00:03:10.920> good<00:03:11.130> idea<00:03:11.310> they're<00:03:12.030> gonna<00:03:12.180> be<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.450> lot

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
very good idea they're gonna be a lot

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.570 
very good idea they're gonna be a lot
more<00:03:12.690> open<00:03:13.410> they're<00:03:13.800> gonna<00:03:13.920> be<00:03:14.100> a<00:03:14.130> lot<00:03:14.340> larger

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
more open they're gonna be a lot larger

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.370 
more open they're gonna be a lot larger
and<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.180> think<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.600> idea<00:03:15.750> of<00:03:16.110> integrating

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
and I think the idea of integrating

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.260 
and I think the idea of integrating
multiplayer<00:03:17.100> maps<00:03:17.370> into<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.760> survival<00:03:18.240> mode

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
multiplayer maps into the survival mode

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.270 
multiplayer maps into the survival mode
is<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:18.690> very<00:03:19.050> smart<00:03:19.320> move<00:03:19.560> it's<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.010> final

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
is a very smart move it's the final

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.590 
is a very smart move it's the final
piece<00:03:20.400> of<00:03:20.550> information<00:03:21.000> here<00:03:21.180> that<00:03:21.330> have<00:03:21.450> you

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
piece of information here that have you

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.000 
piece of information here that have you
guys<00:03:21.780> that's<00:03:21.990> probably<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.410> most<00:03:22.530> important

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
guys that's probably the most important

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.590 
guys that's probably the most important
bit<00:03:23.130> of<00:03:23.160> information<00:03:23.280> is<00:03:23.790> how<00:03:24.000> many<00:03:24.270> players

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
bit of information is how many players

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.510 
bit of information is how many players
can<00:03:24.930> play<00:03:25.080> spec<00:03:25.470> up<00:03:25.620> survival<00:03:26.070> mode<00:03:26.220> together

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
can play spec up survival mode together

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.070 
can play spec up survival mode together
but<00:03:26.970> they've<00:03:27.060> actually<00:03:27.209> capped<00:03:27.570> it<00:03:27.720> at<00:03:27.810> two

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
but they've actually capped it at two

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.140 
but they've actually capped it at two
people<00:03:28.410> now<00:03:28.980> we're<00:03:29.100> used<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.370> in<00:03:29.670> zombies

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
people now we're used to in zombies

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.880 
people now we're used to in zombies
anyway<00:03:30.420> seeing<00:03:30.690> one<00:03:31.050> two<00:03:31.350> three<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:31.800> even

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
anyway seeing one two three and even

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.190 
anyway seeing one two three and even
four<00:03:32.040> players<00:03:32.610> all<00:03:33.120> playing<00:03:33.450> together<00:03:33.630> but<00:03:34.170> I

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
four players all playing together but I

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.020 
four players all playing together but I
think<00:03:34.260> limiting<00:03:34.770> this<00:03:34.890> game<00:03:35.100> are<00:03:35.250> 22<00:03:35.610> people

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
think limiting this game are 22 people

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.630 
think limiting this game are 22 people
is<00:03:36.180> going<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.600> be<00:03:36.720> its<00:03:36.840> downfall<00:03:37.470> and<00:03:37.800> making

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
is going to be its downfall and making

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.580 
is going to be its downfall and making
it<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:38.970> know<00:03:39.120> integrating<00:03:39.600> it<00:03:39.990> into<00:03:40.290> a<00:03:40.320> sort

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
it you know integrating it into a sort

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.350 
it you know integrating it into a sort

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
bit more it's not going to be exactly

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.470 
bit more it's not going to be exactly
the<00:03:58.980> same<00:03:59.010> it's<00:03:59.459> not<00:03:59.670> going<00:03:59.850> to<00:03:59.940> be<00:04:00.060> zombies

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
the same it's not going to be zombies

3<00:04:02.310> it's<00:04:02.910> gonna<00:04:03.090> be<00:04:03.239> very<00:04:03.360> different<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.080> you

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
3 it's gonna be very different and you

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.410 
3 it's gonna be very different and you
should<00:04:05.040> expect<00:04:05.430> something<00:04:05.820> different<00:04:06.209> but<00:04:06.330> I

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
should expect something different but I

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.970 
should expect something different but I
think<00:04:06.630> it's<00:04:06.780> going<00:04:06.989> to<00:04:07.050> be<00:04:07.110> just<00:04:07.350> as<00:04:07.560> good<00:04:07.620> if

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
think it's going to be just as good if

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.710 
think it's going to be just as good if
it's<00:04:08.400> going<00:04:08.489> to<00:04:08.550> be<00:04:08.670> better<00:04:08.850> that's<00:04:09.150> up<00:04:09.360> to<00:04:09.540> you
