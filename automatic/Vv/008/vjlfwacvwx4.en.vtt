00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.740 

first<00:00:04.060> thing<00:00:04.180> we're<00:00:04.270> going<00:00:04.360> to<00:00:04.450> do<00:00:04.510> is<00:00:04.630> turn

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:04.750 
first thing we're going to do is turn

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.630 
first thing we're going to do is turn
the<00:00:04.870> bike<00:00:04.990> on<00:00:05.170> let<00:00:05.380> the<00:00:05.500> engine<00:00:06.069> oil<00:00:06.130> heat<00:00:06.609> up

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:06.640 
the bike on let the engine oil heat up

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.820 
the bike on let the engine oil heat up
so<00:00:07.240> it's<00:00:07.479> more<00:00:07.960> viscous<00:00:08.349> so<00:00:08.500> it<00:00:08.620> drains<00:00:08.860> easier

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
so it's more viscous so it drains easier

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.410 
so it's more viscous so it drains easier
trouble<00:00:11.830> let<00:00:11.950> the<00:00:12.040> bike<00:00:12.220> idle<00:00:13.060> for<00:00:13.240> maybe

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:13.420 
trouble let the bike idle for maybe

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.450 
trouble let the bike idle for maybe
three<00:00:14.050> minutes<00:00:14.320> or<00:00:14.440> so<00:00:14.590> just<00:00:14.620> make<00:00:15.220> sure<00:00:15.250> the

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.460 
three minutes or so just make sure the

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.800 
three minutes or so just make sure the
engine<00:00:15.700> oils<00:00:15.970> warmed<00:00:16.209> up<00:00:16.330> enough<00:00:16.449> in<00:00:16.750> the

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
engine oils warmed up enough in the

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.750 
engine oils warmed up enough in the
meantime<00:00:17.019> I'll<00:00:17.920> show<00:00:18.099> you<00:00:18.189> what<00:00:18.310> I<00:00:18.340> have<00:00:18.519> for

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.760 
meantime I'll show you what I have for

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.060 
meantime I'll show you what I have for
tools<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.990> now<00:00:20.110> that<00:00:20.170> the<00:00:20.350> oil<00:00:20.380> and<00:00:20.830> the<00:00:20.890> bike

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
tools so now that the oil and the bike

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.410 
tools so now that the oil and the bike
is<00:00:21.100> warmed<00:00:21.430> up<00:00:21.550> just<00:00:21.580> want<00:00:22.000> to<00:00:22.090> show<00:00:22.180> you<00:00:22.270> the

tools we're going to be using today just

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.420 
tools we're going to be using today just

a ten millimeter and twelve millimeter
socket<00:00:27.430> I<00:00:27.820> have<00:00:28.600> some<00:00:28.810> paper<00:00:28.960> towels<00:00:29.230> to<00:00:29.410> use

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
socket I have some paper towels to use

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.500 
socket I have some paper towels to use
as<00:00:29.800> well<00:00:29.949> as<00:00:29.980> I'm<00:00:30.400> using<00:00:30.580> Mobil<00:00:30.910> one<00:00:31.029> synthetic

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.510 
as well as I'm using Mobil one synthetic

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.689 
as well as I'm using Mobil one synthetic
it's<00:00:31.660> it<00:00:32.649> is<00:00:32.770> probably<00:00:33.309> one<00:00:33.460> of<00:00:33.520> the<00:00:33.609> more

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:33.699 
it's it is probably one of the more

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:35.130 
it's it is probably one of the more
expensive<00:00:33.910> oils<00:00:34.449> out<00:00:34.539> there<00:00:34.719> on<00:00:34.780> the<00:00:34.840> market

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
expensive oils out there on the market

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.630 
expensive oils out there on the market
but<00:00:35.229> it's<00:00:35.379> worth<00:00:35.530> it<00:00:35.710> the<00:00:35.920> engine<00:00:36.489> is<00:00:36.550> the

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
but it's worth it the engine is the

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.369 
but it's worth it the engine is the
lifeblood<00:00:36.819> of<00:00:36.999> your<00:00:37.239> machine<00:00:37.539> and<00:00:37.569> you<00:00:38.260> know<00:00:38.350> I

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
lifeblood of your machine and you know I

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:39.899 
lifeblood of your machine and you know I
keep<00:00:38.620> it<00:00:38.710> running<00:00:38.859> you<00:00:39.249> know<00:00:39.370> you<00:00:39.429> can<00:00:39.729> trust

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:39.909 
keep it running you know you can trust

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:42.959 
keep it running you know you can trust
it<00:00:40.120> also<00:00:40.239> have<00:00:40.960> an<00:00:41.050> oil<00:00:41.260> pan<00:00:41.469> here<00:00:41.769> and<00:00:41.940> then<00:00:42.940> a

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:42.969 
it also have an oil pan here and then a

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:44.549 
it also have an oil pan here and then a
container<00:00:43.359> to<00:00:43.539> put<00:00:43.569> the<00:00:44.019> oil<00:00:44.139> in<00:00:44.319> when<00:00:44.469> I'm

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
container to put the oil in when I'm

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.520 
container to put the oil in when I'm
done<00:00:44.710> on<00:00:45.039> Honda's<00:00:45.579> the<00:00:45.789> oil<00:00:46.210> goes<00:00:47.139> into<00:00:47.379> the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
done on Honda's the oil goes into the

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.529 
done on Honda's the oil goes into the
frame<00:00:47.859> actually<00:00:48.159> so<00:00:48.639> we're<00:00:49.030> gonna<00:00:49.120> take<00:00:49.359> this

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
frame actually so we're gonna take this

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.360 
frame actually so we're gonna take this
off<00:00:49.859> to<00:00:50.859> let<00:00:51.010> it<00:00:51.100> breathe

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
off to let it breathe

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.869 
off to let it breathe
it's<00:00:52.299> a<00:00:52.420> dipstick<00:00:52.920> put<00:00:53.920> it<00:00:54.039> somewhere<00:00:54.249> out<00:00:54.819> of

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
it's a dipstick put it somewhere out of

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.160 
it's a dipstick put it somewhere out of
the<00:00:54.999> way<00:00:55.059> that<00:00:55.479> we're<00:00:55.629> it<00:00:55.719> will<00:00:55.809> stay<00:00:55.989> clean

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
the way that we're it will stay clean

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.449 
the way that we're it will stay clean
first<00:00:59.170> we'll<00:00:59.409> remove<00:01:00.749> this<00:01:01.749> bolt<00:01:02.049> here<00:01:02.459> which

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:03.459 
first we'll remove this bolt here which

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:06.180 
first we'll remove this bolt here which
is<00:01:03.609> on<00:01:03.729> the<00:01:03.819> down<00:01:03.999> tube<00:01:04.590> we'll<00:01:05.590> let<00:01:05.740> that<00:01:05.860> drain

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
is on the down tube we'll let that drain

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.570 
is on the down tube we'll let that drain
and<00:01:06.460> then<00:01:07.240> we'll<00:01:07.390> go<00:01:07.510> back<00:01:07.540> here<00:01:07.720> and<00:01:08.580> remove

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
and then we'll go back here and remove

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.850 
and then we'll go back here and remove
this<00:01:09.730> left<00:01:10.240> crankcase<00:01:10.720> bolt<00:01:11.500> there'll<00:01:11.830> be

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
this left crankcase bolt there'll be

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.200 
this left crankcase bolt there'll be
some<00:01:12.100> oil<00:01:12.250> that<00:01:12.400> comes<00:01:12.550> out<00:01:12.760> it<00:01:12.910> right<00:01:13.030> here<00:01:15.210> so

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
some oil that comes out it right here so

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.150 
some oil that comes out it right here so
the<00:01:16.330> last<00:01:16.480> oil<00:01:16.690> at<00:01:17.440> least<00:01:17.620> from<00:01:17.710> this<00:01:17.890> plug<00:01:18.130> is

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
the last oil at least from this plug is

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.240 
the last oil at least from this plug is
draining<00:01:18.550> I<00:01:18.760> put<00:01:18.970> my<00:01:19.150> oil<00:01:19.600> pan<00:01:19.750> on<00:01:19.900> a<00:01:19.930> block

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
draining I put my oil pan on a block

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.290 
draining I put my oil pan on a block
just<00:01:21.250> because<00:01:21.400> sometimes<00:01:21.640> with<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.060> pressure

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
just because sometimes with the pressure

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.700 
just because sometimes with the pressure
built<00:01:22.570> up<00:01:22.690> the<00:01:22.870> oil<00:01:23.020> will<00:01:23.170> come<00:01:23.350> out<00:01:23.530> on<00:01:23.680> a

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
built up the oil will come out on a

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.590 
built up the oil will come out on a
stream<00:01:24.100> pretty<00:01:24.640> quick<00:01:24.880> right<00:01:25.090> when<00:01:25.180> it<00:01:25.300> starts

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
stream pretty quick right when it starts

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.350 
stream pretty quick right when it starts
so<00:01:25.690> I<00:01:25.750> just<00:01:25.960> wanted<00:01:26.140> to<00:01:26.230> make<00:01:26.350> sure<00:01:26.520> didn't<00:01:27.520> get

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
so I just wanted to make sure didn't get

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.450 
so I just wanted to make sure didn't get
on<00:01:28.480> the<00:01:28.570> ground<00:01:28.750> pollute<00:01:29.200> everything<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:30.340> we

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
on the ground pollute everything so we

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.610 
on the ground pollute everything so we
have<00:01:30.550> the<00:01:30.670> front<00:01:30.880> drain<00:01:31.240> we're<00:01:31.900> going<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.080> take

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
have the front drain we're going to take

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.990 
have the front drain we're going to take
off<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:32.860> left<00:01:33.040> crankcase<00:01:33.520> bolt<00:01:33.820> which<00:01:33.970> is

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
off the left crankcase bolt which is

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.160 
off the left crankcase bolt which is
again<00:01:34.360> right<00:01:35.260> behind<00:01:35.500> your<00:01:36.010> shifter<00:01:36.430> a<00:01:37.170> little

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
again right behind your shifter a little

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.320 
again right behind your shifter a little
a<00:01:38.710> little<00:01:39.250> more<00:01:39.370> recessed<00:01:39.790> in<00:01:39.970> there<00:01:40.150> where

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
a little more recessed in there where

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.290 
a little more recessed in there where
the<00:01:40.390> bolt<00:01:40.570> is<00:01:40.750> so<00:01:41.020> I<00:01:41.230> put<00:01:41.710> an<00:01:41.800> extender<00:01:42.250> on<00:01:42.300> this

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
the bolt is so I put an extender on this

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:52.010 
the bolt is so I put an extender on this
is<00:01:43.690> 12<00:01:44.020> millimeter<00:01:46.290> okay<00:01:47.290> so<00:01:47.350> that's<00:01:47.620> broken
