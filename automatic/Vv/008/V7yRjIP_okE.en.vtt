a<00:02:22.580> lot<00:02:22.880> of<00:02:22.910> sections<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:24.710> reason<00:02:24.980> I've

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
a lot of sections and the reason I've

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.380 
a lot of sections and the reason I've
got<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:25.220> do<00:02:25.340> this<00:02:25.490> is<00:02:25.700> because<00:02:25.790> of<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.120> thick

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
got to do this is because of the thick

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.730 
got to do this is because of the thick
nut<00:02:27.820> and<00:02:28.820> I<00:02:28.940> want<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.480> have<00:02:29.630> on<00:02:30.080> either<00:02:30.380> side<00:02:30.710> of

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
nut and I want to have on either side of

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.190 
nut and I want to have on either side of
the<00:02:31.370> nut<00:02:32.650> part<00:02:33.650> of<00:02:33.770> the<00:02:33.860> wood<00:02:34.960> so<00:02:35.960> if<00:02:36.080> you

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
the nut part of the wood so if you

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.690 
the nut part of the wood so if you
imagine<00:02:36.290> you'd<00:02:36.980> have<00:02:37.130> two<00:02:37.310> bits<00:02:37.490> in<00:02:37.640> the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
imagine you'd have two bits in the

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.870 
imagine you'd have two bits in the
middle<00:02:38.920> two<00:02:39.920> bits<00:02:40.130> in<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.340> middle<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:40.760> then

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
middle two bits in the middle and then

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.020 
middle two bits in the middle and then
on<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.150> outside<00:02:41.180> a<00:02:42.460> bit<00:02:43.460> on<00:02:43.790> either<00:02:43.910> side<00:02:46.030> I

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
on the outside a bit on either side I

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.070 
on the outside a bit on either side I
think<00:02:47.690> now<00:02:47.990> I<00:02:48.020> think<00:02:48.260> I'll<00:02:48.560> fabricate<00:02:49.070> the

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
think now I think I'll fabricate the

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.900 
think now I think I'll fabricate the
trigger<00:02:51.080> and<00:02:51.410> then<00:02:51.560> that<00:02:51.770> and<00:02:52.340> then<00:02:52.460> once<00:02:52.610> us

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
trigger and then that and then once us

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.360 
trigger and then that and then once us
down<00:02:53.150> I<00:02:53.180> can<00:02:53.420> start<00:02:53.570> putting<00:02:53.690> it<00:02:53.900> together<00:02:54.370> not

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
down I can start putting it together not

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.850 
down I can start putting it together not
gonna<00:02:55.520> take<00:02:55.700> long<00:02:55.730> really

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
gonna take long really

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.720 
gonna take long really
this<00:02:57.860> has<00:02:57.980> probably<00:02:58.130> been<00:02:58.310> about<00:02:58.520> an<00:02:58.640> hour

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
this has probably been about an hour

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.890 
this has probably been about an hour
that<00:02:59.060> so<00:02:59.300> far

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
that so far

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.600 
that so far
you<00:03:00.710> don't<00:03:00.860> know<00:03:00.920> if<00:03:00.980> I<00:03:01.070> spent<00:03:01.310> all<00:03:01.430> doubt

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
you don't know if I spent all doubt

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.750 
you don't know if I spent all doubt
before<00:03:01.910> we<00:03:01.970> do<00:03:02.120> this<00:03:02.240> in<00:03:02.390> a<00:03:02.480> day<00:03:03.130> but<00:03:04.130> I

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
before we do this in a day but I

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.470 
before we do this in a day but I
probably<00:03:05.090> won't

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
probably won't

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.640 
probably won't
I'll<00:03:05.570> probably<00:03:05.690> do<00:03:05.960> it<00:03:06.020> master<00:03:06.170> count<00:03:06.500> today

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
I'll probably do it master count today

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.130 
I'll probably do it master count today
and<00:03:06.920> then<00:03:07.120> do<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.180> rest<00:03:08.270> tomorrow<00:03:08.480> so<00:03:08.930> next

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
and then do the rest tomorrow so next

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.280 
and then do the rest tomorrow so next
thing<00:03:09.260> you<00:03:09.440> should<00:03:09.500> see<00:03:09.800> is<00:03:09.830> the<00:03:10.840> nut<00:03:11.840> and

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
thing you should see is the nut and

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.400 
thing you should see is the nut and
trigger<00:03:12.820> roughly<00:03:13.820> cut<00:03:14.030> up<00:03:14.180> oh<00:03:16.090> there's<00:03:17.090> my

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
trigger roughly cut up oh there's my

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.710 
trigger roughly cut up oh there's my
trigger<00:03:18.550> and<00:03:19.550> the<00:03:20.270> nut<00:03:20.710> the<00:03:21.710> nut<00:03:22.510> drilled<00:03:23.510> out

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
trigger and the nut the nut drilled out

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.250 
trigger and the nut the nut drilled out
I'm<00:03:24.140> just<00:03:24.320> gonna<00:03:25.390> cut<00:03:26.390> them<00:03:26.570> out<00:03:26.720> now<00:03:26.930> follow

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
I'm just gonna cut them out now follow

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.479 
I'm just gonna cut them out now follow
them<00:03:27.440> to<00:03:27.560> shape<00:03:27.800> and<00:03:28.040> then<00:03:28.130> I'll<00:03:28.250> show<00:03:28.430> you

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
them to shape and then I'll show you

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:34.720 
them to shape and then I'll show you
then<00:03:28.700> once<00:03:28.880> they're<00:03:29.060> done<00:03:33.100> right<00:03:34.100> so<00:03:34.430> so<00:03:34.700> far

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
then once they're done right so so far

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.380 
then once they're done right so so far
I've<00:03:35.239> done<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:36.610> sort<00:03:37.610> of<00:03:37.700> free<00:03:38.030> Court<00:03:38.300> has

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
I've done the sort of free Court has

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:48.910 
I've done the sort of free Court has
done<00:03:38.600> the<00:03:41.560> pretty<00:03:42.560> cool<00:03:43.989> saying<00:03:45.010> that<00:03:47.920> fixed

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
done the pretty cool saying that fixed

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.240 
done the pretty cool saying that fixed
the<00:03:49.070> stock<00:03:49.730> together<00:03:50.260> in<00:03:51.260> its<00:03:51.440> rough<00:03:51.680> state

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
the stock together in its rough state

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.790 
the stock together in its rough state
so<00:03:52.489> I<00:03:52.550> can<00:03:53.980> sand<00:03:54.980> it<00:03:55.220> smooth<00:03:55.760> it<00:03:55.970> into<00:03:56.770> shape

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
so I can sand it smooth it into shape

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.110 
so I can sand it smooth it into shape
it's<00:03:58.459> basic<00:03:58.970> shape<00:03:59.239> and<00:03:59.860> the<00:04:00.860> nut<00:04:01.130> goes<00:04:01.850> in

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
it's basic shape and the nut goes in

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:09.120 
it's basic shape and the nut goes in
there<00:04:05.170> don't<00:04:06.170> quite<00:04:06.350> fit<00:04:06.590> a<00:04:06.650> minute<00:04:07.010> but<00:04:07.340> happy

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
there don't quite fit a minute but happy

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:21.460 
there don't quite fit a minute but happy
about<00:04:10.130> their<00:04:12.280> inside<00:04:14.620> trigger<00:04:16.690> be<00:04:17.690> someone

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.770 

so<00:04:22.130> I<00:04:22.850> don't<00:04:23.210> know<00:04:23.270> how<00:04:23.360> I'm<00:04:23.420> gonna<00:04:23.510> do<00:04:23.630> anymore

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
so I don't know how I'm gonna do anymore

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.800 
so I don't know how I'm gonna do anymore
today<00:04:27.760> all<00:04:28.760> right<00:04:28.910> so<00:04:29.210> this<00:04:29.390> is<00:04:29.450> the<00:04:29.600> end<00:04:29.720> of

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
today all right so this is the end of

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.490 
today all right so this is the end of
day<00:04:29.870> 1<00:04:30.370> I've<00:04:31.370> got<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.970> stock<00:04:32.360> sort<00:04:32.750> of<00:04:32.840> roughly

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
day 1 I've got the stock sort of roughly

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
day 1 I've got the stock sort of roughly
shaped<00:04:35.020> I'll<00:04:36.020> just<00:04:36.200> ride<00:04:36.500> in<00:04:36.770> that's<00:04:37.340> where

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
shaped I'll just ride in that's where

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.220 
shaped I'll just ride in that's where
the<00:04:37.610> trigger<00:04:37.940> will<00:04:38.030> go<00:04:38.210> that's<00:04:38.960> how<00:04:39.020> much<00:04:39.200> of

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
the trigger will go that's how much of

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.420 
the trigger will go that's how much of
the<00:04:39.440> nut<00:04:39.680> will<00:04:39.860> stick<00:04:40.070> out<00:04:40.280> so<00:04:42.070> you<00:04:43.070> can<00:04:43.250> see

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
the nut will stick out so you can see

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.660 
the nut will stick out so you can see
you'd<00:04:43.670> pull<00:04:43.910> the<00:04:44.030> figure<00:04:44.770> and<00:04:45.770> then<00:04:45.980> the<00:04:46.520> nut

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
you'd pull the figure and then the nut

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:56.140 
you'd pull the figure and then the nut
would<00:04:46.790> spin<00:04:53.860> still<00:04:54.860> gotta<00:04:55.010> do<00:04:55.160> the<00:04:55.190> groove<00:04:55.520> for

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
would spin still gotta do the groove for

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.810 
would spin still gotta do the groove for
the<00:04:56.210> bolt<00:04:56.680> probably<00:04:57.680> shoot<00:04:57.920> pistol<00:04:58.340> bucks<00:04:58.640> out

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
the bolt probably shoot pistol bucks out

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:11.650 
the bolt probably shoot pistol bucks out
of<00:04:58.850> this<00:05:01.600> that's<00:05:02.600> the<00:05:02.780> basic<00:05:10.300> yeah<00:05:11.300> shouldn't

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
of this that's the basic yeah shouldn't

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.360 
of this that's the basic yeah shouldn't
take<00:05:11.780> too<00:05:11.810> long<00:05:12.080> to<00:05:12.140> do<00:05:12.350> yeah

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
take too long to do yeah

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.910 
take too long to do yeah
well<00:05:14.210> hope<00:05:14.510> you<00:05:14.540> enjoyed<00:05:15.280> this<00:05:16.280> part<00:05:16.640> 1<00:05:16.940> of
