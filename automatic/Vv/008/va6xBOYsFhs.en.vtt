00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
sharp learning curve I bet what about

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.370 
sharp learning curve I bet what about
the<00:02:27.370> man<00:02:27.549> his<00:02:27.880> name<00:02:28.090> is<00:02:28.120> synonymous<00:02:28.450> with<00:02:28.900> fast

but when returned into service for the
second<00:03:04.210> time<00:03:04.390> one<00:03:05.140> car<00:03:05.380> seemed<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.830> have<00:03:05.950> a<00:03:06.010> bit

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
second time one car seemed to have a bit

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.960 
second time one car seemed to have a bit
more<00:03:06.480> ventilation<00:03:08.370> what<00:03:09.370> happened<00:03:09.760> to<00:03:09.850> the

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
more ventilation what happened to the

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.180 
more ventilation what happened to the
hole<00:03:10.090> in<00:03:10.270> the<00:03:10.360> car<00:03:10.570> the<00:03:11.380> hole<00:03:11.560> in<00:03:11.710> the<00:03:11.800> cow<00:03:11.980> well

hole in the car the hole in the cow well

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.770 
hole in the car the hole in the cow well
that's<00:03:12.400> a<00:03:12.490> bit<00:03:12.640> of<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:12.790> story<00:03:13.150> there<00:03:13.420> we<00:03:13.600> were

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
that's a bit of a story there we were

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.320 
that's a bit of a story there we were
getting<00:03:14.380> faster<00:03:14.800> and<00:03:14.920> faster<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:16.090> we<00:03:16.240> were

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
getting faster and faster and we were

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.080 
getting faster and faster and we were
coming<00:03:16.660> down<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:17.050> straight<00:03:17.350> before<00:03:17.620> the

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
coming down the straight before the

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.060 
coming down the straight before the
before<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.390> finish<00:03:19.720> and<00:03:20.050> I<00:03:20.410> thought<00:03:20.830> well

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
before the finish and I thought well

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.010 
before the finish and I thought well
we'll<00:03:21.280> just<00:03:21.820> about<00:03:22.150> be<00:03:22.420> able<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.630> make<00:03:22.840> this

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
we'll just about be able to make this

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.810 
we'll just about be able to make this
because<00:03:23.260> it<00:03:23.380> was<00:03:23.500> very<00:03:23.800> very<00:03:24.130> slippery<00:03:24.550> the

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
because it was very very slippery the

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.730 
because it was very very slippery the
water<00:03:25.060> was<00:03:25.300> running<00:03:25.570> and<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:25.990> mud<00:03:26.200> was<00:03:26.440> there

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
water was running and the mud was there

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.040 
water was running and the mud was there
and<00:03:27.040> didn't<00:03:27.880> look<00:03:28.000> good<00:03:28.240> anyway<00:03:28.570> I<00:03:28.660> could<00:03:28.840> feel

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
and didn't look good anyway I could feel

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.290 
and didn't look good anyway I could feel
the<00:03:29.170> car<00:03:29.410> moving<00:03:29.980> and<00:03:30.190> I<00:03:30.250> thought<00:03:30.430> are<00:03:31.240> we

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
the car moving and I thought are we

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.910 
the car moving and I thought are we
going<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.600> make<00:03:31.720> this<00:03:31.840> right-hand<00:03:32.380> bend<00:03:32.710> or

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
going to make this right-hand bend or

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.100 
going to make this right-hand bend or
not<00:03:33.160> and<00:03:33.460> inevitably<00:03:34.000> we<00:03:34.240> didn't<00:03:34.570> did<00:03:34.750> we<00:03:34.930> we

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
not and inevitably we didn't did we we

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.710 
not and inevitably we didn't did we we
slid<00:03:35.470> right<00:03:35.710> off<00:03:36.220> the<00:03:36.550> road<00:03:36.760> down<00:03:37.240> the<00:03:37.450> bank

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
slid right off the road down the bank

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.920 
slid right off the road down the bank
onto<00:03:38.590> a<00:03:38.620> tree<00:03:39.010> and<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.940> tree<00:03:40.210> went<00:03:40.450> into<00:03:40.780> the

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
onto a tree and the tree went into the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.010 
onto a tree and the tree went into the
upper<00:03:41.530> window<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.130> car<00:03:42.700> so<00:03:43.540> then<00:03:43.690> it<00:03:43.810> took<00:03:43.960> us

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
upper window the car so then it took us

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.880 
upper window the car so then it took us
a<00:03:44.200> bit<00:03:44.230> of<00:03:44.470> time<00:03:44.650> to<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:46.720> get<00:03:47.230> ourselves<00:03:47.350> out<00:03:47.830> of

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
a bit of time to to get ourselves out of

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.440 
a bit of time to to get ourselves out of
the<00:03:48.130> ditch<00:03:48.370> we<00:03:48.640> had<00:03:48.760> to<00:03:48.910> move<00:03:49.060> the<00:03:49.240> car

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
the ditch we had to move the car

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.880 
the ditch we had to move the car
backwards<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:50.020> forwards<00:03:50.410> and<00:03:50.530> when<00:03:50.650> we<00:03:50.740> did

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
backwards and forwards and when we did

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.070 
backwards and forwards and when we did
that<00:03:50.950> we<00:03:51.130> cook<00:03:51.550> the<00:03:51.700> clutch<00:03:51.940> and<00:03:52.630> we<00:03:52.780> had<00:03:52.900> no

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
that we cook the clutch and we had no

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.830 
that we cook the clutch and we had no
clutch<00:03:53.350> so<00:03:53.710> the<00:03:53.860> last<00:03:54.090> stage<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.390> a<00:03:55.420> half<00:03:55.600> we
