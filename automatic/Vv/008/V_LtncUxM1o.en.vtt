eat flour so to make this fabric beat
flowers<00:00:38.129> will<00:00:38.579> need<00:00:39.050> ten<00:00:40.910> fabric<00:00:41.910> beans<00:00:42.920> so

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
flowers will need ten fabric beans so

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.049 
flowers will need ten fabric beans so
let's<00:00:44.489> start<00:00:44.940> do<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.739> felt<00:00:47.250> one<00:00:47.760> inch

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
one layer also like this to the center

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.760 
one layer also like this to the center
one<00:01:57.790> layer<00:01:58.119> and<00:01:58.450> you<00:01:58.659> can<00:01:58.810> make<00:01:59.409> even<00:01:59.619> more

one layer and you can make even more
than<00:02:00.220> two<00:02:00.640> years<00:02:01.080> so<00:02:02.080> now<00:02:02.350> we<00:02:02.710> are<00:02:02.740> finished

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
than two years so now we are finished

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.300 
than two years so now we are finished
gluing<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.360> first<00:02:04.659> layer<00:02:05.020> now<00:02:05.740> we'll<00:02:05.979> start

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
gluing the first layer now we'll start

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.850 
gluing the first layer now we'll start
gluing<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.590> second<00:02:08.590> layer<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.230> put<00:02:11.650> the

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
gluing the second layer so to put the

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.770 
gluing the second layer so to put the
beads<00:02:12.130> for<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.670> second<00:02:13.120> year<00:02:13.180> we'll<00:02:13.510> put

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
beads for the second year we'll put

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.710 
beads for the second year we'll put
between<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.739> first<00:02:15.269> layer<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.860> we'll<00:02:18.010> start

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
between the first layer so we'll start

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:27.080 
between the first layer so we'll start
gluing<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.900> beads<00:02:20.110> between<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:23.670> first<00:02:24.670> layer

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
gluing the beads between the first layer

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.490 
gluing the beads between the first layer
so<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.150> will<00:02:28.330> give<00:02:28.630> you<00:02:28.840> kind<00:02:29.140> of<00:02:29.350> a

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
so it will give you kind of a

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:50.820 
so it will give you kind of a
dimensional<00:02:30.280> like<00:02:30.730> this<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:37.120> I'm<00:02:37.209> gluing<00:02:37.780> it

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.010 

if<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.610> don't<00:02:51.820> want<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.210> glue<00:02:52.420> can<00:02:52.690> even

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
if you don't want to glue can even

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:16.240 
if you don't want to glue can even
stretch<00:02:53.470> it

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.870 

so<00:03:17.250> after<00:03:17.550> gluing<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.900> second<00:03:19.410> layer<00:03:19.850> you<00:03:20.850> can

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
so after gluing the second layer you can

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.850 
so after gluing the second layer you can
continue<00:03:21.720> if<00:03:21.750> you<00:03:21.990> want<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.290> make<00:03:22.440> a<00:03:22.470> third

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
continue if you want to make a third

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.570 
continue if you want to make a third
layer<00:03:23.160> but<00:03:23.700> i'm<00:03:23.940> just<00:03:23.970> making<00:03:24.630> today<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:25.260> layer

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
layer but i'm just making today to layer

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.050 
layer but i'm just making today to layer
so<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:27.720> flower<00:03:28.560> is<00:03:28.980> done<00:03:29.310> now<00:03:29.580> we'll<00:03:29.820> put<00:03:30.030> a

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
so the flower is done now we'll put a

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.080 
so the flower is done now we'll put a
center<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.870> can<00:03:30.900> put<00:03:31.260> any<00:03:31.530> center<00:03:32.280> you<00:03:32.850> like

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
center you can put any center you like

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.449 
center you can put any center you like
our<00:03:34.490> clear<00:03:35.490> rhinestone<00:03:36.390> which<00:03:36.690> i'll<00:03:36.900> put<00:03:37.459> the

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
our clear rhinestone which i'll put the

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:45.370 
our clear rhinestone which i'll put the
center<00:03:39.080> so<00:03:40.080> put<00:03:40.319> glue<00:03:40.830> in<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:41.220> center<00:03:41.250> and

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:54.370 

then<00:03:46.940> you<00:03:47.940> can<00:03:48.120> just
