 and you're going to see this clip so if and 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.360
 So here it is that there are no 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.009
 problem there it's really solid 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.720
 we have no problem at this level 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:36.450
 was really good so I'm going so 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.570
 now to see I'm going to clip 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.500
 it's here with the small clip system 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:46.630
 on my table 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.400
 game like this it's an accessory that 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.650
 will be especially useful you were going to table 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.490
 office 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.620
 when you are working 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.440
 it's convenient enough so there here I 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.270
 fix them and there it does not move there is enough 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.410
 to unscrew get laid and I can do 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.270
 turn as I want the arm I fix it 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:09.130
 like these we'll say I'll go 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:12.430
 put like that here's hop there I can 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.200
 also turned that arm there and puts so 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.900
 this direction then he can not 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.220
 go 360 degrees but for once there 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.209
 can go from left to right what is 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.570
 practice also here and now 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.120
 it's enough for me to fix the part 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:33.489
 mint and here on the little life this game 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:36.760
 but like this I turn and that's it 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.980
 fixed here you see it's really 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.310
 nickel it does not move we can turn it 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.070
 in every way there is no problem 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.019
 so let's imagine hop I want to change the 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.200
 master like these saw perfectly 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:53.739
 articulated there I turn there we can the 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.140
 put like this so imagine as 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.180
 this is really a small accessory 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.769
 hyper practice that really allows you 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.680
 to save space 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.820
 when you are working 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.170
 it saves you from having an ipad that is 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.299
 posed permanently there you really 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.610
 you can fix it see for example 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:14.079
 like this i want to turn game like this 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.670
 and it's really super convenient as 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.950
 accessory that's so it's a 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.459
 accessory found on the site 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.230
 who is our partner the site 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:27.790
 shelf accessories points like to a 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.260
 price around 80 euros 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.660
 but for once it's really a 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.130
 product very well realize the finishes 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.049
 so it's not at all like 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.000
 products that we could test about 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.200
 two years where the finishes really was 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.940
 plastic that is not very strong 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.980
 the sound feels like it's solid 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.950
 it's scrap metal and especially this 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.290
 small rotating system is really great 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.840
 interesting so here it was the test 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.760
 of the joy factory accessory 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.280
 the clip holder for tablets 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.280
 exclusively ipad 2 3 and 4
