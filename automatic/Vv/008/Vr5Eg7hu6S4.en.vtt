I<00:02:06.569> am<00:02:06.929> applying<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.560> white<00:02:07.829> powder<00:02:08.130> directly

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
I am applying this white powder directly

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.400 
I am applying this white powder directly
under<00:02:09.060> my<00:02:09.209> eyes<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.780> it's<00:02:09.899> just<00:02:10.079> a<00:02:10.170> setting

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
under my eyes and it's just a setting

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.589 
under my eyes and it's just a setting
powder<00:02:10.530> because<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.519> dark<00:02:11.849> application

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599

so I am pretty sure that some of this

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.089 
so I am pretty sure that some of this
dark<00:02:15.060> shadow<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.510> gonna<00:02:15.690> fall<00:02:16.079> and<00:02:16.410> if<00:02:16.950> you

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
dark shadow is gonna fall and if you

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.160 
dark shadow is gonna fall and if you

ISO<00:02:19.590> setting<00:02:19.980> powder<00:02:20.190> then<00:02:20.819> if<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.120> does<00:02:21.299> fall

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
ISO setting powder then if it does fall

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.150 
ISO setting powder then if it does fall
you<00:02:21.720> could<00:02:21.840> just<00:02:22.019> sort<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.230> brush<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.560> off<00:02:22.829> and

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
which is kind of a cool it comes like in

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.890 
which is kind of a cool it comes like in
a<00:05:45.680> pencil<00:05:46.100> form<00:05:46.400> but<00:05:46.910> it<00:05:47.000> is<00:05:47.120> a<00:05:47.150> lipstick<00:05:47.600> and

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
a pencil form but it is a lipstick and

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.450 
a pencil form but it is a lipstick and
it's<00:05:48.020> called<00:05:48.350> the<00:05:48.590> juicy<00:05:49.039> peach<00:05:51.130> so<00:05:52.130> this<00:05:52.280> is

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
it's called the juicy peach so this is
