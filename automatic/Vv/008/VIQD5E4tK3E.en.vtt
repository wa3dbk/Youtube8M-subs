00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
nails have a tendency to split a little

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.190 
nails have a tendency to split a little
bit<00:04:23.100> on<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.430> edges<00:04:23.580> like<00:04:24.360> my<00:04:24.510> phone's<00:04:24.750> always

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
bit on the edges like my phone's always

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.520 
bit on the edges like my phone's always
tend<00:04:25.889> to<00:04:25.979> split<00:04:26.280> and<00:04:26.840> this<00:04:27.840> keeps<00:04:28.110> them<00:04:28.350> from

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
tend to split and this keeps them from

doing<00:04:28.680> that<00:04:28.950> and<00:04:29.220> I<00:04:30.000> think<00:04:30.540> it<00:04:30.780> kind<00:04:31.139> of

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
doing that and I think it kind of

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.490 
doing that and I think it kind of
protects<00:04:31.650> your<00:04:31.889> nails<00:04:32.040> in<00:04:32.280> a<00:04:32.340> way<00:04:32.460> but<00:04:33.500> it's
