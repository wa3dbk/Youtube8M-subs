00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
know if you can see it that very clearly

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.270 
know if you can see it that very clearly
but<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.700> design<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.060> actually<00:01:48.270> very<00:01:48.720> subtle

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
but the design is actually very subtle

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.679 
but the design is actually very subtle
when<00:01:50.280> it's<00:01:50.430> actually<00:01:50.640> up<00:01:51.090> which<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.450> really

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
when it's actually up which I really

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.300 
when it's actually up which I really
like<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.020> want<00:01:52.170> something<00:01:52.409> very<00:01:52.560> subtle<00:01:53.009> but

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
like I want something very subtle but

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.530 
like I want something very subtle but
would<00:01:53.430> still<00:01:53.579> match<00:01:53.880> because<00:01:54.180> it's<00:01:54.299> going<00:01:54.450> to

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
would still match because it's going to

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.209 
would still match because it's going to
be<00:01:54.600> very<00:01:54.899> small<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.560> there<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:55.890> don't<00:01:55.950> want
