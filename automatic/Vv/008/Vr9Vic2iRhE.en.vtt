00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 the empty claw of the dark star is 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.429
 a new ultras mount in world of 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.660
 Warcraft was a lot of players 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.670
 very popular 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.590
 I try a little light in the dark too 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.929
 bring because the whole is something else 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.929
 questionable so let's go 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.920
 with the empty claw of the dark star 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.360
 Blizzard finally has one again 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.120
 desirable mount put into play 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.280
 which not through the in game shop too 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.739
 is that means that the players 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.590
 The spawn points have to fight for a long time 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.390
 have to expire around this desirable 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.449
 Moon finally get 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.239
 but how do you get that now the portals 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:58.140
 to the edge of reality there that is 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:01.299
 place where you can bleed the mount 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.850
 open in the level 100 from access 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:05.470
 crystal daily areas of this bonn 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.840
 points to live by the gamblers 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.370
 Well worn together and now 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.840
 they are probably the only ones confirmed 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.510
 Spawn points 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.570
 These are frost fire degrees in the 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.180
 shadow monday in le grand and in the 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.880
 tips from arag if you have this portal 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.940
 enters where a solo scenario opens 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.310
 and you can invite one there 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.770
 then that leads to the mount 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.090
 according to information, that remains 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.610
 Portal only five to ten minutes 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.370
 exist or as long as someone in the 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.470
 On the other hand, porch is well 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.230
 only one player per portal 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.090
 Entering this portal also means that 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.890
 if someone was there before you 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.100
 have you had a bad luck first and must 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.990
 hope for the next point 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.790
 if you go out of the portal then 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.280
 the portal is closed and a 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.050
 respawn Kaymer starts from the model ago 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.100

 Anyone can get it nowadays 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.069

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.379
 extremely rare then I wish you 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.750
