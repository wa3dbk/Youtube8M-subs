00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.960
 Hello 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.639
 today we will learn how to make a 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.219
 people that stirred 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.170
 first we will have to always 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.389
 choose the eggs very well that we 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.270
 will be able to use then it has to be 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.380
 always a perfect smooth-skinned egg without 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.380
 have no cracks 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:31.679
 I'm going to break these games. 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:38.690
 season with a little salt and 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:40.379
 batteries quickly into the pan on fire 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.070
 medium 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.829
 I'll put a little butter 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.050
 and let this butter melt 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.410
 As soon as it melts, I'll put the 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.170
 eggs and stirring them slowly large 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.469
 secret of the scrambled egg is the temperature 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.320
 pan then always medium or low heat 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.570
 And we'll move it all the time. 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.479
 so the legitimate effect shook the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:11.939
 English style like melted butter 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:14.390
 I'll put the eggs inside the word and 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.420
 I'm going to work with a silicone spatula 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.460
 stirring him all the time until he 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.580
 be fully corrected 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.350
 When he starts cooking, I'll go. 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.020
 put a little cream and a 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.610
 a little milk remembering that the cream 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.979
 of milk that always uses that cream of 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.740
 fresh milk I will never use the 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.579
 packaged milk or canned milk 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.159
 canister 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:43.250
 It's time to put some 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.250
 sour cream just a little bit 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.100
 and some milk 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.180
 that milk and sour cream will make 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.890
 with this scrambled egg to become even more 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.890
 creamy and tasty 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.880
 good it is already almost in texture copy 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.710
 Scrambled egg texture you can see 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.840
 that he looks more like a scrambled egg than 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.610
 hotel because I moved from what really 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.110
 people do at home and the secret is 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.760
 really the one that stays the most 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.530
 juicy so that it gets better 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.510
 because we put a 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.860
 a little milk and a little bit of 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.600
 cream and this will give this touch 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.860
 differentiated in it to finish I go 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:39.490
 put a little more salt and a 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.550
 bit of ground white pepper in the 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.550
 hour 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:54.819
 and that's how we make the scrambled egg
