00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.150
 mercedes never says never shadow you 

00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:07.580
 we finish it 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.570
 breathe away we know she is tired 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.570
 remove pigeon 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.340
 the cute waves 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:20.180
 let's calmly take air side we know 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:24.080
 who are married or if you do not put 17 in 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:28.330
 sad face puts him in the face 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:31.249
 support I have the care supports 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.960
 and pulling away from him, he grabs her arm 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.960
 they want to spend in the breast 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:45.430
 it marginalized him from that test wins the team 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.940
 if we want 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.970
 for the right attitude 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:15.030
 in the second that the chain for the 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:15.030
 first the second and the face 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.630
 this shoulders that the same as I think 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.490
 sanz dove that made the throne 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.490
 Alejandra leaning on her legs 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:47.950
 to kick her face Alejandra look there 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.330
 right there that's not that but now the xx 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.280
 others to move the leg towards the other 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.020
 side wanted to cover diabetes or comb 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.439
 efe 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.070
 I think I think I think 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:02.609
 sports are not at stake because look 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.609
 apart 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:18.330
 the quiet world but not what happens 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.330
 it is perfect 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.420
 a little calm alejandra obviously 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.890
 it was lory because all the force the 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.930
 have in the arm to try to pass and 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.930
 obviously the tensions this 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:40.790
 this means something because of my way of 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.290
 competing is not aggressive at all I'm 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.319
 without right I think with the heat of 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.030
 moment of sudden it happened to me I did not 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.519
 I was not even seeing everything I was putting the 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.640
 leg the truth I in the other 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:55.640
 I do not like competitions either 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.340
 kicking or attacking and something to pass 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.379
 but I see that determined in 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.540
 determine the competencies if so is 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.489
 so to pass and to achieve things not 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.870
 patio there is nothing but one has to 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.720
 win the other one because of this the idea 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.660
 we know it does not work but it happened 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.460
 I'm sorry but I'm going to try 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.760
 take care I always try to tell a lot 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.760
 efe 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.000
 it's a competition 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.190
 obviously mortified is mario park 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.720
 but it bothers pretty hypocrite 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.720
 scream to christian dominguez 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.670
 talking screaming images 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.500
 practically the page to the lady of this 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.690
 craving or that is not already for that thing 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.250
 as a cry gains and may 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.490
 it will be cold not bad if you do not understand 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.380
 please if I see that repeatedly 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.930
 they are committing faults and they do not 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.090
 nothing and that somehow they are 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.250
 putting into play 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.050
 the physical of ale because they are kicking that 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.989
 put him in the face unintentionally or 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.970
 intention ok she says that if you believe her 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.920
 but of course but it was not but 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.420
 it was not you did not realize that they stopped the 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.220
 competition and they gave you the point of your 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.780
 team but in the second but there were already 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.120
 past and regÃºs away to build and 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.370
 we will be so loyal to the competition 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.569
 I think that the one that was better I think that 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.100
 you could determine a little better what 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.169
 what happened to the is because I think the two 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.340
 for the euphoria they tried to pass and a 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.600
 recently from the earth the other you 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.010
 you got somehow kicked in 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.010
 the face that I think was not purposely 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.630
 father but in that moment obviously of 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.580
 the euphoria she without realizing it then you 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.080
 weight pulls it down where I am and 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.470
 He's definitely caught a rope and 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.470
 that burns
