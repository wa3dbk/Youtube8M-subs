rings so on on this one the Rubik's

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.930 
rings so on on this one the Rubik's
magic<00:00:36.929> is<00:00:37.079> right<00:00:37.260> here<00:00:37.769> this<00:00:38.339> is<00:00:38.460> long<00:00:38.699> as<00:00:38.879> the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
magic is right here this is long as the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.410 
magic is right here this is long as the
three<00:00:39.149> rings<00:00:39.390> are<00:00:39.600> like<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:40.159> okay<00:00:41.159> so<00:00:41.429> you

from<00:01:09.120> the<00:01:09.330> two<00:01:09.540> sides<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.380> will<00:01:10.650> unfold

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
from the two sides and it will unfold

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.440 
from the two sides and it will unfold
and<00:01:12.960> go<00:01:13.440> like<00:01:13.620> this<00:01:13.800> as<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.550> see<00:01:14.700> there's

to do is flip this side down and you're
going<00:01:23.160> to<00:01:23.220> do<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> single<00:01:23.760> roll<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.960> means

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
going to do a single roll that means

going to do a single roll that means
that<00:01:25.380> only<00:01:25.560> one<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:26.010> the<00:01:26.160> squares<00:01:26.630> is<00:01:27.630> moved

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
that only one of the squares is moved

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.670 
that only one of the squares is moved
right<00:01:28.350> like<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.840> that's<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.500> single

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
right like this so that that's a single

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.140 
right like this so that that's a single
roll<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.250> you're<00:01:32.340> going<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.520> then<00:01:32.730> flip<00:01:33.060> it

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
roll and you're going to then flip it

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
down okay so you'll have a ring half

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.120 
down okay so you'll have a ring half
ring<00:01:37.440> ring<00:01:38.130> half<00:01:38.940> ring<00:01:39.740> then<00:01:40.740> what<00:01:40.980> you<00:01:41.100> have

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
to do flip it over

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.750 
to do flip it over
and<00:01:45.870> what<00:01:46.050> you'll<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:47.220> ring<00:01:47.550> right
