00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 here is the computer center of 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.970
 federal university of pernambuco ufpe 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.139
 It is considered a reference in that 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.210
 presents to you 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.580
 sarmento the money and is a doctor and 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.800
 microelectronics and ufpr professor 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.990
 adriano, let's go first of all 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.800
 Launch this computer 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.320
 come on it's good with several competitors 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.359
 here on the computer so I will explain and 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.220
 show only the best known and the most 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.980
 important so here we have a 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.020
 processor is then this processor 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.969
 is the computer's brain is it going 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.760
 perform calculations is he who will perform 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.629
 its functions and that will command the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.149
 other parts 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.309
 this piece here is the main memory is 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.090
 it is capable of storing data and 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.860
 Software 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.629
 so every time we run a 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.600
 program with the first program is 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.570
 stored in main memory and 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.300
 the dumper will access the instructions that 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.789
 are in main memory problem 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.789
 main memory is that it does not 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.320
 can store the data in 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.780
 electrical current when the computer 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.909
 disconnected all the data that was 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.710
 stored in the main memory are 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.530
 and then, so we will not lose 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.369
 the data programs that we were in 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.610
 computer 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.180
 There is this part from here that is the disk 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.920
 hard and then what happens when I go 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.040
 running a program, the program is 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.850
 transferred from hard disk to memory 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.130
 main 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.509
 and then the processor executes the 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.420
 institutions that are in the 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.759
 then I would appreciate the memory 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.030
 computer, this is also 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.829
 from manufacturer data to 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.560
 data that people save that people 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.320
 record and email photos and all that is it and 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.240
 has the advantage when there is no 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.700
 electric current her age she still 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.280
 retains the data it has stored 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.420
 now when you save a file it 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.909
 came here to jail 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.509
 how does this work in good practice? 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.399
 I'll show you 1h of open ta sure and 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.740
 it consists of several discs such as 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.600
 people can realize this can record in the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.640
 two surfaces and each disk 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.770
 so when we want to record a 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.390
 file processors where do people 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.000
 will save this file 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.580
 is what happens by careless turns and he 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.280
 will tell you which part of the disc 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.520
 be recorded information for example I 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.810
 I have one of these then I go there unless 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.330
 my Documents 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.950
 the processor will generate it 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.110
 say and look save it a little place x 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.410
 and then the arm will move 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.510
 exactly the place x and the head of 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.390
 read recording will access that 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.190
 Bishop paradinha I want to record 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.300
 file or want to read the article 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.790
 this is what we call the address 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.470
 where such file is and when I delete a 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.500
 file that happens 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.590
 good is how I said neither the files 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.470
 recorded here in the trash and have a 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.360
 table that holds the address should these 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.880
 files then when I delete file 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.450
 they are actually modifying this table 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.220
 and saying no, that address where 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.780
 was the file is released to be 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.630
 recorded other information 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.370
 so on to the user it seems that the 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.250
 file was deleted but in fact it 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.519
 continue here in a file that he 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.070
 some there who has chosen us 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.769
 will necessarily find it there 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.440
 not necessarily but it is possible 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.360
 to recover it so nowadays there are 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.040
 programs that do it there then 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.170
 basically what they do 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.560
 they seek to do an investigation 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.900
 or on the disc and they compare to that 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.510
 table that has the addresses of the files 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.019
 What they find the most is because it is the 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.400
 file deleted a confidential file 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.070
 those who do not want it 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.829
 stay on the hard drive has to erase 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.140
 there are definitely programs that 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.250
 can permanently delete 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.200
 they work 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.660
 in fact they get address in that 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.910
 file that was noticed and they write 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.530
 some random data simply 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.579
 to write something over 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.980
 from that file 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.299
 so in practice the file has been deleted 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.130
 now that you know how it is 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.989
 a hard drive works and other 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.060
 questions to ask you and if a 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.880
 computer has no hard disk 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.769
 this requires another question if you put 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.709
 information on a social network and then 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:27.190
 resolve to erase 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.190
 Is it really erased, right?
