00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
the way through very well so a metal

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.250 
the way through very well so a metal

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
all the way around and then lightly

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.260 
all the way around and then lightly

a little wavy border I thought that
would<00:01:52.299> be<00:01:52.389> really<00:01:52.659> cute<00:01:53.049> but<00:01:53.740> after<00:01:54.189> it<00:01:54.310> was

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
would be really cute but after it was

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.980 
would be really cute but after it was
done<00:01:54.639> I<00:01:54.670> realized<00:01:55.179> I<00:01:55.359> probably<00:01:55.389> would<00:01:55.869> have

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
done I realized I probably would have

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.739 
done I realized I probably would have
been<00:01:56.079> better<00:01:56.259> off<00:01:56.499> cutting<00:01:57.389> those<00:01:58.389> flower

00:01:58.739 --> 00:01:58.749 
been better off cutting those flower

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:01.889 
been better off cutting those flower
shapes<00:01:59.109> in<00:01:59.289> half<00:01:59.560> directly<00:02:00.219> across<00:02:00.869> when<00:02:01.869> I

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
shapes in half directly across when I

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.410 
shapes in half directly across when I
got<00:02:02.139> to<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.439> bottom<00:02:02.740> edge<00:02:02.979> and<00:02:03.369> leaving<00:02:04.270> a

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
got to the bottom edge and leaving a

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.209 
got to the bottom edge and leaving a
straight<00:02:04.840> edge<00:02:05.079> around<00:02:05.380> there<00:02:05.829> I<00:02:05.859> think<00:02:06.039> that

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
straight edge around there I think that

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:08.190 
straight edge around there I think that
would<00:02:06.429> have<00:02:06.490> been<00:02:06.549> a<00:02:06.909> little<00:02:07.209> bit<00:02:07.420> better<00:02:07.600> it

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
would have been a little bit better it

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.749 
would have been a little bit better it
but<00:02:08.380> I'll<00:02:08.470> show<00:02:08.679> you<00:02:08.740> how<00:02:08.979> it<00:02:09.130> turned<00:02:09.369> out<00:02:09.520> and

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
but I'll show you how it turned out and

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.220 
but I'll show you how it turned out and
you<00:02:09.819> can<00:02:09.970> decide<00:02:10.240> how<00:02:10.420> you<00:02:10.450> want<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:10.810> try<00:02:10.990> to<00:02:11.050> do

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
you can decide how you want to try to do

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.640 
you can decide how you want to try to do
this

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
this

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.190 
this
now<00:02:12.430> to<00:02:12.490> make<00:02:12.819> this<00:02:13.030> all<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.360> did<00:02:13.630> was<00:02:13.810> just<00:02:13.959> take

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
now to make this all I did was just take

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.320 
now to make this all I did was just take
the<00:02:14.380> bowl<00:02:14.590> just<00:02:15.160> like<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.550> was<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:15.970> put<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.209> in

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
the bowl just like it was and put it in

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.690 
the bowl just like it was and put it in
the<00:02:16.390> oven<00:02:16.510> on<00:02:16.780> top<00:02:17.020> of<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.260> oven<00:02:17.380> rack<00:02:17.680> I<00:02:18.040> baked

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
the oven on top of the oven rack I baked

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.559 
the oven on top of the oven rack I baked
it<00:02:18.850> at<00:02:18.940> 350<00:02:19.480> degrees<00:02:19.659> for<00:02:20.560> about<00:02:20.849> 20<00:02:21.849> minutes

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
it at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.760 
it at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes
or<00:02:22.810> so<00:02:22.950> that'll<00:02:23.950> really<00:02:24.099> depend

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
or so that'll really depend

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.440 
or so that'll really depend
on<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:25.100> thickness<00:02:25.490> that<00:02:25.730> you're<00:02:26.060> going<00:02:26.300> to

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
on the thickness that you're going to

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.130 
on the thickness that you're going to
make<00:02:27.070> your<00:02:28.070> little<00:02:28.370> shapes<00:02:28.760> of<00:02:29.000> course<00:02:29.330> you

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
make your little shapes of course you

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.720 
make your little shapes of course you
want<00:02:30.320> to<00:02:30.440> bake<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:30.590> until<00:02:30.860> it's<00:02:31.190> kind<00:02:31.430> of<00:02:31.490> like

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
want to bake it until it's kind of like

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.370 
want to bake it until it's kind of like
golden-brown<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:32.810> when<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:32.990> touch<00:02:33.170> the

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
golden-brown and when you touch the

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.210 
golden-brown and when you touch the
cookies<00:02:33.710> they<00:02:33.860> feel<00:02:34.130> firm<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:36.010> then<00:02:37.010> you're

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
cookies they feel firm and then you're

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.090 
cookies they feel firm and then you're
gonna<00:02:37.310> let<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:37.580> bowl<00:02:37.760> cool<00:02:38.180> completely<00:02:39.100> once

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
gonna let the bowl cool completely once

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.580 
gonna let the bowl cool completely once

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
it's cooled completely you can remove

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.230 
it's cooled completely you can remove
the<00:02:42.860> bowl<00:02:43.190> underneath<00:02:43.490> it<00:02:43.730> just<00:02:43.760> just<00:02:44.030> pop

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
the bowl underneath it just just pop

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.380 
the bowl underneath it just just pop
right<00:02:44.270> out<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:45.400> then<00:02:46.400> remove<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.940> aluminum

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
foil and the aluminum foil released very

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.180 
foil and the aluminum foil released very
easily<00:02:50.690> as<00:02:51.080> well<00:02:53.080> now<00:02:54.080> if<00:02:54.230> you<00:02:54.320> under<00:02:54.650> bake<00:02:54.920> the

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
easily as well now if you under bake the

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.530 
easily as well now if you under bake the
bowl<00:02:55.370> you'll<00:02:55.640> find<00:02:56.000> that<00:02:56.180> some<00:02:56.360> of<00:02:56.390> the

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
bowl you'll find that some of the

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.050 
bowl you'll find that some of the
cookies<00:02:56.870> in<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.170> center<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:57.770> the<00:02:58.430> inside<00:02:58.790> may

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
cookies in the center and the inside may

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.940 
cookies in the center and the inside may
be<00:02:59.120> a<00:02:59.270> little<00:02:59.510> undercooked<00:02:59.900> mine<00:03:00.230> was<00:03:00.530> perfect

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
be a little undercooked mine was perfect

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.920 
be a little undercooked mine was perfect
though<00:03:01.130> I<00:03:01.370> found<00:03:01.970> all<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.300> cookies<00:03:02.570> to<00:03:02.780> be

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
though I found all the cookies to be

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.990 
though I found all the cookies to be
cooked<00:03:03.680> but<00:03:03.890> not<00:03:04.040> overcooked

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
cooked but not overcooked

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.910 
cooked but not overcooked
now<00:03:05.570> if<00:03:05.990> you'll<00:03:06.170> know<00:03:06.350> what<00:03:06.470> I<00:03:06.530> mean<00:03:06.560> by<00:03:06.890> that

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
now if you'll know what I mean by that

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.610 
now if you'll know what I mean by that
edge<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:08.330> edge<00:03:08.360> didn't<00:03:08.900> turn<00:03:09.050> out<00:03:09.200> as<00:03:09.260> pretty

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
edge the edge didn't turn out as pretty

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.140 
edge the edge didn't turn out as pretty
as<00:03:09.770> I<00:03:09.890> would<00:03:10.010> like<00:03:10.190> it<00:03:10.370> it's<00:03:10.520> all<00:03:10.730> those<00:03:10.880> flower

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
as I would like it it's all those flower

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.120 
as I would like it it's all those flower
petals<00:03:11.660> that<00:03:11.840> I<00:03:11.870> stuck<00:03:12.260> on<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:12.470> edge<00:03:12.620> they

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
petals that I stuck on the edge they

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.980 
petals that I stuck on the edge they
folded<00:03:13.640> a<00:03:13.730> little<00:03:13.940> bit<00:03:14.060> as<00:03:14.240> they<00:03:14.450> were<00:03:14.510> baking

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
folded a little bit as they were baking

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.630 
folded a little bit as they were baking
because<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.710> dough<00:03:15.860> has<00:03:16.040> a<00:03:16.070> tendency<00:03:16.520> to

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
because the dough has a tendency to

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.880 
because the dough has a tendency to
slide<00:03:16.850> down<00:03:17.240> a<00:03:17.270> little<00:03:17.600> a<00:03:17.840> little<00:03:18.320> bit<00:03:18.530> on<00:03:18.710> the

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
slide down a little a little bit on the

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.550 
slide down a little a little bit on the
bowl<00:03:19.040> while<00:03:19.340> it's<00:03:19.550> baking<00:03:19.790> but<00:03:20.720> overall<00:03:21.080> I<00:03:21.440> was

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
bowl while it's baking but overall I was

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.880 
bowl while it's baking but overall I was
happy<00:03:21.860> with<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.040> result<00:03:22.490> and<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:24.560> serve<00:03:24.710> the

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
happy with the result and to serve the

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.450 
happy with the result and to serve the
cookies<00:03:25.220> in<00:03:25.370> it<00:03:25.550> I<00:03:25.700> decided<00:03:26.090> to<00:03:26.360> put<00:03:26.540> a

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:27.460
