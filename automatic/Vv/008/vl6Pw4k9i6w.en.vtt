think to do that they should incentivize
rating<00:01:04.710> with<00:01:05.220> year<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.670> their<00:01:05.939> cuesta<00:01:06.540> fying

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
not not blown away I mean it looked

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.229 
not not blown away I mean it looked
better<00:03:49.440> than<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.800> year<00:03:50.100> one<00:03:50.310> strike<00:03:50.670> certainly

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
better than a year one strike certainly

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.810 
better than a year one strike certainly
but<00:03:51.900> not<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:52.500> know<00:03:52.620> crazy<00:03:52.860> impressive<00:03:53.580> I

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
but not you know crazy impressive I

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.210 
but not you know crazy impressive I
think<00:03:54.450> that<00:03:55.140> they<00:03:55.230> really<00:03:55.590> have<00:03:55.860> to<00:03:56.010> come

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
think that they really have to come

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.710 
think that they really have to come
ready<00:03:56.550> to<00:03:56.610> play<00:03:56.820> with<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.209> other<00:03:57.360> strikes

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
we're also getting remixed strikes which

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.100 
we're also getting remixed strikes which
means<00:03:59.670> original<00:04:00.239> year<00:04:00.420> one<00:04:00.600> strikes<00:04:00.930> have

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
means original year one strikes have

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.840 
means original year one strikes have
been<00:04:01.140> remixed<00:04:01.890> with<00:04:01.950> taken<00:04:02.340> enemies<00:04:02.640> and

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
been remixed with taken enemies and

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.250 
been remixed with taken enemies and
maybe<00:04:03.000> some<00:04:03.239> new<00:04:03.390> little<00:04:03.660> mechanics<00:04:04.110> and

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
maybe some new little mechanics and

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.470 
maybe some new little mechanics and
changes<00:04:04.650> I<00:04:04.800> look<00:04:05.370> forward<00:04:05.580> to<00:04:05.760> that<00:04:05.790> but<00:04:06.360> it

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
changes I look forward to that but it

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.660 
changes I look forward to that but it
all<00:04:06.570> comes<00:04:06.959> down<00:04:07.170> to<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:07.739> rewards<00:04:08.220> right<00:04:08.459> if

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
all comes down to the rewards right if

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.690 
all comes down to the rewards right if
there<00:04:09.120> is<00:04:09.150> no<00:04:09.239> reason<00:04:09.989> to<00:04:10.230> run<00:04:10.709> it<00:04:10.860> people

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
there is no reason to run it people

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.759 
there is no reason to run it people
aren't<00:04:11.940> going<00:04:12.239> to<00:04:12.390> do<00:04:12.840> it<00:04:12.870> I<00:04:13.110> think<00:04:13.320> strikes

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
aren't going to do it I think strikes

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.470 
aren't going to do it I think strikes
are<00:04:13.920> real<00:04:14.130> fun<00:04:14.400> she'll<00:04:14.700> activity<00:04:15.150> you<00:04:15.239> put<00:04:15.390> on

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
are real fun she'll activity you put on

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.610 
are real fun she'll activity you put on
music<00:04:15.600> you<00:04:15.840> don't<00:04:15.989> really<00:04:16.140> have<00:04:16.290> to<00:04:16.380> think

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
music you don't really have to think

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.080 
music you don't really have to think
they're<00:04:16.859> relaxed<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.459> they're<00:04:17.669> a<00:04:17.700> good<00:04:17.880> time

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
they're relaxed and they're a good time

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.680 
they're relaxed and they're a good time
but<00:04:19.019> I<00:04:19.350> think<00:04:19.950> they<00:04:20.040> could<00:04:20.190> be<00:04:20.220> so<00:04:20.700> so<00:04:21.060> so<00:04:21.390> much

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
but I think they could be so so so much

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.020 
but I think they could be so so so much
more<00:04:22.140> than<00:04:22.919> what<00:04:23.160> they<00:04:23.310> currently<00:04:23.550> are

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
speaking of so much more than what they

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.330 
speaking of so much more than what they
currently

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
currently

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.830 
currently
