restoring<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.710> one<00:01:11.430> flaw<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.180> cube

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
restoring this one flaw that this cube

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.780 
restoring this one flaw that this cube
has<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.409> center's<00:01:13.830> can<00:01:14.100> get<00:01:14.250> twisted

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
has is that the center's can get twisted

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.749 
has is that the center's can get twisted
because<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.200> see<00:01:16.409> here<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.369> sticker

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
because as you can see here the sticker

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.999 
because as you can see here the sticker
is<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.210> straight<00:01:18.810> but<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> center<00:01:19.740> has

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
is on straight but the center has

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.070 
is on straight but the center has
twisted<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:21.210> now<00:01:21.330> I'll<00:01:21.450> show<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.720> some<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
twisted so now I'll show you some of the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.880 
twisted so now I'll show you some of the
mechanism<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.770> this

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.200 

there<00:01:29.890> we<00:01:29.980> go<00:01:30.130> I've<00:01:30.250> taken<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.640> queue<00:01:30.850> apart<00:01:31.180> a

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
there we go I've taken the queue apart a

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.210 
there we go I've taken the queue apart a
little<00:01:31.300> bit<00:01:31.570> and<00:01:31.780> you<00:01:32.410> can<00:01:32.560> really<00:01:32.710> see<00:01:33.040> the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
little bit and you can really see the

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.820 
little bit and you can really see the
internal<00:01:34.000> mechanism<00:01:34.750> you<00:01:35.110> can<00:01:35.290> see<00:01:35.440> all<00:01:35.650> the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
internal mechanism you can see all the

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.830 
internal mechanism you can see all the
pieces<00:01:36.040> in<00:01:36.250> there<00:01:36.580> you<00:01:37.330> can<00:01:37.480> see<00:01:37.510> how<00:01:37.780> the

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
pieces in there you can see how the

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.570 
pieces in there you can see how the
edges<00:01:38.110> and<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:38.530> corners<00:01:38.560> are<00:01:38.950> hooked<00:01:39.370> in

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
edges and the corners are hooked in

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.090 
edges and the corners are hooked in
there<00:01:39.850> way<00:01:40.120> down<00:01:40.330> in<00:01:40.540> there<00:01:40.690> just<00:01:41.530> like<00:01:41.800> on

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
there way down in there just like on

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.330 
there way down in there just like on

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
the middle pieces middle edges Center

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.670 
the middle pieces middle edges Center
edges<00:01:48.610> here's<00:01:49.210> another<00:01:49.479> one<00:01:49.720> of<00:01:49.750> them<00:01:50.020> and

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
edges here's another one of them and

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.680 
edges here's another one of them and
here's<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.070> third<00:01:51.340> one<00:01:51.580> you<00:01:51.880> can<00:01:52.330> see<00:01:52.479> if<00:01:52.570> the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
here's the third one you can see if the

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.200 
here's the third one you can see if the
pieces<00:01:52.900> look<00:01:53.260> actually<00:01:53.680> quite<00:01:54.010> weird<00:01:54.370> on<00:01:54.700> this

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
pieces look actually quite weird on this

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.810 
pieces look actually quite weird on this
piece<00:01:55.540> this<00:01:55.990> is<00:01:56.050> completely<00:01:56.710> flat<00:01:57.160> except<00:01:57.670> for

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
piece this is completely flat except for

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.270 
piece this is completely flat except for
this<00:01:57.940> part<00:01:58.330> and<00:01:58.900> this<00:01:59.380> part<00:01:59.500> here<00:01:59.920> we've<00:02:00.040> got<00:02:00.220> a

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
this part and this part here we've got a

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.020 
this part and this part here we've got a
very<00:02:00.759> big<00:02:01.240> center<00:02:02.170> piece<00:02:02.580> looks<00:02:03.580> like<00:02:03.759> this

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
very big center piece looks like this

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.870 
very big center piece looks like this
it's<00:02:04.479> got<00:02:04.660> the<00:02:04.810> little<00:02:04.930> pegs<00:02:05.430> this<00:02:06.430> is<00:02:06.640> very

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
it's got the little pegs this is very

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.150 
it's got the little pegs this is very
big<00:02:07.180> there's<00:02:07.810> a<00:02:07.930> lot<00:02:08.080> of<00:02:08.170> black<00:02:08.380> part<00:02:08.740> here<00:02:09.040> are

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
big there's a lot of black part here are

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.889 
big there's a lot of black part here are
the<00:02:09.310> three<00:02:09.580> edges<00:02:09.729> that<00:02:10.060> fit<00:02:10.240> together<00:02:10.360> this

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
the three edges that fit together this

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.040 
the three edges that fit together this
is<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:11.260> longest<00:02:11.740> one<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:13.360> can<00:02:13.540> see<00:02:13.750> how<00:02:13.870> these

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
is the longest one you can see how these

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.930 
is the longest one you can see how these
all<00:02:14.110> fit<00:02:14.830> together<00:02:15.190> very<00:02:17.520> interesting<00:02:18.520> so

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
all fit together very interesting so

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:19.860 
all fit together very interesting so
that's<00:02:19.060> all<00:02:19.180> I'm<00:02:19.270> gonna<00:02:19.390> show<00:02:19.480> you<00:02:19.720> the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
that's all I'm gonna show you the

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.600 
that's all I'm gonna show you the
mechanism<00:02:20.050> there's<00:02:20.770> no<00:02:20.890> way<00:02:21.040> I'm<00:02:21.160> taking<00:02:21.370> this

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
mechanism there's no way I'm taking this

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.340 
mechanism there's no way I'm taking this
entire<00:02:21.820> thing<00:02:22.300> apart<00:02:22.600> because<00:02:23.050> I<00:02:23.200> would<00:02:23.320> just

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
entire thing apart because I would just

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.010 
entire thing apart because I would just
be<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.709> real<00:02:24.190> pain<00:02:24.520> to<00:02:24.580> assemble<00:02:25.270> so<00:02:25.510> for<00:02:25.959> the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
be a real pain to assemble so for the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.920 
be a real pain to assemble so for the
final<00:02:26.380> recommendation<00:02:27.190> maybe<00:02:27.940> if<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:28.630> don't

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
final recommendation maybe if you don't

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.210 
final recommendation maybe if you don't
enjoy<00:02:29.140> big<00:02:29.680> cubes

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
enjoy big cubes

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.430 
enjoy big cubes
you<00:02:30.340> probably<00:02:30.700> shouldn't<00:02:31.300> buy<00:02:31.480> this<00:02:31.540> but<00:02:32.350> if

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
you probably shouldn't buy this but if

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.199 
you probably shouldn't buy this but if
you<00:02:32.590> do<00:02:32.739> enjoy<00:02:32.890> big<00:02:33.280> cubes<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:33.850> you<00:02:33.940> really

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
you do enjoy big cubes and you really

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.790 
you do enjoy big cubes and you really
like<00:02:34.390> shank<00:02:34.720> shell<00:02:34.900> products<00:02:35.350> you<00:02:35.769> should

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
like shank shell products you should

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.280 
like shank shell products you should
really<00:02:36.100> look<00:02:36.310> into<00:02:36.459> this<00:02:36.760> in<00:02:37.300> my<00:02:37.510> opinion<00:02:37.750> this

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
really look into this in my opinion this

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.530 
really look into this in my opinion this
is<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:38.530> best<00:02:38.680> shank<00:02:39.340> shell<00:02:39.580> cube<00:02:39.910> this<00:02:40.360> is

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
is the best shank shell cube this is

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.350 
is the best shank shell cube this is
$100<00:02:41.290> which<00:02:41.470> may<00:02:41.650> seem<00:02:41.709> like<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.280> lot<00:02:42.580> but<00:02:43.060> for<00:02:43.330> a

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
$100 which may seem like a lot but for a

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.390 
$100 which may seem like a lot but for a
cube<00:02:43.660> of<00:02:43.750> such<00:02:44.019> high<00:02:44.230> quality<00:02:44.410> it's<00:02:44.980> actually

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
cube of such high quality it's actually

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.310 
cube of such high quality it's actually
quite<00:02:45.670> reasonable<00:02:45.850> so<00:02:46.750> that's<00:02:46.930> all<00:02:47.080> I<00:02:47.140> gotta

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
quite reasonable so that's all I gotta

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.229 
quite reasonable so that's all I gotta
say<00:02:47.530> on<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.830> shank<00:02:48.040> shown<00:02:48.250> nine<00:02:48.430> by<00:02:48.610> nine<00:02:48.820> so

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
say on the shank shown nine by nine so

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.430 
say on the shank shown nine by nine so
