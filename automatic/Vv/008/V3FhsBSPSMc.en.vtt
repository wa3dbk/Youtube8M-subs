00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
I get started I guess I dislike to say

I get started I guess I dislike to say
that<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:35.970> think<00:00:36.090> multiplex<00:00:36.870> hit<00:00:37.470> a<00:00:37.500> home<00:00:37.680> run

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
with this little plane the fun cub is

with this little plane the fun cub is
just<00:00:40.140> what<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.830> says<00:00:41.040> it's<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.400> lot<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.580> fun<00:00:41.850> it's

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
just what it says it's a lot of fun it's

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.030 
just what it says it's a lot of fun it's
a<00:00:42.510> great<00:00:42.629> plane<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.080> fly<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.559> more<00:00:43.770> packs

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
a great plane to fly and the more packs

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.710 
a great plane to fly and the more packs
I<00:00:44.340> run<00:00:44.610> through<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:44.970> plane<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.510> more<00:00:45.690> I

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
I run through this plane the more I

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.860 
I run through this plane the more I
enjoy<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:46.730> after<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:47.790> picked<00:00:48.030> up<00:00:48.150> this<00:00:48.360> kit<00:00:48.660> the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
enjoy it after I picked up this kit the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.420 
enjoy it after I picked up this kit the
first<00:00:49.110> thing<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.350> did<00:00:49.410> was<00:00:49.680> hop<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
first thing I did was hop on to the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.369 
first thing I did was hop on to the
Internet<00:00:50.790> and<00:00:51.090> see<00:00:51.390> what<00:00:51.720> everybody<00:00:52.050> was

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
Internet and see what everybody was

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.950 
Internet and see what everybody was
using<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.950> their<00:00:53.040> planes<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:54.000> wanted<00:00:54.809> to

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
using in their planes and I wanted to

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.390 
using in their planes and I wanted to
get<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.199> right<00:00:55.350> if<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.650> could<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.010> first<00:00:56.220> time

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
get it right if I could the first time

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.880 
get it right if I could the first time
obviously<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.180> as<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.080> turns<00:00:58.260> out<00:00:58.409> I<00:00:58.470> didn't

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
obviously and as it turns out I didn't

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.220 
obviously and as it turns out I didn't
but<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.640> ended<00:01:00.180> up<00:01:00.239> at<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.510> right<00:01:00.659> place<00:01:00.900> and

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
but I ended up at the right place and

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.140 
but I ended up at the right place and
that's<00:01:01.949> what<00:01:02.190> we're<00:01:02.280> gonna<00:01:02.370> talk<00:01:02.610> about<00:01:02.820> today

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
that's what we're gonna talk about today

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.090 
that's what we're gonna talk about today
well<00:01:03.960> as<00:01:04.050> you<00:01:04.170> can<00:01:04.260> see<00:01:04.409> on<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.620> table<00:01:04.920> here

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
well as you can see on the table here

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.830 
well as you can see on the table here
I've<00:01:05.250> sort<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.640> laid<00:01:05.820> out<00:01:05.850> everything<00:01:06.360> that

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
I've sort of laid out everything that

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.510 
I've sort of laid out everything that
went<00:01:06.960> into<00:01:07.050> this<00:01:07.290> plane<00:01:07.560> aside<00:01:07.950> from<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
went into this plane aside from the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.780 
went into this plane aside from the
motor<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:09.090> originally<00:01:09.930> went<00:01:10.110> with<00:01:10.580> 35:36<00:01:11.580> C

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.719 
motor I originally went with 35:36 C
1100<00:01:12.420> kV<00:01:12.780> motor<00:01:12.990> because<00:01:13.440> I<00:01:13.470> had<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> bunch<00:01:14.580> of

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
1100 kV motor because I had a bunch of

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:15.890 
1100 kV motor because I had a bunch of
them<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.120> turned<00:01:15.300> out<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.570> be<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.780> wrong

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
them and it turned out to be the wrong

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.840 
them and it turned out to be the wrong
choice<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.560> ended<00:01:17.220> up<00:01:17.280> with<00:01:17.460> quite<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.640> bit<00:01:17.700> of

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
choice I ended up with quite a bit of

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.690 
choice I ended up with quite a bit of
vibration<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.690> the<00:01:18.750> motor<00:01:18.960> mounts<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.700> ended

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
vibration and the motor mounts and ended

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.219 
vibration and the motor mounts and ended
up<00:01:20.760> having<00:01:21.120> to<00:01:21.240> add<00:01:21.360> some<00:01:21.630> weight<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.049> tail

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
up having to add some weight to the tail

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.280 
up having to add some weight to the tail
of<00:01:22.440> the<00:01:22.530> plane<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.740> balance<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.370> out<00:01:24.260> so<00:01:25.260> I

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
of the plane to balance it out so I

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.310 
of the plane to balance it out so I
ended<00:01:25.560> up<00:01:25.650> swapping<00:01:26.070> out<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.510> motor<00:01:27.510> for<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.840> 35

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
ended up swapping out the motor for a 35

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.370 
ended up swapping out the motor for a 35

are<00:01:52.770> what<00:01:53.010> I<00:01:53.040> used<00:01:53.700> for<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.210> elevator<00:01:54.960> and

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
are what I used for the elevator and

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.070 
are what I used for the elevator and
rudder<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.520> plane<00:01:56.730> and<00:01:57.030> they're<00:01:57.660> doing<00:01:57.870> a

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
great job back there I'm not sure if

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.250 
great job back there I'm not sure if
they're<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.060> bit<00:02:00.240> overkill<00:02:00.630> or<00:02:00.690> not<00:02:00.930> but<00:02:01.140> they

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
they're a bit overkill or not but they

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.980 
they're a bit overkill or not but they
work<00:02:01.440> great<00:02:01.730> here<00:02:02.730> we<00:02:02.880> show<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.120> ubiquitous

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
work great here we show the ubiquitous

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.850 
work great here we show the ubiquitous
hexatronic<00:02:05.360> 9<00:02:06.360> gram<00:02:06.630> servos<00:02:07.170> for<00:02:07.200> two<00:02:07.560> dollars

hexatronic 9 gram servos for two dollars

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.969 
hexatronic 9 gram servos for two dollars
and<00:02:08.039> 69<00:02:08.519> cents<00:02:09.050> they're<00:02:10.050> doing<00:02:10.319> yeoman<00:02:10.679> duty

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
and 69 cents they're doing yeoman duty

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.220 
and 69 cents they're doing yeoman duty
and<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.430> for<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.120> ailerons<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.660> flaps<00:02:12.989> they

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
and the for the ailerons and flaps they

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.400 
and the for the ailerons and flaps they
work<00:02:13.410> great<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:14.390> I'm<00:02:15.390> still<00:02:15.720> going<00:02:16.290> ahead

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
work great and I'm still going ahead

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.580 
work great and I'm still going ahead
with<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:17.129> cheap<00:02:17.760> spectrum<00:02:18.629> clone<00:02:18.930> receiver

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
with the cheap spectrum clone receiver

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.350 
with the cheap spectrum clone receiver
out<00:02:19.620> of<00:02:19.739> hobbyking<00:02:20.370> they've<00:02:20.940> lowered<00:02:21.209> the

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
out of hobbyking they've lowered the

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.410 
out of hobbyking they've lowered the
price<00:02:21.569> now<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.840> $6.99<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:22.950> just<00:02:23.640> can't<00:02:23.909> I

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
price now to $6.99 so I just can't I

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.570 
price now to $6.99 so I just can't I
just<00:02:24.840> can't<00:02:25.230> not<00:02:25.440> use<00:02:25.709> these<00:02:25.980> they<00:02:26.190> work<00:02:26.340> so

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
just can't not use these they work so

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.050 
just can't not use these they work so
great<00:02:27.620> no<00:02:28.620> issues<00:02:28.980> with<00:02:29.400> any<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.819> planes

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
great no issues with any of the planes

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.020 
great no issues with any of the planes
so<00:02:30.269> far<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.840> no<00:02:31.170> reason<00:02:31.350> to<00:02:31.740> look<00:02:31.920> back<00:02:32.130> so

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
so far and no reason to look back so

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.050 
so far and no reason to look back so
this<00:02:33.270> is<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:34.740> ESC<00:02:35.250> that<00:02:35.430> I<00:02:35.460> used<00:02:35.760> in<00:02:35.970> the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
this is the the ESC that I used in the

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.550 
this is the the ESC that I used in the
plane

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
plane

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.220 
plane
I<00:02:36.590> had<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:36.860> whole<00:02:37.190> bunch<00:02:37.459> of<00:02:37.730> them<00:02:37.940> at<00:02:38.090> 60<00:02:38.690> amps

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
I had a whole bunch of them at 60 amps

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.140 
I had a whole bunch of them at 60 amps
it's<00:02:39.500> way<00:02:39.800> overkill<00:02:40.400> as<00:02:40.610> you'll<00:02:40.790> see<00:02:40.970> later

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
it's way overkill as you'll see later

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.900 
it's way overkill as you'll see later
when<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:41.450> show<00:02:41.750> you<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:42.170> app<00:02:42.319> readings<00:02:42.830> but<00:02:43.550> I

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
when I show you the app readings but I

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.430 
when I show you the app readings but I
had<00:02:44.209> a<00:02:44.239> whole<00:02:44.450> whack<00:02:44.660> of<00:02:44.690> them<00:02:44.989> and<00:02:45.140> when<00:02:45.260> I<00:02:45.290> do

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
had a whole whack of them and when I do

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.550 
had a whole whack of them and when I do
get<00:02:45.739> some<00:02:46.120> 40s<00:02:47.120> in<00:02:47.360> I'm<00:02:47.750> going<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.260> probably

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
get some 40s in I'm going to probably

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.880 
get some 40s in I'm going to probably
swap<00:02:48.950> it<00:02:49.130> out<00:02:49.250> for<00:02:49.630> four<00:02:50.630> or<00:02:50.720> 40<00:02:51.080> and<00:02:51.260> then

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
swap it out for four or 40 and then

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.830 
swap it out for four or 40 and then
using<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.550> turnigy<00:02:53.560> 2.2<00:02:54.880> 3s<00:02:55.880> battery<00:02:56.630> which

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
using the turnigy 2.2 3s battery which

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.759 
using the turnigy 2.2 3s battery which
is<00:02:56.870> a<00:02:57.110> perfect<00:02:57.739> fit<00:02:57.920> into<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.400> fuselage<00:02:59.769> when

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
is a perfect fit into the fuselage when

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.620 
is a perfect fit into the fuselage when
I<00:03:00.800> test<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.370> for<00:03:01.550> center<00:03:01.849> of<00:03:01.940> gravity<00:03:02.330> I<00:03:02.360> found

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
I test it for center of gravity I found

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:03.699 
I test it for center of gravity I found
that<00:03:02.720> it<00:03:02.840> was<00:03:02.930> necessary<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.470> push<00:03:03.680> the

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
that it was necessary to push the

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.680 
that it was necessary to push the
battery<00:03:04.010> all<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.580> way<00:03:04.700> back<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.209> opening

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
battery all the way back to the opening

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.660 
battery all the way back to the opening
in<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:05.930> back<00:03:06.080> of<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.349> fuselage<00:03:06.800> this<00:03:07.430> makes

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
in the back of the fuselage this makes

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.610 
in the back of the fuselage this makes
it<00:03:07.819> hard<00:03:08.030> to<00:03:08.090> strap<00:03:08.480> it<00:03:08.660> down<00:03:08.690> and<00:03:08.870> secure<00:03:09.470> it

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
it hard to strap it down and secure it

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.789 
it hard to strap it down and secure it
so<00:03:09.830> I<00:03:10.160> just<00:03:10.630> created<00:03:11.630> a<00:03:11.750> loop<00:03:11.989> part<00:03:12.200> of<00:03:12.380> velcro

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
so I just created a loop part of velcro

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.890 
so I just created a loop part of velcro
that<00:03:13.400> snugly<00:03:13.880> fits<00:03:14.090> around<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:14.390> battery<00:03:14.810> and

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
that snugly fits around the battery and

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.930 
that snugly fits around the battery and
as<00:03:15.019> you<00:03:15.140> can<00:03:15.260> see<00:03:15.470> it<00:03:15.590> slides<00:03:15.890> in<00:03:16.250> and<00:03:16.280> then

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
as you can see it slides in and then

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.490 
as you can see it slides in and then
what<00:03:17.120> I've<00:03:17.209> done<00:03:17.360> is<00:03:17.480> I've<00:03:17.630> taken<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:18.019> block<00:03:18.290> of

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
what I've done is I've taken a block of

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.710 
what I've done is I've taken a block of
foam<00:03:18.739> with<00:03:19.489> Velcro<00:03:19.940> on<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.180> bottom<00:03:20.510> and

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
foam with Velcro on the bottom and

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.479 
foam with Velcro on the bottom and
you'll<00:03:21.080> see<00:03:21.290> that<00:03:21.440> little<00:03:21.620> blue<00:03:21.830> velcro<00:03:22.310> there

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
you'll see that little blue velcro there

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.789 
you'll see that little blue velcro there
in<00:03:22.580> the<00:03:22.670> fuse<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.630> block<00:03:23.840> simply<00:03:24.319> sits<00:03:24.590> in

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
in the fuse and the block simply sits in

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.100 
in the fuse and the block simply sits in
front<00:03:25.040> of<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.430> battery<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:26.569> prevents<00:03:26.959> it

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
front of the battery and prevents it

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.320 
front of the battery and prevents it
from<00:03:27.230> moving<00:03:27.590> forward<00:03:28.190> that<00:03:28.849> between<00:03:29.120> the

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
from moving forward that between the

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.170 
from moving forward that between the
fuse<00:03:29.599> the<00:03:29.840> deans<00:03:30.049> plug<00:03:30.410> and<00:03:30.799> the<00:03:31.610> little<00:03:31.970> block

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
fuse the deans plug and the little block

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.150 
fuse the deans plug and the little block
of<00:03:32.209> foam<00:03:32.599> the<00:03:32.959> battery<00:03:33.290> doesn't<00:03:33.590> go<00:03:33.739> anywhere

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
of foam the battery doesn't go anywhere

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.280 
of foam the battery doesn't go anywhere
and<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.880> center<00:03:35.150> of<00:03:35.209> gravity<00:03:35.330> is<00:03:35.780> spot-on

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.190 

although<00:03:39.290> I'd<00:03:39.440> prefer<00:03:39.950> a<00:03:40.130> more<00:03:40.310> secure<00:03:40.730> way<00:03:40.880> of

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
although I'd prefer a more secure way of

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.810 
although I'd prefer a more secure way of
strapping<00:03:42.200> down<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:42.530> battery<00:03:42.980> this<00:03:43.310> this

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
strapping down the battery this this

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.220 
strapping down the battery this this
works<00:03:44.030> quite<00:03:44.269> well<00:03:44.299> and<00:03:44.570> hasn't<00:03:44.720> caused<00:03:45.049> any

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
works quite well and hasn't caused any

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.199 
works quite well and hasn't caused any
problems<00:03:45.320> at<00:03:45.799> all<00:03:45.890> it's<00:03:46.760> really<00:03:46.940> nice

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
problems at all it's really nice

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.759

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.259 
of the aircraft and this little hatch
design<00:03:51.620> that<00:03:51.859> multiplex<00:03:52.519> has<00:03:52.730> come<00:03:52.940> up<00:03:53.060> with

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
design that multiplex has come up with

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.509 
design that multiplex has come up with
is<00:03:53.480> is<00:03:53.750> very<00:03:54.200> good<00:03:54.410> it's<00:03:55.040> a<00:03:55.130> very<00:03:55.160> positive

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
is is very good it's a very positive

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.420 
is is very good it's a very positive
catch<00:03:56.060> and<00:03:56.829> actually<00:03:57.829> I<00:03:57.859> quite<00:03:58.040> preferred

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
catch and actually I quite preferred

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.030 
catch and actually I quite preferred
over<00:03:58.609> the<00:03:58.790> magnet<00:03:59.359> approach<00:03:59.780> there's<00:04:00.739> just<00:04:00.920> no

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
over the magnet approach there's just no

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.140 
over the magnet approach there's just no
way<00:04:01.160> that<00:04:01.190> this<00:04:01.430> canopy<00:04:01.700> is<00:04:01.850> going<00:04:02.000> to<00:04:02.060> go

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
way that this canopy is going to go

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.690 
way that this canopy is going to go
anywhere<00:04:02.239> one<00:04:03.140> thing<00:04:03.350> I'm<00:04:03.500> sure<00:04:03.890> of<00:04:04.340> pointing

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
anywhere one thing I'm sure of pointing

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.300 
anywhere one thing I'm sure of pointing
out<00:04:04.790> here<00:04:05.150> is<00:04:05.180> that<00:04:05.329> as<00:04:05.720> you<00:04:06.380> cut<00:04:06.769> the<00:04:06.889> decals

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
out here is that as you cut the decals

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.160 
out here is that as you cut the decals
after<00:04:07.970> they're<00:04:08.150> applied<00:04:08.450> and<00:04:08.840> you<00:04:08.959> have<00:04:09.049> to

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
after they're applied and you have to

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.900 
after they're applied and you have to
cut<00:04:09.350> them<00:04:09.500> away<00:04:09.739> to<00:04:09.799> be<00:04:10.190> able<00:04:10.250> to<00:04:10.459> remove<00:04:10.730> the

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
cut them away to be able to remove the

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.840 
cut them away to be able to remove the
hatch<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:12.079> edges<00:04:12.799> of<00:04:12.950> the<00:04:13.069> decals<00:04:13.430> tend<00:04:13.700> to

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
hatch the edges of the decals tend to

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.449 
hatch the edges of the decals tend to
lift<00:04:14.030> and<00:04:14.359> sort<00:04:14.660> of<00:04:14.720> the<00:04:14.810> little<00:04:15.019> trick<00:04:15.319> is<00:04:15.859> to

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
lift and sort of the little trick is to

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.680 
lift and sort of the little trick is to
take<00:04:16.669> the<00:04:17.510> surplus<00:04:18.049> clear<00:04:19.030> deco<00:04:20.030> material

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
take the surplus clear deco material

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.290 
take the surplus clear deco material
that's<00:04:20.900> on<00:04:21.049> the<00:04:21.200> big<00:04:21.380> decals<00:04:21.889> sheet<00:04:22.130> and<00:04:22.400> trim

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
that's on the big decals sheet and trim

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.080 
that's on the big decals sheet and trim
it<00:04:23.419> and<00:04:23.600> use<00:04:23.900> it<00:04:23.930> to<00:04:24.139> overlap<00:04:24.979> the<00:04:25.400> deckle<00:04:25.820> and

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
it and use it to overlap the deckle and

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.050 
it and use it to overlap the deckle and
into<00:04:26.630> the<00:04:26.750> areas<00:04:27.350> of<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:27.530> fuse<00:04:27.800> that<00:04:28.010> you<00:04:28.190> made

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
into the areas of the fuse that you made

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.940 
into the areas of the fuse that you made
the<00:04:29.210> cuts<00:04:29.419> into<00:04:29.810> so<00:04:30.050> it<00:04:30.229> holds<00:04:30.380> it<00:04:30.530> very<00:04:30.800> well

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
the cuts into so it holds it very well

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.080 
the cuts into so it holds it very well
just<00:04:31.850> a<00:04:31.970> little<00:04:32.180> tip<00:04:32.330> there<00:04:33.729> okay<00:04:34.729> this<00:04:34.940> is

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
just a little tip there okay this is

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.670 
just a little tip there okay this is
just<00:04:35.240> a<00:04:35.360> quick<00:04:35.720> look<00:04:35.900> underneath<00:04:36.229> the<00:04:36.530> wing

just a quick look underneath the wing

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.770 
just a quick look underneath the wing
just<00:04:37.280> to<00:04:37.460> show<00:04:37.639> you<00:04:37.700> that<00:04:37.789> I<00:04:37.970> used<00:04:38.180> white<00:04:38.510> and

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
just to show you that I used white and

at a hole in the bottom of the fuse

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.080 
at a hole in the bottom of the fuse
where<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.200> receiver<00:04:54.500> lives<00:04:54.860> in<00:04:55.100> case<00:04:55.880> you<00:04:56.000> are

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
where the receiver lives in case you are

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.540 
where the receiver lives in case you are
wondering<00:04:56.150> where<00:04:56.570> it<00:04:56.720> ended<00:04:57.020> up<00:04:57.169> and<00:04:57.550> this

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
wondering where it ended up and this

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.330 
wondering where it ended up and this
next<00:04:58.880> segment<00:04:59.060> I'm<00:04:59.540> going<00:05:00.260> to<00:05:00.500> share<00:05:00.919> with<00:05:01.100> you

the<00:05:01.790> results<00:05:02.270> of<00:05:02.450> the<00:05:03.110> test<00:05:03.350> when<00:05:03.680> I<00:05:04.150> was

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
the results of the test when I was

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.640 
the results of the test when I was
wondering<00:05:05.480> what<00:05:05.630> kind<00:05:05.840> of<00:05:05.900> amps<00:05:06.290> and<00:05:06.410> watts

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
wondering what kind of amps and watts

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.140 
wondering what kind of amps and watts
this<00:05:07.040> little<00:05:07.540> 36<00:05:08.540> 30<00:05:08.900> C<00:05:09.590> 1100<00:05:10.220> kV<00:05:10.550> motor<00:05:10.850> pulled

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.070 
this little 36 30 C 1100 kV motor pulled
when<00:05:11.840> it<00:05:12.020> swung<00:05:12.320> a<00:05:12.380> 13<00:05:13.340> by<00:05:13.370> 4<00:05:13.520> prop<00:05:13.970> so<00:05:14.660> I'm

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
when it swung a 13 by 4 prop so I'm

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.500 
when it swung a 13 by 4 prop so I'm
going<00:05:15.440> to<00:05:15.740> let<00:05:16.280> the<00:05:16.520> test<00:05:16.850> speak<00:05:17.150> for<00:05:17.389> itself

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
going to let the test speak for itself

00:05:17.510 --> 00:06:31.469 
going to let the test speak for itself
and<00:05:17.900> here<00:05:18.410> we<00:05:18.500> go

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:33.820 

so<00:06:32.479> as<00:06:32.629> you<00:06:32.749> can<00:06:32.899> see<00:06:33.049> from<00:06:33.199> this<00:06:33.349> little<00:06:33.499> test

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
so as you can see from this little test

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.619 
so as you can see from this little test
it's<00:06:34.249> it's<00:06:34.729> pretty<00:06:34.909> impressive<00:06:35.179> little

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:35.629 
it's it's pretty impressive little

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:37.929 
it's it's pretty impressive little
combination<00:06:35.899> in<00:06:36.349> terms<00:06:36.559> of<00:06:36.799> the<00:06:37.039> very<00:06:37.729> little

00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:37.939 
combination in terms of the very little

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:41.109 
combination in terms of the very little
amount<00:06:38.269> of<00:06:38.389> power<00:06:38.959> it's<00:06:39.259> using<00:06:39.649> at<00:06:40.249> its<00:06:40.669> normal

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:41.119 
amount of power it's using at its normal

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:45.339 
amount of power it's using at its normal
rpm<00:06:41.889> having<00:06:42.889> said<00:06:43.129> that<00:06:43.159> you<00:06:43.959> throw<00:06:44.959> the<00:06:45.110> stick

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:45.349 
rpm having said that you throw the stick

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:48.279 
rpm having said that you throw the stick
forward<00:06:45.679> and<00:06:46.099> this<00:06:46.879> plane<00:06:47.149> will<00:06:47.329> act<00:06:47.899> very

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:48.289 
forward and this plane will act very

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:49.869 
forward and this plane will act very
much<00:06:48.409> like<00:06:48.529> a<00:06:48.679> sport<00:06:49.039> plane<00:06:49.249> and<00:06:49.549> here's<00:06:49.819> a

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:49.879 
much like a sport plane and here's a

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:52.329 
much like a sport plane and here's a
knife<00:06:50.149> nice<00:06:50.629> little<00:06:50.959> knife<00:06:51.439> edge<00:06:51.649> to<00:06:51.860> prove<00:06:52.069> it

00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:52.339 
knife nice little knife edge to prove it

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:55.509 
knife nice little knife edge to prove it
so<00:06:53.139> what<00:06:54.139> a<00:06:54.169> great<00:06:54.829> all-around<00:06:55.039> little
