00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.420
 the cores with another gameplay 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.279
 comments our I today 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.020
 small team with it on the website for 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.759
 you a map so not so often on 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.680
 I do not see it like this on a canal 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:24.450
 But I really like it here 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.040
 now a lived on her plays and 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.650
 use this time for this 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.210
 comments yes to the comment I have 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.070
 actually a very interesting topic 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.510
 brought with me as I think you have 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.930
 It already read in the comments to 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.199
 or in the video description of his like that 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:43.589
 namely black ops 2 is the most important 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.839
 cod of all time because yes I say so 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:48.720
 at the age of 43, there were a lot of people 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.430
 disappointed me so understood that 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.620
 was really a flop for me and me 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.360
 think of it as generally considered as well 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.129
 flop yes they are still a few 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.500
 people as isolated design is the game 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.570
 really well accepted but still me 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.460
 think this is the game on the whole 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.860
 rather than flop and therefore 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.600
 I think this is black ops 2 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.369
 more important than ever before we now 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.890
 still such a misfire he comes in the 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.080
 community completely bad then arrives 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.960
 it could be that there are with cod 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.920
 they do not happen that way anymore 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.810
 really have many people on 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.110
 Battlefield 3 lost that's clear 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.500
 because among other things and 43 stop like 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.150
 in many people their eyes and yes so 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.470
 so if there are more people now 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.450
 So go away I'm sure no 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:36.510
 third year black ops can leads it yes 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.520
 be playing before two and so too 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.960
 only 23 are waiting for the release that 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.810
 we waste very quickly because the people 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.640
 even if they are a little less 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.080
 as at the time where black ops still yes 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.540
 ensures deep warm season but still 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.600
 yes I think there is really important 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.780
 for activision because it stands now too 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.970
 a new quasi game in front of the door and 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.080
 Although respawn entertainment makes synonymous yes 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.940
 Your game 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.340
 that's almost the old in shape 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.890
 Developers and they will be safe 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.610
 to do something in the cod 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.560
 So, there is definitely one 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.450
 even a cod clown if you can say it 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.260
 can actually cod developed why 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.209
 should 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.060
 I can not say clown but still 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.250
 Maybe that's the ratio 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.900
 will surely cod artikels come see 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.519
 so 100 percent and therefore cod 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.010
 also get much more competition 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.110
 Above all, this is the first shooter 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.030
 you really compare commission 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.069
 because honestly you can battlefield 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.409
 100 with cod compare is complete 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.390
 other means of as well though 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:44.099
 again a small map shooter 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.349
 comes with weapons and they have yes 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.599
 quasi cod also invented the virus cod 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.340
 evolve, so to speak 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.690
 then bring her game out 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.250
 the game will definitely be tough 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.790
 competition for activision that's all 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.639
 clear 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.440
 and therefore I think that too 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.510
 competition will be much stronger and 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.280
 that bentley go2 really falls is 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.980
 There would be a lot more people 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.019
 remove from cod and no longer on the 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.599
 then watch the next cd title and thus 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.310
 he is really very many at cod 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.379
 I lose time and think of customers 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.030
 Therefore, I see that at the moment as 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.590
 would black ops 2 be a very important one 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.299
 title and therefore is also the 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.459
 expectations that I put in play-off 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.769
 pretty high you can write 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.449
 as you can find out so cod is black 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.549
 ops was now a me quasi a theory 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:29.040
 like everything else for you all of us 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.060
 title before or you also see so 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.919
 playoffs was really one now 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.169
 key game that's really important 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:38.370
 is for the series and has 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:42.629
 just has to be good so really must 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.949
 and yes, I'm very curious how 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.480
 that would now I think so too 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:47.310
 coach circle about it and the 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.169
 will certainly have tried everything 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.669
 to the best possible cod go to 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:52.709
 We can decide if it will be enough in the end 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.760
 then in november you can see her 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.889
 Write is your expectations 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.379
 tall or are now rather small after that 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.690
 field of 943 can of course also at 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.879
 but I am with them 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.449
 the expectations are higher or more or less 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.919
 must be better otherwise monument 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:10.109
 is advised by a tainment who many 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:11.909
 pull away the gameplay the customer is now 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.159
 already as good as over the 1.2 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:15.930
 or 27 0 because the body just is not 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.750
 hewn purely you know yes the 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.250
 website then get along well shopper 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.870
 getting it done is relatively difficult and me 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.310
 I also have a round trip there 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.810
 but now good gameplay pops by 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.810
 fallen to the next time charlie
