in contact with my shin to the front of

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.039 
in contact with my shin to the front of
the<00:03:41.069> boot<00:03:41.220> that's<00:03:41.879> gonna<00:03:42.030> let<00:03:42.299> me<00:03:42.450> know<00:03:42.690> that<00:03:42.720> I

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
the boot that's gonna let me know that I

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.750 
the boot that's gonna let me know that I
have<00:03:43.260> access<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:44.040> ability<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.340> turn<00:03:44.580> my

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
have access to the ability to turn my

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.640 
have access to the ability to turn my
legs<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.180> tip<00:03:45.360> my<00:03:45.510> feet<00:03:45.750> so<00:03:46.080> much<00:03:46.230> as<00:03:46.349> I<00:03:46.470> need

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
legs and tip my feet so much as I need

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.339 
legs and tip my feet so much as I need
to<00:03:46.819> this<00:03:47.819> simulates<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.690> feeling<00:03:49.110> what<00:03:49.260> the

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
to this simulates the feeling what the

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.080 
to this simulates the feeling what the
bumps<00:03:49.530> are<00:03:49.739> gonna<00:03:49.890> do<00:03:50.129> to<00:03:50.310> me<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.549> the<00:03:50.909> thing

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
bumps are gonna do to me and the thing

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.729 
bumps are gonna do to me and the thing
is<00:03:51.180> I'm<00:03:51.390> going<00:03:51.629> need<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:51.900> do<00:03:52.019> to<00:03:52.140> recover<00:03:52.470> as<00:03:52.620> I

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
is I'm going need to do to recover as I

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.080 
is I'm going need to do to recover as I
get<00:03:54.950> now<00:03:55.950> let's<00:03:55.980> take<00:03:56.370> this<00:03:56.489> into<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.760> bumps

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
get now let's take this into the bumps

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.850 
get now let's take this into the bumps
just<00:03:57.720> like<00:03:57.900> we<00:03:58.019> did<00:03:58.140> on<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.349> green<00:03:58.560> terrain

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
just like we did on the green terrain

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.710 
just like we did on the green terrain
we're<00:03:59.010> going<00:03:59.190> to<00:03:59.280> traverse<00:03:59.489> some<00:03:59.970> bumps<00:04:00.269> but

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
we're going to traverse some bumps but

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.780 
we're going to traverse some bumps but
I'm<00:04:00.810> not<00:04:01.019> gonna<00:04:01.230> need<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.980> push<00:04:02.159> my<00:04:02.400> feet<00:04:02.579> back

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
I'm not gonna need to push my feet back

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.729 
I'm not gonna need to push my feet back
and<00:04:02.819> forth<00:04:03.090> because<00:04:03.420> as<00:04:03.629> I<00:04:03.930> hit<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.170> bump<00:04:04.500> the

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
and forth because as I hit the bump the

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.380 
and forth because as I hit the bump the
bumps<00:04:05.190> gonna<00:04:05.370> put<00:04:05.549> skis<00:04:05.790> are<00:04:05.879> gonna<00:04:06.030> go<00:04:06.150> uphill

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
bumps gonna put skis are gonna go uphill

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.930 
bumps gonna put skis are gonna go uphill
and<00:04:06.780> my<00:04:06.989> feet<00:04:07.200> are<00:04:07.230> gonna<00:04:07.379> slow<00:04:07.709> down<00:04:07.739> as<00:04:08.190> they

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
and my feet are gonna slow down as they

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.390 
and my feet are gonna slow down as they
go<00:04:09.060> back<00:04:09.239> down<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.900> bump<00:04:10.079> if<00:04:10.620> my<00:04:11.069> feet<00:04:11.280> are

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
go back down the bump if my feet are

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.680 
go back down the bump if my feet are
going<00:04:11.519> to<00:04:11.670> speed<00:04:11.940> up<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.239> that's<00:04:12.540> gonna

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
going to speed up and that's gonna

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.630 
going to speed up and that's gonna
simulate<00:04:13.049> feet<00:04:13.769> moving<00:04:14.099> back<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:14.430> forth

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
simulate feet moving back and forth

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.789 
simulate feet moving back and forth
underneath<00:04:14.940> what<00:04:15.900> I'm<00:04:16.019> going<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.350> try<00:04:16.530> to<00:04:16.620> do

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
underneath what I'm going to try to do

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.920 
underneath what I'm going to try to do
is<00:04:16.949> limit<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.579> amount<00:04:17.789> they<00:04:18.030> slow<00:04:18.329> down<00:04:18.359> by

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
is limit the amount they slow down by

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.180 
is limit the amount they slow down by
pushing<00:04:19.169> them<00:04:19.350> a<00:04:19.410> little<00:04:19.590> forward<00:04:19.979> over<00:04:20.160> the

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
pushing them a little forward over the

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.770 
pushing them a little forward over the
bump<00:04:20.430> I'm<00:04:20.820> gonna<00:04:21.000> try<00:04:21.150> to<00:04:21.209> limit<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.660> amount

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
bump I'm gonna try to limit the amount

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.140 
bump I'm gonna try to limit the amount
they<00:04:22.260> speed<00:04:23.010> up<00:04:23.190> by<00:04:23.370> pulling<00:04:23.729> them<00:04:23.910> back<00:04:24.090> a

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
they speed up by pulling them back a

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.920 
they speed up by pulling them back a
little<00:04:24.389> bit<00:04:24.539> as<00:04:24.690> they<00:04:24.810> go<00:04:24.930> over<00:04:24.960> them

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
little bit as they go over them

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.300 
little bit as they go over them
now<00:04:27.930> let's<00:04:28.140> put<00:04:28.290> that<00:04:28.440> into<00:04:28.560> some<00:04:28.740> basic<00:04:29.100> terms

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
now let's put that into some basic terms

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.890 
now let's put that into some basic terms
we're<00:04:29.790> not<00:04:29.910> gonna<00:04:30.030> worry<00:04:30.210> too<00:04:30.450> much<00:04:30.480> about<00:04:30.750> the

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
we're not gonna worry too much about the

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.480 
we're not gonna worry too much about the
line<00:04:31.110> though<00:04:31.320> where<00:04:31.650> we<00:04:31.800> turn<00:04:32.010> but<00:04:32.400> we're

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
line though where we turn but we're

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.310 
line though where we turn but we're
gonna<00:04:32.610> try<00:04:32.850> to<00:04:32.880> keep<00:04:33.120> centered<00:04:33.690> on<00:04:33.870> our<00:04:34.050> feet

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
gonna try to keep centered on our feet

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.580 
gonna try to keep centered on our feet
by<00:04:34.940> adapting<00:04:35.940> to<00:04:36.060> the<00:04:36.150> terrain<00:04:36.450> through<00:04:37.380> some

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
by adapting to the terrain through some

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.860 
by adapting to the terrain through some
medium-sized<00:04:38.250> turns<00:04:38.610> as<00:04:38.880> we<00:04:39.360> feel<00:04:39.540> our<00:04:39.690> feet

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
medium-sized turns as we feel our feet

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.300 
medium-sized turns as we feel our feet
go<00:04:40.020> up<00:04:40.140> the<00:04:40.290> bumps<00:04:40.530> we're<00:04:40.650> gonna<00:04:40.740> let<00:04:41.010> our<00:04:41.040> feet

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
go up the bumps we're gonna let our feet

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.520 
go up the bumps we're gonna let our feet
rock<00:04:41.520> forward<00:04:41.910> a<00:04:42.030> little<00:04:42.210> bit<00:04:42.330> as<00:04:42.510> we<00:04:43.170> come

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
rock forward a little bit as we come

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.020 
rock forward a little bit as we come
over<00:04:43.890> the<00:04:43.980> bumps<00:04:44.250> we're<00:04:44.370> gonna<00:04:44.460> pull<00:04:44.760> our<00:04:44.850> feet

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
over the bumps we're gonna pull our feet

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.450 
over the bumps we're gonna pull our feet
back<00:04:45.270> trying<00:04:45.690> to<00:04:45.780> eat<00:04:45.900> a<00:04:45.930> consistent<00:04:46.680> size<00:04:47.250> of

so guys in summary what we've done today
is<00:05:31.130> develop<00:05:32.130> stronger<00:05:32.520> for<00:05:32.910> apt<00:05:33.090> ability<00:05:33.510> to

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
is develop stronger for apt ability to

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.050 
is develop stronger for apt ability to
get<00:05:34.020> us<00:05:34.110> off<00:05:34.320> to<00:05:34.560> the<00:05:34.650> groom<00:05:34.860> so<00:05:35.100> in<00:05:35.370> some<00:05:35.850> basic

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
get us off to the groom so in some basic

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.900 
get us off to the groom so in some basic
bumps<00:05:36.540> and<00:05:37.280> conquering<00:05:38.280> the<00:05:38.370> challenges<00:05:38.880> that

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
bumps and conquering the challenges that

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.910 
bumps and conquering the challenges that
bumps<00:05:39.420> give<00:05:39.630> us<00:05:39.780> within<00:05:40.290> that<00:05:40.500> realm<00:05:40.740> of

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
bumps give us within that realm of

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.100 
bumps give us within that realm of
fore/aft<00:05:41.340> and<00:05:41.640> getting<00:05:41.820> thrown<00:05:42.090> around<00:05:42.150> we

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
fore/aft and getting thrown around we

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.840 
fore/aft and getting thrown around we
strengthen<00:05:43.620> the<00:05:43.710> core<00:05:43.920> we<00:05:44.430> lowered<00:05:44.790> the

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
strengthen the core we lowered the

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.330 
strengthen the core we lowered the
stance<00:05:45.180> and<00:05:45.390> learn<00:05:45.900> to<00:05:46.110> move<00:05:46.230> our<00:05:46.380> feet<00:05:46.680> under

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
stance and learn to move our feet under

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.130 
stance and learn to move our feet under
our<00:05:47.490> center<00:05:47.730> of<00:05:47.790> mass<00:05:47.880> versus<00:05:48.720> our<00:05:48.840> center<00:05:49.080> of

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
our center of mass versus our center of

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.070 
our center of mass versus our center of
mass<00:05:49.380> over<00:05:49.710> the<00:05:50.100> top<00:05:50.280> of<00:05:50.460> our<00:05:50.550> feet<00:05:50.870> so<00:05:51.870> that<00:05:51.930> we

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
mass over the top of our feet so that we

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.630 
mass over the top of our feet so that we
can<00:05:52.230> manage<00:05:52.380> the<00:05:52.590> terrain<00:05:52.740> you<00:05:53.280> took<00:05:53.430> that

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
can manage the terrain you took that

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.120 
can manage the terrain you took that
skiing<00:05:53.880> and<00:05:54.060> some<00:05:54.240> shorter<00:05:54.540> turns<00:05:54.780> and<00:05:54.990> bumps

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
skiing and some shorter turns and bumps

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.220 
skiing and some shorter turns and bumps
going<00:05:56.130> forward<00:05:56.580> keep<00:05:56.790> practicing<00:05:57.330> that<00:05:57.360> move

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.230 
going forward keep practicing that move

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.810 
going forward keep practicing that move
it<00:05:58.380> to<00:05:58.440> some<00:05:58.590> steeper<00:05:58.950> terrain<00:05:59.100> and<00:05:59.490> keeping

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
it to some steeper terrain and keeping

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.910 
it to some steeper terrain and keeping
it<00:05:59.910> skitty<00:06:00.210> and<00:06:00.420> round<00:06:00.660> turns<00:06:00.960> as<00:06:01.200> you<00:06:01.770> get

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:01.920 
it skitty and round turns as you get

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.890 
it skitty and round turns as you get
more<00:06:02.160> advanced<00:06:02.700> go<00:06:03.090> a<00:06:03.120> little<00:06:03.330> faster<00:06:03.810> and

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
more advanced go a little faster and

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.660 
more advanced go a little faster and
start<00:06:04.110> increasing<00:06:04.470> the<00:06:04.650> range<00:06:04.890> of<00:06:05.100> motion<00:06:05.280> so

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 
start increasing the range of motion so

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.120 
start increasing the range of motion so
that<00:06:05.820> you<00:06:05.910> can<00:06:06.090> stay<00:06:06.630> centered<00:06:07.130> absorbing

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
that you can stay centered absorbing

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.400 
that you can stay centered absorbing
