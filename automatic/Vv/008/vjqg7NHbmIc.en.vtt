00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Now we are here this afternoon 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.970
 It was a woman at home 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.030
 Come here, we're caught 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.950
 we do not or too little with compost 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.719
 and 0 work and if you have his books 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.549
 then you read that there are 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.340
 almost a passion for compass 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.410
 they tumbled that they were the earth, so to speak 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.050
 lives that is the goal that you , so to speak 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.100
 Benefit what is your bottom what is 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.990
 a kind of philosophy 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.990
 I wanted to leave the garden already 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:35.040
 why quite simple earth lives only 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.250
 brings healthy living garden soil 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.860
 healthy less with illnesses and 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.980
 pests contaminated plants a number 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.219
 to a garden soil with little with 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.190
 Compost has supplied in a handful 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.789
 more microorganisms than it is on earth 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.260
 people give more than eight billion 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.420
 microorganisms and critters for it 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.250
 Make sure the floor stays alive 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.329
 and that's something you do not except 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.370
 should be careful 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.220
 if dead matter on the ground where i am now 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.000
 only artificial fertilizer on top of it becomes littered soil 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.180
 reduced 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.290
 that means these plants live almost on 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.610
 drip and we will only be with 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.830
 Vitamin tablets and other nutrients 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.570
 but also that does not work says 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.090
 high fiber in humans 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.250
 nutrition all the mix of all that 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.840
 what is healthy therefore just record and 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.580
 The same goes for the plants that can 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.159
 even choose and deliver them yourself 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.320
 we and therefore we work with compost 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.750
 namely this natural cycle it 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.210
 Does not give any waste in the garden 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.890
 be recycled 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.049
 Compost of one side needs material 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.310
 of the andrÃ© material which of course in the 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.780
 end effect then again to humus 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.610
 leads and therefore 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.409
 We will start a trial 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.369
 direct we will start a trial 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.110
 and it is a conversion in the 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.020
 head i like to tell an example 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.250
 when mulching my mother-in-law must 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.020
 I have to say at home first 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.000
 returned then we lived in vienna 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.710
 and then left and the in 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.030
 the time was where with linz I had 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.119
 no garden one and a half square meters 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.590
 balcony thoma we also consciously one 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.330
 balcony garden inside and 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.280
 suggestions how to returned balcony can 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.720
 it now lives up close 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.640
 At the time I said then too 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.020
 not yet ahead of my wife and after 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.160
 I could not join friends 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.900
 look after the vegetable garden at home 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.910
 asks a possible future 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.400
 Mother-in-law and that was her right 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.170
 that was almost the moment to enter 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.680
 visa mandatory I know that was not 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.920
 so easy 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.989
 who that was so the zoo and 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.180
 again made to the suggestion 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.310
 Of course not said no because yes the 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.720
 son in law maybe that's it 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.180
 so I dare not say no 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:47.130
 but biological is not accurate 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.739
 knew what to expect and that 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.810
 Hardest was then the mulchen or soil 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.519
 cover as I with the lawn cut 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.709
 come and that between the 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.930
 bristling rows has the hands on the 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.920
 hit head together and now comes 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.560
 the austrian expression klumpert 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.510
 do you know that clumps and then I have 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.950
 explains why that is so important 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.720
 she has to pour less that she has less 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.060
 odd that the rain only in the feed 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.890
 that the ground stays loose it was 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.520
 all the same, the only thing that has come 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.080
 what will the neighbors say 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.180
 and I really have them then 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.660
 tried again and say that 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.060
 I have to bed with every bed now 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.250
 and next to it a picture without milk and 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.230
 We leave these two beets 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.360
 lie next four five six weeks 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.060
 without being able to do anything without pouring 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.120
 nothing at all then i'll show you how 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.890
 This organic gardening is comfortable 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.740
 once done and that's what it has 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:51.840
 really convinced in the carrot master 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:54.390
 have carrots or carrot and onion 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.730
 so it sets mixed culture in the 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.540
 one was mixed picture when the 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.160
 carrots too high outside the the 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.450
 Onion has grown nicely in the other 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.860
 peter of the chaotos at all 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.790
 not seen and the rein has just 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.830
 looked a bit 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.670
 that's what convinced her and she was 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.620
 at that time, already at the 80th do that now 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.530
 and from the time the whole has 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.060
 garden made everywhere and we need 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.920
 do not pour anymore and that was really 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.989
 So this is this is the 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.090
 huge advantage that you the moisture 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.740
 the floor holding that seems that it is in 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.360
 professional horticulture often one 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.400
 Changeover is but there are so many 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.940
 big plants but we show traces 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.400
 it works 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.860
 100 percent today in the 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.320
 Obstkulturen company that thought that you 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:42.780
 I had to bet that works 100 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:44.160
 percent a discussion lead that 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.390
 I do not strictly believe the cultures 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.820
 against between , for example, are 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.920
 raspberries because then the colder and 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.440
 bar down has these cities have it 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.570
 There are people there are those that huge 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.910
 layers draufmachen and you have five 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.460
 For years, logical plants also plant that 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.620
 is it because the material above all 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.240
 one is not very composted before 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.940
 A lot of nitrogen binds during the time 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.590
 what's on it 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.810
 Add compost and light 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.700
 superficially a hook that sure what 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.500
 positive but so five centimeters 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.120
 there I am, I know 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.230
 Skeptical and of course I am like that 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.400
 as you with the story 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.750
 mother in law I have the 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.360
 story with my parents 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.870
 I had to be 15 years old 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.580
 life 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.350
 my son will have been able to do so 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.750
 then talk in a 30 15 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.880
 15 had to mow and must lawn 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.400
 Just as accurate is the grasscut 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.500
 how you are doing now on the bears 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.740
 bring in and then I have now 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.420
 spent my adult life with it 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.820
 happy reasons why not do that 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.080
 got to 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:49.270
 There is a story about my wife 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.900
 we have director hannes and that was 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.970
 at home 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.050
 the water is mean 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.850
 postwar generation their parents and the 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.530
 have had a row she was 600 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.700
 meter 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.830
 currants and they had to do it 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.930
 knows always pick and that was for 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.400
 she a horn they were only three of 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.650
 come home from school 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.690
 John plowing and then I have 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.620
 Come in with four strings and 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:13.300
 For the sake of God there is again going on 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.890
 but the chance horror experiences it goes 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.390
 I think my garden it is 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.550
 maybe also because you are 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:21.040
 own concept really also at home 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.180
 pervades the garden and there is 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.890
 Lucky me, I say 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.120
 always at the end of my videos and mostly 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.790
 Do not believe everything I give them 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.920
 tell because the other guy is leaving 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.570
 also and if you have the experience in 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.820
 your garden did that differently 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.260
 is that also a possibility because 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.520
 you are the specialist in your garden 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.600
 and you have yourself a 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.600
 trust something
