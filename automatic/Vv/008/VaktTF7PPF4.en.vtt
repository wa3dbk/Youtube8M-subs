00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
hey guys it's custom mold here and I

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.169 
hey guys it's custom mold here and I
have<00:00:01.949> a<00:00:02.040> wicked<00:00:02.429> video<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.760> show<00:00:03.000> you<00:00:03.030> guys

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
have a wicked video to show you guys

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.269 
have a wicked video to show you guys
today<00:00:03.389> so<00:00:03.959> this<00:00:04.170> is<00:00:04.410> kind<00:00:04.620> of<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.799> contraption

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
today so this is kind of a contraption

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.550 
today so this is kind of a contraption
where<00:00:05.790> you'll<00:00:06.120> never<00:00:06.420> need<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:06.779> use<00:00:07.109> rail

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
where you'll never need to use rail

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.470 
where you'll never need to use rail
again<00:00:08.040> once<00:00:08.309> you've<00:00:08.519> got<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.820> simple<00:00:09.269> like

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
again once you've got the simple like

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.870 
again once you've got the simple like
setup<00:00:09.960> here<00:00:10.380> you'll<00:00:10.830> never<00:00:11.099> actually<00:00:11.309> have<00:00:11.730> to

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
setup here you'll never actually have to

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.999 
setup here you'll never actually have to
use<00:00:12.000> rail<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.509> get<00:00:12.660> minecarts<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.469> go<00:00:13.650> anywhere

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
use rail to get minecarts to go anywhere

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.670 
use rail to get minecarts to go anywhere
um<00:00:14.210> so<00:00:15.210> as<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.360> can<00:00:15.480> see<00:00:15.630> here<00:00:15.900> all<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.350> have<00:00:16.560> to

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
um so as you can see here all I have to

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.349 
um so as you can see here all I have to
do<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.830> just<00:00:16.980> set<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.310> up<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.670> then<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.150> will

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
do is just set this up and then I will

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.810 
do is just set this up and then I will
be<00:00:18.480> able<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.750> go<00:00:19.010> for<00:00:20.010> as<00:00:20.070> long<00:00:20.279> as<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.580> want

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
be able to go for as long as I want

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.759 
be able to go for as long as I want
without<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.240> single<00:00:21.720> bit<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.869> rail<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> single

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
without a single bit of rail a single

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.320 
without a single bit of rail a single
bit<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:22.980> redstone<00:00:23.189> rail<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.850> single<00:00:24.150> bit<00:00:24.269> of

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
bit of redstone rail a single bit of

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.580 
bit of redstone rail a single bit of
anything<00:00:24.689> I'll<00:00:24.810> get<00:00:24.930> all<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.140> way<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.470> end

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
anything I'll get all the way to the end

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.950 
anything I'll get all the way to the end
of<00:00:25.710> here<00:00:26.000> literally<00:00:27.000> without<00:00:27.300> doing<00:00:27.779> and

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
of here literally without doing and

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.660 
of here literally without doing and
having<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.230> do<00:00:28.349> anything<00:00:28.619> it's<00:00:28.949> not<00:00:29.160> as<00:00:29.340> fast

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
having to do anything it's not as fast

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.299 
having to do anything it's not as fast
why<00:00:30.090> no<00:00:30.119> sometimes<00:00:30.810> it's<00:00:31.080> faster<00:00:31.590> but<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> lot

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
why no sometimes it's faster but a lot

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.889 
why no sometimes it's faster but a lot
of<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.460> time<00:00:32.640> it's<00:00:32.790> not<00:00:32.850> as<00:00:33.149> fast<00:00:33.420> as<00:00:33.690> normal

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
of the time it's not as fast as normal

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.500 
of the time it's not as fast as normal
rail<00:00:34.260> but<00:00:34.829> rather<00:00:35.460> than<00:00:35.700> wasting<00:00:36.120> loads<00:00:36.360> of

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
rail but rather than wasting loads of

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.450 
rail but rather than wasting loads of
money<00:00:36.690> make<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.230> well<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.469> am<00:00:37.800> making<00:00:38.190> loads<00:00:38.370> of

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
money make it well I am making loads of

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.139 
money make it well I am making loads of
rail<00:00:38.719> this<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.989> literally<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:41.399> best<00:00:41.640> way<00:00:42.120> that

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
rail this is literally the best way that

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.959 
rail this is literally the best way that
you<00:00:42.780> can<00:00:43.020> really<00:00:43.379> have<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:44.640> do<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:44.910> I'm

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
you can really have to do it so I'm

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.220 
you can really have to do it so I'm
gonna<00:00:45.030> show<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.270> guys<00:00:45.360> what<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.960> start

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
gonna show you guys what it is to start

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.930 
gonna show you guys what it is to start
with<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.590> then<00:00:46.739> next<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.309> all<00:00:47.430> I'll<00:00:47.640> show<00:00:47.670> you

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
with and then next of all I'll show you

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.700 
with and then next of all I'll show you
exactly<00:00:48.329> how<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.629> make<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.899> how<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.230> set<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.620> up

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
exactly how to make it how to set it up

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.470 
exactly how to make it how to set it up
and<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.520> really<00:00:50.700> simple<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.059> set<00:00:51.210> up<00:00:51.300> and

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
and it's really simple to set up and

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.049 
and it's really simple to set up and
really<00:00:51.660> simple<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.050> use<00:00:52.550> what<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.730> will<00:00:53.910> need

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
really simple to use what you will need

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.279 
really simple to use what you will need
is<00:00:54.300> all<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.629> but<00:00:54.809> you'll<00:00:54.930> also<00:00:55.079> need

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
is all of this but you'll also need

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.490 
is all of this but you'll also need
about<00:00:55.500> six<00:00:55.860> minecarts<00:00:56.670> so<00:00:57.510> let's<00:00:57.809> play<00:00:57.960> six<00:00:58.289> in

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
about six minecarts so let's play six in

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.219 
about six minecarts so let's play six in
make<00:00:58.770> sure<00:00:58.800> using<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.000> same<00:01:00.680> thing<00:01:01.680> for<00:01:02.989> six<00:01:03.989> I

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
make sure using the same thing for six I

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.870 
make sure using the same thing for six I
think<00:01:04.290> that's<00:01:04.589> six<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.369> then<00:01:05.460> let<00:01:05.610> them<00:01:05.700> get<00:01:05.850> a

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
think that's six so then let them get a

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.219 
think that's six so then let them get a
bit<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.180> speed<00:01:06.420> but<00:01:06.600> what<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.869> want<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.080> do<00:01:07.170> is

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
bit of speed but what you want to do is

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.230 
bit of speed but what you want to do is
you<00:01:07.290> want<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.439> make<00:01:07.619> sure<00:01:07.729> try<00:01:08.729> if<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.090> keep

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
you want to make sure try if you keep

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.660 
you want to make sure try if you keep
walking<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.810> them<00:01:09.930> eventually<00:01:10.400> they<00:01:11.400> will<00:01:11.520> all

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
walking to them eventually they will all

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.690 
walking to them eventually they will all
group<00:01:12.060> together<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.600> be<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:13.049> one<00:01:13.700> laggy

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
group together and be like in one laggy

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.580 
group together and be like in one laggy
looking<00:01:15.240> block<00:01:16.400> so<00:01:17.400> that's<00:01:17.549> almost<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:18.590> there

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
looking block so that's almost it there

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.219 
looking block so that's almost it there
we<00:01:19.680> are<00:01:19.920> shy<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.250> break<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.670> up<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.049> okay<00:01:22.049> there

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
we are shy to break it up so okay there

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.580 
we are shy to break it up so okay there
we<00:01:22.290> go<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.650> that's<00:01:22.799> kind<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.090> will<00:01:24.360> do<00:01:24.590> I

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
we go so that's kind of that will do I

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.160 
we go so that's kind of that will do I
think<00:01:26.270> I'm<00:01:27.270> gonna<00:01:27.390> try<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.750> get<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> little

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
think I'm gonna try and get it a little

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.539 
think I'm gonna try and get it a little
bit<00:01:28.380> more<00:01:29.360> okay<00:01:30.360> now<00:01:30.479> that's<00:01:30.630> not<00:01:30.930> how<00:01:31.079> long

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
bit more okay now that's not how long

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.530 
bit more okay now that's not how long
there<00:01:32.549> we<00:01:32.640> go<00:01:32.759> that's<00:01:32.880> that's<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.270> we'll

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
there we go that's that's that we'll

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.300 
there we go that's that's that we'll
have<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.780> do<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.650> just<00:01:34.829> look<00:01:34.950> very<00:01:35.130> laggy

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
have to do and it just look very laggy

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.990 
have to do and it just look very laggy
yes<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.850> know<00:01:36.060> but<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.810> does<00:01:37.170> work<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:38.000> because

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
yes I know but it does work so because

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.789 
yes I know but it does work so because
it's<00:01:39.150> spinning<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.600> way<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.560> reason

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
it's spinning this way the reason

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.230 
it's spinning this way the reason
there's<00:01:40.950> two<00:01:41.100> lanes<00:01:41.340> if<00:01:41.759> it's<00:01:41.909> spinning<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
there's two lanes if it's spinning the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.730 
there's two lanes if it's spinning the
other<00:01:42.360> way<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.540> have<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.869> break<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.229> side<00:01:43.470> so

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
other way you have to break this side so

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.780 
other way you have to break this side so
it<00:01:43.799> goes<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.100> way<00:01:44.159> as<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:44.579> see<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.729> just

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
it goes that way as you can see it just

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.789 
it goes that way as you can see it just
broke<00:01:45.060> up<00:01:45.119> which<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.020> not<00:01:46.170> what<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.350> want<00:01:46.619> so

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
broke up which is not what you want so

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.020 
broke up which is not what you want so
you<00:01:46.890> have<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.100> make<00:01:47.250> sure<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.460> get<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.700> right

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
you have to make sure you get it right

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.760 
you have to make sure you get it right
so<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.540> can<00:01:48.720> break<00:01:48.899> up<00:01:49.049> half<00:01:49.200> way<00:01:49.320> through<00:01:49.590> but

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
so you can break up half way through but

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.010 
so you can break up half way through but
if<00:01:49.860> you've<00:01:50.009> breakin<00:01:50.430> rail<00:01:50.729> already<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.899> you'd

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
if you've breakin rail already so you'd

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.300 
if you've breakin rail already so you'd
have<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.259> break<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.470> rail<00:01:52.619> but<00:01:52.770> say<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.009> break

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
have to break the rail but say I break

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.550 
have to break the rail but say I break
this<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.640> then<00:01:53.729> I'll<00:01:53.850> go<00:01:54.000> down<00:01:54.479> there<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.439> if

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
this and then I'll go down there and if

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.840 
this and then I'll go down there and if
I<00:01:55.619> break<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.890> side<00:01:56.189> because<00:01:56.430> it's<00:01:56.700> now

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
I break that side because it's now

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.310 
I break that side because it's now
spinning<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.299> way<00:01:57.450> it'll<00:01:57.810> go<00:01:57.990> all<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.290> way

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
spinning that way it'll go all the way

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.810 
spinning that way it'll go all the way
down<00:01:58.530> there<00:01:58.680> I'll<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:58.799> show<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.189> first<00:01:59.610> and

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
down there I'll just show you first and

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.819 
down there I'll just show you first and
then<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.060> kind<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.360> get<00:02:00.509> understand<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.380> so

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
then you kind of get understand it so

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.280 
then you kind of get understand it so
it's<00:02:01.950> get<00:02:02.070> them<00:02:02.159> back<00:02:02.280> together<00:02:05.990> that<00:02:06.990> should

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
it's get them back together that should

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
it's get them back together that should
do<00:02:07.530> now<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.340> need<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.670> break<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:08.970> up

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
do now I need to break this up

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.420 
do now I need to break this up
so<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.460> now<00:02:11.960> these<00:02:12.960> are<00:02:13.320> no<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.620> feels<00:02:13.860> slow

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
so that now these are no it feels slow

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.120 
so that now these are no it feels slow
but<00:02:15.060> it's<00:02:15.210> not<00:02:15.450> really<00:02:16.020> that<00:02:16.260> Sloane

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
but it's not really that Sloane

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.270 
but it's not really that Sloane
considering<00:02:17.670> these<00:02:17.790> will<00:02:18.000> go<00:02:18.150> on<00:02:18.360> forever

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
considering these will go on forever

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.650 
considering these will go on forever
literally<00:02:20.280> at<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.490> speed<00:02:20.790> even<00:02:21.120> past<00:02:21.390> the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
literally at this speed even past the

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.570 
literally at this speed even past the
end<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.930> this<00:02:22.140> it's<00:02:22.860> just<00:02:23.040> great<00:02:23.280> which<00:02:23.460> you'll

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
end of this it's just great which you'll

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.330 
end of this it's just great which you'll
never<00:02:23.760> have<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.090> use<00:02:24.210> rail<00:02:24.450> again<00:02:24.830> really<00:02:25.830> and

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
never have to use rail again really and

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.190 
never have to use rail again really and
I<00:02:26.490> think<00:02:27.150> I'd<00:02:27.330> imagine<00:02:27.720> there<00:02:27.870> will<00:02:28.050> be<00:02:28.080> a

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
I think I'd imagine there will be a

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.390 
I think I'd imagine there will be a
limit<00:02:28.530> where<00:02:28.680> eventually<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.370> will<00:02:29.550> stop<00:02:29.940> but

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
limit where eventually it will stop but

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.700 
limit where eventually it will stop but
for<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.550> way<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.300> works<00:02:33.540> it's<00:02:33.930> perfectly<00:02:34.440> just

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
for the way it works it's perfectly just

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.160 
for the way it works it's perfectly just
will<00:02:35.100> keep<00:02:35.280> going<00:02:35.490> and<00:02:35.760> then<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.510> as<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:37.080> can

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
will keep going and then it as you can

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.110 
will keep going and then it as you can
see<00:02:37.230> if<00:02:37.620> they<00:02:37.890> leave<00:02:38.280> each<00:02:38.490> other<00:02:38.730> that's<00:02:38.940> why

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
see if they leave each other that's why

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.400 
see if they leave each other that's why
you<00:02:39.180> kind<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.720> need<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.870> keep<00:02:39.960> them<00:02:40.290> all

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
you kind of need to keep them all

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.790 
you kind of need to keep them all
together<00:02:40.560> in<00:02:41.040> one<00:02:41.900> energy<00:02:42.900> before<00:02:43.290> they<00:02:43.590> will

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
together in one energy before they will

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.050 
together in one energy before they will
just<00:02:43.980> keep<00:02:44.100> going<00:02:44.400> off<00:02:44.520> and<00:02:44.640> if<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:44.760> let<00:02:45.030> them

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
just keep going off and if you let them

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.840 
just keep going off and if you let them
go<00:02:45.270> off<00:02:45.420> like<00:02:45.630> this<00:02:45.860> it<00:02:46.860> will<00:02:47.070> ruin<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.640> world

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
go off like this it will ruin the world

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.480 
go off like this it will ruin the world
and<00:02:48.150> whole<00:02:48.570> thing<00:02:48.600> or<00:02:48.870> lag<00:02:49.080> but<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.190> reason

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
and whole thing or lag but the reason

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.980 
and whole thing or lag but the reason
you<00:02:50.580> need<00:02:50.670> six<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:51.240> because<00:02:51.450> it's<00:02:51.600> like<00:02:51.720> each

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
you need six is because it's like each

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.630 
you need six is because it's like each
one<00:02:52.020> pushes<00:02:52.620> each<00:02:52.770> other<00:02:52.980> sort<00:02:53.220> of<00:02:53.310> thing<00:02:53.490> I

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
one pushes each other sort of thing I

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.520 
one pushes each other sort of thing I
mean<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:54.090> just<00:02:54.150> keeps<00:02:54.390> they<00:02:54.840> keeping<00:02:55.200> themself

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
mean it just keeps they keeping themself

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.130 
mean it just keeps they keeping themself
going<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.160> so<00:02:57.060> they<00:02:57.180> say<00:02:57.330> I'm<00:02:57.600> doing<00:02:57.840> this<00:02:57.990> in

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
going and so they say I'm doing this in

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.530 
going and so they say I'm doing this in
Minecraft<00:02:58.530> 1.3<00:02:59.040> point<00:02:59.280> 2<00:02:59.490> so<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.790> most<00:03:00.090> recent

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
Minecraft 1.3 point 2 so the most recent

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.330 
Minecraft 1.3 point 2 so the most recent
update<00:03:00.840> at<00:03:00.960> the<00:03:01.050> moment<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.590> I'd<00:03:01.950> imagine

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
update at the moment and I'd imagine

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.410 
update at the moment and I'd imagine
it's<00:03:02.460> still<00:03:02.550> going<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.820> work<00:03:03.000> for<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.240> while

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
it's still going to work for a while

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.720 
it's still going to work for a while
after<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.110> but<00:03:05.100> anyway<00:03:05.160> I'm<00:03:05.430> gonna<00:03:05.550> show<00:03:05.640> you

after and but anyway I'm gonna show you

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.280 
after and but anyway I'm gonna show you
guys<00:03:05.790> how<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:06.030> make<00:03:06.360> this<00:03:06.540> now<00:03:06.750> so<00:03:07.050> what<00:03:07.170> you

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
guys how to make this now so what you

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.960 
guys how to make this now so what you
need<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.620> do<00:03:07.800> is<00:03:08.040> get<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.780> 4<00:03:09.780> redstone<00:03:10.280> well<00:03:11.280> I

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
need to do is get a 4 redstone well I

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.540 
need to do is get a 4 redstone well I
don't<00:03:12.120> actually<00:03:12.180> know<00:03:12.420> what<00:03:12.540> it's<00:03:12.660> called

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
don't actually know what it's called

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.890 
don't actually know what it's called
powered<00:03:14.550> rail<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.030> you<00:03:15.120> place<00:03:15.330> it<00:03:15.480> in<00:03:15.540> like<00:03:15.750> a

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
powered rail and you place it in like a

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.240 
powered rail and you place it in like a
square<00:03:16.230> sort<00:03:16.470> of<00:03:16.530> shape<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:16.980> then<00:03:17.130> place<00:03:17.430> four

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
square sort of shape and then place four

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.650 
square sort of shape and then place four
bits<00:03:20.250> of<00:03:20.340> normal<00:03:20.700> rail<00:03:20.820> on<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.180> outside<00:03:21.480> then

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
bits of normal rail on the outside then

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.210 
bits of normal rail on the outside then
place<00:03:21.870> doing<00:03:22.320> it<00:03:22.440> is<00:03:22.560> like<00:03:22.739> a<00:03:22.770> redstone<00:03:23.100> torch

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
place doing it is like a redstone torch

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.290 
place doing it is like a redstone torch
in<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.550> middle<00:03:23.760> next<00:03:24.690> we<00:03:24.930> need<00:03:25.170> to<00:03:25.320> place<00:03:26.300> the

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
in the middle next we need to place the

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.479 
in the middle next we need to place the
the<00:03:27.600> like<00:03:28.020> blocks<00:03:28.380> or<00:03:28.830> just<00:03:29.160> around<00:03:29.370> the

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
the like blocks or just around the

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:30.890 
the like blocks or just around the
outside<00:03:29.520> this<00:03:30.150> is<00:03:30.239> kind<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.540> just<00:03:30.630> like<00:03:30.810> the

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
outside this is kind of just like the

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.170 
outside this is kind of just like the
structure<00:03:31.670> of<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:33.330> actual<00:03:33.720> thing<00:03:35.000> so<00:03:36.000> there

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
structure of the actual thing so there

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.150 
structure of the actual thing so there
we<00:03:36.270> go<00:03:36.300> so<00:03:36.450> now<00:03:36.780> you<00:03:36.840> know<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.620> then<00:03:37.830> make

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
we go so now you know and then make

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.610 
we go so now you know and then make
obviously<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.970> little<00:03:39.180> turn<00:03:39.480> like<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.870> train

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
obviously the little turn like the train

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.880 
obviously the little turn like the train
sort<00:03:41.070> of<00:03:41.450> way<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:43.020> do<00:03:43.140> it<00:03:43.230> so<00:03:43.350> this<00:03:43.500> is<00:03:43.650> great

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
sort of way to do it so this is great

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.500 
sort of way to do it so this is great
all<00:03:44.130> you<00:03:44.220> have<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.400> do<00:03:44.459> break<00:03:44.700> one<00:03:44.910> round<00:03:45.209> and

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
all you have to do break one round and

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.180 
all you have to do break one round and
work<00:03:45.720> so<00:03:46.050> the<00:03:46.140> next<00:03:46.380> one<00:03:46.530> we<00:03:46.590> need<00:03:46.770> to<00:03:46.920> set<00:03:47.160> up

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
work so the next one we need to set up

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.220 
work so the next one we need to set up
it<00:03:47.580> like<00:03:48.030> this<00:03:48.270> so<00:03:48.570> it's<00:03:48.750> kind<00:03:48.930> of<00:03:48.989> like<00:03:49.140> the

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
it like this so it's kind of like the

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.590 
it like this so it's kind of like the
tilted<00:03:49.530> rail<00:03:49.739> you<00:03:50.400> simply<00:03:50.940> easy<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.239> do<00:03:51.390> just

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
tilted rail you simply easy to do just

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.750 
tilted rail you simply easy to do just
that

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
that

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.250 
that
you<00:03:53.760> only<00:03:54.330> need<00:03:54.480> one<00:03:54.510> really<00:03:54.930> it<00:03:55.080> doesn't

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
you only need one really it doesn't

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.780 
you only need one really it doesn't
really<00:03:55.350> matter<00:03:55.560> but<00:03:55.800> I<00:03:55.830> like<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.100> do<00:03:56.250> too

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
really matter but I like to do too

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.970 
really matter but I like to do too
let's<00:03:57.660> just<00:03:57.810> do<00:03:57.930> that<00:03:57.989> that<00:03:58.410> and<00:03:58.620> then<00:03:58.739> destroy

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
let's just do that that and then destroy

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.500 
let's just do that that and then destroy
the<00:03:59.130> top<00:03:59.310> one<00:03:59.489> and<00:03:59.700> then<00:03:59.880> it<00:04:00.000> stays<00:04:00.209> there<00:04:00.450> like

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
the top one and then it stays there like

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.020 
the top one and then it stays there like
that<00:04:01.100> this<00:04:02.100> is<00:04:02.250> now<00:04:02.370> literally<00:04:02.640> that<00:04:02.820> is<00:04:02.940> all

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
that this is now literally that is all

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.670 
that this is now literally that is all
you<00:04:03.120> have<00:04:03.239> to<00:04:03.360> do<00:04:03.480> and<00:04:03.720> then<00:04:03.900> just<00:04:03.930> want<00:04:04.470> work

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
you have to do and then just want work

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:12.710 
you have to do and then just want work
six<00:04:05.010> on<00:04:05.220> oh<00:04:05.540> one<00:04:06.540> two<00:04:08.239> four<00:04:09.239> five<00:04:09.739> six<00:04:10.739> okay<00:04:11.720> so

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
six on oh one two four five six okay so

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.360 
six on oh one two four five six okay so
there<00:04:12.900> we<00:04:12.930> go<00:04:13.140> and<00:04:13.260> then<00:04:13.380> just<00:04:13.739> once<00:04:14.040> again

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
there we go and then just once again

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.920 
there we go and then just once again
group<00:04:14.640> them<00:04:14.790> together<00:04:14.970> as<00:04:15.360> much<00:04:15.540> as<00:04:15.690> you<00:04:15.780> can

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
group them together as much as you can

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.469 
group them together as much as you can
on<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.169> put<00:04:16.350> another<00:04:16.620> block<00:04:16.799> here<00:04:17.479> let's

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
on the put another block here let's

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:26.980 
on the put another block here let's
groove<00:04:18.690> them<00:04:18.810> together

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.910 

this<00:04:27.990> is<00:04:28.140> the<00:04:28.230> only<00:04:28.410> bill<00:04:28.530> that<00:04:28.650> takes<00:04:28.740> a

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
this is the only bill that takes a

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.050 
this is the only bill that takes a
little<00:04:29.040> bit<00:04:29.160> of<00:04:29.280> effort<00:04:29.610> that<00:04:29.640> you<00:04:29.820> know

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
little bit of effort that you know

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.490 
little bit of effort that you know
continuing<00:04:30.840> you're<00:04:30.960> not<00:04:31.080> going<00:04:31.200> after<00:04:31.290> us

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
continuing you're not going after us

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.840 
continuing you're not going after us

Lyonne<00:04:34.920> sorry<00:04:35.160> maybe<00:04:35.700> less<00:04:35.910> perfect<00:04:36.740> so<00:04:37.740> let's

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
Lyonne sorry maybe less perfect so let's

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.980 
Lyonne sorry maybe less perfect so let's
just<00:04:38.070> stand<00:04:38.310> up<00:04:38.490> here<00:04:38.550> and<00:04:39.000> we<00:04:39.690> need<00:04:39.840> to<00:04:39.900> write

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
just stand up here and we need to write

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.970 
just stand up here and we need to write
this<00:04:40.170> side<00:04:41.840> so<00:04:42.840> now<00:04:43.020> we're<00:04:43.290> actually<00:04:43.710> kind<00:04:43.890> of

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
this side so now we're actually kind of

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.790 
this side so now we're actually kind of
going<00:04:44.100> a<00:04:44.280> little<00:04:44.550> bit<00:04:45.200> but<00:04:46.200> the<00:04:46.440> thing<00:04:46.590> is<00:04:46.680> you

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
going a little bit but the thing is you

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.440 
going a little bit but the thing is you
go<00:04:46.950> faster<00:04:47.520> if<00:04:47.700> you<00:04:47.880> didn't<00:04:48.120> need<00:04:48.240> to<00:04:48.270> have

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
go faster if you didn't need to have

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.000 
go faster if you didn't need to have
these<00:04:48.630> side<00:04:48.870> tubes<00:04:49.140> it's<00:04:49.380> pushing<00:04:49.770> against

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
these side tubes it's pushing against

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.210 
these side tubes it's pushing against
the<00:04:50.220> sides<00:04:50.490> but<00:04:51.300> because<00:04:51.900> of<00:04:52.140> them<00:04:52.350> you'll

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
the sides but because of them you'll

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.040 
the sides but because of them you'll
just<00:04:53.460> rush<00:04:53.760> off<00:04:53.970> in<00:04:54.150> one<00:04:54.300> direction<00:04:54.330> if<00:04:54.930> you

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
just rush off in one direction if you

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.930 
just rush off in one direction if you
can<00:04:55.200> get<00:04:55.350> it<00:04:55.470> so<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.710> direction<00:04:56.010> is<00:04:56.250> perfect

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
can get it so the direction is perfect

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.240 
can get it so the direction is perfect
and<00:04:57.210> because<00:04:57.690> like<00:04:58.050> that<00:04:58.650> way<00:04:58.830> they're<00:04:59.100> just

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
and because like that way they're just

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.440 
and because like that way they're just
going<00:04:59.340> to<00:04:59.400> keep<00:04:59.550> going<00:04:59.730> this<00:04:59.880> side<00:05:00.090> but<00:05:00.330> if<00:05:00.420> you

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
going to keep going this side but if you

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.610 
going to keep going this side but if you
broke<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:00.810> other<00:05:00.930> side<00:05:01.170> they<00:05:01.290> could<00:05:01.410> want<00:05:01.530> to

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
broke the other side they could want to

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.260 
broke the other side they could want to
go<00:05:01.710> this<00:05:01.890> side<00:05:02.190> so<00:05:02.670> if<00:05:02.760> you<00:05:02.790> could<00:05:02.970> kind<00:05:03.180> of

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
go this side so if you could kind of

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.230 
go this side so if you could kind of
time<00:05:03.510> it<00:05:03.690> perfectly<00:05:03.870> and<00:05:04.620> we'll<00:05:05.250> make<00:05:05.460> it<00:05:05.490> work

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
time it perfectly and we'll make it work

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.940 
time it perfectly and we'll make it work
perfectly<00:05:06.840> she'll<00:05:07.140> run<00:05:07.350> off<00:05:07.440> now<00:05:07.620> this<00:05:07.770> side

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
perfectly she'll run off now this side

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.310 
perfectly she'll run off now this side
but<00:05:08.100> a<00:05:08.160> lot<00:05:08.340> faster<00:05:08.850> and<00:05:09.630> so<00:05:09.870> if<00:05:09.930> you<00:05:09.990> kind<00:05:10.230> of

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
but a lot faster and so if you kind of

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.050 
but a lot faster and so if you kind of
make<00:05:10.470> it<00:05:10.590> so<00:05:10.710> it's<00:05:10.860> like<00:05:11.010> a<00:05:11.040> diagonal<00:05:11.490> tunnel

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
make it so it's like a diagonal tunnel

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.830 
make it so it's like a diagonal tunnel
it<00:05:12.150> worked<00:05:12.450> really<00:05:12.750> well<00:05:12.930> and<00:05:13.260> really<00:05:13.320> fast

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
it worked really well and really fast

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.330 
it worked really well and really fast
because<00:05:15.840> I<00:05:16.080> can't<00:05:16.380> well<00:05:16.680> I'm<00:05:16.800> not<00:05:16.920> in<00:05:17.040> a<00:05:17.100> tunnel

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
because I can't well I'm not in a tunnel

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.760 
because I can't well I'm not in a tunnel
it<00:05:17.880> doesn't<00:05:18.090> really<00:05:18.180> work<00:05:18.390> but<00:05:18.960> like<00:05:19.140> these

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
it doesn't really work but like these

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.130 
it doesn't really work but like these
will<00:05:19.980> these<00:05:20.640> will<00:05:20.910> just<00:05:21.150> keep<00:05:21.270> going<00:05:21.600> forever

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
will these will just keep going forever

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.280 
will these will just keep going forever
and<00:05:22.940> will<00:05:23.940> ruin<00:05:24.210> your<00:05:24.390> world<00:05:24.600> eventually<00:05:24.900> so

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
and will ruin your world eventually so

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.010 
and will ruin your world eventually so

tutorials<00:05:46.980> like<00:05:47.100> this<00:05:47.130> where<00:05:47.400> you<00:05:47.460> can<00:05:47.580> kind

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
tutorials like this where you can kind

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.430 
tutorials like this where you can kind
of<00:05:47.820> take<00:05:48.000> advantage<00:05:48.540> of<00:05:48.600> glitches<00:05:48.870> sort<00:05:49.350> of

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
of take advantage of glitches sort of

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.180 
of take advantage of glitches sort of
bugs<00:05:49.680> in<00:05:50.010> the<00:05:50.490> game<00:05:51.650> for<00:05:52.650> example<00:05:52.950> this<00:05:53.040> is

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
bugs in the game for example this is

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.680 
bugs in the game for example this is
probably<00:05:53.400> the<00:05:53.550> best<00:05:53.700> one<00:05:54.000> that<00:05:54.360> you<00:05:54.510> can<00:05:54.660> use

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
probably the best one that you can use

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.210 
probably the best one that you can use
because<00:05:55.050> you<00:05:55.140> could<00:05:55.290> set<00:05:55.530> this<00:05:55.620> up<00:05:55.830> here<00:05:56.040> and

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
because you could set this up here and

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.500 
because you could set this up here and
then<00:05:56.340> on<00:05:56.460> the<00:05:56.580> other<00:05:56.610> side<00:05:56.790> you<00:05:57.150> could<00:05:57.270> set<00:05:57.450> up

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
then on the other side you could set up

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:58.970 
then on the other side you could set up
another<00:05:57.750> one<00:05:57.990> so<00:05:58.230> you<00:05:58.260> just<00:05:58.350> be<00:05:58.530> able<00:05:58.620> to<00:05:58.710> keep

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:58.980 
another one so you just be able to keep

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.170 
another one so you just be able to keep
going<00:05:59.160> back<00:05:59.370> and<00:05:59.550> forth<00:05:59.760> when<00:05:59.880> you<00:05:59.940> need<00:06:00.150> to

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
going back and forth when you need to

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.050 
going back and forth when you need to
and<00:06:01.110> what's<00:06:01.290> great<00:06:01.440> as<00:06:01.710> well<00:06:01.890> is<00:06:02.040> if<00:06:02.220> the<00:06:02.430> car

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
and what's great as well is if the car

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.850 
and what's great as well is if the car
runs<00:06:03.090> over<00:06:03.450> here<00:06:03.750> or<00:06:03.870> connect<00:06:04.170> itself<00:06:04.440> back<00:06:04.710> to

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
runs over here or connect itself back to

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.500 
runs over here or connect itself back to
the<00:06:04.890> rail<00:06:05.130> so<00:06:05.670> then<00:06:05.820> you<00:06:05.910> can<00:06:06.030> just<00:06:06.150> leave<00:06:06.330> them

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
the rail so then you can just leave them

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:07.700 
the rail so then you can just leave them
on<00:06:06.600> there<00:06:06.840> while<00:06:07.020> you<00:06:07.170> go<00:06:07.320> off<00:06:07.350> and<00:06:07.620> do

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
on there while you go off and do

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.010 
on there while you go off and do
something<00:06:07.950> else<00:06:08.240> so<00:06:09.240> this<00:06:09.450> isn't<00:06:09.660> more

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
something else so this isn't more

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.650 
something else so this isn't more
