00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
their not being a bright coach which is

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.560 
their not being a bright coach which is
good<00:01:35.390> I<00:01:35.420> think<00:01:36.400> all<00:01:37.400> things<00:01:37.790> considered<00:01:38.300> for

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
good I think all things considered for

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.920 
good I think all things considered for
the<00:01:38.630> line<00:01:39.100> and<00:01:40.480> you<00:01:41.480> know<00:01:42.580> out<00:01:43.580> of<00:01:43.850> all<00:01:44.060> the

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
the line and you know out of all the

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.080 
the line and you know out of all the
discontinuation<00:01:45.740> zin<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.340> line

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
discontinuation zin the line

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.040 
discontinuation zin the line
I<00:01:48.460> think<00:01:49.460> this<00:01:49.640> continuing<00:01:50.270> these<00:01:50.480> was<00:01:50.900> the

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
I think this continuing these was the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:57.520 
I think this continuing these was the
worst<00:01:51.320> they've<00:01:52.190> done<00:01:53.500> because<00:01:55.750> these<00:01:56.750> are

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
worst they've done because these are

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.290 
worst they've done because these are
really<00:01:58.370> and<00:01:58.700> I<00:01:58.940> mean<00:01:58.970> really<00:01:59.870> important<00:02:01.300> these

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
really and I mean really important these

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.600 
really and I mean really important these

unfortunately they had an eleven-year

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.790 
unfortunately they had an eleven-year

rod so they're not too rare on the
secondary<00:02:45.340> market<00:02:45.490> though<00:02:46.120> they<00:02:46.240> can<00:02:46.390> be<00:02:46.540> a
