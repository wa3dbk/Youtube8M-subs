00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.670
 it is not the mode more information in work tables with salary will sing in turn 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.790
 is a very important information for housewives innovation like gas 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.049
 domestic 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:15.429
 in 'very good morning' status 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.750
 a few days ago a controversy has started regarding the creation 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.690
 the markets as a subject with gas and we are going to explain today 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.740
 what is all this problem about 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.789
 so that just like everything said the housewives come out of this and 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.679
 of this confusion of those who have entered 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.819
 and can understand today what is happening 

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:39.319
 with the ideas values ​​and precisely today we are joined by Caésar Bedón, who is the 

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:41.600
 executive director of the ideas associations 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.330
 of glp but that no place fly face briefly please 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.530
 what is all this problem generated by the day rooms 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.000
 denounces the pro's demands because it gives me what we are dealing with 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.790
 hundred presentations 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:54.970
 alert 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.300
 what the consumer in another country a series at home with the blue wants 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.780
 one of them was accurate to have a ball that identifies the person together 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.220
 the company j lends the packaging company 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.220
 responsible for the maintenance and possession of the ball 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.530
 from the year 94 been a promotional investment legislation 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.640
 to our country 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.500
 i asia that the packers she wanted in chile in two in kilograms and put 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.140
 its label in high relief on the packaging 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.670
 in the front and peace back 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.939
 the consumer can clearly identify as jealousy also in this 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.170
 moment for example has the company responsible for that speech 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.010
 is what we want to just jump in that microwave today 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.670
 that the housewives can and is that if a modern ball a ball 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.140
 that comes in aunt to know who and the manufacturer 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.140
 and a ball that is not what they will be manufactured until the year 93 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.890
 and as we are told a very important thing the detail is that you have the 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.090
 mark eg high relief etc since in a fire the packaging hours 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.850
 that they simply paint pop online the name cimera so it was never to burn 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.799
 is going to know who was the company manufactures now not 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.630
 the main concern is is he the housewife 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.450
 have security that is not a matter of messes between mashad hours should not 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.309
 monitor the security the housewife 

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:16.629
 the proposal of micheletti minas that points towards a common ball park 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.239
 would make no incentive for the acquisition of balls has not 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.999
 maintenance or scientific which company responsible 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.979
 In case of a disaster, lohan began 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:30.769
 there would be no incentive for any company to invest because it is that 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.249
 breakdown and because I think it is because it is generated and acts in relation and is 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:36.189
 a first common case of valence 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.959
 clear because being a common market 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.180
 the indecopi technical standard that states that the balls 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.590
 they must identify 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.459
 responsible and this has to be done in high relief to be common is 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.000
 owned by everyone and anyone and then there is a the company responsible for the 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.429
 maintenance of that ball 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:52.430
 to be like that 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.460
 none would worry about simply maintaining the ball 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:56.410
 would arrive 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.729
 to the plant it would be and in have taken out 

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:03.129
 and a layer of paint that can be placed on top of the ball is not at the end 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.859
 a proof that proves conclusively who is responsible 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.719
 business and informality in any case if there was a common market in Germany 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:14.400
 we would return to the situation that we had the year 93 in which he will say 

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:19.039
 goodbye to the figure there was no pons to the spur mess and this for the rest 

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:22.559
 It is a practice that is not recommended in any country in the world 

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:26.409
 you practice what is the common park and no one takes it or course poke more 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.820
 we are not praying in those moments 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.900
 which foam and even if manufactured until the year 93 and for example the difference 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.750
 we go with this ppv to ask please was I command the difference is that I had 2 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.120
 you do that very much we have them now at home because it was coming 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.549
 handles and the mark that was not that it does not come to be completed signaled in some way 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:54.279
 ennis fees until however those could well be withdrawn and one again 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:58.309
 I would go back to the percent and uncertainty of knowing who the manufacturer was 

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:02.140
 and none of the state on this side of the Bayonne 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.010
 because you see the brand in high relief that is a problem that really generates 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.680
 some kind of exercise that falsifies between the beds of house 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.159
 there is another problem that is not and we will walk guaranteed with its closing 11 is 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:19.099
 that there would be two and a half million balls of gas that would be distributed 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:24.580
 between packing houses that would be a latent danger to the integrity of 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.729
 a family that is true to little what is the reality of these two million is 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.409
 it is worth saying at the end of the year 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:34.439
 94 there were approximately three million balls per 100 pounds that 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:38.050
 decided to use the attacks have removed from the market facts 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.520
 has done progressively 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.729
 Packaging companies give LED maintenance to test 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.980
 of these balls and at the moment when they can not continue circulating they are 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:47.740
 withdrawn and they become scrap 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.979
 this is a program that is regularly followed by voter accounts 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.639
 guilarte people housewife so safe 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:58.070
 that the ball is when a company was acquired would be responsible 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:04:59.050
 and has 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.300
 the maintenance commission enough 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.169
 What needs to be done is that our country companies comply with the 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.960
 programs of replacement of balls that the inspection is made and that it leaves to the 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.030
 market in the best clear security conditions but how will they do 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.030
 that of the small embasadoras that could understand that the same street there is 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.389
 nor to the largest 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.599
 How can I guarantee that those valadares and maintenance and appropriate 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:22.060
 of May although it is not our luck our country since we have the 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.590
 companies dismiss we contribute with that Indians 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.300
 criminal your operation financing expense 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.199
 through the prices we pay for it to be in this operation of 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:33.180
 It is up to them to control 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.000
 of the use and maintenance and replacement of the ball now something else 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.669
 which percent increases more the concern is that both indecopi 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.750
 they eat ministry of energy and mines 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.180
 have ordered that these balls be removed from the market that would not say 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.150
 Of course, many of you who love the house will warn them that the ball is really 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.300
 riches in unicasa be a danger to her 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.430
 well I know it from a withdrawal order what there is is a program already 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.800
 since the year 94 the progressively replacing the balloons if this 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.650
 happen 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.110
 overnight you can not give the time there is in it in the country 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.520
 approximately 7 million balls of which two and a half million are 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.400
 these ancient balloons in book 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.809
 what 

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:17.210
 said proper maintenance and can reach the goal without conditions 

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:17.790
 secure 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.620
 because there is so much grace pointed out 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.170
 well we hope we have helped the mother to know how to differentiate 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.940
 which a ball that has been manufactured until year 23 and which is a value that 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.600
 has been manufactured after year 24 and that will undoubtedly give you a little 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.870
 more security at the time of acquiring we go with you blue 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.960
 thank you very much will make alcantara very important is the information that we 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.659
 provided well as well indicated 

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:43.969
 this puts a more expensive knowledge within the reach of housewives that is 

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:48.069
 going on with the gas balloons let's go to a new pause friends friends here in 

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:52.259
 that central is already in other studies the congressman of pp gustavo
