it's<00:00:23.080> gonna<00:00:23.200> start<00:00:23.500> by<00:00:24.510> breaking<00:00:25.510> off<00:00:25.840> about

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
it's gonna start by breaking off about

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.140 
it's gonna start by breaking off about
3/4<00:00:27.040> of<00:00:27.130> the<00:00:27.220> deck<00:00:27.460> you<00:00:28.470> then<00:00:29.910> swing<00:00:30.910> cut<00:00:31.119> a

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
3/4 of the deck you then swing cut a

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.210 
3/4 of the deck you then swing cut a
small<00:00:31.450> packet<00:00:31.840> of<00:00:32.020> over<00:00:32.710> into<00:00:32.980> your<00:00:33.100> left<00:00:33.280> hand

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
small packet of over into your left hand

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.520 
small packet of over into your left hand
but<00:00:36.220> don't<00:00:36.430> square<00:00:36.850> it<00:00:36.970> up<00:00:37.090> because<00:00:37.840> your<00:00:38.199> left

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
but don't square it up because your left

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.250 
but don't square it up because your left
ring<00:00:41.530> and<00:00:41.739> middle<00:00:42.220> finger<00:00:42.850> are<00:00:43.629> going<00:00:43.840> to<00:00:43.989> sort

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
ring and middle finger are going to sort

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.750 
ring and middle finger are going to sort
of<00:00:44.320> curl<00:00:45.280> in<00:00:45.720> which<00:00:46.720> should<00:00:46.960> push<00:00:47.519> just<00:00:48.519> pack

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
of curl in which should push just pack

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.970 
of curl in which should push just pack
it<00:00:48.790> out<00:00:49.620> like<00:00:50.620> that

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.650 

do<00:00:53.980> that<00:00:54.130> again<00:00:57.030> like<00:00:58.030> that<00:00:58.210> that's<00:00:58.450> what<00:00:58.570> you

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
do that again like that that's what you

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.560 
do that again like that that's what you
need<00:00:58.809> to<00:00:58.840> do<00:00:59.050> as<00:00:59.440> you<00:00:59.680> do<00:00:59.860> this<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:01.300> going<00:01:01.420> to

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
need to do as you do this you going to

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.460 
need to do as you do this you going to
turn<00:01:01.750> your<00:01:01.960> right<00:01:02.110> hand<00:01:02.500> face<00:01:03.129> up<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.809> that<00:01:05.020> you

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
turn your right hand face up so that you

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.160 
turn your right hand face up so that you
can<00:01:05.710> let<00:01:05.979> go<00:01:06.250> with<00:01:06.700> your<00:01:06.910> of<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.570> packet<00:01:07.960> and

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
can let go with your of the packet and

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.310 
can let go with your of the packet and
it<00:01:08.259> will<00:01:08.350> fall<00:01:08.590> into<00:01:08.860> this<00:01:09.130> position<00:01:10.320> from

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
it will fall into this position from

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.779 
it will fall into this position from
there<00:01:11.530> you<00:01:11.800> continue<00:01:12.700> to<00:01:12.910> flip<00:01:13.119> it<00:01:13.210> over<00:01:14.789> like

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:15.789 
there you continue to flip it over like

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:18.240 
there you continue to flip it over like
that<00:01:15.850> onto<00:01:16.509> the<00:01:16.600> packet<00:01:16.930> now<00:01:17.649> do<00:01:17.710> you<00:01:17.920> yell
