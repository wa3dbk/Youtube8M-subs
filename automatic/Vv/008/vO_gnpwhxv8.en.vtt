want<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.580> do<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:05.970> bring<00:00:06.569> up<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.960> kneeboard<00:00:07.440> to

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
want to do is bring up the kneeboard to

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.440 
want to do is bring up the kneeboard to
find<00:00:08.400> out<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.639> proper<00:00:09.059> take<00:00:09.900> off<00:00:10.080> speeds<00:00:10.410> and

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450 
find out the proper take off speeds and

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.440 
find out the proper take off speeds and
this<00:00:12.450> is<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.780> airbus<00:00:13.110> a321<00:00:14.089> and<00:00:15.089> we're<00:00:15.330> going

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
this is the airbus a321 and we're going

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.790 
this is the airbus a321 and we're going
to<00:00:15.509> be<00:00:15.570> looking<00:00:15.660> for<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.020> rotation<00:00:16.529> speed

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
to be looking for the rotation speed

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.200 
to be looking for the rotation speed
that's<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.100> speeding<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.640> want<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.910> pull<00:00:18.060> off

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
that's a speeding I want to pull off

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.950 
that's a speeding I want to pull off
that<00:00:18.680> so<00:00:21.529> just<00:00:22.529> look<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:22.980> up<00:00:23.039> get<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:23.970> then

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
that so just look that up get it then

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.759 
that so just look that up get it then
next<00:00:25.500> we're<00:00:25.769> going<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.010> plug<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:26.730> into<00:00:27.090> our

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
next we're going to plug that into our

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.569 
next we're going to plug that into our
our<00:00:29.990> autopilot<00:00:30.990> for<00:00:31.439> reference<00:00:31.920> we're<00:00:32.399> not

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
our autopilot for reference we're not

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.639 
our autopilot for reference we're not
going<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.820> use<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.300> autopilot<00:00:33.690> but<00:00:34.500> we're

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
going to use the autopilot but we're

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.420 
going to use the autopilot but we're
just<00:00:34.800> going<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:34.980> have<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.250> there<00:00:35.399> for

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
just going to have it there for

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.920 
just going to have it there for
reference<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.239> we<00:00:36.360> don't<00:00:36.540> have<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.750> keep

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
reference so we don't have to keep

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.110 
reference so we don't have to keep
looking<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.410> pause<00:00:37.620> in<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.860> flight

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.479 

next<00:00:44.899> up<00:00:45.050> we<00:00:45.199> set<00:00:45.410> our<00:00:45.500> trim<00:00:45.890> you<00:00:46.070> want<00:00:46.219> to<00:00:46.309> set

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
next up we set our trim you want to set

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.360 
next up we set our trim you want to set
it<00:00:46.579> to<00:00:46.699> about<00:00:46.760> 4<00:00:47.329> degrees<00:00:47.590> that's<00:00:48.590> a<00:00:48.980> good

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
it to about 4 degrees that's a good

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.430 
it to about 4 degrees that's a good
takeoff<00:00:49.820> trim<00:00:50.149> just<00:00:50.629> from<00:00:50.960> firsthand

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
takeoff trim just from firsthand

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.479 
takeoff trim just from firsthand
experience<00:00:56.680> and<00:00:57.680> then<00:00:57.890> we're<00:00:58.129> going<00:00:58.250> to<00:00:58.339> put

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
experience and then we're going to put

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.299 
experience and then we're going to put
down<00:00:58.670> the<00:00:58.790> flaps<00:00:59.620> just<00:01:00.620> put<00:01:00.800> them<00:01:00.949> down<00:01:00.979> about

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
down the flaps just put them down about

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.509 
down the flaps just put them down about
two<00:01:01.670> notches<00:01:01.909> for<00:01:02.360> Airbus's<00:01:03.250> Airbus's<00:01:04.250> flat

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
two notches for Airbus's Airbus's flat

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.520 
two notches for Airbus's Airbus's flat
system<00:01:05.119> works<00:01:05.330> different<00:01:05.780> than<00:01:05.930> bowling<00:01:06.110> so

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
system works different than bowling so

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.780 
system works different than bowling so
just<00:01:06.800> put<00:01:06.979> down<00:01:07.159> two<00:01:07.399> notches<00:01:08.830> now<00:01:09.830> just<00:01:10.220> apply

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
just put down two notches now just apply

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:25.680 
just put down two notches now just apply
full<00:01:11.090> Albert<00:01:11.570> engines<00:01:11.990> and<00:01:12.500> get<00:01:13.430> rolling

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.560 

now<00:01:26.680> the<00:01:26.740> aircraft's<00:01:27.310> going<00:01:27.490> to<00:01:27.550> since<00:01:28.210> we<00:01:28.360> set

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
now the aircraft's going to since we set

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:29.850 
now the aircraft's going to since we set
the<00:01:28.690> trend<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.050> aircraft's<00:01:29.440> going<00:01:29.590> to<00:01:29.650> start

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
the trend the aircraft's going to start

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.250 
the trend the aircraft's going to start
to<00:01:29.920> pop<00:01:30.130> up<00:01:30.190> when<00:01:31.180> it<00:01:31.270> pops<00:01:31.540> up<00:01:31.750> that's<00:01:32.020> when

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
to pop up when it pops up that's when

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:38.160 
to pop up when it pops up that's when
you're<00:01:32.470> going<00:01:32.740> to<00:01:32.860> want<00:01:32.980> to<00:01:33.070> take<00:01:33.220> off

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.450 

remember<00:01:39.170> to<00:01:39.259> put<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:39.530> landing<00:01:39.890> gear<00:01:40.040> up<00:01:40.220> and

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
remember to put the landing gear up and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.780 
remember to put the landing gear up and
then<00:01:41.409> we<00:01:42.409> want<00:01:42.649> to<00:01:42.740> do<00:01:42.829> is<00:01:43.070> after<00:01:43.399> you<00:01:43.579> first

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
then we want to do is after you first

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.789 
then we want to do is after you first
take<00:01:43.939> off<00:01:44.119> you<00:01:44.240> want<00:01:44.390> to<00:01:44.450> climb<00:01:44.799> pretty

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
take off you want to climb pretty

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.730 
take off you want to climb pretty
steeply<00:01:46.310> you<00:01:47.149> want<00:01:47.390> to<00:01:47.509> have<00:01:48.079> still<00:01:48.530> have

steeply you want to have still have

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.620 
steeply you want to have still have
about<00:01:49.039> full<00:01:49.549> power<00:01:49.820> and<00:01:50.149> you<00:01:50.270> want<00:01:50.450> to<00:01:50.539> go

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
about full power and you want to go

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.679 
about full power and you want to go
about<00:01:50.810> 250<00:01:51.649> knots<00:01:51.860> so<00:01:52.159> set<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.090> proper<00:01:53.539> way

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
about 250 knots so set the proper way

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.810 
about 250 knots so set the proper way
just<00:01:54.320> find<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.590> proper<00:01:54.860> pitch<00:01:55.159> to<00:01:55.369> keep<00:01:55.549> going

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
just find the proper pitch to keep going

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.090 
just find the proper pitch to keep going
up<00:01:55.970> and<00:01:56.179> you<00:01:56.720> should<00:01:56.960> find<00:01:57.200> yourself<00:01:57.350> climbing

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
up and you should find yourself climbing

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:09.999 
up and you should find yourself climbing
fairly<00:01:58.580> quickly

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.339 

as<00:02:10.519> you<00:02:10.640> can<00:02:10.729> see<00:02:10.939> we're<00:02:11.120> almost<00:02:11.239> at<00:02:11.540> like<00:02:11.780> six

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
as you can see we're almost at like six

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.699 
as you can see we're almost at like six
thousand<00:02:12.830> feet<00:02:13.069> and<00:02:13.870> look<00:02:14.870> how<00:02:15.019> far<00:02:15.260> Bowie<00:02:15.560> are

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
thousand feet and look how far Bowie are
