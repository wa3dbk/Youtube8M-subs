00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.880
 Welcome to the DEKRA pedelec check! Today we introduce you to the Grace MX. 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.570
 The MX is a hardtail with 2013 Bosch mid-engine drive that provides pedal support up to 25 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.809
 km / h delivers. The MX presents itself as a chic all-rounder, 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.910
 who wants to cut a good figure both off-road and in the urban jungle. Total have 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.460
 We gained extensive experience with the Grace on more than 2000 km onroad as well as offroad. 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.680
 And now for the check. The Grace impresses with its distinctive look 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.640
 with intricately welded matt black frame, in which inscriptions as far as possible 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.530
 Was renounced, so as not to distract from the extraordinary design. What we like, engine 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.320
 and battery are visually very well integrated into the overall design in the Grace. The 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.619
 centrally mounted, well readable display is visually successful. The for our taste 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.619
 Visually too clunky operating unit can not keep up here unfortunately. Overall works 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.380
 the extraordinary very massive look of the Grace MX strongly polarizing, one loves 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:35.119
 it or you hate it. We love it! The downside of the massive bombproof construction 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:42.189
 the MX is the heavy weight, measured at 24.7 kilograms. By the mid-engine concept 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.249
 Although there is an overall good weight distribution, wearing the bike, but still makes 

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:56.170
 no fun. The NuVinci hub gear of the MX is on 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.909
 special technical treat. This makes the translation infinitely perfect 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.560
 adapt to the particular driving situation and is really fun. Unfortunately owns 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.030
 the hub does not have a quick-release axle, causing the wheel to move out, for example on 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.819
 Reason of a plates, extremely elaborately designed. The likewise unusual belt drive 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.550
 Grace spoils, in addition to the extraordinary appearance and lower maintenance, too 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.900
 by the absence of greasy chains press on the pants. However, the belt drive tends 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.569
 with inaccurate voltage setting quickly to crackling noise. The built on MX MX 2013er 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.959
 Bosch drive system is mature and now very widespread. It worked while 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.299
 the test mostly problem-free. Our Testrad was with the larger, the two Lieferbaren, 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:51.939
 Batteries equipped. This battery provides 11.6 amp hours or 400 watt hours. We achieved 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:56.709
 so on average, in relatively hilly terrain, in the strongest support level, ranges 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:03.560
 from 60 to 80 kilometers. Unfortunately, there is no reoccupation for reaching coverage here 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:11.599
 to disposal. It is not possible to charge the battery when it is installed. The battery needs 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:17.970
 Unfortunately, it is mandatory to remove it from the shop. The detachable display offers the one for 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.260
 Pedelec usual information, these are easy to read. The control of the display 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.230
 via the, at the end of the handlebar laid ergonomically good, operating unit. This was 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.000
 but responsible for the only defect during our test drives. It became though 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.549
 a spare part delivered quickly and easily. The 2013 Bosch drive offers the driver 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.069
 Four well-tuned levels of support that are suitable for almost any driving situation 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:50.010
 Provide thrust. Compared to some other pedelecs, the starting power of the MX, 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.219
 even in the strongest support level, weaker. Even in steep mountain passages 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:04:01.189
 could not completely convince us the drive performance. The drive power is but 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:06.379
 always easy to dose, which of course is advantageous in off-road or in tight bends. 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:11.719
 The engine is clearly audible under full load, here we would be an acoustic 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:17.100
 wish inconspicuous occurrence of the drive. Overall, the Grace but will endure and 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:27.720
 pushed sufficiently ahead. The MX fitted rox shock sector RL fork 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.100
 With a powerful 150mm of travel, Offroad in a hardtail is beyond doubt. 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.570
 She speaks sensitively and can be well adjusted to the driver and the ground. 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:45.080
 Unfortunately, the sector has no lock-out remote control. But it can be blocked directly on the fork leg. 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:57.600
 On the bike Avid Elexier 5 brakes are installed. The brakes are easy to dose, with great 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.740
 Pressure point and good performance with little tendency for grinding and squeaking. The 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.320
 large 200 mm disc on the front wheel guaranteed despite high vehicle weight even at long 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:19.280
 Downhill runs and enough reserves under the toughest conditions. The Grace MX offers for the 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.030
 Driver a relaxed upright seating position. This makes it pleasant to drive and especially 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.520
 well suited for city traffic. It has a good directional stability and offers a safe 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:36.290
 and a rich driving experience. The rotation of the Boschmotor is an excellent ground clearance 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:44.830
 guaranteed. However, the bike indicates a fast ride over short waves 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.620
 even for hardtails, stubborn handling of the rear triangle. Due to the overall high weight 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.770
 and the lack of a sprung rear end is the bike for demanding trails only 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:03.770
 conditionally suitable. The Grace MX tries both as a stylish 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.970
 E-hardtail for the city to shine as well as to look good off the road. The former 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:15.710
 is definitely well done. Offroad feels the MX, despite powerful fork and potent 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.120
 Brakes, more comfortable on easy terrain. The missing rear suspension is here 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:27.210
 limiting factor. Overall, the Grace MX is definitely fun. A cool look 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:33.350
 paired with technical high lights make the MX an exceptional pedelec. 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:38.490
 Grace has tried squaring the circle with the MX and is an unsolvable task 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:50.910
 come amazingly far.
