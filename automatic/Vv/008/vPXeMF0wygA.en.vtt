lot<00:02:45.209> of<00:02:45.239> fingerprints<00:02:46.079> no<00:02:46.260> they<00:02:46.530> have<00:02:46.739> screen

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.190 
lot of fingerprints no they have screen
films<00:02:47.549> over<00:02:47.879> there<00:02:48.030> on<00:02:48.180> their<00:02:48.329> website<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.170> i

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
films over there on their website so i

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.780 
films over there on their website so i
might<00:02:49.440> check<00:02:49.680> them<00:02:49.829> out<00:02:49.920> because<00:02:50.129> the<00:02:50.400> line<00:02:50.610> up

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
might check them out because the line up

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.030 
might check them out because the line up
on<00:02:50.970> this<00:02:51.180> was<00:02:51.450> ridiculous<00:02:51.720> so<00:02:52.590> if<00:02:52.709> they<00:02:52.829> have<00:02:53.010> a

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
on this was ridiculous so if they have a

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.160 
on this was ridiculous so if they have a
mirror<00:02:53.459> one<00:02:53.790> or<00:02:54.030> anti-fingerprint<00:02:54.930> i'm

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
mirror one or anti-fingerprint i'm

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.970 
mirror one or anti-fingerprint i'm
definitely<00:02:55.500> gonna<00:02:55.590> check<00:02:55.769> it<00:02:55.890> out

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
definitely gonna check it out

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.920

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.449 
really simple there's no problems but to
think<00:03:00.540> about<00:03:00.810> this<00:03:01.019> case<00:03:01.260> they<00:03:01.500> also<00:03:01.739> include

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459
