 Alberto Romero who is going to tell us a 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.309
 little about the specialty of orthodontics 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.470
 and maxillary orthopedics that is within 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.480
 the dentistry career tell us that 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.420
 orthodontic abortion is going to be the 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.860
 specialty that will take care of 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.600
 study and treatment of what they are 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.730
 malocclusion that are malocclusions are 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.480
 mainly poor positions in tasks 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.379
 not with the main objective of 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.379
 give or give to our 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.449
 patients a correct alignment of 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.210
 teeth so the bite can 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.580
 be functional and logical has to go from 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.920
 the hand for aesthetics orthopedics if 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.900
 it is a science that is contained within 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.979
 of this same specialty that is no longer 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.290
 will focus so much on those who are 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.140
 teeth but in what are jaws and 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.450
 what is sought here is a harmony 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.610
 facial and not so much of teeth but of 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.619
 bone structure and facial complex for 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.560
 what then the person gets to have a 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.170
 harmonious profile without deviations nor 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.710
 nothing for the main problems in 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.570
 one with maintaining a malocclusion is going to 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.850
 be that the dental crowding 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.159
 can lead to the greatest accumulation of 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.229
 Bacterial plaque between the teeth can 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.600
 also lead to even pains 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:44.280
 joint by the bad gear of the 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.170
 teeth and work directly with 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.840
 career specialists work 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.910
 from the hand of a pediatricians point 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.750
 when I was working with children 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.800
 as I tell you four or five years 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.600
 but periodontist the 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:04.119
 rehabilitators when you work 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:09.360
 we can not observe a crowding 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:13.320
 in the teeth in this like 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.300
 some hero versions or 3 turned in 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:20.160
 this case here 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:24.330
 then in the case of it we would put 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:28.280
 the brackets to be able to carry these 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.280
 customers to a correct alignment 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.280
