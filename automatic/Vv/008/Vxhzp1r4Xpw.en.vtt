00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
of record let's slide down of course

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.590 
of record let's slide down of course
it's<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> same<00:00:56.640> chord<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.329> just<00:00:57.479> an

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
it's the same chord it's just an

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.399 
it's the same chord it's just an
inversion<00:00:58.110> of<00:00:58.290> that<00:00:58.470> chord<00:00:59.300> so<00:01:00.300> what<00:01:01.050> comes<00:01:01.229> to

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:01.409 
inversion of that chord so what comes to

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:03.049 
inversion of that chord so what comes to
mind<00:01:01.559> first<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:02.010> all<00:01:02.100> instead<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.670> starting

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
mind first of all instead of starting

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.900 
mind first of all instead of starting
with<00:01:03.120> just<00:01:03.570> an<00:01:03.840> F<00:01:04.229> chord<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.399> could<00:01:05.580> subject

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
with just an F chord we could subject

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.450 
with just an F chord we could subject
for<00:01:06.240> any<00:01:06.300> any<00:01:06.720> major<00:01:07.530> bringing<00:01:08.009> up<00:01:08.220> down<00:01:08.429> a

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
for any any major bringing up down a

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.490 
for any any major bringing up down a
fourth<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.149> substitute<00:01:09.509> a<00:01:09.600> minor<00:01:09.810> seventh<00:01:10.320> so

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
fourth and substitute a minor seventh so

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.999 
fourth and substitute a minor seventh so
if<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.160> count<00:01:11.399> down<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.670> fourth<00:01:12.030> from<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:13.009> can

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
if I count down a fourth from it I can

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.029 
if I count down a fourth from it I can
substitute<00:01:14.250> C<00:01:14.759> minor<00:01:15.000> seventh<00:01:15.570> for<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.259> F

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
substitute C minor seventh for that F

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:19.999 
substitute C minor seventh for that F
chord<00:01:17.780> so<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.840> could<00:01:19.110> start<00:01:19.440> the<00:01:19.470> song<00:01:19.770> like

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
chord so I could start the song like

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.060 
chord so I could start the song like
that<00:01:20.039> and<00:01:20.789> then<00:01:21.750> what<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.140> might<00:01:22.380> want<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.679> do<00:01:22.800> is

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
that and then what I might want to do is

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.609 
that and then what I might want to do is
and<00:01:23.399> change<00:01:23.820> change<00:01:24.479> back<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.929> F<00:01:25.080> before<00:01:25.409> I

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
and change change back to F before I

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.249 
and change change back to F before I
move<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.860> b-flat<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.580> other<00:01:26.670> words<00:01:26.880> instead<00:01:27.360> of

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.010 

I'll<00:01:31.259> start<00:01:31.590> with<00:01:31.770> C<00:01:32.100> minor<00:01:32.340> seventh<00:01:33.020> then

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
I'll start with C minor seventh then

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:47.140 
I'll start with C minor seventh then
I'll<00:01:34.170> break<00:01:34.380> up<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.740> chords<00:01:35.040> incidentally

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.030 

okay<00:01:48.150> so<00:01:48.210> let<00:01:48.630> see<00:01:49.229> what<00:01:49.350> I've<00:01:49.470> done<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.800> far<00:01:49.830> I

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
okay so let see what I've done so far I

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.490 
okay so let see what I've done so far I
used<00:01:50.340> two<00:01:50.460> chords<00:01:50.820> subdivision<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.810> fourth

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
used two chords subdivision a fourth

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.940 
used two chords subdivision a fourth
below<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:54.030> word<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.450> was<00:01:54.540> indicated<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.740> then

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
below the word it was indicated and then

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.969 
below the word it was indicated and then
I<00:01:56.010> used<00:01:56.280> some<00:01:56.430> arpeggios

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
I used some arpeggios

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.560 
I used some arpeggios
all<00:01:58.979> right<00:01:59.100> wire<00:01:59.580> instead<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.210> playing<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
all right wire instead of playing the

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
you might go about doing it the second

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.750 
you might go about doing it the second
thing<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.730> did<00:02:20.940> was<00:02:21.690> added<00:02:22.320> a<00:02:22.380> color<00:02:22.620> tone<00:02:22.860> ansan

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
every 7th I added a ninth

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:38.530 
every 7th I added a ninth
so<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:29.790> went<00:02:30.000> from<00:02:30.060> saline<00:02:30.360> or<00:02:30.750> 7<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.620> 1/2<00:02:31.650> night

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.690 

so<00:02:39.540> just<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.900> be<00:02:40.019> frank<00:02:40.230> when<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:40.620> pass<00:02:41.250> out<00:02:41.550> of

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.440 

and<00:02:47.050> I<00:02:47.110> went<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.410> a<00:02:47.500> substitute<00:02:47.950> court<00:02:48.420> again<00:02:49.420> I

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
and I went to a substitute court again I

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.570 
and I went to a substitute court again I
won't<00:02:49.630> I<00:02:49.930> don't<00:02:50.320> have<00:02:50.440> time<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.800> explain<00:02:50.920> how<00:02:51.550> I

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
won't I don't have time to explain how I

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.040 
won't I don't have time to explain how I
come<00:02:51.820> up<00:02:51.910> with<00:02:52.060> this<00:02:52.120> substitute<00:02:52.510> chords<00:02:52.900> but

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
come up with this substitute chords but

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:08.210 
come up with this substitute chords but
it's<00:02:53.200> very<00:02:53.410> simple<00:02:53.770> if<00:02:54.010> you<00:02:54.130> know<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.370> rules

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.520 

no<00:03:09.120> Sarah<00:03:09.510> I

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
no Sarah I

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:34.460 
no Sarah I
I<00:03:11.940> changed<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.030> melody<00:03:13.390> just<00:03:13.510> a<00:03:13.630> little<00:03:13.810> bit

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.780 

then<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.620> middle<00:03:35.860> section<00:03:36.250> I<00:03:36.459> might<00:03:36.640> go

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
then the middle section I might go

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:45.230 
then the middle section I might go
something<00:03:37.030> like<00:03:37.150> this

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:51.920 

that's<00:03:45.810> half<00:03:46.110> step<00:03:46.380> slide

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:59.959 

a<00:03:54.140> suspension<00:03:55.159> resolution<00:03:56.159> flat<00:03:58.489> 9/7<00:03:59.489> over<00:03:59.819> at

00:03:59.959 --> 00:03:59.969 
a suspension resolution flat 9/7 over at

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:16.409 
a suspension resolution flat 9/7 over at
this<00:04:00.209> time

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.879 

so<00:04:17.419> those<00:04:17.660> are<00:04:17.840> just<00:04:17.870> some<00:04:18.079> of<00:04:18.350> the<00:04:18.410> tools<00:04:18.590> I

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
so those are just some of the tools I

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.409 
so those are just some of the tools I
would<00:04:18.949> use<00:04:19.220> on<00:04:19.459> a<00:04:19.489> slide<00:04:19.790> like<00:04:20.000> that<00:04:20.060> we<00:04:20.299> can

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
would use on a slide like that we can

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.170 
would use on a slide like that we can
take<00:04:20.540> any<00:04:20.750> song<00:04:21.019> we<00:04:21.139> can<00:04:21.169> take<00:04:21.500> go<00:04:21.769> oh<00:04:22.180> let's

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
take any song we can take go oh let's

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.150 
take any song we can take go oh let's
take<00:04:23.330> em<00:04:23.600> now<00:04:23.780> fun<00:04:24.050> of<00:04:24.260> every<00:04:24.500> blessing<00:04:24.919> real

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
take em now fun of every blessing real

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.820 
take em now fun of every blessing real
quickly<00:04:25.570> instead<00:04:26.570> of<00:04:26.720> playing<00:04:27.260> it<00:04:27.410> as<00:04:27.500> written

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
quickly instead of playing it as written

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:42.120 
quickly instead of playing it as written
we<00:04:28.520> might<00:04:28.820> do<00:04:28.940> this

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:05:01.420 

how<00:04:43.130> I<00:04:43.160> might<00:04:43.400> realize

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.550 

and<00:05:02.030> so<00:05:02.300> on<00:05:02.419> okay<00:05:02.630> and<00:05:02.810> would<00:05:03.020> you<00:05:03.080> do<00:05:03.229> that<00:05:03.350> the

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
and so on okay and would you do that the

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:24.999 
and so on okay and would you do that the
same<00:05:03.800> to<00:05:04.100> adjust<00:05:04.790> a<00:05:04.850> culture

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:25.009 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:27.200 

that's<00:05:26.009> kind<00:05:26.249> of<00:05:26.279> messy<00:05:26.610> but<00:05:26.639> you<00:05:26.849> get<00:05:27.059> the

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
that's kind of messy but you get the

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.079 
that's kind of messy but you get the
idea<00:05:27.240> by<00:05:28.139> just<00:05:28.409> adding<00:05:28.649> a<00:05:28.860> very<00:05:29.249> few<00:05:29.580> arranging

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:30.089 
idea by just adding a very few arranging

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:31.399 
idea by just adding a very few arranging

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
techniques you didn't come up with some

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:33.619 
techniques you didn't come up with some
