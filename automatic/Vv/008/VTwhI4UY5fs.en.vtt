fight<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.570> lufkin<00:01:39.870> then<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.380> think<00:01:40.590> his<00:01:40.710> legacy

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
fight the lufkin then I think his legacy

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.860 
fight the lufkin then I think his legacy
will<00:01:41.190> be<00:01:41.250> tarnished<00:01:41.550> if<00:01:42.030> he<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.360> he<00:01:42.479> willing<00:01:42.660> to

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
will be tarnished if he is he willing to

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.540 
will be tarnished if he is he willing to
live<00:01:43.050> with<00:01:43.080> that<00:01:43.290> who<00:01:43.650> knows<00:01:43.830> I<00:01:44.100> mean<00:01:44.400> if
