first one that you'll see is that we
stood<00:00:16.260> either<00:00:16.590> side<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.340> line<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.910> aim

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
stood either side of the line of aim

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.960 
stood either side of the line of aim
behind<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.920> for<00:00:20.010> either<00:00:20.160> side<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.699> line<00:00:20.820> of

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
behind it for either side of the line of

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.620 
behind it for either side of the line of
aim<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.800> what<00:00:22.800> some<00:00:23.100> pros<00:00:23.430> do<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:23.850> they<00:00:24.000> place

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
aim and what some pros do is they place

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.109 
aim and what some pros do is they place
the<00:00:24.900> rest<00:00:25.170> head<00:00:25.410> on<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.769> line<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.070> aim<00:00:26.220> cue<00:00:26.910> in

the rest head on the line of aim cue in
the<00:00:27.240> rest<00:00:27.449> head<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.220> then<00:00:29.599> slide<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:31.140> rest

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
the rest head and then slide the rest

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.940 
the rest head and then slide the rest
toward<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.250> shot

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
toward the shot

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.700 
toward the shot
and<00:00:35.090> a<00:00:36.090> corner<00:00:36.540> mistake<00:00:36.900> is<00:00:37.170> supposed<00:00:37.560> to

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
and a corner mistake is supposed to

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.970 
and a corner mistake is supposed to
thing<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.070> have<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.460> put<00:00:38.580> the<00:00:38.670> rest<00:00:38.940> underneath

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
thing I have to put the rest underneath

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.790 
thing I have to put the rest underneath
the<00:00:40.980> cure<00:00:41.310> the<00:00:41.940> problem<00:00:42.330> with<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.720> is<00:00:43.200> that

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
the cure the problem with that is that

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.070 
the cure the problem with that is that
the<00:00:44.250> arm<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.730> be<00:00:44.850> out<00:00:44.970> of<00:00:45.000> balance<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.840> lose

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.080 
the arm can be out of balance and lose

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.440 
the arm can be out of balance and lose
source<00:00:46.410> strength<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.980> stability<00:00:47.240> and<00:00:48.240> when

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
source strength and stability and when

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.330 
source strength and stability and when
we're<00:00:48.570> playing<00:00:48.780> lower<00:00:49.170> with<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.830> bottle

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
we're playing lower with the bottle

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.930 
we're playing lower with the bottle
higher<00:00:50.580> on<00:00:50.790> line<00:00:51.030> or<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:52.800> grip<00:00:53.160> hand<00:00:53.490> can

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
higher on line or the grip hand can

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.470 
higher on line or the grip hand can
interfere<00:00:55.160> with<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.540> bridging<00:00:57.540> home

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
interfere with the bridging home

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.750 
interfere with the bridging home
so<00:01:00.140> an<00:01:00.830> exercise<00:01:01.400> first<00:01:01.820> in<00:01:02.830> how<00:01:03.830> to<00:01:03.890> deliver

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
so an exercise first in how to deliver

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.400 
so an exercise first in how to deliver

outside<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.700> grip<00:01:11.300> pound<00:01:11.600> means<00:01:12.590> that<00:01:13.120> you

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
outside the grip pound means that you

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.420 
outside the grip pound means that you
close<00:01:14.540> your<00:01:14.780> fingers<00:01:14.990> like<00:01:15.350> this<00:01:15.590> around<00:01:16.310> the

is always disappeared inside their grip
before<00:01:29.750> it<00:01:29.900> grew

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
before it grew

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.340 
before it grew
you<00:01:31.040> drop<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.400> hand<00:01:31.610> so<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.509> cute<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:33.050> grip

delivery we want is about this distance

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.390 
delivery we want is about this distance
here<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:47.270> camera<00:01:47.630> can<00:01:47.810> say<00:01:48.050> that<00:01:48.400> that

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
here the camera can say that that

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.960 
here the camera can say that that
starfish<00:01:50.000> distance<00:01:50.950> but<00:01:51.950> of<00:01:52.100> the<00:01:52.160> huge<00:01:52.460> chin

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
starfish distance but of the huge chin

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.899 
starfish distance but of the huge chin
so<00:01:53.810> you<00:01:54.170> can

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909

enough distanced and healthy backswing

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.179 
enough distanced and healthy backswing
and<00:02:01.610> generate<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.240> speed<00:02:02.570> that<00:02:02.720> you<00:02:02.869> need<00:02:03.189> the

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
and generate the speed that you need the

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.650 
and generate the speed that you need the
other<00:02:04.340> thing<00:02:04.610> is<00:02:05.020> deliver<00:02:06.850> now<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:07.909> elbow<00:02:08.539> in

this practice routine to deliver on to

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.070 
this practice routine to deliver on to
it<00:02:10.850> straight<00:02:11.920> with<00:02:12.920> fingers<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.670> open

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
it straight with fingers to open

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.140 
it straight with fingers to open
smoothly<00:02:15.100> keeping<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.190> hand<00:02:16.489> in<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.819> arm<00:02:17.000> in

smoothly keeping the hand in the arm in

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.809 
smoothly keeping the hand in the arm in
one<00:02:17.180> line<00:02:17.630> rather<00:02:18.020> than<00:02:18.200> like<00:02:18.830> this<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:19.370> lot<00:02:19.670> of

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
one line rather than like this a lot of

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.610 
one line rather than like this a lot of
tension<00:02:20.330> and<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:20.569> angle<00:02:20.930> down<00:02:20.989> there

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
tension and that angle down there

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.900 
tension and that angle down there
and<00:02:22.280> that<00:02:22.520> takes<00:02:22.819> to<00:02:23.030> do<00:02:23.180> this<00:02:23.360> effect<00:02:27.910> allow

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
curious some plan is that you not

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.250 
curious some plan is that you not
dropping<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.799> cue<00:03:48.040> like<00:03:48.250> this<00:03:52.260> that's

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
dropping the cue like this that's

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.080 
dropping the cue like this that's
because<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.739> changes<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.340> arm<00:03:54.790> position

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
because it changes the arm position

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.589 
because it changes the arm position
relative<00:03:55.599> to<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.080> shoulders<00:03:56.680> which<00:03:56.890> makes

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
relative to the shoulders which makes

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.970 
relative to the shoulders which makes
straightness<00:03:58.599> is<00:03:58.780> so<00:03:58.930> cueing<00:03:59.230> more<00:03:59.410> difficult

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
straightness is so cueing more difficult

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.289 
straightness is so cueing more difficult
so<00:04:00.849> there's<00:04:01.269> my<00:04:01.510> screw<00:04:01.989> position<00:04:03.299> topspin

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
so there's my screw position topspin

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:19.929 
so there's my screw position topspin
