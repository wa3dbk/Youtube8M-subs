scrap wood is mounted flush with the top
of<00:01:42.680> your<00:01:42.710> board<00:01:46.240> then<00:01:47.240> you<00:01:47.270> can<00:01:47.360> reach<00:01:47.630> for

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
of your board then you can reach for

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.260 
of your board then you can reach for
your<00:01:47.990> low<00:01:48.140> angle<00:01:48.500> block<00:01:48.710> plane<00:01:49.119> notice<00:01:50.119> the

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
your low angle block plane notice the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.020 
your low angle block plane notice the

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
the front of the block plane so you want

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.399 
the front of the block plane so you want
to<00:01:55.850> make<00:01:55.970> sure<00:01:56.000> that<00:01:56.479> you're<00:01:56.810> starting<00:01:57.080> far

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
to make sure that you're starting far

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.200 
to make sure that you're starting far
enough<00:01:57.619> back<00:01:57.890> that<00:01:58.670> you're<00:01:58.820> going<00:01:58.940> to<00:01:59.000> be<00:01:59.119> able

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
enough back that you're going to be able

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.930 
enough back that you're going to be able
to<00:01:59.360> plane<00:01:59.899> the<00:01:59.930> entire<00:02:00.530> top<00:02:00.860> of<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.100> board<00:02:01.340> and

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
to plane the entire top of the board and

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.090 
to plane the entire top of the board and
not<00:02:02.119> just<00:02:02.360> start<00:02:02.810> in<00:02:02.960> the<00:02:03.049> middle<00:02:03.350> and<00:02:03.530> expect

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
not just start in the middle and expect

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.920 
not just start in the middle and expect
the<00:02:04.250> whole<00:02:04.399> board<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.820> be<00:02:04.940> smooth<00:02:05.299> just

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
the whole board to be smooth just

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.229 
the whole board to be smooth just
because<00:02:06.140> you<00:02:06.289> set<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.619> plane<00:02:06.860> down<00:02:07.100> I'm<00:02:08.030> gonna

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
because you set the plane down I'm gonna

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.389 
because you set the plane down I'm gonna
back<00:02:08.450> up<00:02:08.709> you're<00:02:09.709> gonna<00:02:09.800> find<00:02:10.009> that<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.280> end

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
back up you're gonna find that the end

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.400 
back up you're gonna find that the end

grain of the board provides a great deal
of<00:02:12.709> resistance<00:02:13.160> it's<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.910> hardest<00:02:14.300> surface

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
of resistance it's the hardest surface

forward<00:02:24.709> pressure<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:39.680> notice<00:02:40.040> as<00:02:40.190> I

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
forward pressure and you notice as I

forward pressure and you notice as I
proceed<00:02:40.730> that<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.269> scrap<00:02:42.200> wood<00:02:42.470> that<00:02:42.530> we

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
proceed that the scrap wood that we

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.130 
proceed that the scrap wood that we
applied<00:02:43.100> to<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.430> far<00:02:44.060> end<00:02:44.360> to<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.570> board<00:02:44.840> is

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.930 
applied to the far end to the board is
getting<00:02:45.320> chipped<00:02:45.709> off<00:02:45.920> this<00:02:46.519> could<00:02:46.820> have<00:02:46.910> been

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
getting chipped off this could have been
