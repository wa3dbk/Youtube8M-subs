00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
couple times and I saw the the Micra on

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.549 
couple times and I saw the the Micra on
the<00:00:12.300> map<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.660> I<00:00:12.809> went<00:00:12.990> in<00:00:13.080> there<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.440> it

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
the map and I went in there and it

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.890 
the map and I went in there and it
wasn't<00:00:13.740> there<00:00:14.040> so<00:00:14.880> I<00:00:14.910> finally<00:00:15.480> figured<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.780> out

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
wasn't there so I finally figured it out

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.450 
wasn't there so I finally figured it out
at<00:00:16.109> least<00:00:16.139> at<00:00:16.560> least<00:00:16.619> for<00:00:16.920> me<00:00:17.010> let<00:00:17.190> me<00:00:17.250> know<00:00:17.279> if

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.460 
I came in through the long entrance
where<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.180> have<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.359> cross<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.570> bridge<00:00:21.779> show

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
it on the map so anyway basically just

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.509

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
car you don't really need a fast car but

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.259 
car you don't really need a fast car but

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
honesty it didn't do anything really I

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.279 
honesty it didn't do anything really I
just<00:00:53.340> kept<00:00:54.180> flying<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.750> didn't<00:00:54.989> even<00:00:55.079> hit

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
just kept flying and it didn't even hit

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.630 
just kept flying and it didn't even hit
me<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.530> would<00:00:55.649> shoot<00:00:55.860> rockets<00:00:56.250> all<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.489> time

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
me it would shoot rockets all the time

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.250
