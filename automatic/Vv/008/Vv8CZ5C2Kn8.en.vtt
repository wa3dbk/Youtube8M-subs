altitudes we have to calculate a
specific<00:02:06.299> drop<00:02:06.539> point<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:06.959> that<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.289> vehicles

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
specific drop point so that the vehicles

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.499 
specific drop point so that the vehicles
are<00:02:08.160> not<00:02:08.310> hitting<00:02:08.610> people<00:02:09.060> on<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.269> ground
