on a circuit that's the reason you have

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.590 
on a circuit that's the reason you have

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
because if you make a mistake you'll

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.320

never<00:02:12.340> catch<00:02:12.700> up<00:02:14.670> when<00:02:15.670> this<00:02:15.760> track<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:16.030> have

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
never catch up when this track you have

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.090 
never catch up when this track you have
to<00:02:16.480> get<00:02:16.690> through<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.110> chicane<00:02:17.440> really

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
to get through the chicane really

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.890

quickly to keep your momentum up and

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.600 
quickly to keep your momentum up and
that's<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.230> massive<00:02:20.530> challenge<00:02:23.310> but<00:02:24.310> if<00:02:24.490> you

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
that's a massive challenge but if you

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.000 
that's a massive challenge but if you
don't<00:02:24.970> handle<00:02:25.540> them<00:02:25.750> well<00:02:25.990> in<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.680> Straits

don't handle them well in the Straits

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.500 
don't handle them well in the Straits
afterwards<00:02:27.580> are<00:02:27.700> going<00:02:27.850> to<00:02:27.940> be<00:02:28.030> horrible<00:02:28.360> for

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.580 
and I thought that there be room to pass
him<00:03:35.340> on<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.520> outside<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.240> to<00:03:36.480> turn<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:37.470> in

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
him on the outside and to turn it in

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.010 
him on the outside and to turn it in
front<00:03:37.860> of<00:03:37.950> him<00:03:38.150> in<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.240> end<00:03:39.390> didn't<00:03:39.810> quite

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
front of him in the end didn't quite

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.170 
front of him in the end didn't quite
work<00:03:40.200> out<00:03:40.440> I<00:03:40.500> was<00:03:40.860> on<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.070> outside<00:03:41.430> should

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
work out I was on the outside should

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.840 
work out I was on the outside should
have<00:03:42.270> been<00:03:42.360> ok<00:03:42.810> but<00:03:43.220> he<00:03:44.220> decided<00:03:44.580> that<00:03:44.670> there
