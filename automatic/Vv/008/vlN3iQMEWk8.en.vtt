00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.270
 what it feels like to come with a team to 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:09.309
 play your country because it has never 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.469
 touched and a tournament as important as 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.330
 is the liberators cup first thing 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.869
 I thank god laura to give me the 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.730
 opportunity to return to my country and 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:21.430
 first time in my career that happens to me 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.529
 come to play and more of something special with 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.980
 a former team where I started my career 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:29.500
 that does something extra and well I more than 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.989
 all thinking about enjoying it live it 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.480
 because you are rarely lived in your 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.830
 race this kind of matches and more so 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.060
 important what is the party what 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.680
 we are playing from both teams and 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.690
 well let's hope to emerge victorious 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.910
 we out there I heard a journalist 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.850
 that said the fans of holy faith do not 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.260
 he wants the delegate because that's because 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.740
 that is, the former player of the national team 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.810
 colombia played in santa fe how is that 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.630
 it is something very ironic labor the truth and 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.420
 something I've not understand me 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.790
 and to find the explanation and find it 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.730
 but I take advantage now that it is the 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.580
 opportunity to touch the subject 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.640
 something very complex happened in 2005 when 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.790
 when I went to national athletics we 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.340
 we had lost a final with them the 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.550
 next semester spent national what 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.100
 she expresses and they say is that I sold myself 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.470
 something that I really do not see the reasons 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.150
 by which they express and say say 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.680
 that kind of comments because first 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.780
 that all I leave in the second time and 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.270
 when they make us two goals 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.970
 and I believe that one as a player get to 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.040
 sell a party where you are in port 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.140
 to achieve the first title in your career 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.640
 and raise the cup and be champion because 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.200
 that I think only for one like 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.210
 footballer Priceless 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.610
 get to have a title I do not see him 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.130
 logic I do not see him apart national step no 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.050
 because I told the board 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.659
 come I want to pass national not the 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.899
 directive towards logical negotiation I 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.520
 they put three teams on their side on the table 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.560
 they say if america eleven caldas or 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.200
 national preferred national institution 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.570
 great an institution of much much 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.860
 prestige and good achieved important things 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.350
 with national but never comes to understand 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.600
 because the form of what they express 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.640
 from me, I respect him, I am a 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.340
 professional in every sense they 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.290
 Whatever they say is their mouth they have their 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.180
 right and can express what you want 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.620
 what I hope I'll leave a little clear 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.569
 this kind of comment because if it is 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.080
 very ill for one to listen to that class 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.080
 of comments
