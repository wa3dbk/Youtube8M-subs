the<00:00:14.190> engine<00:00:14.960> we<00:00:15.960> started<00:00:16.440> out<00:00:16.590> by<00:00:17.430> piping<00:00:18.320> the

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
the engine we started out by piping the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.640 
the engine we started out by piping the
gases<00:00:19.800> in<00:00:19.980> through<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.550> tee<00:00:20.880> fitting<00:00:21.750> directly

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
looking at both our cars we noticed that

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.840 
looking at both our cars we noticed that
there<00:00:30.000> were<00:00:30.330> differences<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.529> way<00:00:31.850> that

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
there were differences in the way that

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.130 
there were differences in the way that
the<00:00:33.239> engine<00:00:34.170> was<00:00:34.680> plumbed<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.540> how<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
the engine was plumbed and how the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.500 
the engine was plumbed and how the
sensors<00:00:38.070> are<00:00:38.960> oriented<00:00:40.940> if<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.120> look<00:00:42.300> over

the reason we have made this change is

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.789 
the reason we have made this change is
that<00:01:30.350> injecting<00:01:31.350> hho<00:01:32.340> gas<00:01:33.409> into<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.439> intake

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
that injecting hho gas into the intake

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.399 
that injecting hho gas into the intake

circuit in it inside the little box

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.590 
circuit in it inside the little box
there<00:03:26.230> is<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.380> relay<00:03:26.830> which<00:03:27.490> is<00:03:27.640> energized<00:03:28.150> by

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
there is a relay which is energized by

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.160 
there is a relay which is energized by
power<00:03:28.870> on<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:30.070> hydrogen<00:03:30.550> generator<00:03:31.170> so

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
power on the hydrogen generator so

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.780 
power on the hydrogen generator so
whenever<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.710> generators<00:03:33.220> turned<00:03:33.580> on

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
whenever the generators turned on

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.110 
whenever the generators turned on
circuit<00:03:34.570> is<00:03:34.690> activated<00:03:35.410> and<00:03:35.550> a<00:03:36.550> correction

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
circuit is activated and a correction

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.070 
circuit is activated and a correction
voltage<00:03:37.630> tells<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:38.710> ECU<00:03:39.370> to<00:03:40.300> lean<00:03:40.540> back<00:03:40.840> the

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
voltage tells the ECU to lean back the

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.400 
voltage tells the ECU to lean back the
fuel

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.950 

okay<00:03:48.410> so<00:03:48.470> we're<00:03:48.800> on<00:03:48.830> the<00:03:49.130> road<00:03:49.340> and<00:03:49.670> we're

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:49.960 
okay so we're on the road and we're

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.290 
okay so we're on the road and we're
testing<00:03:50.960> the<00:03:51.230> new<00:03:51.380> configuration<00:03:52.310> in<00:03:52.880> the

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
testing the new configuration in the

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.650 
testing the new configuration in the
ford<00:03:53.570> escort<00:03:53.780> and<00:03:54.710> we've<00:03:55.430> reformulated<00:03:56.120> the

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
ford escort and we've reformulated the

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.830 
ford escort and we've reformulated the
solution<00:03:57.170> in<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.410> generator<00:03:57.890> so<00:03:58.280> that<00:03:58.490> it<00:03:58.640> is

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
solution in the generator so that it is

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.170 
solution in the generator so that it is
in<00:03:59.840> a<00:03:59.990> quart<00:04:00.290> of<00:04:00.470> water<00:04:01.900> actually<00:04:02.900> it's<00:04:03.620> a

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
in a quart of water actually it's a

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.990 
in a quart of water actually it's a
total<00:04:05.180> of<00:04:05.360> one<00:04:05.570> quart<00:04:06.610> mixed<00:04:07.610> with

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
total of one quart mixed with

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.330 
total of one quart mixed with
twenty-five<00:04:08.660> percent<00:04:08.950> rubbing<00:04:09.950> alcohol<00:04:10.130> and

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
twenty-five percent rubbing alcohol and

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.650 
twenty-five percent rubbing alcohol and
approximately<00:04:13.340> three<00:04:13.730> tablespoons<00:04:14.660> of<00:04:14.930> soda

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
approximately three tablespoons of soda

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.039 
approximately three tablespoons of soda
engines<00:04:17.660> running<00:04:17.930> very<00:04:18.260> smoothly<00:04:18.590> right<00:04:19.040> now

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
engines running very smoothly right now

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.510 
engines running very smoothly right now
we've<00:04:21.049> even<00:04:21.799> come<00:04:22.100> to<00:04:22.130> several<00:04:22.880> stops<00:04:23.150> and<00:04:24.520> the

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
we've even come to several stops and the

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.960 
we've even come to several stops and the
engine<00:04:25.790> idles<00:04:26.180> perfectly<00:04:26.840> well<00:04:27.050> I<00:04:27.700> think<00:04:28.700> it

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
engine idles perfectly well I think it

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.200 
engine idles perfectly well I think it
really<00:04:29.180> is<00:04:29.450> an<00:04:30.110> advantage<00:04:30.830> to<00:04:30.860> be<00:04:31.580> injecting

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
really is an advantage to be injecting

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.300 
really is an advantage to be injecting
the<00:04:32.919> hho<00:04:33.919> gas<00:04:34.510> before<00:04:35.510> the<00:04:36.140> butterfly<00:04:36.710> in<00:04:37.100> the

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
the hho gas before the butterfly in the

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.360 
the hho gas before the butterfly in the
intake<00:04:37.960> because<00:04:38.960> when<00:04:39.320> you<00:04:39.440> come<00:04:39.620> to<00:04:39.890> a<00:04:39.919> stop

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
intake because when you come to a stop

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.940 
intake because when you come to a stop
and<00:04:40.610> let<00:04:40.760> your<00:04:40.940> foot<00:04:41.150> off<00:04:41.330> throttle<00:04:41.950> that

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
and let your foot off throttle that

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.570 
and let your foot off throttle that
butterfly<00:04:43.490> closes<00:04:44.120> down<00:04:44.360> and<00:04:45.580> it's

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
butterfly closes down and it's

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.960 
butterfly closes down and it's
controlling<00:04:47.480> the<00:04:48.310> flow<00:04:49.310> of<00:04:49.900> outside<00:04:50.900> air<00:04:51.140> and

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
controlling the flow of outside air and

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:58.900 
controlling the flow of outside air and
hho<00:04:52.970> gases<00:04:54.070> into<00:04:55.070> the<00:04:55.370> intake<00:04:56.860> so<00:04:57.860> the<00:04:58.130> proof

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
hho gases into the intake so the proof

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.340 
hho gases into the intake so the proof
is<00:04:59.180> in<00:04:59.210> the<00:04:59.390> pudding<00:04:59.840> as<00:05:00.050> they<00:05:00.080> say<00:05:00.530> and<00:05:02.350> we're

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
is in the pudding as they say and we're

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.290 
is in the pudding as they say and we're
traveling<00:05:04.190> at<00:05:04.400> some<00:05:05.240> very<00:05:05.479> slow<00:05:05.780> speeds<00:05:06.169> here

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
traveling at some very slow speeds here

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.219 
traveling at some very slow speeds here
without<00:05:08.440> any<00:05:09.550> ill<00:05:10.550> effects

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
without any ill effects

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.629 
without any ill effects
so<00:05:13.229> we're<00:05:13.320> going<00:05:13.380> to<00:05:13.500> get<00:05:13.620> it<00:05:13.800> try<00:05:14.280> to<00:05:14.310> get<00:05:14.520> it

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
so we're going to get it try to get it

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:26.420 
so we're going to get it try to get it
up<00:05:14.760> to<00:05:15.800> 60<00:05:16.800> on<00:05:17.010> the<00:05:17.190> road<00:05:17.340> up<00:05:17.580> ahead

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.650 

okay<00:05:27.150> we<00:05:27.330> got<00:05:27.480> it<00:05:27.510> up<00:05:27.720> to<00:05:27.750> 60<00:05:28.320> and<00:05:29.360> we've<00:05:30.360> got

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
okay we got it up to 60 and we've got

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.430 
okay we got it up to 60 and we've got
plenty<00:05:31.530> of<00:05:31.710> power<00:05:32.150> and<00:05:34.400> just<00:05:35.400> running<00:05:35.790> great

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
plenty of power and just running great

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.600 
plenty of power and just running great
so<00:05:38.000> obviously<00:05:39.380> we<00:05:40.380> chose<00:05:40.620> the<00:05:40.800> right<00:05:40.920> spot<00:05:41.370> to

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
so obviously we chose the right spot to

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.510 
so obviously we chose the right spot to
inject<00:05:42.030> their<00:05:42.180> hho<00:05:42.840> gas<00:05:43.080> on<00:05:43.380> this<00:05:43.560> vehicle<00:05:43.830> and

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
inject their hho gas on this vehicle and

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.070 
inject their hho gas on this vehicle and
the<00:05:45.450> next<00:05:45.660> step<00:05:45.810> is<00:05:46.200> to<00:05:46.230> recheck<00:05:46.860> our<00:05:48.080> fuel

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
the next step is to recheck our fuel

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.490 
the next step is to recheck our fuel
economy<00:05:50.480> well<00:05:51.480> that<00:05:51.660> it'll<00:05:52.020> take<00:05:52.200> a<00:05:52.230> while

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
economy well that it'll take a while

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.910 
economy well that it'll take a while
we'll<00:05:52.800> have<00:05:53.040> to<00:05:53.310> probably<00:05:54.300> take<00:05:54.900> a<00:05:55.620> good

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920 
we'll have to probably take a good

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
we'll have to probably take a good
80-mile<00:05:56.430> trip<00:05:56.460> and<00:05:57.350> carefully<00:05:58.400> top<00:05:59.400> off<00:05:59.670> the

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
80-mile trip and carefully top off the

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.030 
80-mile trip and carefully top off the
fuel<00:05:59.970> that's<00:06:00.600> beginning<00:06:01.110> and<00:06:01.380> end<00:06:01.650> of<00:06:01.800> the

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 
fuel that's beginning and end of the

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.730 
fuel that's beginning and end of the
trip<00:06:02.630> and<00:06:03.630> we'll<00:06:03.840> have<00:06:03.990> to<00:06:04.170> repeat<00:06:04.500> this

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
trip and we'll have to repeat this

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.960 
trip and we'll have to repeat this
several<00:06:04.980> times<00:06:05.160> to<00:06:05.700> verify<00:06:06.150> our<00:06:06.180> results
