00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:06.810
 Hey, everyone, everything beauty. 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.900
 it's me once again here games br 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.030
 and in this tutorial wringing you a 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.839
 how to update the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.270
 freestyle on 775 review by top gg 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.970
 which I consider a very simple way 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.460
 to do so, including not only this 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.680
 this is this update you have like 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.109
 do as it does other applications you 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.929
 has to install in this way but the 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.090
 today's issue is to update the 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.460
 freestyle in review 775 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.840
 So what are we going to need? 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.320
 first from the top gg 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.809
 I already left a link from the video for you guys. 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.350
 and how to tg we will do it 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.840
 through wool through ftp 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.930
 it is not enough simply to select 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:57.690
 in alan just check here in this box 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.680
 in this boxing is to type ipê 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.290
 that appears in front of you and a 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.729
 tip I give and the people I think 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.130
 very important to the well 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.700
 interesting there are consoles that 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.640
 every time you restart it it tends 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.390
 to make the exchange of ipê and the high gg 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.979
 some updates from above gg it 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.110
 reset to freestyle only 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.850
 so it's interesting whenever you go 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.509
 make the use of the high spin for any 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.180
 procedure you sit in lanusse 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.159
 your fixed annual ip network settings 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.579
 pro your xbox 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.220
 it always keep that same default ip 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:41.150
 and in this boxing you will dictate how 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.329
 I already said the ip of your xbox 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:49.110
 good down here you will select the 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.250
 freestyle in revision 775 is the version 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.380
 her too 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.659
 below in Spanish there are people who 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.820
 Likes I do not particularly like it 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.850
 I like the default version 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.130
 This is already updated, okay, and you 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.659
 simply click on this button 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.280
 here only just this 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.050
 so I will not do now we 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.700
 because I just did this 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:17.360
 my idh procedure 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.890
 which again set everything up there but he 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.940
 just give a message here 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.680
 down 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.349
 and at the end it will appear that it is 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.750
 done or will appear next to the name I 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:30.470
 I do not know the right head right now but it's just 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:34.430
 This is just waiting to finish the process. 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.250
 When it's over, we'll do it. 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.709
 the part of xbox because it will be created 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.569
 a new page with your freestyle and me 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.120
 I'll show you now. 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.690
 The next step is what people 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.930
 will do in the handset beauty 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:03:00.950
 Come on, you talk about driving. 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:03:03.200

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.730
 You can notice that there are two 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.099
 matches here the new one that is written 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.400

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:21.019
 I'm starting as old as we know 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.299

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.130

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:29.329

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:32.090

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:36.650

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.260
