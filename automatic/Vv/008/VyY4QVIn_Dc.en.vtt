00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
nut code you can select your code and

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.119

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.260 
button to turn now but now we need to
enter<00:01:16.110> your<00:01:16.140> code<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.520> was<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.470> so

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
enter your code so it was like that so

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.530 
enter your code so it was like that so
left<00:01:21.270> right<00:01:21.570> all<00:01:22.020> right<00:01:22.520> and<00:01:23.520> I'll<00:01:24.210> going<00:01:24.450> to

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
left right all right and I'll going to

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.340 
left right all right and I'll going to
lock<00:01:24.780> or<00:01:25.350> when<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> screen<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.790> off<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:28.049> can

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
lock or when the screen is off you can

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.160 
lock or when the screen is off you can
do<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:29.329> and<00:01:30.680> it<00:01:31.680> will<00:01:31.740> turn<00:01:31.920> screen<00:01:32.369> on<00:01:32.600> so<00:01:33.600> this

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
do it and it will turn screen on so this

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.420 
do it and it will turn screen on so this
adds<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.860> bit<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.040> security<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.970> your<00:01:36.150> LG<00:01:36.630> g2<00:01:37.430> so

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
adds a bit of security to your LG g2 so

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.520 
adds a bit of security to your LG g2 so
if<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.030> for<00:01:39.630> time<00:01:39.780> we'll<00:01:39.900> do<00:01:39.990> another<00:01:40.020> pattern

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
if I for time we'll do another pattern

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.410 
if I for time we'll do another pattern
like<00:01:42.500> it<00:01:43.500> won't<00:01:43.770> turn<00:01:43.950> on<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.369> if<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:44.970> do<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
like it won't turn on and if you do the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.420 
like it won't turn on and if you do the
right<00:01:45.600> pattern<00:01:47.600> it<00:01:48.600> real<00:01:48.930> turn-on<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.979> if<00:01:50.250> it's

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
right pattern it real turn-on so if it's

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.609 
right pattern it real turn-on so if it's
on<00:01:50.790> table<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:54.290> premium<00:01:55.290> screen

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
on table like that premium screen

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.010 
on table like that premium screen
brightness<00:01:57.380> so<00:01:59.360> without<00:02:00.360> sup<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.780> make<00:02:00.899> it

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
brightness so without sup to make it

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.090 
brightness so without sup to make it
down<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.579> now

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.570 

you<00:02:06.909> can<00:02:07.060> see<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.689> screen<00:02:07.990> turns<00:02:08.289> on<00:02:08.619> so<00:02:09.550> a
