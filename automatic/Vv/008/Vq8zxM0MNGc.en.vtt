00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
high demand for Canon FD lenses when

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.040 
high demand for Canon FD lenses when

using them for making movies and I mean

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.440

we<00:02:50.200> made<00:02:50.440> a<00:02:50.470> video<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:50.950> while<00:02:51.160> back<00:02:51.220> about<00:02:51.970> using

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
we made a video a while back about using

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.150 
we made a video a while back about using
FD<00:02:52.720> lenses<00:02:53.110> that's<00:02:53.410> why<00:02:53.590> I<00:02:53.620> ended<00:02:53.920> up<00:02:53.980> with

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
FD lenses that's why I ended up with

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.130 
FD lenses that's why I ended up with
them<00:02:54.340> but<00:02:55.000> neither<00:02:55.480> is<00:02:55.630> a<00:02:55.720> bigger<00:02:55.870> higher

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
them but neither is a bigger higher

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.360 
them but neither is a bigger higher
demand<00:02:56.500> you're<00:02:56.800> going<00:02:56.920> to<00:02:56.980> be<00:02:57.070> paying<00:02:57.220> a<00:02:57.340> lot

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
demand you're going to be paying a lot

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.930 
demand you're going to be paying a lot
more<00:02:57.520> for<00:02:57.700> them<00:02:57.970> but<00:02:58.380> they're<00:02:59.380> good<00:02:59.560> for

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
more for them but they're good for

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.130 
more for them but they're good for
photographing<00:03:00.940> as<00:03:01.030> well<00:03:01.209> so<00:03:01.750> let's<00:03:01.930> take<00:03:02.110> a

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
photographing as well so let's take a

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:09.449 
photographing as well so let's take a
few<00:03:02.440> shots<00:03:05.970> so<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.360> meter<00:03:07.989> inside<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.739> FTB<00:03:09.190> is

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
few shots so the meter inside the FTB is

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.820 
few shots so the meter inside the FTB is
a<00:03:10.030> pretty<00:03:10.420> simple<00:03:10.810> spot<00:03:11.350> meter<00:03:11.590> which

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
a pretty simple spot meter which

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.410 
a pretty simple spot meter which
basically<00:03:12.100> means<00:03:12.400> wherever<00:03:12.670> you<00:03:12.940> point<00:03:13.209> the

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
basically means wherever you point the

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.360 
basically means wherever you point the
middle<00:03:13.660> of<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:13.930> camera<00:03:14.440> it's<00:03:15.010> going<00:03:15.190> to<00:03:15.250> be

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
middle of the camera it's going to be

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.000 
middle of the camera it's going to be
metering<00:03:16.060> for<00:03:16.090> there<00:03:16.540> so<00:03:16.930> if<00:03:17.290> we're<00:03:17.739> taking<00:03:17.830> a

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
metering for there so if we're taking a

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.680 
metering for there so if we're taking a
landscape<00:03:18.400> shot<00:03:18.610> for<00:03:18.940> example<00:03:19.300> we're<00:03:19.540> aiming

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
landscape shot for example we're aiming

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.080 
landscape shot for example we're aiming
up<00:03:20.020> and<00:03:20.260> we're<00:03:20.650> sort<00:03:20.800> of<00:03:20.830> getting<00:03:20.980> 1/3<00:03:21.760> of<00:03:21.940> the

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
up and we're sort of getting 1/3 of the

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.610 
up and we're sort of getting 1/3 of the
shot<00:03:22.360> we'll<00:03:22.720> take<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:22.900> shot<00:03:23.080> here<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.380> show<00:03:23.500> you

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
shot we'll take a shot here to show you

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.560 
shot we'll take a shot here to show you
that<00:03:23.650> looks<00:03:24.100> like<00:03:25.050> and<00:03:27.090> you<00:03:28.090> can<00:03:28.180> kind<00:03:28.360> of<00:03:28.390> see

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
that looks like and you can kind of see

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.030 
that looks like and you can kind of see
that<00:03:28.720> we're<00:03:28.870> aiming<00:03:29.020> mostly<00:03:29.500> at<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.680> sky<00:03:29.890> in

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
that we're aiming mostly at the sky in

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.910 
that we're aiming mostly at the sky in
that<00:03:30.190> shot<00:03:30.459> but<00:03:31.270> to<00:03:31.600> actually<00:03:31.720> meter<00:03:32.200> for<00:03:32.620> what

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
that shot but to actually meter for what

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.770 
that shot but to actually meter for what
we<00:03:33.040> want<00:03:33.340> on<00:03:33.580> the<00:03:33.610> ground<00:03:33.940> you<00:03:34.270> need<00:03:34.390> to<00:03:34.510> point

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
we want on the ground you need to point

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.590 
we want on the ground you need to point
the<00:03:35.050> meter<00:03:35.260> at<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:35.800> ground<00:03:36.130> first<00:03:36.430> then<00:03:36.730> line

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
the meter at the ground first then line

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.760 
the meter at the ground first then line
up<00:03:37.750> your<00:03:37.900> aperture<00:03:38.550> then<00:03:39.550> recompose<00:03:40.330> and

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
up your aperture then recompose and

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.259 
up your aperture then recompose and
we're<00:03:41.770> just<00:03:41.920> focusing<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:42.489> infinity<00:03:42.970> so<00:03:43.239> that

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
we're just focusing to infinity so that

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.420 
we're just focusing to infinity so that
way<00:03:43.840> we<00:03:44.019> can<00:03:44.170> get<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.500> proper<00:03:44.800> shot<00:03:45.040> that<00:03:45.280> we

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
way we can get the proper shot that we

00:03:45.430 --> 00:04:54.240 
way we can get the proper shot that we
need<00:03:45.610> and<00:03:45.820> get<00:03:45.910> it<00:03:46.060> nicely<00:03:46.510> exposed

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
very nice actually do want it done keep

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:16.450 
very nice actually do want it done keep
it<00:05:16.070> down

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
it down

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.480 
it down
that's<00:05:17.330> the<00:05:17.510> ticker<00:05:17.660> roll<00:05:17.900> then<00:05:18.890> you<00:05:19.340> just

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
that's the ticker roll then you just

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.970 
that's the ticker roll then you just
spend<00:05:19.760> about<00:05:20.180> four<00:05:20.870> years<00:05:21.169> of<00:05:21.410> your<00:05:21.500> life<00:05:21.650> I'm

and<00:05:28.940> stuff<00:05:29.150> like<00:05:29.270> that<00:05:29.480> will<00:05:30.140> have<00:05:30.290> automatic

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
rewinding but you're going to do the

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:34.740 
rewinding but you're going to do the
seal<00:05:33.950> fashion<00:05:34.340> way

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750

this<00:05:35.750> does<00:05:35.990> not<00:05:36.110> make<00:05:36.290> it<00:05:36.410> practical<00:05:36.890> for

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
this does not make it practical for

this does not make it practical for

speed shooting of course you may have

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.100 
speed shooting of course you may have
there<00:05:40.580> you<00:05:40.640> go<00:05:40.730> you'll<00:05:40.910> feel<00:05:41.120> it<00:05:41.270> latch<00:05:41.840> off

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
there you go you'll feel it latch off

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.020 
there you go you'll feel it latch off
then<00:05:42.890> you<00:05:43.070> want<00:05:43.220> to<00:05:43.280> pull<00:05:43.370> that<00:05:43.400> up<00:05:43.550> that

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
then you want to pull that up that

that's the Kalin fqv ql this was

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.140 
that's the Kalin fqv ql this was
actually<00:06:00.350> the<00:06:00.560> first<00:06:00.980> film<00:06:01.310> camera<00:06:01.700> I've<00:06:01.910> got

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
actually the first film camera I've got

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.570 
actually the first film camera I've got
and<00:06:02.410> I've<00:06:03.410> probably<00:06:03.590> had<00:06:03.770> it<00:06:03.890> for<00:06:04.040> nearly<00:06:04.430> a

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
and I've probably had it for nearly a

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.430 
and I've probably had it for nearly a
year<00:06:04.610> now<00:06:05.000> and<00:06:05.210> it's<00:06:05.750> a<00:06:05.870> great<00:06:06.020> camera<00:06:06.260> to

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
year now and it's a great camera to

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.020 
year now and it's a great camera to
think<00:06:06.590> about<00:06:06.830> if<00:06:07.040> you're<00:06:07.100> trying<00:06:07.520> to<00:06:07.550> get<00:06:07.640> into

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
think about if you're trying to get into

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.770 
think about if you're trying to get into
sort<00:06:08.450> of<00:06:08.540> basic<00:06:09.250> 35<00:06:10.250> millimeter<00:06:10.700> SLR<00:06:11.420> film

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
sort of basic 35 millimeter SLR film

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.620 
sort of basic 35 millimeter SLR film
cameras<00:06:12.250> it's<00:06:13.250> very<00:06:13.550> familiar<00:06:13.760> to<00:06:14.030> use<00:06:14.420> in

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
cameras it's very familiar to use in

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.760 
cameras it's very familiar to use in
like<00:06:14.840> a<00:06:14.870> DSLR<00:06:15.500> and<00:06:15.890> I<00:06:16.520> mean<00:06:16.790> it's<00:06:17.350> manual<00:06:18.350> focus

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
like a DSLR and I mean it's manual focus

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.120 
like a DSLR and I mean it's manual focus
but<00:06:19.130> other<00:06:19.850> than<00:06:20.030> that<00:06:20.120> it's<00:06:20.830> you<00:06:21.830> know<00:06:21.890> it

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
but other than that it's you know it

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.370 
but other than that it's you know it
feels<00:06:22.310> fairly<00:06:22.790> similar<00:06:23.240> and<00:06:23.540> it<00:06:23.780> works<00:06:24.020> fairly

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
feels fairly similar and it works fairly

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.040 
feels fairly similar and it works fairly
similarly<00:06:24.920> you<00:06:25.160> get<00:06:25.340> pretty<00:06:26.210> similar<00:06:26.630> images

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
similarly you get pretty similar images

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.620 
similarly you get pretty similar images
and<00:06:27.260> of<00:06:28.070> course<00:06:28.280> the<00:06:28.430> main<00:06:28.580> benefit<00:06:29.060> to<00:06:29.360> using

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 
and of course the main benefit to using

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.980 
and of course the main benefit to using
35-millimeter<00:06:30.620> and<00:06:31.040> is<00:06:31.660> that<00:06:32.660> it's<00:06:32.780> full

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 
35-millimeter and is that it's full

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.920 
35-millimeter and is that it's full
frame<00:06:33.260> so<00:06:33.950> you<00:06:34.010> might<00:06:34.400> be<00:06:34.940> looking<00:06:35.240> at<00:06:35.360> bigger

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
frame so you might be looking at bigger

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.840 
frame so you might be looking at bigger
dslr's<00:06:36.470> like<00:06:36.650> the<00:06:36.740> 5d<00:06:36.980> or<00:06:37.340> something<00:06:37.700> and

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:37.850 
dslr's like the 5d or something and

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.190 
dslr's like the 5d or something and
they're<00:06:38.120> I<00:06:38.300> don't<00:06:38.419> know<00:06:38.660> they're<00:06:38.810> like<00:06:38.960> 3

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.200 
they're I don't know they're like 3

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.840 
they're I don't know they're like 3
grand<00:06:39.230> or<00:06:39.650> something<00:06:39.740> stupid<00:06:40.070> but<00:06:40.669> you<00:06:40.760> can

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:40.850 
grand or something stupid but you can

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.760 
grand or something stupid but you can
pick<00:06:40.970> up<00:06:41.150> like<00:06:41.540> a<00:06:41.570> film<00:06:41.900> camera<00:06:42.080> like<00:06:42.350> this<00:06:42.560> and

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:42.770 
pick up like a film camera like this and

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.730 
pick up like a film camera like this and
have<00:06:43.100> a<00:06:43.400> full-frame<00:06:44.000> camera<00:06:44.480> and<00:06:44.690> get<00:06:44.990> you

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
have a full-frame camera and get you

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.560 
have a full-frame camera and get you
know<00:06:45.860> your<00:06:46.040> proper<00:06:46.370> lens<00:06:46.580> size<00:06:47.030> so<00:06:47.330> I<00:06:47.360> mean

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:47.570 
know your proper lens size so I mean

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.450 
know your proper lens size so I mean
this<00:06:47.690> is<00:06:47.810> a<00:06:47.840> 24<00:06:48.290> millimeter<00:06:48.500> and<00:06:48.890> there's<00:06:49.310> no

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 
this is a 24 millimeter and there's no

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.210 
this is a 24 millimeter and there's no
crop<00:06:49.730> so<00:06:50.030> it's<00:06:50.360> literally<00:06:50.630> 24<00:06:51.230> but<00:06:51.890> say<00:06:52.100> if

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:52.220 
crop so it's literally 24 but say if

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.950 
crop so it's literally 24 but say if
you're<00:06:52.340> using<00:06:52.550> like<00:06:53.090> a<00:06:53.150> crop<00:06:53.419> sensor<00:06:53.600> DSLR

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 
you're using like a crop sensor DSLR

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.159 
you're using like a crop sensor DSLR
camera<00:06:54.680> and<00:06:55.270> the<00:06:56.270> widest<00:06:56.630> you<00:06:56.690> can<00:06:56.840> maybe<00:06:56.930> get

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:57.169 
camera and the widest you can maybe get

00:06:57.169 --> 00:06:59.830 
camera and the widest you can maybe get
easily<00:06:57.950> is<00:06:58.400> maybe<00:06:58.669> like<00:06:58.880> 50<00:06:59.330> or<00:06:59.540> something

00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 
easily is maybe like 50 or something

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.990 
easily is maybe like 50 or something
like<00:06:59.930> that<00:06:59.990> with<00:07:00.950> the<00:07:01.100> crop<00:07:01.310> on<00:07:01.550> sort<00:07:01.940> of

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 
like that with the crop on sort of

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.210 
like that with the crop on sort of
wide-angle<00:07:02.479> lenses<00:07:02.750> but<00:07:03.650> yeah<00:07:03.740> it's<00:07:04.040> a<00:07:04.070> pretty

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:04.220 
wide-angle lenses but yeah it's a pretty

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.180 
wide-angle lenses but yeah it's a pretty
simple<00:07:04.520> camera<00:07:04.910> to<00:07:05.000> use<00:07:05.180> and<00:07:05.950> there's<00:07:06.950> no

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.190 
simple camera to use and there's no

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.790
