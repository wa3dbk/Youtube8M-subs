been working like on a lot of things in
parallel<00:00:05.549> and<00:00:05.790> I've<00:00:06.540> kind<00:00:06.750> of<00:00:06.810> we<00:00:07.170> finally<00:00:07.440> got

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
parallel and I've kind of we finally got

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.330 
parallel and I've kind of we finally got
a<00:00:08.429> new<00:00:09.120> set<00:00:09.420> of<00:00:09.570> car<00:00:09.960> shaders<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.410> things<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:11.070> a

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
a new set of car shaders and things to a

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.370 
a new set of car shaders and things to a
standard<00:00:12.210> we<00:00:12.360> actually<00:00:12.630> like<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.080> kind<00:00:13.259> of

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
standard we actually like the kind of

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.900 
standard we actually like the kind of
the<00:00:13.530> previous<00:00:13.980> shaders<00:00:14.340> on<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.490> previous<00:00:14.759> car

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
the previous shaders on a previous car

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.849 
the previous shaders on a previous car
but<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.179> looks<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.420> bit<00:00:15.509> funky<00:00:15.960> didn't<00:00:16.770> look

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
but it looks a bit funky didn't look

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.220 
but it looks a bit funky didn't look
quite<00:00:17.010> right<00:00:17.210> some<00:00:18.210> people<00:00:18.480> said<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.960> looked<00:00:19.140> a

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
quite right some people said it looked a

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.320 
quite right some people said it looked a
bit<00:00:19.260> odd<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.949> yeah<00:00:20.310> we<00:00:20.490> won't<00:00:20.609> like<00:00:21.090> paint

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
bit odd and yeah we won't like paint

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.080 
bit odd and yeah we won't like paint
before<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:22.439> egg<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:23.220> I've<00:00:23.760> done<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.910> bit<00:00:24.060> of

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
before the egg so I've done a bit of

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.779 
before the egg so I've done a bit of
work<00:00:24.240> on<00:00:24.420> them<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.279> our<00:00:26.430> kind<00:00:26.580> of

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
work on them and so this is our kind of

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.929 
work on them and so this is our kind of
our<00:00:27.090> new<00:00:27.269> Patriot<00:00:27.689> let's<00:00:27.900> chew<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.349> kind<00:00:28.590> of

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
our new Patriot let's chew the kind of

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.709 
our new Patriot let's chew the kind of
occasion<00:00:31.189> there<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.250> go<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:32.640> cash<00:00:32.910> blue<00:00:33.180> so

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
occasion there you go so cash blue so

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.990 
occasion there you go so cash blue so
the<00:00:33.809> reflections<00:00:34.320> are<00:00:34.500> kind<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:35.100> lot<00:00:35.969> more

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
the reflections are kind of a lot more

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.060 
the reflections are kind of a lot more
realistic<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.899> lot<00:00:37.050> more<00:00:37.200> toned<00:00:37.530> down<00:00:37.739> with

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
realistic and a lot more toned down with

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.100 
realistic and a lot more toned down with
specular<00:00:38.489> highlights<00:00:38.989> embarrassing<00:00:39.989> so

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
specular highlights embarrassing so

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.250 
specular highlights embarrassing so
these<00:00:40.230> are<00:00:40.379> one<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.770> new<00:00:41.730> car<00:00:42.000> bodies<00:00:42.360> done

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
these are one of the new car bodies done

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.560 
these are one of the new car bodies done
by<00:00:43.410> Daffy<00:00:43.800> done<00:00:43.980> by<00:00:44.100> Andrew<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.700> have<00:00:44.879> door

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
by Daffy done by Andrew that have door

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.220 
by Daffy done by Andrew that have door
seems<00:00:45.930> in<00:00:46.200> them<00:00:46.700> things<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.879> lot<00:00:48.059> nicer<00:00:48.239> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
seems in them things a lot nicer the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.990 
seems in them things a lot nicer the
plastic<00:00:49.649> surrounds<00:00:50.039> around<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.309> windows<00:00:50.610> few

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
plastic surrounds around the windows few

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.750 
plastic surrounds around the windows few
more<00:00:51.149> details<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.930> Jeremy<00:00:52.800> bit<00:00:52.920> nicer<00:00:53.100> so

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
more details and Jeremy bit nicer so

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.290 
more details and Jeremy bit nicer so
yeah<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.149> much<00:00:54.570> happier<00:00:55.969> moved<00:00:56.969> away<00:00:57.090> all

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
yeah so much happier moved away all

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.340 
yeah so much happier moved away all
these<00:00:57.480> look<00:00:59.180> it's<00:01:00.180> not<00:01:00.359> just<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.750> car<00:01:01.140> what<00:01:01.289> he

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
these look it's not just a car what he

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.349 
these look it's not just a car what he
showed<00:01:01.500> has<00:01:01.649> been<00:01:01.829> reworked<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.760> headlight

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
showed has been reworked the headlight

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.950 
showed has been reworked the headlight
shaders<00:01:03.840> have<00:01:04.110> been<00:01:04.260> reworked<00:01:04.680> and

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
shaders have been reworked and

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.820 
shaders have been reworked and
headlights<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:07.260> kind<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:09.530> not<00:01:10.530> quite

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
headlights have kind of not quite

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.310 
headlights have kind of not quite
refractions<00:01:11.549> but<00:01:11.939> then<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.420> don't<00:01:13.049> know<00:01:13.110> what<00:01:13.290> I

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
refractions but then I don't know what I

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.390 
refractions but then I don't know what I
really<00:01:13.619> describe<00:01:14.570> that<00:01:15.650> is<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.860> slatted

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
really describe that is the slatted

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.990 
really describe that is the slatted
textured<00:01:18.210> glass<00:01:18.420> look<00:01:18.869> looks<00:01:19.110> yeah<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.470> for<00:01:19.680> now

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
textured glass look looks yeah I for now

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.830 
textured glass look looks yeah I for now
although<00:01:21.000> they<00:01:21.119> had<00:01:21.240> lice<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.420> turn<00:01:21.810> over

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
although they had lice and turn over

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.450 
although they had lice and turn over
there<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> little<00:01:22.350> bit<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.770> little<00:01:23.009> bit<00:01:23.250> too

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
there a little bit a little bit too

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.859 
there a little bit a little bit too
reflective<00:01:23.670> we<00:01:24.060> still<00:01:24.240> got<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.390> work<00:01:24.540> on<00:01:24.659> them

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
reflective we still got to work on them

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.810 
reflective we still got to work on them
you're<00:01:25.530> not<00:01:25.680> speaking<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.250> go<00:01:26.369> with<00:01:26.520> all<00:01:26.640> these

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
you're not speaking to go with all these

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.910 
you're not speaking to go with all these
values<00:01:27.270> but<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.930> general<00:01:28.259> project<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.799> in

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
values but the general project is in

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.710 
values but the general project is in
place<00:01:29.130> anyway<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.640> might<00:01:29.909> just<00:01:29.939> go<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.240> form<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
place anyway I might just go to form the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.410 
place anyway I might just go to form the
car<00:01:30.930> body<00:01:31.340> good<00:01:32.340> look<00:01:32.579> earlier<00:01:32.970> we<00:01:33.360> were

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
car body good look earlier we were

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.429 
car body good look earlier we were
playing<00:01:33.689> around<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.470> stretch<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.610> out

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
playing around so stretch that out

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.440 
playing around so stretch that out
stretch<00:01:37.439> that

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.940 

something<00:01:41.450> like<00:01:41.570> that<00:01:41.600> I'll<00:01:42.530> tighten<00:01:42.740> I've

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
something like that I'll tighten I've
