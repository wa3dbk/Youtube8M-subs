incredible so let's go ahead and open it

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.460 
incredible so let's go ahead and open it
up<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.760> take<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.970> look<00:00:21.210> now<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:21.869> isn't<00:00:22.140> out

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470

up and take a look now this isn't out
yet<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.890> comes<00:00:23.130> out<00:00:23.310> Oh<00:00:23.550> probably<00:00:24.449> next<00:00:24.689> week

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
yet it comes out Oh probably next week

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.759 
yet it comes out Oh probably next week
although<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.260> don't<00:00:25.380> have<00:00:25.590> an<00:00:25.680> official

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
although I don't have an official

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.640 
although I don't have an official
release<00:00:26.369> date<00:00:26.400> should<00:00:27.240> be<00:00:27.300> about<00:00:27.570> 2<00:00:27.840> 99<00:00:28.380> with<00:00:28.619> a

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
release date should be about 2 99 with a

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.019 
release date should be about 2 99 with a
two-year<00:00:29.010> contract<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:29.640> it's<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.789> little<00:00:29.910> bit

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
two-year contract so it's a little bit

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.569 
two-year contract so it's a little bit
expensive<00:00:30.890> let's<00:00:31.890> go<00:00:31.949> ahead<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.130> take<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.340> look

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
expensive let's go ahead and take a look

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.240 
expensive let's go ahead and take a look
at<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.899> so<00:00:33.899> here's<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.290> device<00:00:34.530> itself<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:35.219> has

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
at it so here's the device itself it has

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.000 
at it so here's the device itself it has
a<00:00:35.370> 4-inch<00:00:35.880> screen<00:00:36.239> we'll<00:00:37.110> talk<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.320> little<00:00:37.770> bit

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
a 4-inch screen we'll talk a little bit

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.530 
a 4-inch screen we'll talk a little bit
more<00:00:38.160> about<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.700> moment<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.059> here<00:00:39.390> we

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
more about that in a moment but here we

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.680 
more about that in a moment but here we
have<00:00:39.750> some<00:00:39.960> paperwork<00:00:40.350> your<00:00:40.890> start<00:00:41.219> here<00:00:41.690> we

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
have some paperwork your start here we

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.229 
have some paperwork your start here we
have<00:00:42.989> probably<00:00:43.710> just<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.100> normal<00:00:44.309> micro<00:00:44.760> USB

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
have probably just a normal micro USB

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.700 
have probably just a normal micro USB
cable<00:00:45.629> let's<00:00:45.989> take<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.230> look<00:00:46.469> at<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:48.440> this<00:00:49.440> is

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
cable let's take a look at that this is

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.569 
cable let's take a look at that this is
the<00:00:50.010> typical<00:00:50.340> HTC<00:00:51.270> micro<00:00:51.660> USB<00:00:52.110> cable<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
the typical HTC micro USB cable and the

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.250 
the typical HTC micro USB cable and the
typical<00:00:54.120> wall<00:00:54.329> charger<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.989> they<00:00:55.110> include

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
typical wall charger that they include

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.500 
typical wall charger that they include
as<00:00:55.620> well<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.160> have<00:00:56.280> your<00:00:56.309> AC<00:00:56.610> adapter<00:00:57.300> to

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
as well so you have your AC adapter to

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.260 
as well so you have your AC adapter to
USB<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.170> bottom<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.910> that's<00:00:59.910> pretty<00:01:00.149> much

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
USB on the bottom and that's pretty much

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.849 
USB on the bottom and that's pretty much
it<00:01:00.390> as<00:01:00.660> far<00:01:00.690> as<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.050> goes<00:01:01.109> but<00:01:01.289> we<00:01:01.559> do<00:01:01.710> need

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
it as far as that goes but we do need

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.369 
it as far as that goes but we do need
the<00:01:01.890> battery<00:01:02.340> down<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.789> bottom<00:01:03.290> let<00:01:04.290> me

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
the battery down in the bottom let me

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.170 
the battery down in the bottom let me
put<00:01:04.559> all<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.949> back<00:01:05.159> get<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.850> out<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
put all of this back get that out of the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.760 
put all of this back get that out of the
way<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.450> we'll<00:01:06.510> take<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.810> closer<00:01:07.200> look<00:01:07.380> at<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
way and we'll take a closer look at the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.460 
way and we'll take a closer look at the
phone<00:01:07.979> itself<00:01:08.600> so<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.750> battery<00:01:10.080> should<00:01:10.200> be<00:01:10.439> a

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
phone itself so the battery should be a

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.880 
phone itself so the battery should be a
1700<00:01:11.340> milliamp<00:01:11.790> hour<00:01:11.970> battery<00:01:12.590> couldn't<00:01:13.590> open

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
1700 milliamp hour battery couldn't open

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.780 
1700 milliamp hour battery couldn't open
it<00:01:14.100> up<00:01:14.250> here<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:16.009> probably<00:01:17.009> could<00:01:17.250> cut<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.610> and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
it up here I probably could cut this and

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.640 
it up here I probably could cut this and
make<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.090> little<00:01:18.270> bit<00:01:18.479> cleaner<00:01:18.720> but<00:01:19.049> let's

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
make it a little bit cleaner but let's

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.539 
make it a little bit cleaner but let's
go<00:01:19.799> ahead<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.009> just<00:01:20.220> open<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.700> up<00:01:21.920> so<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.220> have

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
go ahead and just open it up so we have

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.399 
go ahead and just open it up so we have
a<00:01:25.280> 1700<00:01:26.280> milliamp<00:01:26.700> hour<00:01:26.880> battery<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:28.110> screen

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
a 1700 milliamp hour battery the screen

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.960 
a 1700 milliamp hour battery the screen
itself<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:28.979> see<00:01:29.280> here's<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.549> volume

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
itself you can see here's the volume

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.109 
itself you can see here's the volume
control<00:01:30.360> sim<00:01:30.720> tray<00:01:30.990> micro<00:01:31.380> SD<00:01:31.770> slot<00:01:31.880> so<00:01:32.880> here

control sim tray micro SD slot so here

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.060 
control sim tray micro SD slot so here
we<00:01:33.240> have<00:01:33.270> volume<00:01:33.780> up<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.049> down<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.770> room

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
we have volume up and down this room

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.370 
we have volume up and down this room
reminds<00:01:35.670> me<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.880> lot<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.630> resound<00:01:37.020> only

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
reminds me a lot of the resound only

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.020 
reminds me a lot of the resound only
slightly<00:01:37.740> smaller<00:01:38.159> let's<00:01:38.729> go<00:01:38.820> ahead<00:01:38.909> and

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
slightly smaller let's go ahead and

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.810 
slightly smaller let's go ahead and
remove<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.600> off<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.960> camera<00:01:40.490> so<00:01:41.490> let's<00:01:41.670> go

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
remove this off the camera so let's go

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.310 
remove this off the camera so let's go
over<00:01:42.000> some<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.299> specs<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:42.930> have<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.079> 4

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
over some of the specs so we have a 4

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.050 
over some of the specs so we have a 4
inch<00:01:43.470> screen<00:01:43.850> 540<00:01:44.850> x<00:01:44.970> 960<00:01:46.340> 275<00:01:47.340> pixels<00:01:47.880> per

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
inch screen 540 x 960 275 pixels per

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.480 
inch screen 540 x 960 275 pixels per
inch<00:01:48.590> let's<00:01:49.590> go<00:01:49.680> ahead<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.860> take<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.280> off

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
inch let's go ahead and take this off

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.490 
inch let's go ahead and take this off
the<00:01:50.640> screen<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:52.740> screen<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.220> qhd<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.320> it's<00:01:55.320> not
