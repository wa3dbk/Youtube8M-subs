to<00:00:50.800> sustain<00:00:51.010> itself<00:00:51.520> in<00:00:51.850> this<00:00:52.210> world

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
to sustain itself in this world

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.880 
to sustain itself in this world
it<00:00:54.430> was<00:00:54.579> cool<00:00:54.879> by<00:00:55.059> itself<00:00:55.390> so<00:00:56.289> they<00:00:56.410> saw<00:00:56.620> you

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
it was cool by itself so they saw you

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.950 
it was cool by itself so they saw you
know<00:00:57.010> we've<00:00:57.219> got<00:00:57.460> it<00:00:57.489> them<00:00:57.820> we've<00:00:58.510> got<00:00:58.780> the

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
know we've got it them we've got the

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.639 
know we've got it them we've got the
design<00:00:59.609> this<00:01:00.609> is<00:01:00.670> what<00:01:00.850> we<00:01:01.210> need<00:01:01.449> perfect

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
design this is what we need perfect

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.310 
design this is what we need perfect

manifesting<00:03:02.560> yourself<00:03:02.670> manifesting<00:03:03.670> a

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
manifesting yourself manifesting a

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.190 
manifesting yourself manifesting a
different<00:03:04.060> form<00:03:04.330> that<00:03:04.780> in<00:03:04.870> which<00:03:05.020> you're<00:03:05.170> able

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
different form that in which you're able

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.460 
different form that in which you're able
to<00:03:05.560> walk<00:03:05.770> into<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:06.700> more<00:03:06.880> ground<00:03:07.209> and<00:03:09.420> so

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
to walk into and the more ground and so

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.610 
to walk into and the more ground and so
along<00:03:11.470> came<00:03:12.300> none<00:03:13.300> other<00:03:13.630> than<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.170> Syrians

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
along came none other than the Syrians

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.670 
along came none other than the Syrians
at<00:03:14.890> this<00:03:15.040> point<00:03:15.310> of<00:03:15.459> time<00:03:15.520> and<00:03:16.230> they<00:03:17.230> said<00:03:17.500> the

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
at this point of time and they said the

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:25.470 
at this point of time and they said the
following<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:19.930> require<00:03:20.940> something<00:03:24.480> inside

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
following you require something inside

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.830 
following you require something inside
this<00:03:26.290> physical<00:03:27.160> in<00:03:27.459> this<00:03:27.970> form<00:03:28.390> in<00:03:28.660> this

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
this physical in this form in this

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.270 
this physical in this form in this
vessel<00:03:29.220> okay<00:03:31.050> so<00:03:32.050> this<00:03:32.260> missile<00:03:32.800> sustains

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
vessel okay so this missile sustains

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.720 
vessel okay so this missile sustains
itself<00:03:34.170> so<00:03:35.170> that<00:03:35.320> you<00:03:35.650> don't<00:03:35.859> have<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.130> sustain

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
itself so that you don't have to sustain

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.850 
itself so that you don't have to sustain
but<00:03:36.910> you<00:03:37.090> can<00:03:37.300> just<00:03:37.450> walk<00:03:37.660> in<00:03:37.900> and<00:03:37.930> power<00:03:38.709> it

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
but you can just walk in and power it

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.350 
but you can just walk in and power it
meaning<00:03:39.730> take<00:03:40.300> it<00:03:40.480> over<00:03:40.690> as<00:03:41.050> a<00:03:41.319> as<00:03:42.129> a<00:03:42.310> force<00:03:42.640> as

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
meaning take it over as a as a force as

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.690 
meaning take it over as a as a force as
that<00:03:43.690> which<00:03:43.870> makes<00:03:43.900> it<00:03:44.700> move<00:03:45.700> an<00:03:47.040> essence<00:03:48.040> of<00:03:48.220> a

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
that which makes it move an essence of a

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.839 
that which makes it move an essence of a
and<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:49.660> he<00:03:49.780> said<00:03:50.019> is<00:03:50.230> it<00:03:50.410> like<00:03:50.980> an<00:03:51.160> essence<00:03:51.640> of

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
and and he said is it like an essence of

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.970 
and and he said is it like an essence of
a<00:03:51.910> machine<00:03:53.550> and<00:03:55.080> of<00:03:56.080> course<00:03:56.319> I<00:03:56.530> didn't

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
a machine and of course I didn't

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.229 
a machine and of course I didn't
understand<00:03:57.340> what<00:03:57.519> you<00:03:57.610> mean<00:03:57.700> about<00:03:57.819> machines

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
understand what you mean about machines

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.620 
understand what you mean about machines
but<00:03:58.599> Syrians<00:03:59.410> themselves<00:03:59.590> from<00:04:00.239> very<00:04:01.239> much<00:04:01.450> in

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
but Syrians themselves from very much in

but Syrians themselves from very much in
machine<00:04:02.050> like<00:04:02.230> development<00:04:04.380> and<00:04:05.380> forms<00:04:05.890> their

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
machine like development and forms their

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.789 
machine like development and forms their
opponent<00:04:06.910> was<00:04:07.060> also<00:04:07.390> very<00:04:09.000> system<00:04:10.000> like<00:04:10.799> and

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
opponent was also very system like and

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.039 
opponent was also very system like and
that's<00:04:12.370> how<00:04:12.549> basically<00:04:12.760> they<00:04:13.239> worked<00:04:13.870> in

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
had many percent of the scenes and they

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.039 
had many percent of the scenes and they
were<00:04:18.310> that<00:04:18.669> which<00:04:18.910> powered<00:04:19.389> and<00:04:19.570> moved<00:04:19.810> them

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
were that which powered and moved them

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.190 
were that which powered and moved them
accordingly<00:04:21.360> said<00:04:22.360> that's<00:04:22.600> what<00:04:22.810> you<00:04:22.960> need<00:04:23.169> in

going to work

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.520 
going to work
do<00:04:27.580> we<00:04:27.729> really<00:04:27.940> need<00:04:28.090> to<00:04:28.419> do<00:04:28.570> that<00:04:28.840> because<00:04:29.080> I

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
do we really need to do that because I

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
just needed to find a point where I'm

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.320 
just needed to find a point where I'm
able<00:04:32.020> to<00:04:32.169> just<00:04:32.290> walk<00:04:32.590> in<00:04:32.860> and<00:04:33.070> move<00:04:33.700> this<00:04:34.000> form

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
able to just walk in and move this form

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.210 
able to just walk in and move this form
because<00:04:34.960> it's<00:04:35.350> not<00:04:35.560> working

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
because it's not working

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.810

and he said trust me put in something

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.409 
and he said trust me put in something
that<00:04:40.240> has<00:04:41.229> to<00:04:41.410> be<00:04:41.440> sustain<00:04:42.039> itself<00:04:42.490> and<00:04:42.910> then

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
that has to be sustain itself and then

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.070 
that has to be sustain itself and then
you<00:04:43.450> can<00:04:43.870> walk<00:04:44.020> into<00:04:44.289> that<00:04:44.710> and<00:04:45.130> just<00:04:46.120> be<00:04:46.419> like

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.770 
like that isn't that so sweet how is
that<00:04:50.500> system<00:04:51.010> inside<00:04:51.400> it<00:04:54.210> why<00:04:55.210> was<00:04:55.450> it<00:04:55.570> being

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
that system inside it why was it being

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.810 
that system inside it why was it being
that<00:04:56.020> way<00:04:56.169> because<00:04:56.380> I'm<00:04:56.740> not<00:04:56.950> that<00:04:57.190> you<00:04:57.639> know<00:04:57.789> I

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
that way because I'm not that you know I

that way because I'm not that you know I
don't<00:04:58.210> look<00:04:58.330> like<00:04:58.389> that<00:04:58.570> I'm<00:04:59.229> still

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
don't look like that I'm still

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.580 
don't look like that I'm still
completely<00:05:00.280> one<00:05:00.900> and<00:05:01.900> he<00:05:02.020> said<00:05:02.200> we'll<00:05:02.320> do<00:05:02.470> the

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
completely one and he said we'll do the

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.469 
completely one and he said we'll do the
following<00:05:02.950> remember<00:05:03.460> you<00:05:03.669> walking<00:05:04.240> into

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
following remember you walking into

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.440 
following remember you walking into
something<00:05:05.370> you<00:05:06.370> are<00:05:06.610> not<00:05:06.850> that<00:05:07.090> something

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
something you are not that something

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.900 
something you are not that something
that<00:05:07.840> form<00:05:08.410> they're<00:05:09.010> not<00:05:09.280> that<00:05:09.550> what<00:05:09.760> you're

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
that form they're not that what you're

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.969 
that form they're not that what you're
putting<00:05:10.090> in<00:05:10.330> there<00:05:10.539> so<00:05:11.289> you<00:05:11.350> need<00:05:11.710> something

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
putting in there so you need something

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.159 
putting in there so you need something
which<00:05:12.280> becomes<00:05:12.669> that<00:05:13.240> which<00:05:13.479> is<00:05:13.660> one<00:05:13.930> with

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
which becomes that which is one with

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.590 
which becomes that which is one with
that<00:05:14.380> said<00:05:14.950> you<00:05:15.130> just<00:05:15.340> become<00:05:15.669> that<00:05:15.729> one<00:05:16.180> point

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
that said you just become that one point

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.570 
that said you just become that one point
even<00:05:16.840> if<00:05:17.139> it's<00:05:17.289> just<00:05:17.500> in<00:05:17.710> the<00:05:18.010> in<00:05:18.160> the<00:05:18.280> brain

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
even if it's just in the in the brain

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.820 
even if it's just in the in the brain
that<00:05:19.510> activates<00:05:20.169> it<00:05:20.349> and<00:05:20.530> then<00:05:20.680> it<00:05:20.800> starts

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
that activates it and then it starts

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.339 
that activates it and then it starts
moving<00:05:21.580> and<00:05:22.740> then<00:05:23.740> I<00:05:23.950> knew<00:05:24.099> it<00:05:24.340> ah<00:05:24.960> that<00:05:25.960> could

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
moving and then I knew it ah that could

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:32.760 
moving and then I knew it ah that could
just<00:05:26.650> work<00:05:28.139> so<00:05:29.139> that's<00:05:29.979> where<00:05:31.289> there's<00:05:32.289> the

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
just work so that's where there's the

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.690 
just work so that's where there's the
Sirians<00:05:33.250> and<00:05:33.870> it<00:05:34.870> was<00:05:35.080> also<00:05:35.440> involved

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
Sirians and it was also involved

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.460 
Sirians and it was also involved
personally<00:05:36.700> the<00:05:37.060> Sirians<00:05:37.450> the<00:05:38.110> sort<00:05:38.380> of

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
personally the Sirians the sort of

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:45.980 
personally the Sirians the sort of
developing<00:05:39.070> the<00:05:39.840> systems<00:05:40.840> that<00:05:41.849> which

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.960 

assist<00:05:46.990> the<00:05:47.259> spoon<00:05:47.620> to<00:05:47.889> sustain<00:05:48.310> itself<00:05:48.699> in

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
assist the spoon to sustain itself in

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.830 
assist the spoon to sustain itself in
this<00:05:49.680> on<00:05:50.680> this<00:05:50.919> planet<00:05:51.370> now<00:05:52.360> where<00:05:52.539> did<00:05:52.660> they

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
this on this planet now where did they

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.490 
this on this planet now where did they
get<00:05:53.020> their<00:05:53.199> ideas<00:05:53.560> from<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:55.360> Syrians

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.580 

manifested<00:05:59.500> themselves<00:05:59.650> mechanically

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
manifested themselves mechanically

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.439 
manifested themselves mechanically
systematically<00:06:02.699> from<00:06:03.699> their<00:06:03.940> planet<00:06:04.330> in

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:04.449 
systematically from their planet in

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:06.540 
systematically from their planet in
their<00:06:04.630> world<00:06:04.900> in<00:06:05.800> other<00:06:06.039> words<00:06:06.340> basically

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
their world in other words basically

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.790 
their world in other words basically
what<00:06:06.880> they<00:06:07.030> did<00:06:07.180> was<00:06:07.330> a<00:06:07.360> place<00:06:07.750> that<00:06:08.080> which

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
what they did was a place that which

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.360 
what they did was a place that which
that<00:06:09.490> I<00:06:10.090> knew<00:06:10.630> and<00:06:10.930> then<00:06:11.169> themselves<00:06:11.830> consists

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
that I knew and then themselves consists

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.129 
that I knew and then themselves consists
of<00:06:12.490> an<00:06:12.729> existed<00:06:13.150> as<00:06:13.300> into<00:06:13.690> a<00:06:13.720> physical

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:14.139 
of an existed as into a physical

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:18.180 
of an existed as into a physical
manifested<00:06:14.979> system<00:06:15.430> form<00:06:16.740> so<00:06:17.740> what<00:06:17.979> they<00:06:18.130> did

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
manifested system form so what they did

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.210 
manifested system form so what they did
was<00:06:18.400> they<00:06:18.789> connected<00:06:19.330> then<00:06:19.539> the<00:06:20.020> brain<00:06:20.319> area

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220 
was they connected then the brain area

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.260 
was they connected then the brain area
the<00:06:21.970> eyes<00:06:22.150> was<00:06:22.870> a<00:06:22.930> one<00:06:23.199> placement<00:06:23.830> all<00:06:24.759> along

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
the eyes was a one placement all along

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.439 
the eyes was a one placement all along
the<00:06:25.449> spine<00:06:26.099> so<00:06:27.099> if<00:06:27.819> you<00:06:27.970> have<00:06:28.060> the<00:06:28.180> skeleton

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:28.449 
the spine so if you have the skeleton

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:30.600 
the spine so if you have the skeleton
and<00:06:28.960> they<00:06:29.169> facing<00:06:29.470> like<00:06:29.830> a<00:06:29.860> metallic<00:06:30.370> system

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:30.610 
and they facing like a metallic system

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.499 
and they facing like a metallic system
inside<00:06:31.210> it<00:06:31.560> which<00:06:32.560> was<00:06:33.330> penetrated<00:06:34.330> like<00:06:34.479> a

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:34.509 
inside it which was penetrated like a

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:36.960 
inside it which was penetrated like a
pin<00:06:34.870> inside<00:06:35.380> the<00:06:35.650> center<00:06:36.069> of<00:06:36.250> the<00:06:36.430> skeleton

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
pin inside the center of the skeleton

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.230 
pin inside the center of the skeleton
also<00:06:37.659> around<00:06:37.960> the<00:06:38.139> skeleton<00:06:38.650> so<00:06:39.009> that<00:06:40.000> was

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
also around the skeleton so that was

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.360 
also around the skeleton so that was
basically<00:06:40.389> the<00:06:40.780> foundation<00:06:41.560> of<00:06:41.770> the<00:06:41.949> system

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370 
basically the foundation of the system

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.969 
basically the foundation of the system
okay<00:06:42.819> you<00:06:43.539> had<00:06:43.750> then<00:06:44.259> what<00:06:44.440> they<00:06:44.530> did<00:06:44.680> this<00:06:44.830> at

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:44.979 
okay you had then what they did this at

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:47.100 
okay you had then what they did this at
the<00:06:45.130> center<00:06:45.550> point<00:06:45.759> inside<00:06:46.330> the<00:06:46.509> brain<00:06:46.750> area

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.110 
the center point inside the brain area

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.960 
the center point inside the brain area
of<00:06:47.169> just<00:06:47.319> like<00:06:47.500> an<00:06:47.650> antenna<00:06:47.949> okay

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:48.970 
of just like an antenna okay

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.909 
of just like an antenna okay
now<00:06:49.509> that<00:06:49.750> was<00:06:49.960> the<00:06:49.990> point<00:06:50.349> which<00:06:50.740> would

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:50.919 
now that was the point which would

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:56.370 
now that was the point which would
activate<00:06:51.550> this<00:06:51.759> entire<00:06:53.130> form<00:06:54.130> to<00:06:55.030> move<00:06:55.380> to

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.380 
activate this entire form to move to

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.339 
activate this entire form to move to
sustain<00:06:56.770> itself<00:06:57.159> and<00:06:57.570> you<00:06:58.570> are<00:06:58.840> that<00:06:59.139> which

00:06:59.339 --> 00:06:59.349 
sustain itself and you are that which

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:03.209 
sustain itself and you are that which
make<00:06:59.680> this<00:07:00.330> form<00:07:01.330> think<00:07:01.780> that<00:07:02.710> which<00:07:02.949> makes

00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:03.219 
make this form think that which makes

00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:06.629 
make this form think that which makes
this<00:07:03.370> form<00:07:03.430> do<00:07:04.389> that<00:07:05.380> which<00:07:05.650> moves<00:07:06.009> this<00:07:06.310> form

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 
this form do that which moves this form

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:08.969 
this form do that which moves this form
accordingly<00:07:07.210> that<00:07:08.110> would<00:07:08.320> make<00:07:08.560> this<00:07:08.680> form

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:08.979 
accordingly that would make this form

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:15.740 
accordingly that would make this form
speak<00:07:09.340> that's<00:07:09.940> you<00:07:10.830> but<00:07:11.830> you're<00:07:12.039> not<00:07:12.250> the<00:07:12.430> form

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:15.750 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.990 

as<00:07:16.750> I<00:07:16.960> was<00:07:17.080> explaining<00:07:17.440> God<00:07:17.949> so<00:07:18.280> the<00:07:18.729> form

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.000 
as I was explaining God so the form

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.879 
as I was explaining God so the form
itself<00:07:19.449> I<00:07:19.810> don't<00:07:20.020> know<00:07:20.110> if<00:07:20.169> I've<00:07:20.349> covered<00:07:20.710> this

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:20.889 
itself I don't know if I've covered this

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:23.520 
itself I don't know if I've covered this
but<00:07:21.099> I<00:07:21.280> really<00:07:21.520> in<00:07:21.669> it's<00:07:21.880> necessary<00:07:22.409> but<00:07:23.409> I

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:23.530 
but I really in it's necessary but I

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.890 
but I really in it's necessary but I
even<00:07:24.039> asked<00:07:24.639> the<00:07:25.030> question<00:07:25.419> of<00:07:25.539> where<00:07:25.750> the

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:25.900 
even asked the question of where the

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.059 
even asked the question of where the
form<00:07:26.169> itself<00:07:26.789> derived<00:07:27.789> from<00:07:28.680> so<00:07:29.680> the<00:07:29.770> form

00:07:30.059 --> 00:07:30.069 
form itself derived from so the form

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:35.939 
form itself derived from so the form
itself<00:07:31.560> is<00:07:32.560> sound<00:07:34.080> the<00:07:35.080> form<00:07:35.349> itself<00:07:35.710> was

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:35.949 
itself is sound the form itself was

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:40.469 
itself is sound the form itself was
developed<00:07:36.219> from<00:07:36.460> sound<00:07:37.590> and<00:07:38.590> I<00:07:39.300> covered<00:07:40.300> that

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479 
developed from sound and I covered that

00:07:40.479 --> 00:08:00.279 
developed from sound and I covered that
in<00:07:40.630> my<00:07:40.870> next<00:07:41.050> interview<00:07:41.199> thanks

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:00.289 

00:08:00.289 --> 00:08:02.349 

you
