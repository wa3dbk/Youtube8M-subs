versions I have no previous versions you
may<00:00:33.600> see<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:34.140> from<00:00:34.770> time<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.219> time<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.880> it

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
may see this from time to time and it

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.600 
may see this from time to time and it
shows<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.780> there<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.110> no<00:00:37.410> available<00:00:38.340> data

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
shows that there is no available data

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.700 
shows that there is no available data
this<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.480> because<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.840> hasn't<00:00:40.020> been<00:00:40.260> set<00:00:40.469> up<00:00:40.500> on

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
this is because it hasn't been set up on

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.830 
this is because it hasn't been set up on
the<00:00:40.800> server<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.940> we're<00:00:42.090> going<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.360> look<00:00:42.570> at<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.440 
the server so we're going to look at the
server<00:00:43.579> we'll<00:00:44.579> right<00:00:44.760> mouse<00:00:44.969> click<00:00:45.000> on<00:00:45.390> the

much space it's going to use you can set

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.570 
much space it's going to use you can set

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
while keeping the newer information I've

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.410 
while keeping the newer information I've

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
noticed with the default settings that I

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.620 
noticed with the default settings that I
sent<00:03:10.840> I<00:03:11.080> get<00:03:11.590> somewhere<00:03:12.040> between<00:03:12.209> two<00:03:13.209> months

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
sent I get somewhere between two months

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.600

to<00:03:13.810> three<00:03:14.080> months<00:03:14.410> out<00:03:14.560> of<00:03:14.590> my<00:03:14.799> shadow<00:03:15.069> copies

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
to three months out of my shadow copies

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.259 
to three months out of my shadow copies
so<00:03:16.330> I<00:03:16.360> do<00:03:16.510> this<00:03:16.780> on<00:03:16.959> every<00:03:17.350> server<00:03:17.650> if<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:19.060> user

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
so I do this on every server if the user

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.930 
so I do this on every server if the user
has<00:03:19.690> edited<00:03:19.930> file<00:03:20.410> one<00:03:20.769> day<00:03:21.010> and<00:03:21.280> then<00:03:21.489> deleted

has edited file one day and then deleted

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.610 
has edited file one day and then deleted
the<00:03:22.120> next<00:03:22.510> they<00:03:22.660> can<00:03:22.840> always<00:03:22.989> go<00:03:23.230> back<00:03:23.260> and

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
the next they can always go back and

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.789 
the next they can always go back and
restore<00:03:24.570> for<00:03:25.570> example<00:03:25.989> will<00:03:26.170> delete<00:03:26.530> this

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
restore for example will delete this
