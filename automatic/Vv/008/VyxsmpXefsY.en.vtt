00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.550
 Hello dear ladies and gentlemen with 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.730
 you see what a new patch has come 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.010
 6.2 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.380
 which means you need to cut a new guide for 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.150
 Omsk and well and in classics we start 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.900
 guys with talent what you most 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.640
 love 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.590
 Well what can I say to create 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.809
 optimal build gdv we need 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.809
 take into account the composition of the team composition of the team 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.850
 opponent and our style of play so guys 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.100
 Consider the first column I can say 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.500
 that they are all well and my advice is 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.050
 uncontrollability because only 12 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.059
 seconds on the jerk guys is very little 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.059
 go after all the grants and magicians it 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:58.030
 will be very helpful following we go 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.820
 double time guys good thing if 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.500
 you want someone to tear down for 1 boost but in 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.019
 further, that is, you understand him sang 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.600
 the minute you make 5 points then you 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.970
 You can do only one time 40 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.979
 seconds plus when do you jerk 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.070
 using this ability you don't get 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:18.970
 rage is very sad herald of war 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.159
 guys ladies cover complement the camp by 0 5 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.649
 seconds but this is of course not enough but still 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.320
 this is camp but guys we lose our 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.750
 mobility and this is our everything he has by the way 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.420
 no diminishing with the usual flock so 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.939
 my option is uncontrollability next 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.710
 column guys this is our healing yes they 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.600
 we have at least some three new 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.700
 Of course, we were nourished in terms of this and 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.259
 painfully dependent heal well 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.359
 do the best option would be 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.890
 unrestrained rest rest 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:47.020
 guys in my talents are not even 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.390
 consider if anything from rampant 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.579
 exhibiting well hiller and it can 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.799
 use stun state 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.880
 and even if you first click encouraging 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.859
 beach and then during the detention 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.659
 recovery and on Khilim on 20 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:02.560
 percent more you watch i jump 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:05.460
 ins in the building 129000 Lebanon and now I 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.729
 jump first shake possessing then 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.250
 recovery from 170 we go further why 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.260
 I make my guide so late well guys 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.020
 because when i was doing my last 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.640
 guide at that time I used powerful 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.640
 kick but his guys two days later 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.860
 nerf and guide was simply no longer 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.840
 relevant so I decided to wait bye 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.120
 we suffered and understood and but in the end everything 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.920
 good third column guys Well on 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.959
 currently the best talent for 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.780
 generating rage and rising moon 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.000
 is our taste of blood if you look 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.459
 on sudden death guys talent 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.380
 Of course delicious but agree it is bad 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.570
 he is rarely yes and i am so fun 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.480
 Damazhit weak here fury I understand 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.610
 there you start guys too much 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.500
 whether rage takeoff and too little for 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.769
 this tomato is the same only 2 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.380
 seconds not to lose a flowerbed but my 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.630
 choice is the taste of blood guys in the arena you 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.000
 must fly like a bunch of burning therefore 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.100
 everywhere on every tank type we support 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.290
 our bloodletting and rage on will 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.769
 go as it should be and if that 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.570
 defensive stance and impenetrable looking 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:12.360
 4 column guys well what are you ready 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.640
 shock wave would be a good choice if 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.680
 you will be able to arrange citizens no less 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.260
 three goals thereby reducing to this 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.090
 abilities then 20 seconds but i thought 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.230
 guys crawl three goals enough for hair 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.890
 then especially if playing against you 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.600
 cool with the Khanty magicians there 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.450
 warlocks oh new next with us 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.700
 camp guys this is a tail feed too 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.800
 very good 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.260
 because it allows caste and 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.870
 stun the enemy from a distance also 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:43.040
 This is my choice and in deuce 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:46.480
 roar I donâ€™t know windows but how much more 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.480
 let's look at it 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.230
 But after all , some guys, he will simply damage 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.730
 atomic really just well not childish 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.730
 everyone was afraid of him 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.870
 well guys so we got to 5 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.030
 columns and so massive reflection 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.250
 spells think everyone knows what it is but 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.970
 my advice is to take here only against the game with 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.550
 casters 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.889
 we will use the guard against the game 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.860
 respectively with milishnik a mi 6 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:37.410
 Kolodochka Well guys here 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.180
 I better take a whirlwind like 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.970
 you all know three new guys 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.750
 warriors mobility problem and if we 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.690
 we will crawl 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.210
 we can easily be given a slowdown yes 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.250
 anything whirlwind my guys will 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.590
 all feel calm in it we are not weight 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.580
 moreover and more flexible and mine and very well by 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.580
 all and ishim 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.479
 so the best option would be 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.629
 click burst 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:15.039
 pay nick colossus sweeping strokes and 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:17.050
 whirlwind of blades 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:19.780
 oh well go oh well guys 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.800
 last column and so control 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.930
 by anger 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.330
 The most rewarding talent I find it for 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.129
 warriors are ready to reduce our main gd 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.569
 warrior abilities need a second on 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:31.030
 every 30 units 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:33.009
 used rage with this 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.849
 talent guys find by my calculations you 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.909
 can reduce 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:39.460
 when a whirlwind well, a whirlwind of blades will give on 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:40.930
 45 seconds the devastation will not give a damn 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.270
 reporting on scrap is rather more 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.000
 fan love to scam someone 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.370
 these bullets she is not sickly bends new 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.469
 all not guys are very weak in principle 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.930
 guys are talents we are done now 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:54.789
 characters are in principle the easiest character 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.069
 crushing blasco guys here everything 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:59.680
 understandably take against mages and paladins 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:01.870
 elsewhere it is not needed or if 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.909

 take a strong death blow to you 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:08.800
 Healing will be 10 percent more 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.270
 character heroic jump guys but 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.639

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.770
 mobility will also help us symbol 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:17.710
 for zubychiny very good in principle 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:19.719
 thing for the whole 20 seconds an important character he 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.180
 increased by 6 percent if you can 

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:24.789
