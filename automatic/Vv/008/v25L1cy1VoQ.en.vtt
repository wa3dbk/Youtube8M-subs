we<00:03:35.860> can<00:03:36.069> keep<00:03:36.489> this<00:03:36.640> momentum<00:03:36.849> going

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
we can keep this momentum going

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.570 
we can keep this momentum going
which<00:03:39.290> is<00:03:39.470> sustained<00:03:39.890> it<00:03:40.130> throughout<00:03:40.400> the

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
which is sustained it throughout the

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.020 
which is sustained it throughout the
world<00:03:40.820> for<00:03:41.090> me<00:03:41.390> to<00:03:41.510> do<00:03:41.630> on<00:03:41.780> this<00:03:41.870> weekend

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:52.570 

Oh

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.480 

do<00:03:53.580> you<00:03:53.640> think<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:54.030> city

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.780 

so<00:03:58.450> I<00:03:58.540> guess<00:03:58.810> I<00:03:59.680> mean<00:04:00.040> it<00:04:00.160> gets<00:04:00.310> forgotten<00:04:00.490> all

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
so I guess I mean it gets forgotten all

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.610 
so I guess I mean it gets forgotten all
the<00:04:00.820> time<00:04:01.120> I<00:04:01.420> don't<00:04:02.020> think<00:04:02.080> is<00:04:02.790> it's<00:04:04.410> that<00:04:05.410> much

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620
