00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.480
 I'm here 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:13.389
 Good people, I decided to make this video. 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:18.039
 to show you who are users 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:20.919
 of the systems that your battery's 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:24.369
 smartphone can indeed last as long as 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:26.019
 battery of an ordinary smartphone good time 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.819
 Here to show you mine is a 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.699
 iphone 4s 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:32.830
 I bought it is about a month and 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:37.150
 I was surprised because I've always been 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.280
 common type smartphone user 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.590
 android 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.590
 the battery usually lasts 34 days 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:48.270
 so direct is from a full charge 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:55.000
 of my smartphone 's battery from my 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:58.360
 apple smartphone 4s she does not 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.140

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:05.469
 completes a full 10-hour cycle 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.789
 It's my battery does not last one day if I 

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:10.450
 play 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:13.840
 The case is if I get access to the 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:17.189
 independent internet if the ifa and 3g 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:21.310
 the battery ends up even more so the more 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:26.229
 music has to reduce obesity 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:28.869
 you having May 11 s 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.479
 an apple smartphone 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.569
 Do you know I'm talking only? 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:40.209
 something happened and I decided to show 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:42.850
 For you, my smartphone is without 

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:47.859
 show service see if it turns red here 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:50.759
 no phone service to my battery 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:50.759
 has 7% 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.110
 It's already okay, let me see if it's for you. 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:04.150
 little way 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:04.150
 This is already here. 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.970
 three days and 16 hours or without 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.910
 telephone service 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:17.709
 my battery from a full cycle of 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:20.459
 ten hours hard three days 16 hours 6 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:26.020
 hours and two minutes of uninterrupted use 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:29.020
 ie the data or the apple does not know 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:33.910
 to say for sure why the battery 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.959
 of a smartphone of them lasts so long 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.900
 little 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:41.950
 there is a personal tip of the apple 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.500
 battery life is too short because 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.239
 receiving and 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:52.030
 sending data are very 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.790
 apple smartphone capacity 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:00.430
 well then folks get the tip 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:03.220
 The telephone service is the 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.830
 data consumes a lot of battery power 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.690
 of your smartphone not only the brightness 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.739
 not only the other other applications 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.769
 working means that it helps 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.260
 rather more mainly data 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.290
 phones 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.290
 thanks guys
