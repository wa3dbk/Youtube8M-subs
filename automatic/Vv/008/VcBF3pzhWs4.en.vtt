00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.279
 the people to see you are 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.649
 starting medical school 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.670
 you're not the second year first year 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.440
 and still do not know how you want proof 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.400
 residence sticking proof 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.560
 residence 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.779
 so I'll explain more or less 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.880
 here you started medicine 56 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.910
 years to graduate as a doctor after 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.199
 six years, most people do not 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.779
 are going to live in 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.199
 specialization of medicine is called 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.690
 residence residence for you 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.340
 passing you to do a test is usually 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.380
 in that test 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.180
 generally each university each 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.030
 hospital is indifferent to the entire hospital 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.950
 has in it is not the whole hospital does not have 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.140
 several hospitals that do not have evidence of 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.700
 most of them and many 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.260
 hospitals that have their own existence 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.260
 usually linked to the university 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.289
 so I'll leave it here under my 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.180
 video lenk in this link will open the edict 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.920
 proof of university residency 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.619
 federal paraná this year 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.360
 then you can go beyond the edict to 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.250
 resistance test with which it works 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.350
 own residence how many vacancies 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.729
 was the competition of the city of 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.200
 residences ne 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.580
 the federal university of paraná 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.680
 Federal University of Parana has 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.060
 several residences do not have this thesis 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.450
 general medical clinic surgery 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.220
 cardiology opinion tried and you 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.380
 can also look at what is 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.890
 that the proof is 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.140
 mark x is to write has practical proof 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.079
 common is the practice proves that they 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.030
 in the curriculum is that you need to 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.840
 do to have a good resume to be 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.640
 shot on a residence test 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.579
 So I'll leave the call for 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.170
 you have access to this announcement is there and there 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.000
 You will realize what it is that you 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.280
 can access the unifesp website see the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.560
 unpublished notice of the unpublished 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.689
 unicamp edict and all of them all 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.479
 Presidents of Brazil also on the internet 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.159
 It's like a college entrance exam 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:06.630
 does not change much more or less in the 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:08.369
 same style and then so what I wanted 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.170
 say that this video proof of residence 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.940
 what is evaluated as a proof of 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.590
 residence then will get this notice and 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.390
 for you to take a look 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.300
 it is like the proof that the university 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.440
 and the federal university of paraná is not 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.420
 let the paper pass in evidence 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.069
 think for the urgency in the end the 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.560
 staff is very interesting you already 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.640
 since the first period of the university 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.069
 entered the university 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.480
 if they start until this 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.370
 proof of residence that you will have 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.849
 six years to prepare 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.950
 It's different than you open your head in the 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.560
 first in the last year that you go 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.360
 give access, do not study the places 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.310
 that you can have your residence 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.709
 rafael carpacho in campinas thinking of 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.730
 São Paulo wants to think about São José do Rio 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.810
 black 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.440
 Look how it works. 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.810
 specialty I wanted to do 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.239
 anesthetic where they are best is 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.040
 the incidence of anesthesiology where only 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.840
 the places that is not so difficult to pass 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.090
 today are the best places to 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.980
 pass in general surgery where then this 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.170
 everything you're building for six 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.970
 years in the store plus a thinking tactic 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.620
 This is where the university will start. 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.090
 think this in the end but now it's already good 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.310
 you start to take a look 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.870
 which charges on the proof of residence as 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.190
 is that you will assemble your resume 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.670
 that your curriculum at ease from the 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.980
 start university monitor that you 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.579
 make your own residence 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.650
 some dot in English account counts 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.630
 you know speak English test 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.970
 English, that's what you tell 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.670
 Do not know how to do English? 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.849
 for you to do the university is 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.310
 to have scored so the project 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.739
 extension is until we set up a 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:51.359
 campaign against skin cancer is this 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:53.250
 account is scientific initiation account that 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.500
 You 're looking for a teacher of yours. 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.329
 worked on some scientific project 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.799
 then the teacher spends his statement 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.260
 You go by your resume account. 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.269
 quite this not mandatory stage 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.380
 for example the hospital offers a 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.340
 stage has nothing to do with the 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.989
 university 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.959
 You go there and do that stadium then. 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.669
 home point account 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.650
 it is logical to count a little point and a 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:15.329
 more than the same 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.669
 passing in the province is proof that you 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.139
 demonstrate knowledge is as if 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.880
 was a college entrance exam to pass the 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.000
 university after they looked at their 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.400
 curriculum also right 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.270
 is your average grade of note throughout 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.300
 the University 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.069
 Also, this is not how much time 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.629
 Portuguese will have access to this edict 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:38.310
 which is below the video link 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:40.020
 that I'm going to leave is anything if 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.879
 you can not access this link 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.349
 here below I'll leave the second 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:46.530
 link that is the same 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:48.449
 there in the fanpage né na fanpage the link goes 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.039
 to be underneath too, right? 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.990
 so you can look at what it's like to 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:54.539
 own residence that they charge everything 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.069
 That's it, I just want to alert you to 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.750
 This video is just that 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:05:00.150
 they all look at the edicts themselves 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.349
 residence is the competitions to be 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.389
 while it was the competition of 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:04.740
 anesthesiology at the hospital, how 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.990
 plastic surgery competition 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.150
 hospital what I need to do to be 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.009
 Plastic surgeon has pre-requisite has 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.300
 who do general surgery first or not 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:14.069
 So all that stuff you got there 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.659
 within the edict the proof of residence 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:18.389
 huh 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:19.259
 once again each hospital has a style 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.030
 of proof 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:22.860
 the paraná federal has a proof of 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.599
 residence other than federal de são 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.219
 paulo do usp 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:28.819
 usually roughly more or less 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:32.130
 It's just the same, but it's a bit different, right? 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:34.229
 so the guys this video for you guys 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.150
 then the beginning of the university is be 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:38.490

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.199
 fernandópolis on unicastelo people not 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.180
 differs a lot by r unicastelo in 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:44.969
 fernandópolis on the puc do rio grande do 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:48.389
 south the mouth is not short the video is not 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:51.090

 another interesting thing also of 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.590
 you do is start accessing the 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:06.060
 medical academy that is a targeted site 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.159
 for medical students and 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.870
 paramedics has no information at all 

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.880
 Yes, you know, it's like an agenda . 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:15.180
 127 meters from a doctor 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:18.150
 the medical academy dot com 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.590
 the medical academy dot com a great 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.150
 our partner is not 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.440
 then you can all have access to the 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.389
 leave a link below also from 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.509
 medical academy you are accessing 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:29.699

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.690
 possibility that you may be 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.029
 doing is has the difference between 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.860
 clinicians and surgeons any difference 

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:39.320
 Yes, so there are several articles 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.570
 places to stay 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.860

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.540
 I do not drink too much I do not see people who 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.890
 they drank if they care, it does not hurt well 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.890
 big hug ae
