00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
here in the upper North Island the paint

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.889 
here in the upper North Island the paint
is<00:00:49.110> quite<00:00:49.710> nice<00:00:49.890> it's<00:00:50.250> possibly<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.539> could

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
is quite nice it's possibly it it could

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.660 
is quite nice it's possibly it it could
do<00:00:52.110> with<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.379> good<00:00:52.680> polish<00:00:53.550> because<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.940> think

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
do with a good polish because I think

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.130 
do with a good polish because I think
from<00:00:56.670> where<00:00:56.910> now<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.090> look<00:00:57.329> at<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.750> think<00:00:57.989> it's

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
from where now I look at it I think it's

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.979 
from where now I look at it I think it's
probably<00:00:58.559> never<00:00:58.800> been<00:00:59.420> the<00:01:00.420> plaint<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.780> never

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
probably never been the plaint is never

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.399 
probably never been the plaint is never
been<00:01:01.170> cut<00:01:02.480> and<00:01:03.480> that's<00:01:04.350> probably<00:01:04.890> what

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
been cut and that's probably what

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.389 
been cut and that's probably what
needs<00:01:05.679> to<00:01:07.109> make<00:01:08.109> it<00:01:08.259> a<00:01:08.289> bit<00:01:08.439> more<00:01:08.649> shiny<00:01:09.009> if<00:01:09.369> you
