00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.189

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.330
 how rhino we all know 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.950

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.950
 just kin on the hood 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.020
 The designer does not bathe at all 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.990
 drew a good logan cut karma 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.360
 got sandero put plastic 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.990
 lining the new wheels and get tv 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.990
 profit 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.370
 but first things first you really 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.890
 different sander other bumpers 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.780
 protective plastic covers 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.670
 wheel clearance and a larger radius and 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.699
 no junior motor in the line 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.460
 move the car 197 millimeters this 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.960
 good level and crossovers 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.180
 due to ground clearance and short overhangs 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.190
 can hope for some people patency 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.310
 in any case, better than normal 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.310
 hatchback 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.460
 The big plus of appearance is 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.369
 high 16-inch wheels 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.830
 and they are steel and just covered 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.960
 cap but the owners on the forums 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.640
 complains that the most inappropriate moment 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.380
 they can just fly like 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.000
 the french is now still romanian 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.090
 tradition gas cap need 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.170
 key open 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.940
 keep her in that condition until 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.190
 you get over the dubious pleasure 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.560
 of course we only have a car stand 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.560
 do not open the trunk dirty 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.539
 hands quite problematic you need to push 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.079
 on this button and for shoving your hand 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:53.680
 drag open we see that loading 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.960
 the height is pretty big here but to me 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.299
 above the knee is the volume itself 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.549
 is 320 liters if decomposed 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.549
 1,200 liters rear seats 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.890
 inside the screaming budget on the wall is all 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.130
 pretty pretty comes true though 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.500
 a bit grayish everywhere 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.260
 black hard plastic is diluted 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.090
 gray plastic seat tight 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.350
 colorless covers 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.350
 with proud inscription stepway 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.680
 you can sit comfortably so much 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.860
 compromise between driving which 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.700
 adjustable only in height and seat 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.080
 which is regulated only by departure 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.340
 although it is worth noting that the other 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.319
 seat trim can 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.299
 regulated also by height 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.329
 once already started talking about picking something 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.430
 200 more to go plus we have the first 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:01.700
 the difference between them is a little bit but they 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.260
 still there is for example except adjustment 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.780
 your seats will still be onboard 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.239
 computer 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.519
 electric rear-view mirrors 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.239
 lifts 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.930
 climate control instead of the usual 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.209
 air conditioner 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.409
 but the obs is not so much for the money 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.780
 You can put the central 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:19.340
 armrest and video system with navigation 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.469
 additional cards 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.549
 but if you need the armrest 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:25.069
 as far as 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.169
 from but i have a system on here such here 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:30.409
 the thing we came across with her was in docker and 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:32.599
 moisture doesn't work quickly clear well and 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:34.250
 is not expensive backseat normal 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:37.340
 here I am watching Andrei as you know 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.739
 boy we are not small i am here 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.480
 I put my knees a little rest but 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:48.019
 not critical here is nothing special 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.989
 the handle is a regular cup holder but that's all 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:54.829
 thought comfortable two people here 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:57.609
 fit on this our review we finish 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:02.590
 you yourself are looking toast somewhere here
