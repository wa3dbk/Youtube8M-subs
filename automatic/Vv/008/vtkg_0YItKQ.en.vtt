00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:11.000
 external gps module test page 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 jeep one and radar detector 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.970
 this test for 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.960
 informativity we will detector street 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.010
 Storm will be with the display off and about 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.410
 have sound off 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.810
 so that we can evaluate the work of the external 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.929
 gps module so he module 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.219
 connects to the detector 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.219
 then turn on the detector 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.590
 status when the led module is external 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.760
 Lit constantly says that gps 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.320
 signals not yet found but in this 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.000
 case we observe the so-called 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.600
 instantly hot start 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.450
 practically a signal is found as a result 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.570
 the LED lights up smoothly and 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.570
 fades away 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:07.720
 respectively, the task module st jeep 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.720
 Ivan inform about us 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.180
 and location approximation 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:18.580
 the location of each radar 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:21.500
 which are listed in the base basket 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.229
 it can be difficult 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.080
 fixed radars eg robot 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.119
 so and complexes joyful module not 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.979
 containing for example up the dolly given 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:38.180
 moment we observe approaching radar 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:43.369
 auto dori we see that as 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:46.100
 approximation of the diode signal frequency megane 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.460
 the diode is growing exactly like sound 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.460
 signal 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.130
 having passed the first measure enter the zone 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.130
 approaching 2
