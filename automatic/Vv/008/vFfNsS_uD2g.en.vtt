down to the quarterback so the ball
can't<00:01:37.240> be<00:01:37.359> intercepted<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:38.170> again<00:01:38.829> you're

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
can't be intercepted and again you're

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.039 
can't be intercepted and again you're
gonna<00:01:39.340> see<00:01:39.700> when<00:01:39.850> we<00:01:39.969> watch<00:01:40.149> this<00:01:40.390> on<00:01:40.600> video

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
gonna see when we watch this on video

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.990 
gonna see when we watch this on video
that<00:01:41.619> at<00:01:41.740> times<00:01:42.039> our<00:01:42.310> receivers<00:01:42.820> aren't

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
that at times our receivers aren't

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.819 
that at times our receivers aren't
getting<00:01:43.329> exactly<00:01:43.929> the<00:01:44.140> depth<00:01:44.380> that<00:01:44.439> we<00:01:44.560> need

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
getting exactly the depth that we need

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.109 
getting exactly the depth that we need
and<00:01:45.009> it's<00:01:45.100> real<00:01:45.340> important<00:01:45.880> that<00:01:46.060> you

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
and it's real important that you

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:47.969 
and it's real important that you
emphasize<00:01:46.390> that<00:01:47.049> they<00:01:47.170> get<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.619> proper

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
emphasize that they get to the proper

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.260 
emphasize that they get to the proper
depth<00:01:48.249> the<00:01:48.880> reads<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:50.619> this<00:01:50.979> play<00:01:51.340> for<00:01:52.179> our

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
depth the reads on this play for our

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.330 
depth the reads on this play for our
quarterback<00:01:52.780> is<00:01:52.810> always<00:01:53.229> an<00:01:53.350> outside-in<00:01:53.829> read

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
quarterback is always an outside-in read

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.830 
quarterback is always an outside-in read
he's<00:01:55.060> always<00:01:55.240> going<00:01:55.420> to<00:01:55.479> read<00:01:55.630> from<00:01:55.689> the

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
he's always going to read from the

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.749 
he's always going to read from the
outside<00:01:56.170> defender<00:01:56.649> in<00:01:56.829> we<00:01:57.310> have<00:01:57.549> what's

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
outside defender in we have what's

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.550 
outside defender in we have what's
called<00:01:57.969> the<00:01:58.149> hitch<00:01:58.359> rule<00:01:58.659> and<00:01:58.929> we'll<00:01:59.049> also<00:01:59.229> see

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
called the hitch rule and we'll also see

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.370 
called the hitch rule and we'll also see
this<00:01:59.710> on<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.009> videotape<00:02:00.340> that<00:02:01.119> if<00:02:01.359> if<00:02:01.630> if<00:02:02.109> we

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
this on the videotape that if if if we

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.169 
this on the videotape that if if if we
know<00:02:02.590> pre-snap<00:02:02.979> alignment<00:02:03.789> that<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:03.999> hitch

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
know pre-snap alignment that the hitch

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:05.999 
know pre-snap alignment that the hitch
is<00:02:04.359> going<00:02:04.539> to<00:02:04.630> be<00:02:04.780> there<00:02:05.049> no<00:02:05.499> matter<00:02:05.649> what<00:02:05.740> the

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
is going to be there no matter what the

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.529 
is going to be there no matter what the
read<00:02:06.189> is<00:02:06.340> we're<00:02:06.549> gonna<00:02:06.670> get<00:02:06.819> the<00:02:06.969> ball<00:02:07.149> to<00:02:07.420> that

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
read is we're gonna get the ball to that

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.630 
read is we're gonna get the ball to that
receiver<00:02:08.319> as<00:02:08.560> quick<00:02:08.770> as<00:02:08.890> possible<00:02:08.950> the

receiver as quick as possible the
corners<00:02:09.940> playing<00:02:10.240> off<00:02:11.140> you<00:02:11.680> know<00:02:11.770> ten<00:02:12.010> yards

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
corners playing off you know ten yards

the quarterback in pre-determined with
eye<00:02:16.120> contact<00:02:16.629> the<00:02:16.780> receiver<00:02:17.140> that<00:02:17.379> we're

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
eye contact the receiver that we're

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.899

quick<00:02:19.120> as<00:02:19.239> possible<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:19.840> that's<00:02:19.900> called<00:02:20.170> our

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
quick as possible and that's called our

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.100 
quick as possible and that's called our
hitch<00:02:20.530> rule<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.099> that's<00:02:21.610> that's<00:02:22.000> a<00:02:22.480> look<00:02:22.900> at

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
hitch rule and that's that's a look at

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.180 
hitch rule and that's that's a look at
the<00:02:23.459> 2x2<00:02:25.140> receiver<00:02:26.140> side<00:02:26.409> the<00:02:26.620> three<00:02:26.830> receiver

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
the 2x2 receiver side the three receiver

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.979 
the 2x2 receiver side the three receiver
side<00:02:27.459> on<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.700> hitch<00:02:27.909> and<00:02:28.120> again<00:02:28.659> if<00:02:28.780> it's<00:02:28.900> a

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
side on the hitch and again if it's a

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.990 
side on the hitch and again if it's a
single<00:02:29.230> receiver<00:02:29.560> side<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:30.459> would<00:02:30.610> just<00:02:30.849> be

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
single receiver side it would just be

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.699 
single receiver side it would just be
the<00:02:31.120> route<00:02:31.299> by<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.540> inside<00:02:31.989> receiver<00:02:32.230> which

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
the route by the inside receiver which

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.399 
the route by the inside receiver which
is<00:02:32.860> a<00:02:32.890> straight<00:02:33.280> six<00:02:33.879> yard<00:02:34.090> hitch<00:02:34.360> over<00:02:35.110> the

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
is a straight six yard hitch over the

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.470 
is a straight six yard hitch over the
top<00:02:35.590> of<00:02:35.799> his<00:02:35.920> alignment<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.909> that's<00:02:37.239> our

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
top of his alignment and that's our

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.959 
top of his alignment and that's our
hitch<00:02:37.720> route
