00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:13.059
 birth of the project stage 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.139
 two hours ago 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.180
 all started slowly working on it an idea following our 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.720
 past activities what we come from the middle of the race console 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.640
 automobile one chokes design and construction of two race cars 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.849
 then 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.310
 trophy andros it's electric also 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.559
 so this is a world first for a consonance indeed what we have 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.390
 allowed us to link with our partners 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.110
 what we have today find on this vehicle that was supposed to lead 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.790
 that's what it takes today 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.640
 m siemens brought us wood in their very last 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.210
 generation that is not yet engine product at the time an engine for 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.630
 cent and that we will use on landreau oscars 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.800
 its surroundings a kilowatt part of notice today we are at 2 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.280
 54 regarding battery on the other hand m always stand out 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.200
 the french bordelais do not surprise the french project is a 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.270
 very very good thing 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.980
 it's their latest generation also lithium-ion batteries 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.159
 highly secure from 0 to 100 it is a study of the third irdes 5 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.270
 so if it turns out really a high-end and high-end vehicles 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.240
 performance 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.979
 on the one hand a maximum speed% which will be limited in any case to 250 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.950
 kilometers an hour if today the promise of the 187 kilometers but to 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.580
 at the moment about twenty people in 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.120
 we were working on this project which is under development it still remains 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.120
 several years of development before falling into production 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.810
 reinforcement the small series what our ambitions are not to become a 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.360
 great builder far from there 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.920
 it's the trustee uhde 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.280
 very high-end niche 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.400
 and percent and outcome of all this will take place late 2012 a hundred 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.530
 of vehicles in this sense of its goals so really in a backbone 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.590
 market 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.200
 without bothering our major French builders
