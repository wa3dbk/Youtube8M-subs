00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.519
 every family has its own 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.770
 to eat Christmas 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.300
 for us it has to be the roast beef and 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.900
 how we put that super yummy on the table 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.820
 I'll show you that today 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.980
 roast beef comes from the intermediate piece 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.680
 of high rib and hip and we have to 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.570
 is before we can fry it first 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.160
 still free from fat and longing 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.780
 make the longing we have with it 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.890
 meat does not contract and that 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.180
 Fat we can do well for the taste 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.950
 let stand now you can 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.950
 meat salt and pepper around 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.140
 also tremble properly 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.320
 and now we can go over to the hearth 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.320
 sautÃ© meat 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.990
 Let's start the skin side 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.980
 the side about four to five minutes 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.960
 so 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.479
 our meat is from both sides 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.860
 seared 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.640
 now we can rub it with the fine 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.360
 it gives a nice taste before it 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.360
 in the oven 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.240
 Careful is still hot 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.190
 I 've already preheated the oven 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.890
 to 150 degrees 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.800
 There's going on in there for pink 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.810
 or medium to about 25 minutes if 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.710
 now wants to have over packs 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.710
 ten minutes to buy 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.380
 I do not quite take that with the cooking time 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.870
 certainly the best meat used 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.290
 thermometer you have the core temperature 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.330
 measure consumed for medium or high 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.239
 54 degrees for medium was that 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.459
 between piece to be cooked 58 degrees 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:37.350
 if it prefers to have durchgebraten 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.700
 then 60 degrees core temperature so while 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.019
 our meat in the oven is we can 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.670
 prepare our sauce 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.310
 I thought about how to make a cat 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.580
 with a fruity sweet touch of it 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.739
 As always, we need a root vegetable 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.019
 Tomato butter and flour as well as a 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.739
 a few spices of juniper berries and 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:03:00.810
 laurel leaves nothing and cover 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:03.030
 brought with you for a delicious sauce 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.650
 we just use our wide 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.910
 pot will have the flesh seared 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.890
 we solve 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:18.239
 Give the fry with some butter 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:20.959
 our carrots our onions and in 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.959
 celerina too 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:29.860
 with the dough scraper well on the ground 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.860
 scrape that triggers the entire frying set 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:44.379
 Now we can do our tomato mark 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:44.379
 Add garlic and run 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.959
 Last but not least, mail 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:10.310
 that ensures a proper bond now 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.310
 we can deglaze with cassis liqueur 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.139
 to give a good sip of red wine 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.310
 and stir well again 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:33.879
 really tomato butter in the flour 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:38.879
 dissolve sauce so plus we give ours 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:43.090
 spices in addition laurel leaves sternanis 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:44.530
 with juniper and pepper and leave the 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:54.370
 Cook sauce as long as it does 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:55.930
 same call is so our meat is 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.639
 finished the oven I have it again 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.620
 five minutes wrapped in aluminum foil and 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.220
 do not let the meat juice rest 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.199
 expires 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.430
 I've had a sauce before 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:06.360
 and seasoned with salt and pepper 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:09.520
 and still diluted with the shot of water 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.949
 a side dish suits me best 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.139
 to a carrot one vegetables and 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:23.229
 fried potatoes our steward meat 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:25.659
 set up and in the case of roastbeef 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:30.389
 also cut with the fiber 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:30.389
 So parallel to the cut surface 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:39.669
 two slices of meat 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:50.630
 little bit of sauce to it 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.120
 a nice glass of white wine or red that 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.800
 fits both 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.800
 I wish you a good determination
