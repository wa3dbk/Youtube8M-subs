00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
here that's one of the issues the other

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.169 
here that's one of the issues the other
one<00:01:34.180> is<00:01:34.840> we<00:01:35.830> need<00:01:36.009> to<00:01:36.160> be<00:01:36.280> very<00:01:36.520> respectable

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
one is we need to be very respectable

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:39.389

with<00:01:37.660> the<00:01:37.780> landscape<00:01:38.289> and<00:01:38.649> then<00:01:39.009> the<00:01:39.220> be

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
with the landscape and then the be

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:40.830
