 the sony xperia tablets and is not the model 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.710
 lightest available in the market but 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.180
 due to the good distribution of 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.100
 internal components 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.140
 the feeling you have is that it is 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.360
 considerably lighter than the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.340
 their competitors when in fact the 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.070
 difference is not so great 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.720
 besides this extremely 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.310
 beneficial to the consumer 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.979
 the finishing material of part 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.530
 back, which makes it easier to 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.220
 adhesion and reduces digital brands 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.660
 caused by handling the appliance with 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.180
 full hd resolution 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.920
 the xperia tablets and is ideal for

 those who use the product to 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.290
 watch videos either via youtube 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.509
 netflix crack or screen quality is 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.180
 tailored to perform functions such as 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.580
 these are the automatic 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.619
 optimization of the device tend to 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.640
 to make the colors of what you see in 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.860
 more vivid and clearer screen 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.390
 the xperia tablets is equipped with a 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.040
 quad core processor qualcomm 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.450
 snapdragon apq8060 and four 1.5ghz 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.489
 2 gb of ram 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.440
 because of this you can stay 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.390
 because any application 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.650
 available on google player will run 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.140
 easily 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.510
 during our analysis we did not realize 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.959
 no treatment or any 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.360
 delay uncomfortable while using the 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.489
 modifications made by sony 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.830
 add useful features to the device 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.140
 as a shortcut in the upper corner for the 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.730
 google search and make life easier 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.980
 who uses the product 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.709
 in addition the tablet has a sensor 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.700
 something unusual in infrared models. 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.739
 genre 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.330
 this allows the gadget to be 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.780
 used as a remote control 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.540
 universal it is difficult to imagine that someone 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.330
 actually use your smartphone or 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.100
 tablet underwater though the 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.380
 appeal seems to have pleased 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.180
 consumers and is becoming more and more 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.350
 more common in several types of 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.320
 gadgets 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.180
 in practice the fact of a jedi being at 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.890
 proof provides a guarantee 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.600
 more to the owner than the 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.120
 product will not spoil by staying 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.099
 exposed some raindrops or even 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.950
 when you knock some drink on 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.410
 he 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.989
 another point that surprised us with 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.090
 very positive way was the duration of 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.430
 the tablet battery during our 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.400
 For example, the analysis shows that the 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.230
 device consumed only 12% of the battery 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.660
 during the display of an episode of 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.410
 series on netflix of approximately 50 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.720
 minutes 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.940
 being thus with the battery in charge 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.790
 complete it is possible to watch 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.569
 least eight episodes with the tranquility 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:58.480
 considerable number 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:00.489
 The rear camera has 8.1 megapixels of 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.290
 resolution condition more than 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.500
 sufficient for good pictures in 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.750
 open and even underwater 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.760
 the front camera , which in most cases 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.269
 competing devices is only eg the 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.010
 here you get a better treatment with 2.2 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.769
 resolution megapixels 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.200
 the fm radio function is between the 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.210
 of Brazilian users 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.639
 but there are few top smartphones 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.830
 line available between the 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.229
 tablets the difficulty of finding it 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.600
 even more so that you find out that 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:34.060
 she is present on the xperia tablet z is 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.320
 a welcome surprise and will certainly fall into the 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.320
 I like the country's public 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.560
 even by North American standards 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.780
 the price of the most expensive model of xperia 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.420
 tablets and is still slightly above 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.490
 average in brazil 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.100
 we know that the tax burden in the country 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.720
 is not lower than the demand for 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.400
 electronic products with these 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.770
 characteristics is lower than in the 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.480
 the United States and that the fact that 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.320
 if there was no national manufacture 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:10.000
 costs two thousand and 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.340
 six hundred reais is not a price 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.980
 competitive for the Brazilian market and 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:18.000
 similar appliances of other 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.000
 more accessible conditions 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.110
 technically xperia tablets and sony 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.970
 can be considered one of the most 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.480
 interesting with android that already 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.580
 went through the writing of the light 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.890
 with long battery life and 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.170
 quadcore processor the model has 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.240
 conditions and characteristics to enter 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.720
 in the consumer dream lists of those 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.400
 looking for a 10-inch tablet 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.470
 the lightness of the product causes it to be 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.050
 quite anatomical not becoming 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.120
 tiring for reading or even for 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.700
 you can carry it wherever you go. 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.830
 You're going to end the battery life. 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.630
 perhaps it is the aspect that most 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.420
 positively surprised 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.760
 in our tests it was almost nine o'clock 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.750
 continuous use without the need for 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.990
 recharge 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:12.610
 but once again the great villain of the 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:14.570
 story ends up being its price in the country 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.310
 2,599 reais 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.680
 it is true that the value is not so 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.200
 different from other products of the 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.300
 competitors but in the case of the 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.400
 sony and ends up becoming a great 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.790
 example where the cost is not worth 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.710
 benefit but if you are willing 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.290
 to pay this price or have the 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.420
 opportunity to import the product know 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.530
 you will hardly be disappointed 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.930
 with him 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:42.160
 also check the analysis in tek world and 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.160
 until our next video
