okay<00:00:02.340> we're<00:00:02.610> back<00:00:02.639> we're<00:00:03.360> kind<00:00:03.570> of<00:00:03.659> like<00:00:04.670> 3-4

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
okay we're back we're kind of like 3-4

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.020 
okay we're back we're kind of like 3-4
minutes<00:00:05.819> on<00:00:06.440> temperature<00:00:07.440> in<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.680> flu<00:00:07.890> is

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.030 
minutes on temperature in the flu is

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.049 
minutes on temperature in the flu is
starting<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.150> rise<00:00:09.360> nicely<00:00:10.130> we're<00:00:11.130> not<00:00:11.759> quite

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
starting to rise nicely we're not quite

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.289 
starting to rise nicely we're not quite
there<00:00:12.090> yet<00:00:12.389> but<00:00:12.630> we're<00:00:13.590> kind<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:14.299> getting

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
there yet but we're kind of getting

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.540 
there yet but we're kind of getting
there<00:00:15.570> quite<00:00:15.839> rapidly<00:00:16.320> so<00:00:16.830> we're<00:00:17.220> kind<00:00:17.520> of

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
there quite rapidly so we're kind of

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.349 
there quite rapidly so we're kind of
like<00:00:17.730> 10<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.630> 50<00:00:19.080> degrees<00:00:19.430> just<00:00:20.430> edging<00:00:21.240> on

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
like 10 to 50 degrees just edging on

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.220 
like 10 to 50 degrees just edging on
that<00:00:21.630> best<00:00:22.380> operating<00:00:22.859> temperature<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:24.480> fire

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
that best operating temperature the fire

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.509 
that best operating temperature the fire
itself<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:26.180> in<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:28.170> really<00:00:28.560> roaring<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.369> can

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
itself is in a really roaring you can

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.459 
itself is in a really roaring you can
probably<00:00:30.890> hear<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.160> draw<00:00:32.930> and<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.260> course

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
probably hear that draw and of course

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.819 
probably hear that draw and of course
I've<00:00:34.680> put<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:34.920> there<00:00:35.219> he<00:00:35.820> be<00:00:36.000> Curtis<00:00:36.829> teapot

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
I've put on there he be Curtis teapot

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.410 
I've put on there he be Curtis teapot
because<00:00:38.070> hey<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.579> might've<00:00:38.879> love<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.149> cup<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.329> tea

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
because hey I might've love a cup of tea

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.639 
because hey I might've love a cup of tea
and<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.980> 10-15<00:00:40.980> minutes<00:00:41.250> time<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:42.379> okay<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.440> what

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
and a 10-15 minutes time so okay so what

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.260 
and a 10-15 minutes time so okay so what
I'm<00:00:43.739> going<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.890> do<00:00:44.040> now<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.579> add<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.030> bit<00:00:45.239> more

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
I'm going to do now is add a bit more

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.660 
I'm going to do now is add a bit more
would<00:00:45.660> give<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> kind<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.219> little<00:00:47.430> rake

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
would give that a kind of a little rake

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.750 
would give that a kind of a little rake
over<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.090> get<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.329> controlled<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.730> turn<00:00:50.730> down

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
over I get it controlled and turn down

00:00:50.760 --> 00:01:03.180 
over I get it controlled and turn down
some<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.300> damping

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.079 

so<00:01:04.190> when<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:04.400> stones<00:01:04.580> that's<00:01:04.909> got<00:01:05.059> a

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
so when the stones that's got a

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:06.640 
so when the stones that's got a
temperature<00:01:05.479> I<00:01:05.780> mean<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.110> door<00:01:06.290> still

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
temperature I mean the door still

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.310 
temperature I mean the door still
relatively<00:01:07.340> cold<00:01:07.790> but<00:01:09.550> just<00:01:10.550> be<00:01:10.670> careful<00:01:11.320> got

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
relatively cold but just be careful got

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.250 
relatively cold but just be careful got
some<00:01:12.530> good<00:01:12.920> gloves<00:01:13.570> makes<00:01:14.570> life<00:01:14.810> a<00:01:14.840> little<00:01:15.080> bit

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
some good gloves makes life a little bit

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.620 
some good gloves makes life a little bit
easier<00:01:15.909> now<00:01:16.909> this<00:01:17.090> isn't<00:01:17.270> going<00:01:17.510> to<00:01:17.570> be

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
easier now this isn't going to be

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.170 
easier now this isn't going to be
massively<00:01:18.080> stable<00:01:18.650> so<00:01:18.890> it's<00:01:19.700> been<00:01:19.880> a<00:01:19.910> little

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
massively stable so it's been a little

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.210 
massively stable so it's been a little
bit<00:01:20.450> careful<00:01:21.050> here<00:01:21.080> these<00:01:21.770> looks<00:01:22.040> are

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
bit careful here these looks are

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.490 
bit careful here these looks are
starting<00:01:22.520> to<00:01:22.550> go<00:01:22.670> nicely<00:01:22.970> I<00:01:23.509> get<00:01:24.140> that<00:01:24.170> nice

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
starting to go nicely I get that nice

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.960 
starting to go nicely I get that nice
base<00:01:24.890> in<00:01:25.190> there<00:01:30.460> so<00:01:31.460> you<00:01:31.520> would<00:01:31.700> should<00:01:31.850> be

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
base in there so you would should be

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
base in there so you would should be
really<00:01:32.240> nicely<00:01:32.420> seasoned<00:01:33.100> before<00:01:34.100> you<00:01:34.160> add<00:01:34.310> it

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
really nicely seasoned before you add it

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.389 
really nicely seasoned before you add it
before<00:01:35.990> you<00:01:36.020> burn<00:01:36.259> it<00:01:36.410> that<00:01:36.920> way<00:01:37.039> you<00:01:37.100> get<00:01:37.280> the

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
before you burn it that way you get the

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.910 
before you burn it that way you get the
maximum<00:01:37.789> heat<00:01:38.720> generated<00:01:39.350> it<00:01:39.470> won't<00:01:39.649> be<00:01:39.740> using

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
maximum heat generated it won't be using

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.080 
maximum heat generated it won't be using
up<00:01:40.570> air<00:01:41.570> won't<00:01:42.530> be<00:01:42.649> using<00:01:42.830> up<00:01:43.009> heat<00:01:43.280> to<00:01:43.820> dry<00:01:43.940> the

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
up air won't be using up heat to dry the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.990 
up air won't be using up heat to dry the
word<00:01:47.200> so<00:01:48.200> I'm<00:01:48.440> just<00:01:48.590> gonna<00:01:48.740> take<00:01:49.640> some<00:01:49.670> nicely

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
word so I'm just gonna take some nicely

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.190 
word so I'm just gonna take some nicely
dry<00:01:50.330> gloves<00:01:51.580> drops<00:01:52.580> logs<00:01:53.180> dry<00:01:53.509> best<00:01:53.780> obviously

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
dry gloves drops logs dry best obviously

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.740 
dry gloves drops logs dry best obviously
when<00:01:54.350> split<00:01:55.149> you<00:01:56.149> can<00:01:56.300> feel<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.720> difference

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
when split you can feel the difference

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.310 
when split you can feel the difference
they<00:01:57.350> started<00:01:57.649> come<00:01:57.890> lie<00:01:59.020> we'll<00:02:00.020> just<00:02:00.140> get

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
they started come lie we'll just get

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.279 
they started come lie we'll just get
those<00:02:00.500> in<00:02:01.060> its<00:02:02.060> stacked<00:02:02.330> up<00:02:02.509> on<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.720> edges<00:02:03.110> and

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
those in its stacked up on the edges and

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.999 
those in its stacked up on the edges and
I've<00:02:04.070> actually<00:02:04.220> got<00:02:04.580> a<00:02:04.610> pea<00:02:04.820> soup<00:02:05.119> for<00:02:05.979> what<00:02:06.979> I

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
I've actually got a pea soup for what I

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.580 
I've actually got a pea soup for what I
think<00:02:07.340> by<00:02:07.549> its<00:02:07.759> a<00:02:08.060> railway<00:02:08.660> sleeper<00:02:09.080> I've

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
think by its a railway sleeper I've

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.930 
think by its a railway sleeper I've
always<00:02:09.769> thought<00:02:10.070> railway<00:02:10.459> sleepers<00:02:10.820> were

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
always thought railway sleepers were

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.570 
always thought railway sleepers were
made<00:02:11.120> out<00:02:11.299> of<00:02:11.330> oak<00:02:11.540> but<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:13.010> coloring<00:02:13.340> on<00:02:13.430> this

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
made out of oak but the coloring on this

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.270 
made out of oak but the coloring on this
one<00:02:13.760> might<00:02:14.600> indicate<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:15.019> it's<00:02:15.290> teak<00:02:15.560> cut

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
one might indicate that it's teak cut

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.400 
one might indicate that it's teak cut
into<00:02:16.579> little<00:02:16.700> slices<00:02:17.140> just<00:02:18.140> going<00:02:18.320> to<00:02:18.380> throw

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
into little slices just going to throw

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.430 
into little slices just going to throw
that<00:02:18.799> on<00:02:18.829> the<00:02:19.040> top<00:02:19.900> okay<00:02:22.840> as<00:02:23.840> I've<00:02:23.989> added<00:02:24.140> a<00:02:24.320> bit

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
that on the top okay as I've added a bit

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.960 
that on the top okay as I've added a bit
more<00:02:24.500> wood<00:02:24.829> I'll<00:02:25.070> leave<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.370> damping<00:02:25.730> open

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
more wood I'll leave the damping open

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.560 
more wood I'll leave the damping open
for<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.180> minute<00:02:27.010> just<00:02:28.010> to<00:02:28.329> allow<00:02:29.329> that<00:02:29.510> to

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
for the minute just to allow that to

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.940 
for the minute just to allow that to
catch

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.809 

we're<00:02:35.760> just<00:02:36.239> creeping<00:02:37.080> up<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.580> 262<00:02:38.580> color
