anything<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.420> will<00:01:03.870> be<00:01:04.019> able<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.320> have

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
anything of that will be able to have

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.490 
anything of that will be able to have
minecraft<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.489> that's<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.330> only<00:01:06.600> other<00:01:06.869> 1i

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
minecraft on it that's the only other 1i

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.130 
minecraft on it that's the only other 1i
think<00:01:07.830> minecraft<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:08.909> obviously<00:01:09.420> pc<00:01:09.900> and

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
think minecraft is on obviously pc and

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.310 
think minecraft is on obviously pc and
but<00:01:10.860> apart<00:01:10.890> from<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.729> ipod<00:01:12.630> which<00:01:13.170> is

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
but apart from that is ipod which is

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.609 
but apart from that is ipod which is
apple<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.939> so<00:01:14.939> i<00:01:14.970> think<00:01:15.150> they<00:01:15.509> was<00:01:15.810> allowed<00:01:16.590> to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
apple and so i think they was allowed to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.370 
apple and so i think they was allowed to
do<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:18.299> since<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:18.840> not<00:01:18.960> pond<00:01:19.229> so

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
do that and and since it's not pond so

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.380 
do that and and since it's not pond so
it<00:01:19.500> doesn't<00:01:19.710> really<00:01:19.799> affect<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.390> contract

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
it doesn't really affect the contract

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.899 
it doesn't really affect the contract
with<00:01:21.570> microsoft<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:23.130> yeah<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.460> contract

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
with microsoft but yeah the contract

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.499 
with microsoft but yeah the contract
does<00:01:24.140> limit<00:01:25.140> loads<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.070> loads<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.939> things<00:01:27.000> so

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
does limit loads and loads of things so

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.330 
does limit loads and loads of things so
why<00:01:27.930> we<00:01:28.259> won't<00:01:28.439> be<00:01:28.560> able<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.829> get<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.159> there

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
why we won't be able to get it on there

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.090 
why we won't be able to get it on there
and<00:01:29.490> stuff<00:01:29.729> like<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:29.880> also<00:01:30.630> if<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.590> i<00:01:31.799> don't

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
and stuff like that also if you i don't

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.530 
and stuff like that also if you i don't
really<00:01:32.220> know<00:01:32.430> what<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.729> Rams<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.299> hard

ease I don't know and maybe that's why

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.980

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
don't know as I said now this gone to

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.950 
don't know as I said now this gone to
ps4<00:02:12.930> and

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
ps4 and

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.440 
ps4 and
if<00:02:14.020> I'm<00:02:14.200> not<00:02:14.230> we'll<00:02:14.440> get<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.680> on<00:02:14.740> ps4<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.850> is

if I'm not we'll get it on ps4 it is

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.230 
if I'm not we'll get it on ps4 it is
difficult<00:02:17.110> because<00:02:17.650> it's<00:02:18.070> a<00:02:18.220> new<00:02:18.250> console<00:02:18.940> and

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
difficult because it's a new console and

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.630 
difficult because it's a new console and
maybe<00:02:19.450> there<00:02:20.020> will<00:02:20.140> be<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.350> new<00:02:20.530> contracts<00:02:21.340> from

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
720 and ps4 when both of those come out

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.400 
720 and ps4 when both of those come out
maybe<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.430> new<00:02:30.640> contract<00:02:31.180> will<00:02:31.480> be<00:02:31.510> available

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
maybe a new contract will be available

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.680 
maybe a new contract will be available
and<00:02:32.890> each<00:02:33.220> one<00:02:33.460> has<00:02:33.490> to<00:02:33.790> battle<00:02:33.970> it<00:02:34.120> out<00:02:34.240> to<00:02:34.300> try

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
and each one has to battle it out to try

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.050 
and each one has to battle it out to try

and get another contract for minecraft

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.760 
and get another contract for minecraft
now<00:02:37.540> it's<00:02:37.720> definitely<00:02:38.050> going<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.260> be<00:02:38.320> on<00:02:38.530> xbox

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
now it's definitely going to be on xbox

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.040 
now it's definitely going to be on xbox
720<00:02:39.280> no<00:02:39.820> doubt<00:02:40.030> about<00:02:40.120> that<00:02:40.480> i'm<00:02:40.630> pretty<00:02:40.870> sure

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
720 no doubt about that i'm pretty sure

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.050 
720 no doubt about that i'm pretty sure
it<00:02:41.170> will<00:02:41.350> be<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:42.190> because<00:02:42.640> i<00:02:42.670> don't<00:02:42.970> think

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
it will be and because i don't think

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.090 
it will be and because i don't think
they'll<00:02:43.420> drop<00:02:43.690> such<00:02:43.960> a<00:02:43.990> big<00:02:44.380> hit<00:02:44.650> of<00:02:44.800> a<00:02:44.890> game

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
they'll drop such a big hit of a game

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.610 
they'll drop such a big hit of a game
it's<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.400> biggest-selling<00:02:45.880> arcade<00:02:46.570> game<00:02:46.900> so

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
it's the biggest-selling arcade game so

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.530 
it's the biggest-selling arcade game so
I<00:02:47.860> think<00:02:48.070> it's<00:02:48.310> also<00:02:48.490> like<00:02:48.790> 1<00:02:49.030> million<00:02:49.270> copies

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
I think it's also like 1 million copies

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.420 
I think it's also like 1 million copies
in<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.900> first<00:02:49.990> day<00:02:50.470> or<00:02:50.740> first<00:02:51.010> week<00:02:51.220> or

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
in the first day or first week or

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.610 
in the first day or first week or
something<00:02:51.790> it's<00:02:52.270> just<00:02:52.540> mental<00:02:53.230> how<00:02:53.350> much

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
something it's just mental how much

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.340 
something it's just mental how much
money<00:02:54.310> they've<00:02:54.580> made<00:02:54.820> from<00:02:55.120> it<00:02:55.270> but<00:02:55.750> iski<00:02:56.170> it's

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
money they've made from it but iski it's

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.200 
money they've made from it but iski it's
going<00:02:56.560> to<00:02:56.620> be<00:02:56.710> very<00:02:56.950> difficult<00:02:57.280> for<00:02:57.610> sony<00:02:57.910> term

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
going to be very difficult for sony term

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.330 
going to be very difficult for sony term

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.210 
sure they'll be up to date with it

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.230

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
because I'd seen I see no reason why

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.720
