00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:15.139
 good among the advantages that the 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:20.460
 products is definitely that we are 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:24.180
 contributing to the environment 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.220
 use what are the scraps of the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.380
 wood that was already used for others 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.710
 what we do is to maximize the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.800
 true resource and so avoid 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.160
 pollution to the environment or that 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.309
 the wood was not given a sustainable use 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.579
 in this case , the advantages that 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.200
 we can see here is the differentiation 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.400
 In design 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.610
 and in what is the quality of the product 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:57.540
 that we sell to the final consumer 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.730
 when wanting to develop a line where 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.650
 us to differentiate with the rest of the 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.860
 other products followed the companies of 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.320
 wood 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.160
 Seeing the need and trends of the 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:14.300
 today's market that a lot of people are 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:17.900
 focuses on supporting what products are 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.970
 green or friendly truth we use 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.850
 also certified wood whereby 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.950
 that also gives us great support and a 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.950
 value to our product because all 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.650
 our woods in this case the mara 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.080
 main we use in teak 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:37.100
 comes from renewable forests and 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:40.580
 fsc and beristain certificates 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.030
 came up a lot especially when it came to 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.409
 create a concept that was innovative 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.470
 something that would differentiate us 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:52.250
 niche market get out a little 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:57.870
 craftsmanship or work in wood that 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:03.080
 already from which we came was accustomed 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:06.060
 we currently see usa and canada 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.030
 soon we will be in Central America between 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.900
 my goals and future plans my market 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.900
 goal is europe
