see<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.379> map<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.739> obviously<00:00:44.250> much<00:00:44.550> larger<00:00:44.969> in

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
see the map is obviously much larger in

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.090 
see the map is obviously much larger in
scale<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.750> has<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.930> lot<00:00:46.260> more<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.620> depth<00:00:46.920> in

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
scale it has a lot more in depth in

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.770 
scale it has a lot more in depth in
detail<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.760> we<00:00:48.239> thought<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.539> would<00:00:48.660> be

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
detail and we thought that this would be

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.660 
detail and we thought that this would be
a<00:00:48.809> great<00:00:48.989> way<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.170> do<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> 100th<00:00:49.980> halo<00:00:50.190> 4<00:00:50.430> for

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
a great way to do the 100th halo 4 for

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.189 
a great way to do the 100th halo 4 for
trams<00:00:50.879> okay<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.270> we<00:00:51.480> started<00:00:51.870> off<00:00:51.960> with<00:00:52.079> the

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
trams okay so we started off with the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.389 
trams okay so we started off with the
Star<00:00:52.410> Wars<00:00:52.440> map<00:00:52.680> at<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.860> very<00:00:53.039> beginning

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
which is polis masa and on that one I'm

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.479 
which is polis masa and on that one I'm
gonna<00:00:55.379> link<00:00:55.559> all<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.829> other<00:00:55.949> Star<00:00:56.190> Wars<00:00:56.309> Maps

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
the back you're going to notice that the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.179 
the back you're going to notice that the
opposing<00:01:18.869> team<00:01:19.020> has<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.229> rate<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> Mantis

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
opposing team has a rate so the Mantis

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.800 
opposing team has a rate so the Mantis
versus<00:01:20.549> Wraith<00:01:20.790> combat<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.330> actually<00:01:21.540> very

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
versus Wraith combat is actually very

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.140 
versus Wraith combat is actually very
interesting<00:01:22.380> if<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.100> manage<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.460> defeat<00:01:24.000> one

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
interesting if you manage to defeat one

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.490 
interesting if you manage to defeat one
of<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.270> other<00:01:24.420> vehicles<00:01:24.900> which<00:01:25.049> tends<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.409> be

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
of the other vehicles which tends to be

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.780 
of the other vehicles which tends to be
the<00:01:25.619> case<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.040> have<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.250> slight<00:01:26.580> advantage

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the case and you have a slight advantage

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.030 
the case and you have a slight advantage
over<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.479> other<00:01:27.630> team<00:01:27.930> until<00:01:28.590> they<00:01:28.740> managed

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
over the other team until they managed

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.380 
over the other team until they managed
to<00:01:29.159> eliminate<00:01:29.310> your<00:01:29.640> vehicle<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.180> course

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
to eliminate your vehicle of course

last look into the Confederate base
which<00:01:48.060> has<00:01:48.270> kind<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.960> multi-leveled<00:01:49.619> area

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
which has kind of a multi-leveled area

didn't arrest to create those very
confusing<00:02:07.680> structures<00:02:08.810> evidently<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.959> had

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
confusing structures evidently you had

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.380 
confusing structures evidently you had
to<00:02:10.259> we<00:02:10.440> had<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.649> do<00:02:10.800> our<00:02:11.220> best<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.790> imitate<00:02:12.239> them

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
to we had to do our best to imitate them

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.030 
to we had to do our best to imitate them
in<00:02:12.510> Halo<00:02:12.690> 4<00:02:12.810> with<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.290> limited<00:02:13.709> sand

in Halo 4 with the limited sand

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.179 
in Halo 4 with the limited sand
skip<00:02:14.659> capabilities<00:02:15.659> but<00:02:16.260> overall<00:02:16.560> I<00:02:16.829> think<00:02:16.920> it

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
skip capabilities but overall I think it

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.009 
skip capabilities but overall I think it
was<00:02:17.280> well<00:02:17.459> pulled<00:02:17.670> off<00:02:17.819> you<00:02:18.359> can<00:02:18.510> see<00:02:18.689> here

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
was well pulled off you can see here

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.420 
was well pulled off you can see here
there<00:02:19.469> are<00:02:19.500> three<00:02:19.620> of<00:02:19.859> these<00:02:19.950> structures<00:02:20.310> only

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
there are three of these structures only

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.039 
there are three of these structures only
one<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:20.760> them<00:02:20.879> possess<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.420> command<00:02:21.810> post<00:02:21.930> on

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
one of them possess a command post on

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.750 
one of them possess a command post on
the<00:02:22.170> very<00:02:22.349> back<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.739> right<00:02:23.310> here<00:02:23.459> is<00:02:23.609> another

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
the very back and right here is another

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.179 
the very back and right here is another
one<00:02:24.239> overlooking<00:02:24.870> this<00:02:25.019> other<00:02:25.200> edge<00:02:25.469> that

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
one overlooking this other edge that

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:27.679 
one overlooking this other edge that
kind<00:02:26.489> of<00:02:26.579> represents<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.120> bit<00:02:27.239> of<00:02:27.329> a<00:02:27.420> cityscape

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
kind of represents a bit of a cityscape

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.599 
kind of represents a bit of a cityscape
thing<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:28.319> is<00:02:28.409> holding<00:02:28.620> up<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.099> rock<00:02:29.340> edge

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609 
thing that is holding up the rock edge

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.280 
thing that is holding up the rock edge
since<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.329> woud<00:02:30.480> appel<00:02:30.750> was<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:30.959> large

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
since that woud appel was a large

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.800 
since that woud appel was a large
sinkhole<00:02:31.799> planet<00:02:32.519> I<00:02:32.609> believe<00:02:32.909> and<00:02:33.090> the

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
sinkhole planet I believe and the

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.479 
sinkhole planet I believe and the
majority<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.260> map<00:02:34.379> took<00:02:34.560> place<00:02:34.709> in<00:02:34.980> this

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
majority of the map took place in this

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:36.080 
majority of the map took place in this
sinkhole

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
sinkhole

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.460 
sinkhole
so<00:02:36.450> as<00:02:36.540> we<00:02:36.659> progressed<00:02:36.989> here<00:02:37.109> you<00:02:37.200> can<00:02:37.319> see

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
so as we progressed here you can see

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.809 
so as we progressed here you can see
this<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:37.709> kind<00:02:37.829> of<00:02:37.920> this<00:02:38.010> balcony<00:02:38.519> looking

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
this is kind of this balcony looking

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.550 
this is kind of this balcony looking
edge<00:02:39.090> where<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.510> can<00:02:39.659> oversee<00:02:40.049> that<00:02:40.200> one<00:02:40.349> base

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
edge where you can oversee that one base

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.259 
edge where you can oversee that one base
below<00:02:40.769> and<00:02:41.099> get<00:02:41.250> somewhat<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.849> a<00:02:41.909> view<00:02:42.120> on<00:02:42.239> that

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
below and get somewhat of a view on that

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.339 
below and get somewhat of a view on that
further<00:02:42.599> base<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:42.989> showed<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.319> earlier

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
further base I showed you earlier

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.800 
further base I showed you earlier
however<00:02:44.250> there<00:02:44.639> are<00:02:44.760> very<00:02:45.030> limited<00:02:45.269> lines<00:02:45.659> of

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
however there are very limited lines of

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.149 
however there are very limited lines of
sight<00:02:46.019> so<00:02:46.230> it's<00:02:46.379> a<00:02:46.439> good<00:02:46.560> position<00:02:46.980> for

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
sight so it's a good position for

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.190 
sight so it's a good position for
protecting<00:02:47.819> certain<00:02:48.180> areas<00:02:48.540> but<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.049> also

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
protecting certain areas but it also

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.800 
protecting certain areas but it also
limits<00:02:49.439> you<00:02:49.680> in<00:02:49.769> other<00:02:49.889> cases<00:02:50.159> up<00:02:50.970> here<00:02:51.299> is<00:02:51.420> the

limits you in other cases up here is the

fortress<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:54.900> believe<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:56.099> is<00:02:56.310> kind<00:02:56.639> of<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.819> multi

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
fortress I believe it is kind of a multi

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.479 
fortress I believe it is kind of a multi
access<00:02:57.659> to<00:02:57.840> room<00:02:58.049> it<00:02:58.560> is<00:02:58.769> a<00:02:58.799> bit<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.069> a<00:02:59.129> fortress

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
access to room it is a bit of a fortress

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:00.740 
access to room it is a bit of a fortress
in<00:02:59.609> a<00:02:59.669> sense<00:02:59.879> just<00:03:00.090> because<00:03:00.299> of<00:03:00.419> its<00:03:00.569> multiple

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
in a sense just because of its multiple

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.750 
in a sense just because of its multiple
walls<00:03:01.200> however<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:01.799> is<00:03:01.889> rather<00:03:02.099> easy<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.609> take

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
walls however it is rather easy to take

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.039 
walls however it is rather easy to take
this<00:03:02.909> building<00:03:03.359> especially<00:03:03.540> if<00:03:03.870> you<00:03:03.930> have<00:03:04.019> a

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
this building especially if you have a

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.479 
this building especially if you have a
vehicle<00:03:04.260> supporting<00:03:04.859> you<00:03:04.919> from<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.159> outside

vehicle supporting you from the outside

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.610 
vehicle supporting you from the outside
but<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:06.359> can<00:03:06.510> see<00:03:06.689> that<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:07.079> kind<00:03:07.230> of<00:03:07.319> merges

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
but you can see that it kind of merges

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.479 
but you can see that it kind of merges
together<00:03:07.889> with<00:03:08.040> some<00:03:08.159> of<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.340> other

together with some of the other

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.490 
together with some of the other
buildings<00:03:08.939> there's<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.540> lot<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:10.079> you<00:03:10.200> know<00:03:10.230> kind

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
buildings there's a lot of you know kind

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.020 
buildings there's a lot of you know kind
of<00:03:10.620> skilled<00:03:11.010> jumps<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:11.430> can<00:03:11.579> do<00:03:11.700> in<00:03:11.849> certain

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
of skilled jumps you can do in certain

working as a team you're really going to
be<00:03:15.510> doing<00:03:15.599> well<00:03:15.840> on<00:03:15.959> these<00:03:16.049> maps<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.470> mean

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
be doing well on these maps I mean

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.690 
be doing well on these maps I mean
that's<00:03:16.739> kind<00:03:16.859> of<00:03:16.980> what<00:03:17.069> we<00:03:17.159> test<00:03:17.400> them<00:03:17.579> for

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
that's kind of what we test them for

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.129 
that's kind of what we test them for
progressively<00:03:18.239> is<00:03:18.389> just<00:03:18.629> to<00:03:18.720> make<00:03:18.870> sure<00:03:18.900> that

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
progressively is just to make sure that

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.409 
progressively is just to make sure that
the<00:03:19.260> team<00:03:19.440> dynamic<00:03:19.560> works<00:03:20.129> very<00:03:20.430> well<00:03:20.549> as<00:03:21.359> you

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
the team dynamic works very well as you

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:22.789 
the team dynamic works very well as you
can<00:03:21.629> see<00:03:21.750> here<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:21.930> went<00:03:22.139> from<00:03:22.199> one<00:03:22.440> base<00:03:22.620> and

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
can see here I went from one base and

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:23.990 
can see here I went from one base and
I'm<00:03:22.859> trying<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.099> push<00:03:23.250> my<00:03:23.400> way<00:03:23.430> towards<00:03:23.909> the

other<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.389> capture<00:03:24.720> this<00:03:24.840> base<00:03:25.049> as<00:03:25.199> well<00:03:25.349> and

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
other to capture this base as well and

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.020 
other to capture this base as well and
that's<00:03:26.190> kind<00:03:26.459> of<00:03:26.489> what<00:03:26.609> you're<00:03:26.669> gonna<00:03:26.790> want<00:03:26.970> to

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
that's kind of what you're gonna want to

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.149 
that's kind of what you're gonna want to
do<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.329> want<00:03:27.569> to<00:03:27.659> keep<00:03:28.079> as<00:03:28.379> a<00:03:28.440> flowing<00:03:28.709> combat

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
do you want to keep as a flowing combat

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:30.649 
do you want to keep as a flowing combat
experience<00:03:29.639> this<00:03:29.760> isn't<00:03:30.120> really<00:03:30.209> a<00:03:30.299> game<00:03:30.510> type

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
experience this isn't really a game type

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.180 
experience this isn't really a game type
that<00:03:30.810> allows<00:03:30.930> camping<00:03:31.470> as<00:03:31.560> I'm<00:03:31.680> sure<00:03:31.859> most<00:03:32.010> of

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
that allows camping as I'm sure most of

continue with the overview of this upper
floor<00:03:35.940> here<00:03:36.239> I<00:03:36.359> just<00:03:36.659> showed<00:03:37.019> you<00:03:37.049> this<00:03:37.379> area

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
floor here I just showed you this area

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.589 
floor here I just showed you this area
of<00:03:37.889> the<00:03:38.040> fortress<00:03:38.430> there's<00:03:38.790> multiple<00:03:39.209> access

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
of the fortress there's multiple access

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.210 
of the fortress there's multiple access
points<00:03:39.629> as<00:03:39.989> I'm<00:03:40.109> just<00:03:40.319> showcasing<00:03:40.739> here<00:03:41.069> and

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
points as I'm just showcasing here and

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.069 
points as I'm just showcasing here and
as<00:03:41.760> we<00:03:41.879> progressed<00:03:42.180> our<00:03:42.299> way<00:03:42.389> up<00:03:42.629> you<00:03:42.870> can<00:03:42.930> see

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
as we progressed our way up you can see

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.960 
as we progressed our way up you can see
that<00:03:43.229> there<00:03:43.530> is<00:03:43.620> actually<00:03:44.159> this<00:03:44.729> other

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
that there is actually this other

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.759 
that there is actually this other
building<00:03:45.449> here<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:45.840> that<00:03:45.959> has<00:03:46.049> a<00:03:46.109> rock<00:03:46.500> ledge

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
building here and that has a rock ledge

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.349 
building here and that has a rock ledge
that<00:03:46.949> you<00:03:47.010> can<00:03:47.099> climb<00:03:47.340> over<00:03:47.639> so<00:03:47.940> this<00:03:48.120> is<00:03:48.239> a

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
that you can climb over so this is a

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.089 
that you can climb over so this is a
well<00:03:48.569> kind<00:03:48.720> of<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.900> one-way<00:03:49.199> access<00:03:49.650> point<00:03:49.919> into

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
well kind of a one-way access point into

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.750 
well kind of a one-way access point into
that<00:03:50.310> base

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
that base

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.250 
that base
anyways<00:03:51.389> that<00:03:51.510> here's<00:03:51.750> where<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:51.959> race<00:03:52.109> is

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
anyways that here's where the race is

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.839 
anyways that here's where the race is
gonna<00:03:52.379> spawn<00:03:52.709> it<00:03:53.250> has<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.609> height<00:03:53.819> advantage

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
gonna spawn it has the height advantage

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.300 
gonna spawn it has the height advantage
over<00:03:54.419> the<00:03:54.690> mantas<00:03:55.109> however<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.799> Mantis<00:03:56.129> has<00:03:56.250> a

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
over the mantas however the Mantis has a

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.830 
over the mantas however the Mantis has a
little<00:03:56.639> more<00:03:56.760> maneuverability<00:03:57.299> since<00:03:57.720> the

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
little more maneuverability since the

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.270 
little more maneuverability since the
Wraith<00:03:57.989> is<00:03:58.139> a<00:03:58.169> little<00:03:58.409> larger<00:03:58.709> and<00:03:58.829> cumbersome

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
Wraith is a little larger and cumbersome

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.339 
Wraith is a little larger and cumbersome
as<00:03:59.459> it<00:03:59.579> goes<00:03:59.699> down<00:03:59.879> this<00:04:00.030> highway<00:04:00.419> this<00:04:01.109> is<00:04:01.229> the

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
as it goes down this highway this is the

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:02.869 
as it goes down this highway this is the
main<00:04:01.560> vehicle<00:04:01.949> route<00:04:02.310> if<00:04:02.459> you<00:04:02.549> want<00:04:02.729> to<00:04:02.790> go

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
main vehicle route if you want to go

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.159 
main vehicle route if you want to go
from<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.150> upper<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.569> lower<00:04:03.659> level

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
from the upper to the lower level

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:06.199 
from the upper to the lower level
however<00:04:04.680> their<00:04:05.310> Mantis<00:04:05.609> like<00:04:05.790> I<00:04:05.879> said<00:04:06.060> has<00:04:06.180> a

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
however their Mantis like I said has a

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.819 
however their Mantis like I said has a
little<00:04:06.479> more<00:04:06.599> maneuverability<00:04:07.079> and<00:04:07.409> that's

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
little more maneuverability and that's

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:08.809 
little more maneuverability and that's
actually<00:04:07.979> we're<00:04:08.220> gonna<00:04:08.310> find<00:04:08.519> the<00:04:08.609> last
