just Wi-Fi that is a great
differentiator<00:01:02.879> here<00:01:03.120> between<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
differentiator here between this and the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.510 
differentiator here between this and the
previous<00:01:04.290> Android<00:01:05.040> camera<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.670> nikon<00:01:06.439> s800c

previous Android camera the nikon s800c
this<00:01:08.520> one<00:01:08.820> actually<00:01:09.090> has<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.390> data<00:01:09.720> connection

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
this one actually has a data connection

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.130 
this one actually has a data connection
so<00:01:10.530> you're<00:01:10.710> always<00:01:11.280> connected<00:01:12.140> obviously

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
so you're always connected obviously

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.600 
so you're always connected obviously
that's<00:01:13.260> going<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.619> cost<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.040> little<00:01:14.159> bit<00:01:14.280> per

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
that's going to cost a little bit per

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.880 
that's going to cost a little bit per
month<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.150> actually<00:01:15.479> not<00:01:15.630> as<00:01:15.810> much<00:01:15.990> as<00:01:16.049> a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
month it's actually not as much as a

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.399 
month it's actually not as much as a
smartphone<00:01:17.640> data<00:01:17.790> plan<00:01:18.119> which<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.479> nice<00:01:18.659> you

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
smartphone data plan which is nice you

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.560 
smartphone data plan which is nice you
can<00:01:19.590> actually<00:01:19.799> set<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.610> hard<00:01:20.970> limit<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.540> how

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
can actually set a hard limit on how

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.410 
can actually set a hard limit on how
much<00:01:21.840> data<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.500> upload<00:01:22.950> over<00:01:23.490> your<00:01:23.759> data<00:01:24.180> plan

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
much data you upload over your data plan

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.300 
much data you upload over your data plan
so<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.659> make<00:01:24.900> sure<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.170> never<00:01:25.470> go<00:01:25.770> over<00:01:25.799> and

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
so you make sure you never go over and

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.270 
so you make sure you never go over and
