ability to manufacture here most cable

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.870 
ability to manufacture here most cable
manufacturers<00:01:18.380> it's<00:01:18.619> far<00:01:18.829> easier<00:01:18.860> to<00:01:19.250> even<00:01:19.820> if

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
manufacturers it's far easier to even if

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.279 
manufacturers it's far easier to even if
they<00:01:20.000> designed<00:01:20.329> about<00:01:20.600> themselves<00:01:21.020> they

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
they designed about themselves they

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.050 
they designed about themselves they
haven't<00:01:21.560> made<00:01:21.710> offshore<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:22.700> then<00:01:22.789> bring<00:01:22.970> it

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
haven't made offshore and then bring it

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.209 
haven't made offshore and then bring it
over<00:01:23.299> to<00:01:23.869> what<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.439> connectors<00:01:24.860> all<00:01:25.009> over

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:25.219 
over to what the connectors all over

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:27.310 
over to what the connectors all over
here<00:01:25.429> it's<00:01:25.640> just<00:01:25.670> more<00:01:26.030> cost<00:01:26.420> if<00:01:26.689> they<00:01:26.840> do<00:01:27.200> it

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
here it's just more cost if they do it

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.990 
here it's just more cost if they do it
that<00:01:27.470> way<00:01:27.590> we<00:01:28.340> actually<00:01:28.610> believe<00:01:28.850> in

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
that way we actually believe in

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.370 
that way we actually believe in
manufacturing<00:01:29.600> everything<00:01:30.079> soup-to-nuts

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380

and<00:02:10.190> how<00:02:10.429> they<00:02:10.729> transcend<00:02:11.239> over<00:02:11.420> what<00:02:11.599> you

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
and how they transcend over what you

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.190 
and how they transcend over what you
hear<00:02:12.880> you<00:02:13.880> notice<00:02:14.209> one<00:02:14.390> perspective<00:02:14.810> most

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
hear you notice one perspective most

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.780 
hear you notice one perspective most
companies<00:02:15.500> don't<00:02:15.680> do<00:02:15.859> which<00:02:16.069> is<00:02:16.190> propagation

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
companies don't do which is propagation

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.849 
companies don't do which is propagation
to<00:02:16.910> life<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.600> that's<00:02:17.690> how<00:02:17.840> fast<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.500> cables

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:18.859 
to life and that's how fast the cables

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:20.470 
to life and that's how fast the cables
are<00:02:19.010> and

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
are and

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.630 
are and
myself<00:02:21.200> only<00:02:21.530> being<00:02:21.770> ignored<00:02:22.010> on<00:02:22.160> about<00:02:22.430> five

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
myself only being ignored on about five

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.150 
myself only being ignored on about five
years<00:02:23.240> I<00:02:23.270> always<00:02:23.480> thought<00:02:23.780> what<00:02:24.500> relevance<00:02:24.739> is

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
years I always thought what relevance is

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.490 
years I always thought what relevance is
that<00:02:25.190> you<00:02:25.730> know<00:02:25.819> cables<00:02:26.270> fast<00:02:26.540> like<00:02:26.900> this<00:02:27.110> then

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
that you know cables fast like this then

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.589 
that you know cables fast like this then
this<00:02:27.950> matter

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
this matter

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.930 
this matter
two<00:02:30.470> years<00:02:30.739> ago<00:02:30.830> we<00:02:31.220> came<00:02:31.370> out<00:02:31.520> with<00:02:31.580> a<00:02:31.670> product

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
two years ago we came out with a product

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.790 
two years ago we came out with a product
that<00:02:32.150> actually<00:02:32.660> showed<00:02:33.020> you<00:02:33.260> why<00:02:33.500> it<00:02:33.560> was

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
that actually showed you why it was

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.650 
that actually showed you why it was
important<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:34.819> product<00:02:34.970> was<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.239> USB

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
important and that product was a USB

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.479 
important and that product was a USB
cable<00:02:35.840> there's<00:02:36.800> a<00:02:36.830> lot<00:02:36.980> of<00:02:37.040> people<00:02:37.160> look<00:02:37.370> at

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
cable there's a lot of people look at

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.010 
cable there's a lot of people look at
your<00:02:37.580> speakers<00:02:38.030> when<00:02:38.239> the<00:02:38.330> new<00:02:38.420> Power<00:02:38.600> Core<00:02:38.900> is

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
your speakers when the new Power Core is

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.740 
your speakers when the new Power Core is
old<00:02:39.200> can't<00:02:39.830> make<00:02:39.980> a<00:02:40.010> difference<00:02:40.459> in<00:02:40.610> its<00:02:41.450> ones

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
old can't make a difference in its ones

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.340 
old can't make a difference in its ones
and<00:02:41.989> zeros<00:02:42.319> is<00:02:42.590> just<00:02:42.770> one<00:02:42.920> point<00:02:43.760> big<00:02:44.260> but<00:02:45.260> they

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
and zeros is just one point big but they

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.229 
and zeros is just one point big but they
don't<00:02:45.530> realize<00:02:45.890> is<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.220> USB<00:02:46.550> when<00:02:46.940> you<00:02:47.000> use<00:02:47.209> a

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
don't realize is the USB when you use a

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.000 
don't realize is the USB when you use a
variety<00:02:47.690> of<00:02:47.720> applications<00:02:48.350> actually<00:02:48.769> a<00:02:48.800> bit

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
variety of applications actually a bit

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.460 
variety of applications actually a bit
stream<00:02:49.340> it's<00:02:49.550> not<00:02:49.670> data<00:02:49.910> packets<00:02:50.390> so<00:02:51.080> all<00:02:51.349> of<00:02:51.410> a

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
stream it's not data packets so all of a

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.990 
stream it's not data packets so all of a
sudden<00:02:51.709> these<00:02:51.890> technologies<00:02:52.519> become<00:02:52.790> very

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
sudden these technologies become very

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.509 
sudden these technologies become very
important<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:54.620> easiest<00:02:54.860> way<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.069> tell<00:02:55.280> this

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
important the easiest way to tell this

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.530 
important the easiest way to tell this
is<00:02:55.760> that<00:02:55.880> if<00:02:55.970> you<00:02:56.090> go<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:56.300> any<00:02:56.660> store<00:02:57.610> in<00:02:58.610> North

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
is that if you go to any store in North

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.220 
is that if you go to any store in North
America<00:03:00.080> asked<00:03:00.830> by<00:03:01.069> a<00:03:01.100> USB<00:03:01.489> cable<00:03:01.850> and<00:03:02.299> you<00:03:02.930> ask

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
America asked by a USB cable and you ask

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.690 
America asked by a USB cable and you ask
what<00:03:03.530> about<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.799> longest<00:03:04.220> one<00:03:04.459> that<00:03:04.580> you

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
what about the longest one that you

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.120 
what about the longest one that you
manufacture<00:03:04.940> or<00:03:05.480> that<00:03:05.660> you<00:03:05.750> have<00:03:05.989> we're<00:03:06.950> still

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
manufacture or that you have we're still

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.240 
manufacture or that you have we're still
long<00:03:07.280> as<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:07.549> the<00:03:07.670> Vivian<00:03:08.799> is<00:03:09.799> a<00:03:09.920> MicroBot

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
long as to the Vivian is a MicroBot

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.059 
long as to the Vivian is a MicroBot
video<00:03:10.549> speed<00:03:10.819> to<00:03:10.940> kind<00:03:11.150> of<00:03:11.209> go<00:03:11.330> to<00:03:12.250> five<00:03:13.250> meters

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
video speed to kind of go to five meters

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.699 
video speed to kind of go to five meters
long<00:03:16.120> is<00:03:17.120> this<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.690> longest<00:03:17.870> theoretical<00:03:18.590> one

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
long is this the longest theoretical one

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.020 
long is this the longest theoretical one
that<00:03:18.860> you're<00:03:19.010> out<00:03:19.130> you're<00:03:19.459> allowed<00:03:19.700> to<00:03:19.819> build

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
that you're out you're allowed to build

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.780 
that you're out you're allowed to build
and<00:03:20.569> the<00:03:20.870> reason<00:03:21.230> for<00:03:21.410> that<00:03:21.470> is<00:03:21.739> because<00:03:21.790> USB

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
and the reason for that is because USB

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.670 
and the reason for that is because USB
cable<00:03:23.120> just<00:03:23.209> like<00:03:23.360> HDMI<00:03:23.900> there's<00:03:24.170> a<00:03:24.230> handshake

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
cable just like HDMI there's a handshake

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.160 
cable just like HDMI there's a handshake
so<00:03:25.640> when<00:03:25.970> you<00:03:26.090> connect<00:03:26.420> to<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.780> post<00:03:26.989> together

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
so when you connect to the post together

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.690 
so when you connect to the post together
to<00:03:27.440> have<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:27.620> shake<00:03:27.799> hands<00:03:28.040> they<00:03:28.400> have<00:03:28.519> to<00:03:28.579> do

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
to have to shake hands they have to do

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.630 
to have to shake hands they have to do
it<00:03:28.820> 22<00:03:29.180> milliseconds<00:03:29.780> so<00:03:30.470> five<00:03:30.950> feet<00:03:31.250> of<00:03:31.489> long

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
it 22 milliseconds so five feet of long

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.849 
it 22 milliseconds so five feet of long
as<00:03:31.790> you<00:03:31.880> can<00:03:32.030> do<00:03:32.180> well<00:03:32.900> nor<00:03:33.170> dock<00:03:33.350> using<00:03:33.650> this

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
as you can do well nor dock using this

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.620 
as you can do well nor dock using this
technology<00:03:34.489> and<00:03:34.670> build<00:03:34.880> 14<00:03:35.420> meter<00:03:35.750> cables

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
technology and build 14 meter cables

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.340 
technology and build 14 meter cables
a<00:03:38.820> lot<00:03:39.820> of<00:03:39.850> things<00:03:40.060> that's<00:03:40.630> that<00:03:40.780> speed<00:03:41.110> thing

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
a lot of things that's that speed thing

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.470 
a lot of things that's that speed thing
that<00:03:41.500> becomes<00:03:41.740> I<00:03:42.190> said<00:03:42.400> maybe<00:03:42.580> speech<00:03:43.090> topping

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
that becomes I said maybe speech topping

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.050 
that becomes I said maybe speech topping
pretty<00:03:43.690> good<00:03:44.160> yeah<00:03:45.190> you're<00:03:45.520> not<00:03:45.700> believe<00:03:45.940> how

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
pretty good yeah you're not believe how

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.000 
pretty good yeah you're not believe how
good<00:03:46.240> if<00:03:46.570> your<00:03:46.690> fee<00:03:46.840> exa<00:03:46.990> can't<00:03:47.380> stop<00:03:47.650> when<00:03:47.890> you

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
good if your fee exa can't stop when you

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.570 
good if your fee exa can't stop when you
do<00:03:48.130> a<00:03:48.160> business<00:03:48.670> right<00:03:49.080> so<00:03:50.250> with<00:03:51.250> that<00:03:51.370> much
