00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.470 
don't get enough gas and air mixture
together<00:05:58.230> you<00:05:58.560> have<00:05:58.680> to<00:05:58.920> take<00:05:59.220> that<00:05:59.550> happens

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
together you have to take that happens

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.090 
together you have to take that happens
usually<00:06:00.900> you<00:06:01.200> burn<00:06:01.410> an<00:06:01.530> engine<00:06:01.800> up<00:06:01.920> and<00:06:02.040> it

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
usually you burn an engine up and it

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.410 
usually you burn an engine up and it
doesn't<00:06:02.370> take<00:06:02.400> very<00:06:02.520> long<00:06:02.790> for<00:06:02.940> that<00:06:03.150> to<00:06:03.210> half

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.420 
doesn't take very long for that to half

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.330 
doesn't take very long for that to half
past<00:06:03.690> or<00:06:03.840> even<00:06:03.900> one<00:06:04.110> there<00:06:04.260> watching<00:06:04.620> it

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.250 

yeah<00:06:07.580> I<00:06:07.610> think<00:06:08.030> today<00:06:08.389> is<00:06:08.600> going<00:06:08.780> to<00:06:08.840> be<00:06:08.900> okay

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
yeah I think today is going to be okay

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.570 
yeah I think today is going to be okay
though<00:06:09.410> there's<00:06:09.680> enough<00:06:09.949> of<00:06:10.100> that<00:06:10.130> opening

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
though there's enough of that opening

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.280 
though there's enough of that opening
there<00:06:10.790> that<00:06:11.000> but<00:06:11.389> what<00:06:11.570> happens<00:06:11.930> is<00:06:12.020> he<00:06:12.199> gets

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
there that but what happens is he gets

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.439 
there that but what happens is he gets
back<00:06:12.650> closer<00:06:12.949> to<00:06:13.100> the<00:06:13.340> windshield<00:06:13.880> that's<00:06:14.300> a

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:14.449 
back closer to the windshield that's a

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:16.510 
back closer to the windshield that's a
lower<00:06:14.630> low<00:06:15.230> pressure<00:06:15.560> area<00:06:15.949> right<00:06:16.130> in<00:06:16.160> front

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
lower low pressure area right in front

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.189 
lower low pressure area right in front
of<00:06:16.610> the<00:06:16.729> windshield<00:06:17.000> right<00:06:17.300> there<00:06:17.570> and<00:06:18.020> that's

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:18.199 
of the windshield right there and that's

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:20.500 
of the windshield right there and that's
why<00:06:18.350> it<00:06:18.410> won't<00:06:18.620> peel<00:06:18.830> off<00:06:19.330> let's<00:06:20.330> get<00:06:20.419> an

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.510 
why it won't peel off let's get an

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.810 
why it won't peel off let's get an
update<00:06:20.570> on<00:06:20.750> Kenny<00:06:21.110> Wallace<00:06:21.470> dick<00:06:21.680> he's<00:06:22.430> okay

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820 
update on Kenny Wallace dick he's okay

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.760 
update on Kenny Wallace dick he's okay
like<00:06:23.030> the<00:06:23.180> problem<00:06:23.570> indeed<00:06:23.870> was<00:06:24.110> the<00:06:24.139> ignition

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
like the problem indeed was the ignition

box he saw the fuel pressure gauge
bouncing

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
bouncing

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.170 
bouncing
he<00:06:30.020> had<00:06:30.170> a<00:06:30.200> fuel<00:06:30.500> problem<00:06:30.889> but<00:06:31.730> then<00:06:31.910> he<00:06:31.970> kept

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
he had a fuel problem but then he kept

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.700 
he had a fuel problem but then he kept
watching<00:06:32.389> the<00:06:32.600> gauge<00:06:32.780> and<00:06:32.990> it<00:06:33.080> kept<00:06:33.290> bouncing

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
watching the gauge and it kept bouncing

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.530 
watching the gauge and it kept bouncing
around<00:06:33.800> so<00:06:34.190> he's<00:06:34.400> decided<00:06:34.580> well<00:06:35.060> he<00:06:35.270> didn't

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:35.540 
around so he's decided well he didn't

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.850 
around so he's decided well he didn't
watch<00:06:35.660> the<00:06:35.690> gate<00:06:35.960> earlier<00:06:36.350> in<00:06:36.440> the<00:06:36.530> race<00:06:36.650> he

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
watch the gate earlier in the race he

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.710 
watch the gate earlier in the race he
watches<00:06:37.190> it<00:06:37.310> down<00:06:37.490> that<00:06:38.060> gauge<00:06:38.270> seems<00:06:38.600> to

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 
watches it down that gauge seems to

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.100 
watches it down that gauge seems to
simply<00:06:39.050> bounce<00:06:39.200> around<00:06:39.590> so<00:06:40.070> he's<00:06:40.250> okay<00:06:41.110> to

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110 
simply bounce around so he's okay to

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.750 
simply bounce around so he's okay to

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.110 
degrees in some times hotter than that

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.140 
degrees in some times hotter than that
on<00:07:00.290> the<00:07:00.350> floorboard<00:07:00.800> it<00:07:01.100> can<00:07:01.280> actually<00:07:01.460> make<00:07:02.120> a

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.150
