really stood out to me never seen

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.770 
really stood out to me never seen
anything<00:01:25.620> like<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:26.160> before<00:01:26.510> and<00:01:27.510> what's

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
anything like this before and what's

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.080 
anything like this before and what's
impressed<00:01:28.140> me<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.620> most<00:01:28.650> that's<00:01:29.040> their<00:01:29.880> work

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
impressed me the most that's their work

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.030 
impressed me the most that's their work
in<00:01:30.300> hood<00:01:30.540> as<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> team<00:01:31.110> they<00:01:31.620> played<00:01:31.800> a<00:01:31.830> really

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
in hood as a team they played a really

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.890 
in hood as a team they played a really
high<00:01:32.190> stands<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.760> think<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.180> like<00:01:33.690> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
high stands and I think the like the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.240 
high stands and I think the like the
precision<00:01:34.320> which<00:01:34.470> they<00:01:34.590> did<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.770> passes<00:01:35.130> and

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
precision which they did the passes and

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.580 
precision which they did the passes and
stuff<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.610> really<00:01:35.820> phenomenal<00:01:36.690> we'd<00:01:37.290> all<00:01:37.410> love

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
to be in the bear Olympics it'd be a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.940 
to be in the bear Olympics it'd be a
