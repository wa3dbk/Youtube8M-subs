how you doing this afternoon what we've

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:13.900 
how you doing this afternoon what we've
got<00:00:11.990> here<00:00:12.349> is<00:00:12.500> a<00:00:12.530> rope<00:00:12.950> from<00:00:13.219> Yale<00:00:13.459> it's<00:00:13.700> called

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
got here is a rope from Yale it's called

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.359 
got here is a rope from Yale it's called
Kern<00:00:14.209> master<00:00:14.750> it's<00:00:15.559> not<00:00:15.740> a<00:00:15.769> new<00:00:15.980> rope<00:00:16.189> it's

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
Kern master it's not a new rope it's

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.310 
Kern master it's not a new rope it's
been<00:00:16.520> around<00:00:16.730> for<00:00:16.970> quite<00:00:17.000> a<00:00:17.180> while<00:00:17.419> but<00:00:18.140> it's

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
been around for quite a while but it's

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.560 
been around for quite a while but it's
got<00:00:18.470> some<00:00:18.650> properties<00:00:19.160> that<00:00:19.430> lend<00:00:19.820> itself<00:00:20.150> to

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
got some properties that lend itself to

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.940 
got some properties that lend itself to
being<00:00:20.810> used<00:00:21.079> in<00:00:21.230> tree<00:00:21.470> work

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
being used in tree work

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.730 
being used in tree work
it's<00:00:22.430> a<00:00:22.579> kernmantle<00:00:22.820> rope<00:00:23.390> one<00:00:24.380> unique<00:00:24.679> thing

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
it's a kernmantle rope one unique thing

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.800 
it's a kernmantle rope one unique thing
is<00:00:25.250> the<00:00:25.369> nylon<00:00:25.760> core<00:00:26.029> is<00:00:26.119> braided<00:00:26.599> in<00:00:26.689> this

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
is the nylon core is braided in this

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.259 
is the nylon core is braided in this
particular<00:00:27.109> row<00:00:27.500> it's<00:00:28.490> got<00:00:28.640> a<00:00:28.670> really<00:00:29.060> good

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
particular row it's got a really good

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.490 
particular row it's got a really good
hand<00:00:30.279> nice<00:00:31.279> soft<00:00:31.699> supple<00:00:32.029> lay<00:00:32.390> makes<00:00:33.379> it

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
hand nice soft supple lay makes it

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.770 
hand nice soft supple lay makes it
really<00:00:34.220> easy<00:00:34.460> to<00:00:34.580> tie<00:00:34.820> knots<00:00:35.120> with<00:00:35.420> this<00:00:35.660> is

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
really easy to tie knots with this is

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.710 
really easy to tie knots with this is
the<00:00:35.930> only<00:00:36.110> static<00:00:36.769> line<00:00:37.010> dot<00:00:37.610> that<00:00:38.360> I've<00:00:38.449> used

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
the only static line dot that I've used

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.720 
the only static line dot that I've used
so<00:00:38.930> far<00:00:39.199> is<00:00:39.379> you<00:00:39.530> can<00:00:39.860> use<00:00:40.160> double<00:00:40.579> rope

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
so far is you can use double rope

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.389 
so far is you can use double rope
technique<00:00:41.000> it's<00:00:41.989> not<00:00:42.230> hitch<00:00:42.469> cord<00:00:42.770> specific

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
technique it's not hitch cord specific

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.610 
technique it's not hitch cord specific
but<00:00:43.579> it<00:00:43.670> will<00:00:43.850> work<00:00:44.149> in<00:00:44.450> doubled<00:00:44.809> rope<00:00:45.020> so<00:00:45.410> this

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
but it will work in doubled rope so this

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.310 
but it will work in doubled rope so this
being<00:00:45.950> a<00:00:46.070> nylon<00:00:46.489> cords<00:00:46.940> kernmantle<00:00:47.600> static

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
being a nylon cords kernmantle static

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.860 
being a nylon cords kernmantle static
line<00:00:48.559> there<00:00:49.190> is<00:00:49.340> a<00:00:49.370> bit<00:00:49.610> of<00:00:49.730> stretch<00:00:50.030> it's<00:00:50.600> not

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
line there is a bit of stretch it's not

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.010 
line there is a bit of stretch it's not
a<00:00:51.579> really<00:00:52.579> big<00:00:52.610> deal<00:00:52.789> but<00:00:53.270> compared<00:00:53.629> to<00:00:53.690> some

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
a really big deal but compared to some

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.010 
a really big deal but compared to some
other<00:00:54.289> more<00:00:54.559> true<00:00:55.180> static<00:00:56.180> low<00:00:56.420> stretch<00:00:56.719> climb

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
other more true static low stretch climb

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.930 
other more true static low stretch climb
lines<00:00:57.320> you<00:00:57.980> will<00:00:58.190> have<00:00:58.460> a<00:00:58.489> little<00:00:58.699> bit<00:00:58.910> of

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
lines you will have a little bit of

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.819 
lines you will have a little bit of
stretch<00:00:59.300> you<00:00:59.510> could<00:00:59.660> compare<00:00:59.989> it<00:01:00.109> to<00:01:00.230> our<00:01:00.260> 24

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
stretch you could compare it to our 24

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.680 
stretch you could compare it to our 24
strand<00:01:01.160> climb<00:01:01.399> lines<00:01:01.670> like<00:01:01.910> velocity<00:01:02.390> blade

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
strand climb lines like velocity blade

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.200 
strand climb lines like velocity blade
blue<00:01:02.989> moon<00:01:03.199> Tachyon<00:01:03.859> but<00:01:04.580> we've<00:01:04.699> got<00:01:04.879> it<00:01:04.910> set

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
blue moon Tachyon but we've got it set

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.330 
blue moon Tachyon but we've got it set
up<00:01:05.239> here<00:01:05.660> we're<00:01:06.229> going<00:01:06.350> to<00:01:06.410> isolate<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:07.160> tie

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
up here we're going to isolate the tie

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.279 
up here we're going to isolate the tie
end<00:01:07.550> point<00:01:07.820> just<00:01:08.780> to<00:01:08.840> kind<00:01:09.020> of<00:01:09.080> demonstrate

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:09.289 
end point just to kind of demonstrate

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:13.030 
end point just to kind of demonstrate
the<00:01:10.100> knot<00:01:10.280> ability<00:01:10.729> of<00:01:10.910> it<00:01:11.619> I'm<00:01:12.619> gonna<00:01:12.770> tie<00:01:13.009> a

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
the knot ability of it I'm gonna tie a

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:25.560 
the knot ability of it I'm gonna tie a
butterfly

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.179 

so<00:01:26.570> it<00:01:26.689> is<00:01:26.840> it<00:01:26.990> you<00:01:27.259> know<00:01:27.350> kernmantle<00:01:27.680> ropes

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
so it is it you know kernmantle ropes

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.880 
so it is it you know kernmantle ropes
oftentimes<00:01:28.850> are<00:01:29.060> pretty<00:01:29.810> stiff<00:01:30.229> and<00:01:30.530> this

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
oftentimes are pretty stiff and this

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:51.850 
oftentimes are pretty stiff and this
knots<00:01:31.280> really<00:01:31.759> easily<00:01:49.689> so<00:01:50.689> again<00:01:50.990> it's<00:01:51.200> a<00:01:51.380> nice

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
knots really easily so again it's a nice

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.950 
knots really easily so again it's a nice
you<00:01:52.100> know<00:01:52.250> tight<00:01:52.520> polyester<00:01:53.240> jacket<00:01:53.479> with<00:01:53.929> a

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
you know tight polyester jacket with a

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.249 
you know tight polyester jacket with a
braided<00:01:54.289> nylon<00:01:54.590> core<00:01:55.630> somewhat<00:01:56.630> unique<00:01:56.990> and

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
braided nylon core somewhat unique and

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.130 
braided nylon core somewhat unique and
kernmantle<00:01:57.500> climb<00:01:58.130> lines<00:01:58.399> and<00:01:59.390> that's<00:01:59.929> the

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
kernmantle climb lines and that's the

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.069 
kernmantle climb lines and that's the
