the image but there's the two options

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.930 
the image but there's the two options
that<00:02:49.209> it<00:02:49.330> could<00:02:49.480> be<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:49.950> yeah<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:51.069> looks<00:02:51.220> like

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
that it could be and yeah it looks like

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.790

a<00:02:51.970> really<00:02:52.120> good<00:02:52.270> gun<00:02:52.480> then<00:02:52.989> we<00:02:53.080> go<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.230> hammer<00:02:53.560> a

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
a really good gun then we go to hammer a

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.620 
a really good gun then we go to hammer a
light<00:02:54.069> machine<00:02:54.489> gun<00:02:54.670> looks<00:02:55.209> like<00:02:55.360> an<00:02:55.450> absolute

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
light machine gun looks like an absolute

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.610 
light machine gun looks like an absolute
based<00:02:56.020> on<00:02:56.140> when<00:02:56.230> i<00:02:56.260> play<00:02:56.440> with<00:02:56.590> the

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
based on when i play with the

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.680 
based on when i play with the
multiplayer<00:02:57.459> it<00:02:57.700> was<00:02:57.790> an<00:02:57.910> absolute<00:02:58.209> based<00:02:58.450> gun

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
multiplayer it was an absolute based gun

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.130 
multiplayer it was an absolute based gun
then<00:02:59.320> we<00:02:59.440> got<00:02:59.590> this<00:02:59.769> special<00:02:59.980> gun<00:03:00.489> this<00:03:01.300> must

then we got this special gun this must
be<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.380> bootable<00:03:02.680> gun<00:03:02.920> I'm<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.370> hundred<00:03:03.700> percent

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
be a bootable gun I'm a hundred percent

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.600 
be a bootable gun I'm a hundred percent
if<00:03:04.690> not<00:03:05.050> 99<00:03:05.350> percent<00:03:05.800> sure<00:03:05.950> that<00:03:06.340> this<00:03:06.430> is<00:03:06.580> a

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
if not 99 percent sure that this is a

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.830 
if not 99 percent sure that this is a
bootable<00:03:06.910> gun<00:03:07.150> you<00:03:07.300> can<00:03:07.420> just<00:03:07.570> steal<00:03:07.660> the

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
bootable gun you can just steal the

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.540 
bootable gun you can just steal the
attachments<00:03:08.739> and<00:03:08.800> stuff<00:03:08.980> that<00:03:09.010> go<00:03:09.280> into<00:03:09.430> it

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
attachments and stuff that go into it

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.770 
attachments and stuff that go into it
just<00:03:10.090> looks<00:03:10.269> like<00:03:10.390> it's<00:03:10.510> going<00:03:10.600> to<00:03:10.690> be<00:03:10.750> a

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
just looks like it's going to be a

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.020 
just looks like it's going to be a
bootable<00:03:11.050> gun<00:03:11.290> then<00:03:12.010> we<00:03:12.130> got<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.370> executioner

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
bootable gun then we got the executioner

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.670 
bootable gun then we got the executioner
which<00:03:13.180> is<00:03:13.300> an<00:03:13.390> absolute<00:03:13.720> based<00:03:13.959> of<00:03:14.170> a<00:03:14.230> pistol

which is an absolute based of a pistol

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.860 
which is an absolute based of a pistol
then<00:03:15.519> we<00:03:15.640> go<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.910> kap-40<00:03:16.420> which<00:03:16.720> is<00:03:16.840> a

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
then we go to the kap-40 which is a

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.080 
then we go to the kap-40 which is a
fully<00:03:17.170> automatic<00:03:17.530> pistol<00:03:18.100> and<00:03:18.250> it's<00:03:18.790> a<00:03:18.880> really

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
tear shit up in zombies i don't think

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.229 
tear shit up in zombies i don't think
that<00:04:10.299> you<00:04:10.390> get<00:04:10.600> a<00:04:10.780> lot<00:04:11.230> of<00:04:11.260> ammo<00:04:11.709> for<00:04:11.980> it<00:04:12.040> but<00:04:12.790> it

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
that you get a lot of ammo for it but it

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:14.460 
that you get a lot of ammo for it but it
is<00:04:13.329> going<00:04:13.480> to<00:04:13.540> be<00:04:13.570> very<00:04:13.750> overpowered<00:04:14.290> so

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.449 
is going to be very overpowered so
that's<00:04:14.620> why<00:04:14.769> i<00:04:14.799> think<00:04:14.950> they'll<00:04:15.160> give<00:04:15.310> it<00:04:15.340> to

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459

that's why i think they'll give it to
