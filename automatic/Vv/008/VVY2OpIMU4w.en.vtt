demonstrate of what I see some of the

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.609 
demonstrate of what I see some of the
differences<00:01:37.149> between<00:01:37.210> a<00:01:37.840> more<00:01:38.289> old-school

all right so I'm going to talk about how
we<00:01:50.160> take<00:01:50.400> small<00:01:50.990> melodic<00:01:52.400> ideas<00:01:53.630> or<00:01:54.630> or

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320

we take small melodic ideas or or
sequences<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.310> how<00:01:57.120> we<00:01:57.180> try<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:58.040> expand<00:01:59.040> them

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
sequences and how we try to expand them

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.530 
sequences and how we try to expand them
by<00:01:59.550> moving<00:01:59.910> across<00:02:00.870> octaves<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:05.240> said<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.390> is
