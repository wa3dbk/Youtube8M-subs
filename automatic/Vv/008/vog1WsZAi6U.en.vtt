00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
the trick here was to run my new lace

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.180 
the trick here was to run my new lace
underneath<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:35.040> shoelace<00:03:36.380> there<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.799> right

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
underneath the shoelace there and right

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.130 
underneath the shoelace there and right
here<00:03:38.400> it's<00:03:38.549> underneath<00:03:38.880> it<00:03:39.299> so<00:03:39.660> I<00:03:39.690> didn't

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
here it's underneath it so I didn't

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.900 
here it's underneath it so I didn't
cover<00:03:40.350> up<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.799> old<00:03:40.950> shoelace<00:03:41.190> that's<00:03:41.700> still

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
cover up the old shoelace that's still

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.449 
cover up the old shoelace that's still
showing<00:03:42.209> otherwise<00:03:42.780> my<00:03:43.739> new<00:03:43.920> lace<00:03:44.130> would<00:03:44.340> have

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
showing otherwise my new lace would have

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.699 
showing otherwise my new lace would have
covered<00:03:44.760> it<00:03:44.880> up<00:03:45.000> so<00:03:45.330> I'd<00:03:45.959> be<00:03:46.170> careful<00:03:46.590> with

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
covered it up so I'd be careful with

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.370 
covered it up so I'd be careful with
that<00:03:46.830> and<00:03:47.540> so<00:03:48.540> that's<00:03:48.720> what<00:03:48.900> it<00:03:48.989> looks<00:03:49.200> like

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
that and so that's what it looks like

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.620 
that and so that's what it looks like
and<00:03:49.680> now<00:03:50.070> he's<00:03:50.250> got<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.489> new<00:03:50.640> glove<00:03:51.120> but<00:03:51.510> it

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
and now he's got a new glove but it

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.539 
and now he's got a new glove but it
still<00:03:51.840> got<00:03:52.019> the<00:03:52.200> old<00:03:52.230> character<00:03:53.010> that<00:03:53.160> he<00:03:53.370> was
