00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:02.510
 hello, my friends, my name is your catalog 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.510
 maybe they do not know me some but tells them about my story 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.760
 better not 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.589
 Who is interested in the lives of others 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:12.569
 I think that many 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:14.279
 they have no heat 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:15.199
 no mames 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.019
 that means that the hostel hole is already well dilated but I'm not 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.860
 talking about no Japanese 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.390
 the ozone layer is in the atmosphere up there at the level of the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.240
 stratosphere 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.529
 and it's called a bear, not because there's a bunch of this gas up there 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.869
 that serves as a reflector so that the sun does not turn us into 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.760
 chicharrón but because we are half of culeros with the planet is already 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.150
 well bored the day before yesterday I bought a massa bread in the little shop of dona mary 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.420

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.650

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.250
 jara gejo 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.060
 returning to the subject I threw the wrapper of my bread dough in the street and it was worth 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.870
 path but then react and I said 'no bed bugs 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.079
 is that it is the same to throw a piece of paper that throw 12 kilos of gas chinga in the 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.879
 street and many people do it and it's worth it I know that sometimes the 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.090
 culeros the truck but it is not to mud the streets apart it looks 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.400
 tell who is affected is ourselves and not the fucking government 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.830
 we are in a society in a state and in an organization there are people who 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.330
 they charge everything and among them the culés those who take the garbage to 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.980
 pull tala Belgian aching to and discover where the cock is because there I will send 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.750

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.440
 trash wherever and then you complain that your city is fine

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:31.139
 little friends 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:33.290
 if there is not a boat near where you are 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.370
 keep the garbage in what you find one so it's easier and the 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.370
 trash bastards will take it faster to the Belgian 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.109
 I do not want to look like all asshole saying this 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:45.849
 because the goal nobody takes heed 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.230
 but even if it sounds trite throw the garbage in its place all the garbage in your 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.149
 place 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:55.589
