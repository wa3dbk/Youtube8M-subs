recommended<00:03:15.209> because<00:03:15.269> that<00:03:15.599> just<00:03:15.630> takes<00:03:15.900> too

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
recommended because that just takes too

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.319 
recommended because that just takes too
long<00:03:16.109> and<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:17.069> my<00:03:17.370> economy<00:03:17.760> will<00:03:17.880> be<00:03:17.910> booming

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
long and it my economy will be booming

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.670 
long and it my economy will be booming
by<00:03:18.419> the<00:03:18.480> time<00:03:18.690> he<00:03:18.840> actually<00:03:18.989> break<00:03:19.230> cell<00:03:19.440> and

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
by the time he actually break cell and

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.530 
by the time he actually break cell and
really<00:03:19.889> if<00:03:20.489> he<00:03:20.639> breaks<00:03:20.790> this<00:03:21.000> board<00:03:21.299> all<00:03:21.510> i

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
really if he breaks this board all i

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.909 
really if he breaks this board all i
have<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.690> do<00:03:21.840> is<00:03:21.930> plant<00:03:22.109> like<00:03:22.290> three<00:03:22.500> cannons

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919

swift<00:06:07.070> money<00:06:07.250> actually<00:06:07.430> and<00:06:07.910> his<00:06:08.630> bullshit

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290 
swift money actually and his bullshit

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.140 
swift money actually and his bullshit
aspires<00:06:09.710> out<00:06:09.920> a<00:06:09.950> lot<00:06:10.280> earlier<00:06:10.460> than<00:06:10.760> I<00:06:10.970> thought

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
aspires out a lot earlier than I thought

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.690 
aspires out a lot earlier than I thought
um<00:06:11.420> I<00:06:12.290> kind<00:06:12.740> of<00:06:12.800> underestimated<00:06:12.980> that<00:06:13.340> timing

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:13.700 
um I kind of underestimated that timing

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.390 
um I kind of underestimated that timing
so<00:06:13.910> getting<00:06:14.810> two<00:06:14.990> cannons<00:06:15.350> to<00:06:16.100> be<00:06:16.190> safe

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
so getting two cannons to be safe

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.340 
so getting two cannons to be safe
generally<00:06:16.910> two<00:06:17.210> cannons<00:06:17.540> not<00:06:17.750> only<00:06:18.020> needed

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
generally two cannons not only needed

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.780 
generally two cannons not only needed
three<00:06:18.500> cannons<00:06:18.980> definitely<00:06:19.370> not<00:06:19.460> needed<00:06:19.700> a

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:19.790 
three cannons definitely not needed a

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.570 
three cannons definitely not needed a
fuck<00:06:20.030> all<00:06:20.300> right<00:06:20.450> that<00:06:21.080> was<00:06:21.110> very<00:06:21.680> lucky

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
fuck all right that was very lucky

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.070 
fuck all right that was very lucky
timing<00:06:22.910> on<00:06:23.150> his<00:06:23.180> part<00:06:23.300> those<00:06:23.660> cannons<00:06:23.990> were

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
timing on his part those cannons were

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.590 
timing on his part those cannons were
just<00:06:24.410> barely<00:06:24.860> not<00:06:25.190> done<00:06:25.430> and<00:06:26.240> now<00:06:26.390> i'm<00:06:26.480> gonna

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:26.600 
just barely not done and now i'm gonna

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.110 
just barely not done and now i'm gonna
count<00:06:26.750> up<00:06:26.960> here<00:06:27.310> because<00:06:28.310> i'm<00:06:28.670> a<00:06:28.730> bitch<00:06:28.970> like

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
count up here because i'm a bitch like

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.660 
count up here because i'm a bitch like
that<00:06:29.180> and<00:06:30.170> now<00:06:30.350> yeah<00:06:30.530> i<00:06:30.560> know<00:06:31.220> you<00:06:31.340> can<00:06:31.460> kill

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:31.670 
that and now yeah i know you can kill

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.490 
that and now yeah i know you can kill
this<00:06:31.760> probe<00:06:32.000> unless<00:06:32.780> he<00:06:32.870> sends<00:06:33.140> a<00:06:33.230> lot<00:06:33.380> of

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
this probe unless he sends a lot of

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.650 
this probe unless he sends a lot of
units<00:06:33.770> own<00:06:33.920> and<00:06:34.130> his<00:06:34.910> mule<00:06:35.150> is<00:06:35.270> to<00:06:35.330> come<00:06:35.480> to<00:06:35.600> my

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:35.660 
units own and his mule is to come to my

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.410 
units own and his mule is to come to my
base<00:06:35.870> and<00:06:36.140> now<00:06:36.410> oh<00:06:36.790> my<00:06:37.790> calves<00:06:38.000> might<00:06:38.210> not<00:06:38.330> be

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:38.420 
base and now oh my calves might not be

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.610 
base and now oh my calves might not be
in<00:06:38.510> time<00:06:38.720> because<00:06:38.960> this<00:06:39.110> medalist<00:06:39.470> came

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
in time because this medalist came

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.640 
in time because this medalist came
directly<00:06:39.950> to<00:06:40.040> my<00:06:40.220> base<00:06:40.400> after<00:06:40.850> oh<00:06:41.060> well<00:06:41.900> yeah

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
directly to my base after oh well yeah

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.190 
directly to my base after oh well yeah
they<00:06:42.950> should<00:06:43.280> be<00:06:43.310> in<00:06:43.550> time<00:06:43.790> oh<00:06:44.090> they<00:06:44.870> aren't<00:06:45.050> oh

is not good um not so good I was like be
sooo<00:06:53.240> like<00:06:53.450> timing<00:06:53.780> right<00:06:53.870> there<00:06:54.110> um<00:06:54.340> actually

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:55.340 
sooo like timing right there um actually

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.710 
sooo like timing right there um actually
I<00:06:55.520> was<00:06:55.640> a<00:06:55.730> little<00:06:56.150> bit<00:06:56.240> off<00:06:56.360> it<00:06:56.540> could<00:06:56.630> have

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720 
I was a little bit off it could have

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.360 
I was a little bit off it could have
been<00:06:56.810> just<00:06:56.870> like<00:06:57.230> one<00:06:57.500> second<00:06:57.920> better<00:06:58.070> but

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.370 
been just like one second better but

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.890 
been just like one second better but
that<00:06:59.000> was<00:06:59.090> actually<00:06:59.180> pretty<00:06:59.330> good<00:06:59.570> timing<00:06:59.810> on

00:06:59.890 --> 00:06:59.900 
that was actually pretty good timing on

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.810 
that was actually pretty good timing on
my<00:06:59.930> part<00:07:00.050> and<00:07:00.410> now<00:07:00.680> I<00:07:00.710> guys<00:07:00.980> all<00:07:01.190> is<00:07:01.340> base<00:07:01.610> to

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:01.820 
my part and now I guys all is base to

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.850 
my part and now I guys all is base to
sell<00:07:02.000> is<00:07:02.090> just<00:07:02.330> too<00:07:02.450> pretty<00:07:02.570> much<00:07:02.810> block<00:07:03.680> that

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:03.860 
sell is just too pretty much block that

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.200 
sell is just too pretty much block that
to<00:07:04.280> make<00:07:04.400> sure<00:07:04.550> he<00:07:04.670> doesn't<00:07:04.820> get<00:07:04.970> out<00:07:05.030> with

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.210 
to make sure he doesn't get out with

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:06.760 
to make sure he doesn't get out with
Matt<00:07:05.330> Sterling's<00:07:05.810> like<00:07:06.020> I<00:07:06.200> guarantee<00:07:06.530> you<00:07:06.620> not

Matt Sterling's like I guarantee you not

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.260 
Matt Sterling's like I guarantee you not
even<00:07:06.860> 50<00:07:07.310> seconds<00:07:07.640> to<00:07:07.760> be<00:07:07.880> able<00:07:07.940> to<00:07:08.090> get<00:07:08.180> out<00:07:08.240> of

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.270 
even 50 seconds to be able to get out of

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.690 
even 50 seconds to be able to get out of
this<00:07:08.420> and<00:07:09.380> now<00:07:09.620> I'm<00:07:09.950> pretty<00:07:10.310> much<00:07:10.400> going<00:07:10.640> to

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:10.700 
this and now I'm pretty much going to

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.100 
this and now I'm pretty much going to
count<00:07:10.940> him<00:07:11.120> right<00:07:11.270> over<00:07:11.360> here<00:07:11.630> because<00:07:11.900> if<00:07:12.050> you

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:12.110 
count him right over here because if you

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.970 
count him right over here because if you
think<00:07:12.140> about<00:07:12.320> it<00:07:12.470> there's<00:07:12.620> no<00:07:12.650> real<00:07:12.830> way<00:07:12.860> to

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:12.980 
think about it there's no real way to

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.320 
think about it there's no real way to
stop<00:07:13.220> him<00:07:13.370> because<00:07:13.670> if<00:07:13.820> he<00:07:13.850> tries<00:07:14.090> to<00:07:14.210> kill

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.330 
stop him because if he tries to kill

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.140 
stop him because if he tries to kill
that<00:07:14.450> gun<00:07:14.630> or<00:07:15.290> that<00:07:15.440> pylon<00:07:15.740> I<00:07:15.980> have<00:07:16.490> cannons<00:07:17.030> in

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:17.150 
that gun or that pylon I have cannons in

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.040 
that gun or that pylon I have cannons in
the<00:07:17.270> back<00:07:17.390> to<00:07:17.570> be<00:07:17.690> able<00:07:17.750> to<00:07:17.900> kill<00:07:18.020> us

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.050 
the back to be able to kill us

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.180 
the back to be able to kill us
Earthlings<00:07:18.530> are<00:07:18.620> trying<00:07:18.830> to<00:07:18.890> attack<00:07:19.070> that

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.190 
Earthlings are trying to attack that

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.770 
Earthlings are trying to attack that
pylon<00:07:19.490> and<00:07:20.860> the<00:07:21.860> middle<00:07:22.100> this<00:07:22.160> is<00:07:22.310> going<00:07:22.460> to<00:07:22.520> I

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:22.780 
pylon and the middle this is going to I

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.890 
pylon and the middle this is going to I
guess<00:07:23.780> we'll<00:07:24.020> list<00:07:24.200> the<00:07:24.260> way<00:07:24.410> to<00:07:24.470> do<00:07:24.620> this<00:07:24.710> and

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:25.900 
guess we'll list the way to do this and

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.970 
guess we'll list the way to do this and
honestly<00:07:26.900> if<00:07:26.960> you<00:07:27.110> can<00:07:27.230> get<00:07:27.350> their<00:07:27.470> gas<00:07:27.680> right

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:27.980 
honestly if you can get their gas right

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.740 
honestly if you can get their gas right
here<00:07:28.160> like<00:07:28.400> if<00:07:28.550> somehow<00:07:28.820> you<00:07:28.940> can<00:07:29.150> cannon<00:07:29.540> and

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:29.750 
here like if somehow you can cannon and

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.050 
here like if somehow you can cannon and
kill<00:07:30.410> their<00:07:30.560> gas<00:07:30.710> that's<00:07:31.520> pretty<00:07:31.640> much<00:07:31.760> game

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:32.060 
kill their gas that's pretty much game

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.690 
kill their gas that's pretty much game
because<00:07:32.950> the<00:07:33.950> only<00:07:34.040> way<00:07:34.220> for<00:07:34.460> them<00:07:34.550> together

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:34.700 
because the only way for them together

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.620 
because the only way for them together
this<00:07:35.090> is<00:07:35.300> with<00:07:35.600> gas<00:07:35.840> consumed<00:07:36.620> like<00:07:37.100> gas<00:07:37.630> units

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:38.630 
this is with gas consumed like gas units

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:42.040 
this is with gas consumed like gas units
and<00:07:39.550> yeah<00:07:40.550> with<00:07:40.820> gas<00:07:41.000> units<00:07:41.330> and<00:07:41.540> like

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:42.050 
and yeah with gas units and like

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.800 
and yeah with gas units and like
Mueller's<00:07:42.440> hydrous<00:07:42.830> drop<00:07:43.550> tech<00:07:43.820> what<00:07:44.060> not<00:07:44.210> and

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:44.810 
Mueller's hydrous drop tech what not and

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.420 
Mueller's hydrous drop tech what not and
if<00:07:45.320> they<00:07:45.410> don't<00:07:45.470> have<00:07:45.650> gas<00:07:45.740> they<00:07:45.980> can't<00:07:46.160> gasps

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:46.430 
if they don't have gas they can't gasps

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.360 
if they don't have gas they can't gasps
units<00:07:46.760> and<00:07:47.030> so
