00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.560
 place here you have to build a house to live here 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.580
 began to build in the winter 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.550
 but in the month of October they found 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.870
 construction company ecopan 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:38.930

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.960
 square was built in canadian technology 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.420
 frame nozzle not and counted 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.060
 initially water based on materials 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.420
 practically got somewhere around 160 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.390
 thousand 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:55.780
 as we stopped elective film heat 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.780
 life participated in the project show building 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.950
 on one of the buildings were representatives 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.770
 firms and advertised us this film 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.330
 pretty interesting feeling 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.810
 for warmth 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.360
 the film was turned on hand bring something 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.010
 there is no way the heat from her 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.540
 felt at a distance as soon as 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.119
 the body touched the film 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.150
 the heat went through the body right away the body 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:27.869
 Heated well, it was comfortable and like that 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:30.790
 learned heat life went to the office 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.300
 considered and eventually get us 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.479
 heating cost with installation 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.340
 123,000 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:41.590
 the installation was done by a team of two days not 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.520
 style or film but it's given that 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.460
 It was 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.740
 December had to be cold 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.530
 provide heating here guns stood 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.220
 helium to work in the soldering iron for minutes 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.890
 in two days 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.470
 steppes in the room were heated with a gun guys 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.170
 or film passed the next room 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.909
 was ready already included the film 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:06.240
 heated the walls bugged house raw 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:11.080
 read the new snow dug panels 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.600
 cold but when was the house was not sheathed 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.500
 only it was not sewn up the roof was not 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:21.690
 the filing was warm and comfortable going away 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.910
 like summer barefoot shorts naked 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.430
 because the heat comes from below the body 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.280
 heats up on a thermometer show 17 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.250
 degrees and you feel like 22 24 how 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.130
 as if in summer outside on a hot day 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.090
 it would be very interesting in the morning 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.640
 create 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.250
 wake up and get up tired 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.549
 already started the floor and body literally right away 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.210
 heated very comfortable already forgot 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.780
 what 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:52.000
 raw wall pony water temperature flows 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:57.810
 exposed but when were strong 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.190
 very cold bark 40 inside 736 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.730
 thermostat and just not all 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.570
 zones what is most interesting is that you can 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.460
 separate zones 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.530
 turn on different heating on let in 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.730
 one room he set him up so that 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.370
 set the temperature 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.800
 another room there freezes people 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.470
 added in different rooms can 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.530
 be different temperatures here are some 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.810
 We've got some advantages in a month in winter 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.940
 three and a half thousand rubles this 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.660
 completely for all the electricity then 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.630
 including 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.290
 stove water boiler which 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.150
 water warms 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.120
 on the fridge, well, that is completely all 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:38.920
 quality assurance here I think that 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.690
 it's much more economical even building 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.600
 with the city 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:47.920
 as I remembered toys invested in the winter before 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.170
 6000 it turned out the bills were but so it 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.490
 forty three squares here to 100 two 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:57.550
 squares apart from the exact visible in our 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.710
 village allocated to each house 1 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.700
 sleeping kilowatt film power 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.430
 which is 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.140
 spread out in the house turned out 13 on 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.160
 kilowatts on the advice of experts 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.080
 advised to put their teacher 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.540
 power that can be allocated 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.330
 connection of certain zones he history 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.150
 vital and again so they 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.489
 cut down and electricity and here we are with him 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.030
 winter winters were pretty 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.180
 comfortable enough electricity and on 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:31.930
 heating the house but also on vital 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:35.010
 items but now I chew well warmly 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:39.880
 no problem everything works flawlessly 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:41.020
 live and enjoy the infrared system 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.150
 heat life 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.150
 new view on heating
