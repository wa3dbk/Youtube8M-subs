very stay old game I just don't know
what<00:00:51.899> was<00:00:52.050> going<00:00:52.350> on<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.530> tried<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.920> break<00:00:53.100> him

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
what was going on I tried to break him

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.950 
what was going on I tried to break him
down<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.460> just<00:00:53.579> couldn't<00:00:54.000> manage<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.600> it's

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
down I just couldn't manage it and it's

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.840 
down I just couldn't manage it and it's
not<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.350> ideal<00:00:55.649> start<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.129> Division<00:00:56.489> one

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
not the ideal start to Division one

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.189 
not the ideal start to Division one
to<00:00:57.120> be<00:00:57.210> honest<00:00:57.480> I'm<00:00:57.600> thinking<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.079> this

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
to be honest I'm thinking that this

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.900 
to be honest I'm thinking that this
division<00:00:58.649> we<00:00:58.770> are<00:00:58.949> going<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.340> just<00:00:59.489> try<00:00:59.879> and

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
division we are going to just try and

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.810 
division we are going to just try and
aim<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.930> stay<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.500> division<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.070> maybe

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
aim to stay in the division and maybe

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.060 
aim to stay in the division and maybe
try<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.629> push<00:01:03.809> for<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> high<00:01:04.199> finish<00:01:04.470> but<00:01:04.710> maybe

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
try and push for a high finish but maybe

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.890 
try and push for a high finish but maybe
not<00:01:05.339> for<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.850> title<00:01:06.210> as<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.479> will<00:01:06.570> be<00:01:06.659> quite

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
that one into the post and unfortunately

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.430 
that one into the post and unfortunately
I<00:03:03.390> think<00:03:03.450> he<00:03:03.660> may<00:03:03.750> have<00:03:03.780> put<00:03:03.990> the<00:03:04.080> controller

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
I think he may have put the controller

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.140 
I think he may have put the controller
down<00:03:04.530> at<00:03:04.770> that<00:03:04.860> point<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:05.610> Robin<00:03:06.000> van

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
down at that point and Robin van

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.370 
down at that point and Robin van
Persie's<00:03:06.510> just<00:03:06.660> nicked<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.900> ball<00:03:07.080> off<00:03:07.230> him

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
Persie's just nicked the ball off him

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.940 
Persie's just nicked the ball off him
and<00:03:07.560> scored<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.400> give<00:03:08.670> us<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:09.120> 3-1<00:03:09.930> victory<00:03:10.170> so

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
and scored to give us the 3-1 victory so

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.070 
and scored to give us the 3-1 victory so
a<00:03:10.980> good<00:03:11.400> comeback<00:03:11.820> from<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.120> team<00:03:12.330> in<00:03:12.570> the

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
a good comeback from the team in the

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.870 
a good comeback from the team in the
dying<00:03:13.320> minutes<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:14.100> game<00:03:14.400> after<00:03:14.640> a

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
dying minutes of the game after a

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.960 
dying minutes of the game after a
freestyle<00:03:15.600> midsection<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.700> pretty<00:03:17.700> happy

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
freestyle midsection and pretty happy

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.070 
freestyle midsection and pretty happy
with<00:03:18.090> that<00:03:18.209> because<00:03:18.360> we're<00:03:18.630> taking<00:03:18.959> down

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
with that because we're taking down

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.229 
with that because we're taking down
three<00:03:19.440> points<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:19.980> means<00:03:20.220> that<00:03:20.430> we<00:03:20.519> are<00:03:20.670> three

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
three points it means that we are three

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.620 
three points it means that we are three
points<00:03:21.660> closer<00:03:21.989> to<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:23.130> or<00:03:23.730> B<00:03:23.940> or<00:03:23.970> safety<00:03:24.420> I

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
points closer to the or B or safety I

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.060 
points closer to the or B or safety I
guess<00:03:24.900> is<00:03:25.080> what<00:03:25.230> we're<00:03:25.380> really<00:03:25.530> looking<00:03:25.769> at

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
guess is what we're really looking at

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.100 
guess is what we're really looking at
and<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:27.060> know<00:03:27.209> it's<00:03:27.420> disappointing<00:03:27.540> that<00:03:27.959> we're

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
and I know it's disappointing that we're

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.090 
and I know it's disappointing that we're
not<00:03:28.200> going<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.440> be<00:03:28.560> looking<00:03:28.650> for<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:28.950> league

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
not going to be looking for a league

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 
who I brought on as a CDM because I

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.750 
who I brought on as a CDM because I
wanted<00:06:09.050> to<00:06:09.140> try<00:06:09.380> them<00:06:09.500> out<00:06:09.650> just<00:06:10.310> to<00:06:10.400> make<00:06:10.580> sure

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.760 
wanted to try them out just to make sure

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.400 
wanted to try them out just to make sure
that<00:06:11.000> I<00:06:11.060> should<00:06:11.390> be<00:06:11.540> I<00:06:11.750> shouldn't<00:06:12.200> be<00:06:12.290> using

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.410 
that I should be I shouldn't be using

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.070 
that I should be I shouldn't be using
them<00:06:12.740> rather<00:06:12.920> than<00:06:13.370> or<00:06:13.940> shouldn't<00:06:14.810> be<00:06:14.900> using

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
them rather than or shouldn't be using

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.490 
them rather than or shouldn't be using
him<00:06:15.260> over<00:06:15.710> Fletcher<00:06:16.670> but<00:06:17.330> after<00:06:18.080> this<00:06:18.140> game<00:06:18.350> I

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
him over Fletcher but after this game I

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.840 
him over Fletcher but after this game I
decided<00:06:18.800> it<00:06:18.920> probably<00:06:19.190> wasn't<00:06:19.370> the<00:06:19.490> best<00:06:19.550> to

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:19.850 
decided it probably wasn't the best to

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.100 
decided it probably wasn't the best to
use<00:06:20.000> them<00:06:20.090> because<00:06:20.180> it's<00:06:20.420> just<00:06:20.540> not<00:06:20.660> defensive

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
use them because it's just not defensive

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.140 
use them because it's just not defensive
enough<00:06:21.320> unfortunately<00:06:22.280> dinatale<00:06:22.850> gets

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
enough unfortunately dinatale gets

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.050 
enough unfortunately dinatale gets
another<00:06:23.390> goal<00:06:23.720> there<00:06:23.990> and<00:06:24.170> makes<00:06:25.070> it<00:06:25.220> 2-2<00:06:25.760> and

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
another goal there and makes it 2-2 and

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.320 
another goal there and makes it 2-2 and
then<00:06:26.390> to<00:06:26.720> put<00:06:27.110> insult<00:06:27.980> to<00:06:28.100> injury<00:06:28.250> manages<00:06:29.180> to

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
then to put insult to injury manages to

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.780 
then to put insult to injury manages to
