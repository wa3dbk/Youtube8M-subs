clean the nomads dagger because of the
hybrid<00:00:19.800> cover<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:21.029> I'd<00:00:21.570> say<00:00:21.810> it's<00:00:21.840> equally<00:00:22.199> as

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
hybrid cover is I'd say it's equally as

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.420 
hybrid cover is I'd say it's equally as
clean<00:00:22.560> but<00:00:22.769> just<00:00:22.890> gives<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.220> different

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
clean but just gives you a different

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.640 
clean but just gives you a different
shape<00:00:23.760> off<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.060> back<00:00:24.240> end<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.810> know<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.199> it's

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
shape off the back end you know and it's

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.580 
shape off the back end you know and it's
not<00:00:25.859> as<00:00:26.090> not<00:00:27.090> as<00:00:27.119> snappy<00:00:27.570> as<00:00:27.750> what<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.289> nomads

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
not as not as snappy as what the nomads

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.479 
not as not as snappy as what the nomads
perlas<00:00:28.920> for<00:00:29.099> most<00:00:29.279> people<00:00:29.900> so<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.260> actually<00:00:31.489> it

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
perlas for most people so it actually it

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.799 
perlas for most people so it actually it
kind<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.730> meshes<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.149> both<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.450> them<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.690> gives

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
kind of meshes the both of them it gives

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.240 
kind of meshes the both of them it gives
you<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.079> clean<00:00:34.290> but<00:00:34.500> it's<00:00:34.590> just<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.800> little<00:00:35.130> bit

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
you the clean but it's just a little bit

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.170 
you the clean but it's just a little bit
stronger<00:00:35.460> than<00:00:35.640> with<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.850> nomads<00:00:36.149> holidays
