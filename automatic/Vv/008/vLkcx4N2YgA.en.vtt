bone arrow but that's still a little bit
of<00:01:05.799> a<00:01:05.860> disappointment<00:01:06.310> that<00:01:06.430> I<00:01:06.520> wasn't<00:01:06.729> just<00:01:06.880> a

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
of a disappointment that I wasn't just a

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.330 
of a disappointment that I wasn't just a
tad<00:01:07.479> bigger<00:01:07.810> in<00:01:07.990> the<00:01:08.110> base<00:01:08.290> section<00:01:08.799> because

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
tad bigger in the base section because

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.190 
tad bigger in the base section because
these<00:01:09.729> parts<00:01:10.060> are<00:01:10.210> fairly<00:01:10.479> impressive<00:01:10.810> but

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
these parts are fairly impressive but

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.550 
these parts are fairly impressive but
the<00:01:11.350> blade<00:01:12.190> portion<00:01:12.700> is<00:01:12.790> just<00:01:12.940> really<00:01:13.150> tiny<00:01:13.560> up

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
the blade portion is just really tiny up

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.110 
the blade portion is just really tiny up
here<00:01:14.830> you<00:01:14.950> have<00:01:14.980> a<00:01:15.100> compartment<00:01:15.490> for<00:01:15.670> a<00:01:15.850> disc

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
here you have a compartment for a disc

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.030 
here you have a compartment for a disc
it<00:01:16.330> can<00:01:16.480> hold<00:01:16.720> any<00:01:16.960> disc<00:01:17.290> it<00:01:17.560> comes<00:01:17.800> with<00:01:18.010> a

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
it can hold any disc it comes with a

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.980 
it can hold any disc it comes with a
version<00:01:18.820> of<00:01:19.000> the<00:01:19.150> dragon<00:01:19.540> disc<00:01:21.750> which<00:01:22.750> is

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
version of the dragon disc which is

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.650 
version of the dragon disc which is
always<00:01:23.320> nice<00:01:23.710> to<00:01:24.310> get<00:01:24.430> more<00:01:24.670> discs<00:01:25.090> so<00:01:25.450> we<00:01:25.540> have

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
always nice to get more discs so we have

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.340 
always nice to get more discs so we have
that<00:01:25.840> going<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:28.180> that<00:01:28.720> just<00:01:28.930> attaches<00:01:29.320> right

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
that going and that just attaches right

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.380 
that going and that just attaches right
in<00:01:29.590> there<00:01:29.710> and<00:01:29.920> can<00:01:30.190> spin<00:01:30.580> freely<00:01:30.940> even<00:01:31.180> though

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
in there and can spin freely even though

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.300 
in there and can spin freely even though
that<00:01:31.600> doesn't<00:01:32.080> really<00:01:32.320> do<00:01:32.530> anything<00:01:32.800> for<00:01:33.190> the

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
that doesn't really do anything for the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
however there is one feature one that I

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.160 
however there is one feature one that I
cannot<00:01:44.290> demonstrate<00:01:44.980> because<00:01:45.250> well<00:01:46.170> I'm

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
cannot demonstrate because well I'm

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.440 
cannot demonstrate because well I'm
surrounded<00:01:47.830> by<00:01:47.860> things<00:01:48.460> that<00:01:48.700> don't<00:01:49.060> want<00:01:49.360> to

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
surrounded by things that don't want to

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.680 
surrounded by things that don't want to
get<00:01:49.630> wet<00:01:49.930> but<00:01:50.650> basically<00:01:51.250> what<00:01:51.580> you<00:01:51.610> do<00:01:51.910> is<00:01:51.940> you

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
get wet but basically what you do is you

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.110 
get wet but basically what you do is you
dip<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.140> nozzle<00:01:53.620> right<00:01:53.680> here<00:01:54.070> into<00:01:54.250> a<00:01:54.430> bowl<00:01:55.000> of

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
dip the nozzle right here into a bowl of

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.440 
dip the nozzle right here into a bowl of
water<00:01:55.360> you<00:01:56.110> pull<00:01:56.440> up<00:01:56.730> and<00:01:57.730> then<00:01:57.970> I'll<00:01:58.090> suck<00:01:58.300> up

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
water you pull up and then I'll suck up

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.030 
water you pull up and then I'll suck up
the<00:01:58.570> water<00:01:58.750> into<00:01:59.080> the<00:01:59.140> chamber<00:01:59.620> right<00:01:59.740> here

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
the water into the chamber right here

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.270 
the water into the chamber right here
then<00:02:00.909> aim<00:02:01.330> and<00:02:01.630> push<00:02:02.380> and<00:02:02.650> then<00:02:02.860> it'll<00:02:03.010> spit

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
then aim and push and then it'll spit

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.520 
then aim and push and then it'll spit
out<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.520> water<00:02:03.550> it<00:02:04.120> the<00:02:04.420> packaging<00:02:04.960> says<00:02:05.350> it

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
out the water it the packaging says it

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.999 
out the water it the packaging says it
shoots<00:02:05.800> up<00:02:05.979> to<00:02:06.190> 15<00:02:06.880> feet<00:02:07.289> it<00:02:08.289> did<00:02:08.500> shoot<00:02:08.769> pretty

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
shoots up to 15 feet it did shoot pretty

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.369 
shoots up to 15 feet it did shoot pretty
well<00:02:09.280> when<00:02:09.459> I<00:02:09.550> tried<00:02:09.849> it<00:02:09.879> but<00:02:10.300> it<00:02:10.379> doesn't

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
well when I tried it but it doesn't

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.330 
well when I tried it but it doesn't
really<00:02:11.650> shoot<00:02:12.190> 15<00:02:12.819> feet<00:02:13.650> that's<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:14.890> little<00:02:15.190> bit

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
really shoot 15 feet that's a little bit

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.629 
really shoot 15 feet that's a little bit
of<00:02:15.459> a<00:02:15.550> white<00:02:16.360> lie<00:02:16.629> there<00:02:16.959> but<00:02:17.799> it<00:02:18.189> does<00:02:18.400> shoot

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:18.639 
of a white lie there but it does shoot

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:21.330 
of a white lie there but it does shoot
fairly<00:02:19.180> fairly<00:02:19.480> well<00:02:19.749> for<00:02:20.349> a<00:02:20.409> water<00:02:20.889> squirter

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
fairly fairly well for a water squirter

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.210 
fairly fairly well for a water squirter
toy<00:02:21.579> so

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
toy so

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.590 
toy so
pull<00:02:23.370> up<00:02:23.550> shoot<00:02:24.770> refill<00:02:25.800> shoot<00:02:26.460> you<00:02:27.360> fill

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
pull up shoot refill shoot you fill

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.770 
pull up shoot refill shoot you fill
shoot<00:02:28.400> can<00:02:29.400> get<00:02:29.550> really<00:02:29.790> really<00:02:30.120> bothersome

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
shoot can get really really bothersome

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.050 
shoot can get really really bothersome
but<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.710> benefit<00:02:32.100> of<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.250> hydro<00:02:32.580> bow<00:02:32.790> is

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
but the benefit of the hydro bow is

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.620 
but the benefit of the hydro bow is
while<00:02:33.630> very<00:02:34.260> tiny<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:35.490> does<00:02:35.760> look<00:02:36.090> very<00:02:36.120> nice

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
while very tiny it does look very nice

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.530 
while very tiny it does look very nice
on<00:02:36.960> a<00:02:36.990> display<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:38.220> is<00:02:38.460> much<00:02:38.850> bigger<00:02:39.150> than<00:02:39.420> the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
on a display it is much bigger than the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.980 
on a display it is much bigger than the
Japanese<00:02:40.050> counterpart<00:02:40.770> which<00:02:41.580> was<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.630> don't

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
Japanese counterpart which was I don't

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.050 
Japanese counterpart which was I don't
know<00:02:43.230> for<00:02:43.500> sure<00:02:43.530> cuz<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.040> don't<00:02:44.100> own<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.460> but<00:02:44.730> I

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
know for sure cuz I don't own it but I

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.110 
know for sure cuz I don't own it but I
don't<00:02:45.210> think<00:02:45.360> I've<00:02:45.420> had<00:02:46.880> nearly<00:02:47.880> as<00:02:47.970> much

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
don't think I've had nearly as much

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.550 
don't think I've had nearly as much
length<00:02:48.360> this<00:02:48.600> is<00:02:48.720> this<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:49.110> think<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.410> was<00:02:49.500> a

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
length this is this I think it was a

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.710 
length this is this I think it was a
little<00:02:49.770> bit<00:02:49.950> squatter<00:02:50.400> too<00:02:50.820> as<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.600> came

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
little bit squatter too as it came

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.410 
little bit squatter too as it came
packed<00:02:52.020> with<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.320> wood<00:02:52.500> spear<00:02:53.150> which<00:02:54.150> is<00:02:54.300> the

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
packed with the wood spear which is the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.070 
packed with the wood spear which is the
forest<00:02:54.780> spear<00:02:55.140> over<00:02:55.380> here<00:02:55.560> so<00:02:56.750> while<00:02:57.750> it

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
forest spear over here so while it

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.449 
forest spear over here so while it
doesn't<00:02:58.260> have<00:02:58.530> really<00:02:58.890> that<00:02:59.310> much

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
doesn't have really that much

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.220 
doesn't have really that much
functionality<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.450> doesn't<00:03:00.750> shoot<00:03:00.900> missiles

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
functionality it doesn't shoot missiles

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.440 
functionality it doesn't shoot missiles
or<00:03:01.650> anything<00:03:01.860> it<00:03:02.130> just<00:03:02.160> squirts<00:03:02.760> one<00:03:03.180> little

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
or anything it just squirts one little

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.530 
or anything it just squirts one little
shot<00:03:03.630> of<00:03:03.840> water<00:03:04.340> it<00:03:05.340> does<00:03:05.640> look<00:03:05.940> nice<00:03:06.120> at<00:03:06.390> this

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
shot of water it does look nice at this

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.780 
shot of water it does look nice at this
on<00:03:06.720> display<00:03:07.290> everything<00:03:08.130> that's<00:03:08.430> painted

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
on display everything that's painted

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.960 
on display everything that's painted
needs<00:03:09.209> to<00:03:09.360> be<00:03:09.480> painted<00:03:09.720> on<00:03:09.959> both<00:03:10.170> sides<00:03:10.970> and

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
needs to be painted on both sides and

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.390 
needs to be painted on both sides and
looks<00:03:12.300> looks<00:03:12.900> fairly<00:03:13.230> well<00:03:13.590> so<00:03:13.980> I'll

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
looks looks fairly well so I'll

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.650 
looks looks fairly well so I'll
definitely<00:03:14.730> give<00:03:14.850> it<00:03:14.880> that<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.209> that<00:03:15.330> it<00:03:15.510> does

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
definitely give it that it that it does

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.270 
definitely give it that it that it does
look<00:03:15.870> nice<00:03:16.020> on<00:03:16.230> display<00:03:16.590> even<00:03:16.800> if<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.100> toy

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
look nice on display even if the toy

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.540 
look nice on display even if the toy
itself<00:03:17.550> is<00:03:17.730> kind<00:03:17.880> of<00:03:18.000> crappy<00:03:18.620> one<00:03:19.620> added<00:03:20.160> bonus

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
itself is kind of crappy one added bonus

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.910 
itself is kind of crappy one added bonus
that<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:21.060> have<00:03:21.360> that<00:03:22.050> will<00:03:22.290> never<00:03:22.500> be<00:03:22.620> in<00:03:22.770> the

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
that you have that will never be in the

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.920 
that you have that will never be in the
show<00:03:23.100> most<00:03:23.310> likely<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:24.480> they<00:03:24.600> didn't<00:03:24.840> have

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
show most likely that they didn't have

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.080 
show most likely that they didn't have
to<00:03:25.110> do<00:03:25.230> but<00:03:25.440> did<00:03:25.650> is<00:03:25.920> that<00:03:26.220> this<00:03:26.370> is<00:03:26.520> compatible

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
to do but did is that this is compatible

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.690 
to do but did is that this is compatible
with<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.330> samurai<00:03:27.720> megazord<00:03:28.230> so<00:03:29.010> what<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.519> do

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
with the samurai megazord so what you do

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.820 
with the samurai megazord so what you do
is<00:03:29.910> you<00:03:30.090> fold<00:03:30.330> this<00:03:30.570> little<00:03:30.989> lever<00:03:31.140> out<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.709> it

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
is you fold this little lever out and it

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.560 
is you fold this little lever out and it
makes<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.130> handle<00:03:32.580> so<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:32.970> bring<00:03:33.360> in<00:03:33.450> the

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
makes a handle so you bring in the

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.870 
makes a handle so you bring in the
samurai<00:03:33.930> megazord<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:35.040> obviously<00:03:35.160> lifts<00:03:35.700> off

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
samurai megazord it obviously lifts off

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.910 
samurai megazord it obviously lifts off
the<00:03:35.910> camera<00:03:36.390> so<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:36.780> can<00:03:36.930> actually<00:03:37.050> see<00:03:37.500> the

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
the camera so you can actually see the

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.090 
the camera so you can actually see the
arms<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.600> then<00:03:39.600> just<00:03:39.660> peg<00:03:40.050> that<00:03:40.350> right<00:03:40.680> into

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
arms and then just peg that right into

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.270 
arms and then just peg that right into
the<00:03:41.280> turtles<00:03:42.030> or<00:03:42.209> or<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.870> or<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:43.800> ape<00:03:44.010> sword

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
the turtles or or the or the ape sword

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.360 
the turtles or or the or the ape sword
doesn't<00:03:44.489> really<00:03:44.700> matter<00:03:44.910> and<00:03:45.360> so<00:03:45.959> now<00:03:46.170> the

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
doesn't really matter and so now the

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.910 
doesn't really matter and so now the
samurai<00:03:47.370> megazord<00:03:47.850> can<00:03:48.690> shoot<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.350> hydro<00:03:49.739> bow

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
samurai megazord can shoot the hydro bow

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.740 
samurai megazord can shoot the hydro bow
granite<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:50.910> can't<00:03:51.120> really<00:03:51.239> shoot<00:03:51.570> it

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
granite it can't really shoot it

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.940 
granite it can't really shoot it
straight<00:03:51.900> because<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.680> way<00:03:52.799> it's

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
straight because of the way it's

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.500 
straight because of the way it's
designed<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:53.640> guess<00:03:53.790> that's<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.090> strange<00:03:54.360> that

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
designed I guess that's a strange that

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.930 
designed I guess that's a strange that
gets<00:03:54.690> gonna<00:03:54.930> get<00:03:55.200> so<00:03:56.190> like<00:03:56.430> I<00:03:56.519> said<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:56.790> does

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
nice the samurai megazord obviously it

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.820 
nice the samurai megazord obviously it
yeah<00:04:12.299> the<00:04:12.570> Turtles<00:04:12.870> or<00:04:12.989> it<00:04:13.049> tilts<00:04:13.440> so<00:04:13.650> that

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
happens but obviously in the relaxed

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.719 
happens but obviously in the relaxed
position<00:04:16.799> he's<00:04:16.979> not<00:04:17.160> really<00:04:17.250> going<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.519> shoot

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
position he's not really going to shoot

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.199 
position he's not really going to shoot
anything<00:04:18.239> but<00:04:19.049> it<00:04:19.560> does<00:04:20.010> look<00:04:20.310> really<00:04:20.519> massive

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
anything but it does look really massive

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.200 
anything but it does look really massive
and<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:21.810> do<00:04:21.870> like<00:04:22.229> that<00:04:22.470> it's<00:04:22.740> a<00:04:22.890> it'd<00:04:23.729> be<00:04:23.910> nice

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
and I do like that it's a it'd be nice

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.530 
and I do like that it's a it'd be nice
if<00:04:24.240> we<00:04:24.600> got<00:04:24.630> a<00:04:25.020> actually<00:04:25.620> got<00:04:26.400> a<00:04:26.540> roleplay

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
if we got a actually got a roleplay

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.540 
if we got a actually got a roleplay
weapon<00:04:27.990> with<00:04:28.169> a<00:04:28.229> sharp<00:04:28.470> sword<00:04:28.800> that<00:04:29.190> could<00:04:29.370> do

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
weapon with a sharp sword that could do

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.110 
weapon with a sharp sword that could do
this<00:04:29.760> to<00:04:30.120> to<00:04:30.840> more<00:04:31.169> accurately<00:04:31.500> represent<00:04:31.680> the

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
this to to more accurately represent the

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.120 
this to to more accurately represent the
shark<00:04:33.120> sword<00:04:33.330> that's<00:04:33.510> on<00:04:33.990> the<00:04:34.169> show<00:04:34.740> being<00:04:35.010> a

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
shark sword that's on the show being a

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.670 
shark sword that's on the show being a
mess

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
mess

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.249 
mess
sword<00:04:36.270> so<00:04:37.270> I<00:04:37.300> thought<00:04:37.750> I<00:04:37.780> think<00:04:38.110> that's

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
sword so I thought I think that's

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:39.719 
sword so I thought I think that's
actually<00:04:38.410> pretty<00:04:38.770> cool<00:04:39.100> it's<00:04:39.340> probably<00:04:39.610> one

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
actually pretty cool it's probably one

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:41.400 
actually pretty cool it's probably one
of<00:04:39.759> the<00:04:39.910> coolest<00:04:40.270> things<00:04:40.690> about<00:04:40.810> this<00:04:41.169> toy

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
of the coolest things about this toy

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.939 
of the coolest things about this toy
that<00:04:41.650> it<00:04:41.770> functions<00:04:41.979> with<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.430> Megazord<00:04:43.949> so

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
that it functions with the Megazord so

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.300 
that it functions with the Megazord so
out<00:04:45.699> of<00:04:45.820> the<00:04:45.910> way<00:04:46.060> and<00:04:46.780> take<00:04:47.320> a<00:04:47.380> look<00:04:47.620> see<00:04:47.830> back

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
out of the way and take a look see back

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:57.390 
out of the way and take a look see back
at<00:04:48.520> to<00:04:48.699> the<00:04:48.850> bow<00:04:53.820> so<00:04:54.820> overall<00:04:55.360> um<00:04:55.660> for<00:04:56.410> 1499<00:04:57.220> I

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
at to the bow so overall um for 1499 I

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.450 
at to the bow so overall um for 1499 I
can't<00:04:57.759> really<00:04:58.000> recommend<00:04:58.690> the<00:04:58.840> hydro<00:04:59.229> bow

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
can't really recommend the hydro bow

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.499 
can't really recommend the hydro bow
because<00:05:00.460> like<00:05:00.639> I<00:05:00.729> said<00:05:00.880> it<00:05:00.970> just<00:05:01.090> doesn't

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:01.509 
because like I said it just doesn't

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.240 
because like I said it just doesn't
really<00:05:01.660> do<00:05:01.930> much<00:05:02.110> playability<00:05:02.680> because<00:05:03.130> at

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
really do much playability because at

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.430 
really do much playability because at
least<00:05:03.400> the<00:05:03.699> black<00:05:04.300> box<00:05:04.630> more<00:05:04.900> for<00:05:05.110> a<00:05:05.139> while<00:05:05.259> has

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
least the black box more for a while has

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.969 
least the black box more for a while has
noises<00:05:06.340> it<00:05:06.490> has<00:05:06.699> noises<00:05:07.440> comes<00:05:08.440> with<00:05:08.680> two

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
noises it has noises comes with two

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:14.850 
noises it has noises comes with two
disks<00:05:09.400> the<00:05:09.669> buckle<00:05:10.530> and<00:05:13.199> has<00:05:14.199> compatibility

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
disks the buckle and has compatibility

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.320 
disks the buckle and has compatibility
with<00:05:14.949> the<00:05:15.039> two<00:05:15.220> swords<00:05:15.490> that<00:05:15.789> most<00:05:16.000> people

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
with the two swords that most people

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.830 
with the two swords that most people
have<00:05:17.130> this<00:05:18.130> just<00:05:18.669> shoots<00:05:19.000> water<00:05:19.240> comes<00:05:19.690> with

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
have this just shoots water comes with

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.990 
have this just shoots water comes with
one<00:05:20.050> disc<00:05:20.320> has<00:05:21.010> some<00:05:21.310> playability<00:05:21.669> with<00:05:21.910> the

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
one disc has some playability with the

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.360 
one disc has some playability with the
Megazord<00:05:22.440> and<00:05:23.440> it<00:05:23.560> comes<00:05:23.770> with<00:05:23.860> this<00:05:24.039> little

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
Megazord and it comes with this little

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.510 
Megazord and it comes with this little
tiny<00:05:24.610> like<00:05:25.030> little<00:05:25.870> pin<00:05:26.169> except<00:05:26.889> it's<00:05:27.039> not<00:05:27.460> a

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
tiny like little pin except it's not a

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.390 
tiny like little pin except it's not a
pin<00:05:27.820> and<00:05:28.000> just<00:05:28.030> pegs<00:05:28.419> under<00:05:28.690> your<00:05:28.810> shirt<00:05:29.400> you

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
pin and just pegs under your shirt you

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.550 
pin and just pegs under your shirt you
can<00:05:30.490> use<00:05:30.639> it<00:05:30.669> as<00:05:30.849> a<00:05:30.880> cuff<00:05:31.120> link<00:05:31.300> I<00:05:31.449> guess<00:05:31.630> but<00:05:32.349> um

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
can use it as a cuff link I guess but um

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.909 
can use it as a cuff link I guess but um
of<00:05:33.370> this<00:05:33.880> the<00:05:34.060> Shiba<00:05:34.360> clan<00:05:34.389> logo<00:05:34.960> so<00:05:35.620> that's

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
of this the Shiba clan logo so that's

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.740 
of this the Shiba clan logo so that's
all<00:05:36.130> this<00:05:36.370> comes<00:05:36.639> packed<00:05:36.940> with<00:05:37.060> because<00:05:37.509> it<00:05:37.630> is

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
all this comes packed with because it is

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.330 
all this comes packed with because it is
much<00:05:37.990> bigger<00:05:38.289> than<00:05:38.560> the<00:05:38.680> black<00:05:38.860> box<00:05:39.099> more

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
much bigger than the black box more

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.400 
much bigger than the black box more
obviously<00:05:40.289> so<00:05:41.289> while<00:05:42.250> a<00:05:42.280> nice<00:05:42.729> looking<00:05:43.360> toy<00:05:44.050> it

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
obviously so while a nice looking toy it

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.450 
obviously so while a nice looking toy it
just<00:05:44.620> doesn't<00:05:44.949> really<00:05:45.070> have<00:05:45.430> the

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
just doesn't really have the

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.629 
just doesn't really have the
functionality<00:05:46.449> to<00:05:46.660> make<00:05:47.169> it<00:05:47.650> worthwhile<00:05:48.130> for

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 
functionality to make it worthwhile for

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.730 
functionality to make it worthwhile for
$14.99<00:05:49.419> but<00:05:49.930> the<00:05:50.020> fact<00:05:50.229> that<00:05:50.320> does<00:05:50.590> have

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
$14.99 but the fact that does have

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.140 
$14.99 but the fact that does have
compatibility<00:05:51.220> with<00:05:51.430> the<00:05:51.460> Megazord<00:05:51.789> is<00:05:52.120> a

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
compatibility with the Megazord is a

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.760 
compatibility with the Megazord is a
pretty<00:05:52.479> cool<00:05:52.720> addition<00:05:53.050> that<00:05:53.349> they<00:05:53.470> didn't

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
pretty cool addition that they didn't

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.140 
pretty cool addition that they didn't
need<00:05:53.860> to<00:05:53.979> do<00:05:54.159> and<00:05:54.310> I'm<00:05:54.400> really<00:05:54.520> glad<00:05:54.699> they<00:05:54.940> did

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
need to do and I'm really glad they did

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.719
