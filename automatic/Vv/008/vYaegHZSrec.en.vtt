on that and somewhere in here we've got
smaller<00:00:48.219> bike<00:00:48.429> axles<00:00:48.879> and<00:00:49.319> little<00:00:50.319> envelope

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
smaller bike axles and little envelope

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.910 
smaller bike axles and little envelope
with<00:00:50.769> to<00:00:50.980> Elling<00:00:51.219> piece<00:00:51.870> open<00:00:52.870> that<00:00:53.019> up<00:00:53.140> we've

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
with to Elling piece open that up we've

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.280 
with to Elling piece open that up we've
got<00:00:53.949> everything<00:00:54.309> we<00:00:54.519> need

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.139 

okay<00:01:00.100> so<00:01:00.160> the<00:01:00.340> first<00:01:00.520> thing<00:01:00.640> we<00:01:00.820> do<00:01:00.910> is<00:01:01.000> take

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
okay so the first thing we do is take

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.030 
okay so the first thing we do is take
the<00:01:01.300> middle<00:01:01.630> spacer<00:01:02.260> now<00:01:02.500> the<00:01:02.559> middle<00:01:02.770> space

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
the middle spacer now the middle space

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.860 
the middle spacer now the middle space
you<00:01:03.250> can<00:01:03.400> tell<00:01:03.610> is<00:01:03.760> obviously<00:01:04.059> shorter<00:01:04.720> than

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
you can tell is obviously shorter than

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.350 
you can tell is obviously shorter than
the<00:01:05.050> two<00:01:05.199> outer<00:01:05.379> spaces<00:01:05.770> so<00:01:06.550> we've<00:01:06.700> put<00:01:07.210> that

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
the two outer spaces so we've put that

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.700 
the two outer spaces so we've put that
between<00:01:07.630> the<00:01:07.869> wooden<00:01:08.020> components<00:01:08.260> at<00:01:08.680> the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
between the wooden components at the

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.280 
between the wooden components at the
back<00:01:08.920> we're<00:01:09.310> back<00:01:09.340> we<00:01:10.030> would<00:01:10.180> be<00:01:10.390> and<00:01:10.990> run<00:01:11.140> that

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
back we're back we would be and run that

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.200 
back we're back we would be and run that
through<00:01:11.500> there<00:01:11.740> like<00:01:11.920> that<00:01:12.130> then<00:01:12.729> place<00:01:13.180> a

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
through there like that then place a

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.149 
through there like that then place a
spacer<00:01:13.930> on<00:01:14.020> either<00:01:14.170> side<00:01:14.500> of<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:14.740> back<00:01:14.979> so

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
spacer on either side of the back so

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.249 
spacer on either side of the back so
you've<00:01:15.280> got<00:01:15.369> two<00:01:15.550> long<00:01:15.759> spacers<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:16.570> you've

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
you've got two long spacers and you've

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:18.690 
you've got two long spacers and you've
got<00:01:17.380> your<00:01:17.500> trike<00:01:17.680> X<00:01:17.890> all<00:01:18.070> like<00:01:18.220> that<00:01:18.400> so<00:01:18.610> that's

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
got your trike X all like that so that's

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.820 
got your trike X all like that so that's
the<00:01:18.910> first<00:01:19.119> thing<00:01:19.270> we<00:01:19.420> do<00:01:19.540> now<00:01:20.050> put<00:01:20.680> your

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
the first thing we do now put your

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.859 
the first thing we do now put your
wheels<00:01:20.979> on<00:01:21.220> relatively<00:01:22.090> simple<00:01:22.479> that<00:01:22.600> slips

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
wheels on relatively simple that slips

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.170 
wheels on relatively simple that slips
over<00:01:23.080> there<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:24.400> second<00:01:24.729> wheel<00:01:24.880> slips

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
over there and the second wheel slips

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.160 
over there and the second wheel slips
over<00:01:25.509> like<00:01:25.690> so<00:01:26.910> we've<00:01:27.910> got<00:01:28.090> that<00:01:28.270> final<00:01:28.869> thing

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
over like so we've got that final thing

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.719 
over like so we've got that final thing
we<00:01:29.259> need<00:01:29.290> to<00:01:29.500> do<00:01:29.680> is<00:01:29.860> we<00:01:30.040> need<00:01:30.159> to<00:01:30.280> assemble<00:01:30.550> the

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
we need to do is we need to assemble the

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.700 
we need to do is we need to assemble the
bolt<00:01:31.330> kit<00:01:31.600> so<00:01:31.930> this<00:01:32.110> comes<00:01:32.350> all<00:01:32.560> the<00:01:32.680> way

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
bolt kit so this comes all the way

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.370 
bolt kit so this comes all the way
through<00:01:33.009> here<00:01:33.220> so<00:01:33.340> it's<00:01:33.460> ready<00:01:33.670> dry<00:01:34.200> suit<00:01:35.200> that

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
through here so it's ready dry suit that

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.040 
through here so it's ready dry suit that
through<00:01:35.649> there<00:01:36.060> put<00:01:37.060> on<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.300> other<00:01:37.390> end<00:01:37.600> and

other side do exactly the same you've

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.370 
other side do exactly the same you've
got<00:02:15.030> your<00:02:15.270> front<00:02:15.420> wheel<00:02:15.600> assembly<00:02:15.630> by<00:02:16.319> the

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
got your front wheel assembly by the

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.410 
got your front wheel assembly by the
bolt<00:02:16.709> we're<00:02:17.310> going<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.489> drop<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.670> in<00:02:17.940> between

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
bolt we're going to drop that in between

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.680 
bolt we're going to drop that in between

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
the forks gently lower that into place

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.479 
the forks gently lower that into place
so<00:02:22.500> once<00:02:22.770> we've<00:02:22.890> got<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.069> front<00:02:23.190> wheel<00:02:23.400> in

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
so once we've got the front wheel in

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:24.800 
so once we've got the front wheel in
place<00:02:23.700> next<00:02:24.060> thing<00:02:24.239> I'm<00:02:24.300> going<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.450> do<00:02:24.540> is<00:02:24.660> put

axle so you can see the various
components<00:03:52.430> there<00:03:52.610> like<00:03:53.120> we<00:03:53.240> did<00:03:53.420> with<00:03:53.540> the

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
components there like we did with the

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.870 
components there like we did with the
trike<00:03:53.930> axle<00:03:54.380> this<00:03:55.190> thing<00:03:55.400> to<00:03:55.490> do<00:03:55.610> is<00:03:55.730> actually

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
trike axle this thing to do is actually

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.280 
trike axle this thing to do is actually
place<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:58.910> axle<00:03:59.240> through<00:03:59.480> the<00:03:59.630> center<00:04:00.020> so

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
place the axle through the center so

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.360 
place the axle through the center so
you've<00:04:00.380> got<00:04:00.500> an<00:04:00.590> element<00:04:00.770> of<00:04:00.920> space<00:04:01.160> for<00:04:01.280> each

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
you've got an element of space for each

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.950 
you've got an element of space for each
side<00:04:01.580> now<00:04:02.120> one<00:04:02.360> thing<00:04:02.480> we're<00:04:02.570> going<00:04:02.660> to<00:04:02.720> do

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
side now one thing we're going to do

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.280 
side now one thing we're going to do
here<00:04:03.170> is<00:04:03.290> splay<00:04:03.950> the<00:04:04.700> rear<00:04:04.910> frame<00:04:05.420> parts<00:04:05.840> apart

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
here is splay the rear frame parts apart

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.140 
here is splay the rear frame parts apart
so<00:04:06.650> that<00:04:06.770> we<00:04:06.860> can<00:04:07.010> drop<00:04:07.190> that<00:04:07.370> into<00:04:07.550> place<00:04:07.880> once

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
so that we can drop that into place once

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.660 
so that we can drop that into place once
you've<00:04:08.330> stretched<00:04:08.720> that<00:04:08.930> open<00:04:09.370> lined<00:04:10.370> up<00:04:10.550> the
