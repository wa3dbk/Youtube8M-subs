00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the blade I wanted something that looked

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.530 
the blade I wanted something that looked
a<00:01:45.990> bit<00:01:46.020> more<00:01:46.409> like<00:01:46.620> the<00:01:46.770> film<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.540> looked

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
a bit more like the film and looked

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.580 
a bit more like the film and looked
generally<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.290> little<00:01:49.530> bit<00:01:49.620> more<00:01:49.800> real<00:01:50.040> really

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
generally a little bit more real really

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.930 
generally a little bit more real really
of<00:01:52.590> course<00:01:52.800> you've<00:01:53.010> got<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.130> Spartan<00:01:53.610> sphere

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.059 

we'll<00:02:06.610> put<00:02:06.790> the<00:02:07.259> on<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.470> running<00:02:08.709> svabhava

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.890

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
so I think we need for firewood to make

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.640 
so I think we need for firewood to make
the<00:02:20.050> spare

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.280 

I<00:02:27.709> hopefully<00:02:28.519> I<00:02:28.849> intend<00:02:29.720> on<00:02:29.810> making<00:02:29.989> this

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
I hopefully I intend on making this

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.929 
I hopefully I intend on making this

I<00:02:48.680> tend<00:02:49.040> on<00:02:49.099> making<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.430> animations<00:02:49.879> a<00:02:50.000> hell

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
I tend on making the animations a hell

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.479 
I tend on making the animations a hell
of<00:02:50.209> a<00:02:50.329> lot<00:02:50.450> better<00:02:50.569> and<00:02:51.079> of<00:02:51.530> course<00:02:51.769> I'm<00:02:52.400> gonna

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
of a lot better and of course I'm gonna

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:53.970 
of a lot better and of course I'm gonna
make<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.730> spear<00:02:52.939> so<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.120> can<00:02:53.269> throw<00:02:53.420> it

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
because I'm sure everybody has been

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.580 
because I'm sure everybody has been
waiting<00:02:56.120> for<00:02:56.269> a<00:02:56.420> sphere<00:02:56.659> weight<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:57.049> fro<00:02:57.290> and

waiting for a sphere weight and fro and
you<00:02:58.099> know<00:02:58.220> with<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.849> right<00:02:58.970> animations<00:02:59.540> of

00:02:59.649 --> 00:02:59.659 
you know with the right animations of

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.220 
you know with the right animations of
course<00:03:01.299> it<00:03:02.299> might<00:03:02.450> take<00:03:02.690> a<00:03:02.720> hell<00:03:02.930> of<00:03:02.959> a<00:03:03.049> lot<00:03:03.139> of

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
course it might take a hell of a lot of

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.119 
course it might take a hell of a lot of
time<00:03:03.440> though<00:03:05.290> that's<00:03:06.290> what<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.709> sphere<00:03:06.950> looks

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129 
time though that's what the sphere looks

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.610 
time though that's what the sphere looks
like<00:03:07.310> so<00:03:07.549> far<00:03:09.370> that's<00:03:10.370> it<00:03:10.519> in<00:03:10.609> first<00:03:10.879> person<00:03:11.060> I

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
like so far that's it in first person I

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.050 
like so far that's it in first person I
do<00:03:12.620> intend<00:03:13.040> on<00:03:13.129> making<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.519> shield<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.879> hell<00:03:14.030> of

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
do intend on making the shield a hell of

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.270 
do intend on making the shield a hell of
a<00:03:14.150> lot<00:03:14.239> smaller<00:03:14.510> I<00:03:15.290> know<00:03:15.680> a<00:03:15.739> lots<00:03:15.980> of<00:03:16.040> people

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
a lot smaller I know a lots of people

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.470 
a lot smaller I know a lots of people
have<00:03:16.370> been<00:03:16.459> saying<00:03:16.700> that<00:03:16.819> the<00:03:16.909> shield<00:03:17.150> is<00:03:17.329> it

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
have been saying that the shield is it

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.500 
have been saying that the shield is it
Hal<00:03:18.200> about<00:03:18.230> too<00:03:18.590> big<00:03:18.889> and<00:03:19.879> you<00:03:20.180> can't<00:03:20.420> really

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
Hal about too big and you can't really

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.949 
Hal about too big and you can't really
see<00:03:20.629> the<00:03:20.840> screen<00:03:20.930> and<00:03:21.349> from<00:03:21.560> if<00:03:21.769> if<00:03:22.129> you<00:03:22.370> if<00:03:22.639> I

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
see the screen and from if if you if I

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.470 
see the screen and from if if you if I
do<00:03:23.959> this<00:03:24.109> now<00:03:24.290> obviously<00:03:24.680> you<00:03:24.799> can<00:03:24.829> see<00:03:24.950> that

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
do this now obviously you can see that

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.699 
do this now obviously you can see that
it<00:03:26.480> takes<00:03:26.689> up<00:03:26.810> half<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.019> screen<00:03:27.290> there<00:03:27.530> enough

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
it takes up half the screen there enough

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.059 
it takes up half the screen there enough
about<00:03:28.250> three-quarters<00:03:28.879> of<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.030> screen<00:03:30.069> I've

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
about three-quarters of the screen I've

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.309 
about three-quarters of the screen I've
also<00:03:31.280> created<00:03:31.609> my<00:03:32.000> own<00:03:32.030> Spartan<00:03:32.720> Race<00:03:32.930> it's

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
also created my own Spartan Race it's

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.069 
also created my own Spartan Race it's
still<00:03:33.560> in<00:03:33.650> beta<00:03:33.680> stages<00:03:34.129> at<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.430> moment<00:03:34.790> but

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
still in beta stages at the moment but

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.920 
still in beta stages at the moment but
nonetheless<00:03:36.079> it<00:03:36.500> still<00:03:36.590> looks<00:03:36.919> pretty<00:03:36.980> good

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
nonetheless it still looks pretty good

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.180 
nonetheless it still looks pretty good

Imperial race but I interned on make him
a<00:03:41.989> hell<00:03:42.139> of<00:03:42.169> a<00:03:42.290> lot<00:03:42.410> better<00:03:42.560> and<00:03:43.400> he<00:03:43.579> already

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
a hell of a lot better and he already

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.899 
a hell of a lot better and he already
has<00:03:44.060> his<00:03:44.239> own<00:03:44.359> abilities<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:45.760> levelling<00:03:46.760> up

has his own abilities and levelling up
tree<00:03:47.709> but<00:03:48.709> at<00:03:48.889> the<00:03:48.980> moment<00:03:49.129> I'm<00:03:49.849> having<00:03:49.970> a<00:03:50.120> bit

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
tree but at the moment I'm having a bit

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.270 
tree but at the moment I'm having a bit
of<00:03:50.299> difficulties<00:03:50.989> with<00:03:51.019> a<00:03:51.230> bit<00:03:51.560> of<00:03:51.590> textures

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
of difficulties with a bit of textures

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.220 
of difficulties with a bit of textures
and<00:03:52.489> meshes<00:03:52.639> and<00:03:52.970> stuff<00:03:53.180> and<00:03:53.389> the<00:03:53.569> heads<00:03:53.780> go<00:03:54.079> in

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.319 
and meshes and stuff and the heads go in
a<00:03:54.379> bit<00:03:54.560> weird<00:03:54.889> and<00:03:55.579> I<00:03:55.760> think<00:03:55.970> it's<00:03:56.090> some<00:03:56.209> for

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
a bit weird and I think it's some for

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.569 
a bit weird and I think it's some for
the<00:03:56.389> better<00:03:56.419> up<00:03:56.870> to<00:03:57.049> fix<00:03:57.290> I've<00:03:57.680> don't<00:03:58.159> know<00:03:58.280> I
