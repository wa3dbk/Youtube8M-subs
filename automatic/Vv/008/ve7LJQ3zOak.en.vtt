 hello my friends here today god and that 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:13.710
 here is an egypt and 307 pt 385 is 1 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.570
 375 this one that I have 385 is practically 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.340
 The same device does not even know which one 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.230
 the difference between one and the other knows 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.270
 very little about that day for him and 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.750
 This agreement would be broken and I will 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.400
 change here with this new one remembering 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.349
 that if you want to buy this lcd 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.700
 with me the link is below this video 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.860
 Looks like it looks bad with broken lcd 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.620
 You can do nothing on the beach so let's 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.809
 Do the following, I'll trade it well. 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.059
 fast lc to learn that I have 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.870
 I took the screws for this video. 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:51.360
 stay away from that profuse not accurate 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:56.010
 say it will not be that same he has two 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:00.750
 layers people will get the first 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:04.739
 part bring here is a little easy to take 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.760
 If you have a hard one of mine that 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.549
 if you can get then took the four 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.920
 screws start playing that underneath 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.119
 look how it makes this part easy come out 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:25.590
 said to bring the next phase now 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:26.549
 The loose cable cd top cable Souto 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.090
 screen 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.740
 look how is it that you wrote 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.290
 my daughter is making noise 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.950
 Unfortunately, it's just the same, it 's nothing to 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:43.680
 do nothing do almost all my 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:48.630
 videos she's screaming loose the way 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.220
 here the power turns the power off and now the 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.270
 People are going to do the following if I'm here. 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:58.350
 the cds dropped dick it's here because the people 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:00.619
 will need and may need to take 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.700
 here is an lcd path 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.700
 let's drop this part here 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.899
 starting here from below 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:17.459
 fuck the cable lcd that it out 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:21.930
 This part is harder than two 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:29.550
 here is another here and 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:37.319
 still we have here below here we see 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:42.030
 If I can get it out here, this is 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.980
 Do not you want to take this part out here? 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.090
 You want to leave the way I'm doing. 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.730
 here o 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.910
 does the following is this way without 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.099
 need to release this part here that is 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.110
 really hard 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.709
 Look, I 'm just getting it out here. 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.160
 but it's not a very easy thing to 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:06.870
 cause of australia that has it 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:10.500
 beyond that hangs here O get well 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:18.600
 camera has another down here to know if 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:21.299
 I can jump here so lets do 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.700
 of account that you are not 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.450
 giving jump so here account not want 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.370
 force not to break anything does so 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.450
 with this problem here this indicator 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.900
 underneath makes a small one of Brazil is 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.040
 embargoed 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.630
 so that you can put your own 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.989
 united finger 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:51.260
 here below the next year and will 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:51.260
 taking off okay now you do the following 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:59.359
 take her started saying so pull this one 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:04.410
 it's broken 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:07.019
 Let's put in a new strip now. 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.340
 Protective plastic care not to 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:13.370
 play with the lcd game so as not to stain 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:17.239
 introducing it this way is here 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:20.419
 like a dog 30 in secret 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:29.960
 And this car here, 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:36.580
 by the hole here between the plate 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.580
 Look how I 'm doing, take it. 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:47.539
 this part that is a bit difficult to 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:49.430
 do because the cable also folded 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:50.630
 so just look with the help of the 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:57.039
 gay slit 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:57.039
 The crucible is here now and he's pulling it. 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:04.699

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.479
 play here you pull a little job 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:09.440
 unglued lcd 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:12.139
 Now let's do the following let's go. 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:16.729
 pass the power button here including 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:23.780
 cell phone and dog 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:28.669
 so power in the box that the cable 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:30.710
 touchscreen ready single thing that 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:35.889

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.169
 Battery Test 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:00.169
 Let's do a test on that battery. 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:03.289
 to see if the appliance will work 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:06.110
 perfectly clear device not to 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:10.270
