00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.950
 hey people my name is xd and today 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:16.240
 I want to show you how you are in gta 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:18.280
 online with the content creators objects 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.130
 Stacking the whole thing works in 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.870
 race or even the match and me 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.510
 just made it full in the race 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:29.680
 and with this little trick could 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.390
 Any object will stack something like that 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.629
 you have to do it first is either 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.280
 Place object on the floor then in 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.489
 In my case it is the container 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.780
 then I take a second container 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.019
 the animal just on the other side 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:47.489
 ground on the ground and raises it too 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:49.510
 again with ex give up the whole 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.329
 works so that the game then 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.489
 thinks that the first container is quasi 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.469
 heard firmly in the ground and can then the 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.569
 other tour starts so easy 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.100
 place an object on the floor 

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:01.960
 pick it up again and you can do it everywhere 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.729
 to place on it 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.890
 she can not do that with all objects 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:08.469
 and I will also be here again 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.100
 show ramps and other trades 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:12.070
 breakfast 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.850
 so you can stretch many hot air 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.789
 whatever match build 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.430
 and yes it just experimented 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.370
 a little bit of wood is pretty much fun 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.760
 in order to 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:30.050
 Triesen ran build and you need 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.540
 no hacks maz whatever i do 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.030
 hope there if in the future nice horny 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.800
 race is also created by 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.630
 rockstar be verified and fun 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.400
 to drive these maps 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.140
 Well that's it for you 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.650
 the video liked it was a 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.630
 small tip if you have more such videos 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.580
 That should be a broker and just 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.580
