00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
think it's best you have a little bit of

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.000 
think it's best you have a little bit of
a<00:00:37.890> either<00:00:38.879> wave<00:00:39.270> or<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> curl<00:00:39.989> or<00:00:40.230> texture<00:00:40.800> to

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
a either wave or a curl or texture to

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.340 
a either wave or a curl or texture to
your<00:00:41.040> hair<00:00:41.430> stick<00:00:42.210> straight<00:00:42.480> hair<00:00:42.719> would<00:00:43.050> be

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
okay I guess but it wouldn't have the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.020 
okay I guess but it wouldn't have the
same<00:00:45.719> effect<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.440> my<00:00:47.340> hair<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.730> pretty

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.750 
i put one there and i don't have a
mirror<00:04:12.960> in<00:04:13.080> front<00:04:13.140> of<00:04:13.380> me<00:04:13.470> so<00:04:13.830> it<00:04:14.100> would<00:04:14.550> be<00:04:14.730> a

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
mirror in front of me so it would be a

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.640 
mirror in front of me so it would be a
lot<00:04:15.150> easier<00:04:15.420> for<00:04:16.110> you<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:18.230> look<00:04:19.230> at<00:04:19.350> a<00:04:19.410> mirror

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
lot easier for you to look at a mirror

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:27.060 
lot easier for you to look at a mirror
while<00:04:19.920> doing<00:04:20.220> this

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.340 

okay<00:04:27.790> so<00:04:28.450> you're<00:04:28.570> just<00:04:28.630> going<00:04:28.780> to<00:04:28.870> go<00:04:28.990> down<00:04:29.170> the

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
okay so you're just going to go down the

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.890 
okay so you're just going to go down the
length<00:04:29.530> of<00:04:29.680> your<00:04:29.740> hair<00:04:29.890> until<00:04:30.450> you<00:04:31.450> get<00:04:31.660> to<00:04:31.870> a

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
length of your hair until you get to a

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.790 
length of your hair until you get to a
point<00:04:31.990> where<00:04:32.440> you<00:04:32.770> really<00:04:33.190> can't<00:04:33.640> put<00:04:34.150> another

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
point where you really can't put another

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.310 
point where you really can't put another
hair<00:04:35.800> tie<00:04:36.040> in<00:04:36.280> my<00:04:36.640> room<00:04:36.970> for<00:04:37.150> one<00:04:37.360> more<00:04:37.390> so<00:04:38.140> I'm

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
hair tie in my room for one more so I'm

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.940 
hair tie in my room for one more so I'm
going<00:04:38.350> to<00:04:38.500> put<00:04:38.650> it<00:04:38.740> down<00:04:38.950> here<00:04:40.410> you<00:04:41.410> could<00:04:41.710> put

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
going to put it down here you could put

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.470 
going to put it down here you could put
one<00:04:42.130> at<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:42.310> very<00:04:42.490> end<00:04:42.700> if<00:04:42.910> you<00:04:42.940> wanted<00:04:43.330> but

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
one at the very end if you wanted but

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.510 
one at the very end if you wanted but
that's<00:04:43.660> just<00:04:43.840> unnecessary<00:04:44.080> and<00:04:44.950> it's<00:04:45.280> kind<00:04:45.490> of

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
that's just unnecessary and it's kind of

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.030 
that's just unnecessary and it's kind of
cute<00:04:45.760> with<00:04:45.940> longer<00:04:46.930> pieces<00:04:47.140> now<00:04:47.740> it<00:04:47.890> would<00:04:48.010> be

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
cute with longer pieces now it would be

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.400 
cute with longer pieces now it would be
really<00:04:48.490> cute<00:04:48.820> if<00:04:49.000> you<00:04:49.120> kind<00:04:49.240> of<00:04:49.360> curled<00:04:49.930> that

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
really cute if you kind of curled that

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.330 
really cute if you kind of curled that
if<00:04:50.860> it<00:04:51.490> was<00:04:51.640> a<00:04:51.670> little<00:04:51.850> bit<00:04:52.000> longer<00:04:52.330> but<00:04:53.340> this

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
if it was a little bit longer but this

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.460 
if it was a little bit longer but this
is<00:04:54.520> where<00:04:54.730> it's<00:04:55.210> going<00:04:55.750> to<00:04:55.840> be<00:04:55.930> best<00:04:56.140> if<00:04:56.350> your
