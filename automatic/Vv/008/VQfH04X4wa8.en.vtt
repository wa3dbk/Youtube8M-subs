00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
bend this up like that and bend the

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.620 
bend this up like that and bend the
other<00:03:19.709> one<00:03:20.489> up<00:03:22.099> like<00:03:23.099> that<00:03:23.910> so<00:03:24.299> they're<00:03:24.480> like

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
other one up like that so they're like

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.890 
other one up like that so they're like
this<00:03:25.010> and<00:03:26.010> you<00:03:26.099> might<00:03:26.250> think<00:03:26.549> you're<00:03:26.790> done<00:03:27.030> but

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
this and you might think you're done but

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.699 
this and you might think you're done but
there<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.709> problem<00:03:29.690> see<00:03:30.690> when<00:03:31.110> you<00:03:31.230> put<00:03:31.500> the

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
there is a problem see when you put the

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.150 
there is a problem see when you put the
ipod<00:03:32.130> in<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.489> stands<00:03:33.299> there's<00:03:34.019> nothing<00:03:34.920> to

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
ipod in the stands there's nothing to

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.490 
ipod in the stands there's nothing to
support<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.819> back<00:03:36.000> so<00:03:36.780> we're<00:03:37.109> going<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.319> have

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
support the back so we're going to have

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.830 
support the back so we're going to have
to<00:03:37.650> use<00:03:37.889> another<00:03:38.489> paper<00:03:38.850> clip<00:03:39.180> as<00:03:39.359> a<00:03:39.389> sport<00:03:39.810> for

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
to use another paper clip as a sport for

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.809 
to use another paper clip as a sport for
the<00:03:39.989> back<00:03:40.190> this<00:03:41.190> is<00:03:41.340> probably<00:03:41.579> the<00:03:41.760> hardest

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
the back this is probably the hardest

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.849 
the back this is probably the hardest
part<00:03:42.299> of<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.600> and<00:03:42.810> it's<00:03:42.989> still<00:03:43.290> not<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:43.530> hard

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
part of it and it's still not that hard

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.229 
part of it and it's still not that hard
so<00:03:44.540> you<00:03:45.540> cannot<00:03:45.810> have<00:03:45.989> to<00:03:46.109> get<00:03:46.380> it<00:03:46.500> like<00:03:46.650> this

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
so you cannot have to get it like this

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.840 
so you cannot have to get it like this
you're<00:03:48.239> going<00:03:48.359> to<00:03:48.420> want<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.690> do<00:03:48.810> is<00:03:49.109> once<00:03:49.530> again

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
you're going to want to do is once again

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.559 
you're going to want to do is once again
fold<00:03:50.900> this<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.319> inner<00:03:52.500> part<00:03:52.799> down<00:03:53.569> then

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
fold this the inner part down then

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.840 
fold this the inner part down then
you're<00:03:54.750> going<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:54.900> want<00:03:55.109> to<00:03:55.200> bend<00:03:55.980> this<00:03:56.370> so

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
you're going to want to bend this so

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:07.460 
you're going to want to bend this so
that<00:03:57.709> it's<00:03:58.819> like<00:04:02.660> like<00:04:03.660> this<00:04:04.760> so<00:04:05.760> that<00:04:06.470> it

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
that it's like like this so that it

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.740 
that it's like like this so that it
lines<00:04:07.680> up<00:04:07.889> like<00:04:08.100> that<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:08.639> that<00:04:09.450> there's<00:04:09.690> a

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
lines up like that and that there's a

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.160 
lines up like that and that there's a
back<00:04:10.230> support<00:04:10.440> there<00:04:10.889> and<00:04:11.870> then<00:04:12.870> you're<00:04:13.049> going

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
back support there and then you're going

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.870 
back support there and then you're going

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.440 
it functions great but why do that one
you<00:04:48.760> could<00:04:48.940> do<00:04:49.210> a<00:04:49.920> soda<00:04:50.920> can<00:04:51.220> now<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.090> soda-can

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
you could do a soda can now the soda-can

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.270 
you could do a soda can now the soda-can
is<00:04:52.690> definitely<00:04:53.260> the<00:04:53.380> hardest<00:04:53.560> and<00:04:54.010> it's

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
is definitely the hardest and it's

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.040 
is definitely the hardest and it's
probably<00:04:54.730> the<00:04:54.970> most<00:04:55.150> dangerous<00:04:55.420> to<00:04:55.900> your

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
probably the most dangerous to your

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.360 
probably the most dangerous to your
safety<00:04:56.320> because<00:04:57.010> you're<00:04:57.100> going<00:04:57.220> to<00:04:57.280> be

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
safety because you're going to be

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.280 
safety because you're going to be
cutting<00:04:57.550> with<00:04:57.760> knives<00:04:57.970> the<00:04:58.660> first<00:04:58.960> thing<00:04:59.170> I'm

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
cutting with knives the first thing I'm

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.170 
cutting with knives the first thing I'm
going<00:04:59.410> to<00:04:59.470> recommend<00:04:59.710> is<00:05:00.220> that<00:05:00.250> you<00:05:00.490> cut<00:05:00.940> it<00:05:01.060> in

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
going to recommend is that you cut it in

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.070 
going to recommend is that you cut it in
half<00:05:01.210> about<00:05:02.110> there<00:05:03.010> and<00:05:03.280> so<00:05:04.030> one<00:05:04.420> jump<00:05:04.780> cut

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
half about there and so one jump cut

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.350 
half about there and so one jump cut
later<00:05:05.500> and<00:05:06.330> bam<00:05:07.330> we<00:05:07.990> have<00:05:08.230> half<00:05:08.470> a<00:05:08.590> can<00:05:08.860> of

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
later and bam we have half a can of

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.300 
later and bam we have half a can of
Mountain<00:05:10.360> Dew<00:05:10.710> but<00:05:11.710> we're<00:05:11.920> going<00:05:12.040> to<00:05:12.100> have<00:05:12.220> to

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
Mountain Dew but we're going to have to

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.660 
Mountain Dew but we're going to have to
do<00:05:12.430> a<00:05:12.460> bit<00:05:12.970> more<00:05:13.000> cutting<00:05:13.660> see<00:05:14.550> depending<00:05:15.550> on

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
do a bit more cutting see depending on

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:16.920 
do a bit more cutting see depending on
where<00:05:15.850> you<00:05:15.940> want<00:05:15.970> it<00:05:16.270> you're<00:05:16.480> going<00:05:16.630> to<00:05:16.720> have

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
where you want it you're going to have

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.620 
where you want it you're going to have
to<00:05:17.080> cut<00:05:17.470> two<00:05:18.310> bars<00:05:19.440> there<00:05:20.440> and<00:05:21.420> opposite<00:05:22.420> that

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
to cut two bars there and opposite that

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.680 
to cut two bars there and opposite that
there<00:05:23.380> so<00:05:24.010> after<00:05:24.340> i<00:05:24.550> get<00:05:24.760> that<00:05:24.970> done<00:05:25.210> i'll<00:05:25.450> come

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
there so after i get that done i'll come

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.980

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
not black bars we have the bars cut out

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.650 
not black bars we have the bars cut out
from<00:05:37.000> the<00:05:37.600> sides<00:05:37.840> of<00:05:38.200> the<00:05:38.620> mountain<00:05:38.740> dew<00:05:39.010> can

from the sides of the mountain dew can
now<00:05:40.660> last<00:05:41.080> thing<00:05:41.350> we're<00:05:41.560> going<00:05:41.710> to<00:05:41.770> do<00:05:42.040> is

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
now last thing we're going to do is

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.300 
now last thing we're going to do is
we're<00:05:43.030> going<00:05:43.420> to<00:05:43.540> cut<00:05:44.350> in<00:05:44.740> this<00:05:44.890> case<00:05:45.100> with

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
we're going to cut in this case with

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.950 
we're going to cut in this case with
safety<00:05:45.550> scissors<00:05:45.700> because<00:05:46.240> safety<00:05:46.690> is

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
safety scissors because safety is

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.360 
safety scissors because safety is
important<00:05:47.820> we're<00:05:48.820> going<00:05:48.940> to<00:05:49.000> cut<00:05:49.420> right<00:05:49.660> here

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
important we're going to cut right here

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.940 
important we're going to cut right here
about<00:05:51.370> were<00:05:51.700> there<00:05:52.170> so<00:05:53.170> I'm<00:05:53.380> just<00:05:53.560> gonna<00:05:53.710> do

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
about were there so I'm just gonna do

00:05:53.950 --> 00:06:05.120 
about were there so I'm just gonna do
that<00:05:55.650> and<00:05:56.650> I<00:05:57.340> don't<00:05:57.460> the<00:05:57.850> sharp<00:05:58.150> knife<00:05:58.330> and

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.410 

there<00:06:06.130> we<00:06:06.250> go<00:06:06.400> I'm<00:06:06.670> just<00:06:06.850> going<00:06:06.970> to<00:06:07.000> round<00:06:07.240> off

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:07.420 
there we go I'm just going to round off

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:15.360 
there we go I'm just going to round off
the<00:06:07.450> edges<00:06:07.720> a<00:06:08.140> little<00:06:08.320> bit<00:06:12.060> and<00:06:13.590> your<00:06:14.590> gym<00:06:14.890> and

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
the edges a little bit and your gym and

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.920 
the edges a little bit and your gym and
uh<00:06:15.870> yeah<00:06:16.870> there<00:06:17.230> we<00:06:17.350> go<00:06:17.380> that's<00:06:17.860> a<00:06:18.010> stand<00:06:18.310> now

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
uh yeah there we go that's a stand now

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.600 
uh yeah there we go that's a stand now
we<00:06:19.930> just<00:06:20.140> take<00:06:20.410> this<00:06:20.620> little<00:06:20.830> piece<00:06:21.190> of<00:06:21.370> metal

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
we just take this little piece of metal

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:30.140 
we just take this little piece of metal
away<00:06:21.850> so<00:06:22.030> no<00:06:22.540> one<00:06:22.570> gets<00:06:22.720> hurt<00:06:23.940> we<00:06:26.370> have<00:06:27.780> one

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
away so no one gets hurt we have one

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.740 
away so no one gets hurt we have one
ipod<00:06:31.150> stand<00:06:31.540> and<00:06:32.940> because<00:06:33.940> we<00:06:34.210> have<00:06:34.390> the<00:06:34.540> bars

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:34.750 
ipod stand and because we have the bars

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.520 
ipod stand and because we have the bars
cut<00:06:35.020> out<00:06:36.090> you<00:06:37.090> have<00:06:37.240> that<00:06:37.510> too<00:06:37.840> you<00:06:38.170> can<00:06:38.290> do<00:06:38.410> it

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
cut out you have that too you can do it

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.060 
cut out you have that too you can do it
in<00:06:38.590> landscape<00:06:39.010> now<00:06:39.970> i<00:06:40.000> don't<00:06:40.300> recommend<00:06:41.080> doing

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
in landscape now i don't recommend doing

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.250 
in landscape now i don't recommend doing
this<00:06:42.280> if<00:06:42.730> your<00:06:43.060> ipod<00:06:43.450> doesn't<00:06:43.840> have<00:06:43.960> a<00:06:43.990> case

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.260 
this if your ipod doesn't have a case

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.070 
this if your ipod doesn't have a case
because<00:06:45.040> the<00:06:45.220> sharp<00:06:45.490> edges<00:06:45.730> can<00:06:46.330> really

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 
because the sharp edges can really

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.290 
because the sharp edges can really
really<00:06:47.500> scratch<00:06:47.950> up<00:06:48.160> an<00:06:48.280> eye<00:06:48.400> on<00:06:48.430> and<00:06:48.880> that's

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.300 
really scratch up an eye on and that's

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.230 
really scratch up an eye on and that's
not<00:06:49.510> good<00:06:49.860> so<00:06:50.860> this<00:06:51.190> is<00:06:51.310> probably<00:06:51.610> only<00:06:51.910> best

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 
not good so this is probably only best

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.570 
not good so this is probably only best
if<00:06:52.510> you're<00:06:52.720> using<00:06:52.990> a<00:06:53.200> case<00:06:53.440> a<00:06:53.470> lot<00:06:53.680> or<00:06:54.100> if<00:06:54.460> you

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580 
if you're using a case a lot or if you

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.060 
if you're using a case a lot or if you
bend<00:06:55.030> down<00:06:55.180> the<00:06:55.330> edges

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.070 
bend down the edges

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.830 
bend down the edges
that<00:06:56.220> it<00:06:56.340> doesn't<00:06:56.640> scratch<00:06:57.000> it<00:06:57.240> that's

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 
that it doesn't scratch it that's

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.510 
that it doesn't scratch it that's
probably<00:06:58.110> the<00:06:58.410> best<00:06:58.710> thing<00:06:58.830> to<00:06:59.040> do<00:06:59.190> if<00:06:59.400> you

00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 
probably the best thing to do if you

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.390 
probably the best thing to do if you
don't<00:06:59.790> own<00:07:00.060> a<00:07:00.090> case<00:07:00.360> but<00:07:01.290> if<00:07:01.410> you<00:07:01.590> do<00:07:01.830> then<00:07:02.190> it's

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 
don't own a case but if you do then it's

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.160 
don't own a case but if you do then it's
probably<00:07:02.760> okay<00:07:03.150> to<00:07:03.210> leave<00:07:03.420> it<00:07:03.570> in<00:07:03.660> there<00:07:03.870> but

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.170 
probably okay to leave it in there but

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:08.470 
probably okay to leave it in there but
i'm<00:07:04.350> not<00:07:04.530> sure<00:07:04.860> but<00:07:06.080> anyway<00:07:07.080> let's<00:07:07.740> review

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:08.480 
i'm not sure but anyway let's review

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:14.870 
i'm not sure but anyway let's review
we've<00:07:09.480> got<00:07:10.220> three<00:07:11.220> cases<00:07:12.740> the<00:07:13.880> icebreaker

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880 
we've got three cases the icebreaker

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.810 
we've got three cases the icebreaker
case<00:07:15.330> with<00:07:15.960> the<00:07:16.260> upside<00:07:16.860> down<00:07:17.070> I<00:07:17.220> hot<00:07:17.460> inside

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:17.820 
case with the upside down I hot inside

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:30.560 
case with the upside down I hot inside
of<00:07:17.940> it<00:07:18.060> e<00:07:21.290> we<00:07:22.290> have<00:07:24.890> the<00:07:25.890> paperclip<00:07:26.700> stand<00:07:29.570> for

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:30.570 
of it e we have the paperclip stand for

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:39.890 
of it e we have the paperclip stand for
landscape<00:07:31.380> and<00:07:31.620> portrait<00:07:35.000> and<00:07:38.690> we<00:07:39.690> have<00:07:39.870> a

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:39.900 
landscape and portrait and we have a

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.120 
landscape and portrait and we have a
soda<00:07:40.200> can<00:07:40.470> now<00:07:41.870> for<00:07:42.870> the<00:07:42.930> soda<00:07:43.170> can<00:07:43.500> that<00:07:43.950> can

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.130 
soda can now for the soda can that can

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.250 
soda can now for the soda can that can
easily<00:07:44.400> be<00:07:44.550> replaced<00:07:44.850> with<00:07:45.450> any<00:07:45.720> round

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:46.260 
easily be replaced with any round

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.730 
easily be replaced with any round
objects<00:07:47.160> like<00:07:47.630> yogurt<00:07:48.630> container<00:07:49.050> your

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:49.740 
objects like yogurt container your

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.260 
objects like yogurt container your
container<00:07:50.190> is<00:07:50.370> probably<00:07:50.700> the<00:07:50.820> best<00:07:51.120> thing

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:51.270 
container is probably the best thing

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.200 
container is probably the best thing
because<00:07:52.260> it<00:07:52.680> doesn't<00:07:53.130> have<00:07:53.280> the<00:07:53.310> sharp<00:07:53.820> metal

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:54.210 
because it doesn't have the sharp metal

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:57.620 
because it doesn't have the sharp metal
around<00:07:54.450> it<00:07:54.840> like<00:07:55.170> the<00:07:55.740> soda-can<00:07:56.130> does<00:07:56.580> so<00:07:57.390> it

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:57.630 
around it like the soda-can does so it

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.480 
around it like the soda-can does so it
won't<00:07:57.840> scratch<00:07:58.020> up<00:07:58.350> the<00:07:58.380> ipod<00:07:58.830> as<00:07:59.010> much<00:07:59.220> but<00:07:59.430> I

00:07:59.480 --> 00:07:59.490 
won't scratch up the ipod as much but I

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.010 
won't scratch up the ipod as much but I
didn't<00:07:59.820> have<00:07:59.970> one<00:08:00.000> available<00:08:00.420> at<00:08:00.900> the<00:08:00.990> moment

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:01.020 
didn't have one available at the moment

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.330 
didn't have one available at the moment
so<00:08:01.470> I<00:08:01.530> couldn't<00:08:01.890> use<00:08:02.070> one

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:04.340 
so I couldn't use one

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:09.100 
so I couldn't use one
in<00:08:04.760> conclusion<00:08:05.660> be<00:08:06.410> safe<00:08:06.680> when<00:08:07.550> using<00:08:08.110> the

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:09.110 
in conclusion be safe when using the

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.560 
in conclusion be safe when using the
scissors<00:08:10.010> or<00:08:10.550> the<00:08:10.730> knife<00:08:10.940> whatever<00:08:11.330> you<00:08:11.449> use

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:11.570 
scissors or the knife whatever you use

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:15.909 
scissors or the knife whatever you use
the<00:08:11.720> cut<00:08:11.960> and<00:08:12.850> have<00:08:13.850> a<00:08:14.150> good<00:08:14.600> day<00:08:14.930> with<00:08:15.530> your

00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:15.919 
the cut and have a good day with your

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:20.350
