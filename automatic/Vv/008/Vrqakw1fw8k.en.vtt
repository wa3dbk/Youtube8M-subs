case I ever want to get it back into

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.479 
case I ever want to get it back into

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
of the piano black shell I actually put

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.670 
of the piano black shell I actually put
my<00:03:59.519> FPS<00:04:00.060> freeks<00:04:00.420> on<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.959> analog<00:04:01.319> sticks

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
my FPS freeks on the analog sticks

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.589 
my FPS freeks on the analog sticks
because<00:04:01.859> they're<00:04:02.220> black<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:02.760> they<00:04:03.209> actually

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
because they're black and they actually

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.020 
because they're black and they actually
go<00:04:03.720> a<00:04:03.750> lot<00:04:04.049> better<00:04:04.079> with<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:05.069> shell<00:04:05.370> because

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
go a lot better with the shell because

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.699 
go a lot better with the shell because
it's<00:04:06.180> all<00:04:06.269> like<00:04:06.480> a<00:04:06.510> black<00:04:06.810> theme<00:04:07.139> as<00:04:07.349> you<00:04:07.560> guys

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
it's all like a black theme as you guys

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.190 
it's all like a black theme as you guys
can<00:04:07.889> see<00:04:07.950> but<00:04:08.730> um<00:04:08.970> without<00:04:09.510> them<00:04:09.750> it's<00:04:09.959> just

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
can see but um without them it's just

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.800 
can see but um without them it's just
the<00:04:10.319> normal<00:04:10.650> gray<00:04:10.919> analog<00:04:11.459> sticks<00:04:11.819> but<00:04:12.450> this

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
the normal gray analog sticks but this

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.360 
the normal gray analog sticks but this
actually<00:04:13.049> is<00:04:13.530> great<00:04:13.769> like<00:04:13.950> I've<00:04:14.130> said<00:04:14.310> before

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
actually is great like I've said before

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.940 
actually is great like I've said before
it<00:04:14.849> is<00:04:14.880> really<00:04:15.359> glossy<00:04:15.569> it<00:04:16.079> has<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.440> different

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
it is really glossy it has a different

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.909 
it is really glossy it has a different
texture<00:04:17.400> in<00:04:17.750> just<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:18.870> different<00:04:19.410> feeling<00:04:19.769> than

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
texture in just a different feeling than

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.880 
texture in just a different feeling than
the<00:04:20.220> normal<00:04:20.579> matted<00:04:21.479> xbox<00:04:22.320> 360<00:04:22.860> controller

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
the normal matted xbox 360 controller

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.659 
the normal matted xbox 360 controller
and<00:04:23.990> it's<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.169> normal<00:04:25.380> controller<00:04:25.919> but<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.490> one

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
and it's a normal controller but the one

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.050 
and it's a normal controller but the one
thing

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
thing

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.820 
thing
that<00:04:27.240> I<00:04:27.270> don't<00:04:27.480> like<00:04:27.900> about<00:04:27.960> it<00:04:28.200> is<00:04:28.470> it

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
that I don't like about it is it

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.860 
that I don't like about it is it
actually<00:04:29.250> leaves<00:04:29.460> a<00:04:29.669> lot<00:04:29.940> of<00:04:30.150> fingerprints

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
actually leaves a lot of fingerprints

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.440 
actually leaves a lot of fingerprints
since<00:04:31.380> it's<00:04:31.560> this<00:04:31.740> glossy<00:04:32.250> feeling<00:04:32.730> you<00:04:33.300> can

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
since it's this glossy feeling you can

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.540 
since it's this glossy feeling you can
actually<00:04:33.630> see<00:04:33.900> fingerprints<00:04:34.680> and<00:04:34.980> sometimes

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
actually see fingerprints and sometimes

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.220 
actually see fingerprints and sometimes
it<00:04:35.700> gets<00:04:35.730> a<00:04:35.880> little<00:04:36.030> sweaty<00:04:36.450> but<00:04:36.660> you<00:04:37.080> just

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
it gets a little sweaty but you just

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.500 
it gets a little sweaty but you just
kind<00:04:37.470> of<00:04:37.560> rub<00:04:37.800> it<00:04:37.919> down<00:04:37.950> and<00:04:38.130> it's<00:04:38.460> alright<00:04:38.850> but

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
kind of rub it down and it's alright but

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.690 
kind of rub it down and it's alright but
the<00:04:39.960> good<00:04:40.260> thing<00:04:40.290> about<00:04:40.560> it<00:04:40.980> is<00:04:41.160> if<00:04:41.400> you<00:04:41.520> guys

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
the good thing about it is if you guys

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.330 
the good thing about it is if you guys
can<00:04:42.000> look<00:04:42.210> back<00:04:42.540> at<00:04:42.870> this<00:04:43.320> controller<00:04:43.740> here<00:04:44.160> I

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
can look back at this controller here I

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.530 
can look back at this controller here I
don't<00:04:44.700> know<00:04:44.760> if<00:04:44.880> you<00:04:44.940> can<00:04:45.090> see<00:04:45.270> this<00:04:45.360> in<00:04:45.510> the

don't know if you can see this in the
camera<00:04:45.990> but<00:04:46.380> it<00:04:46.500> gets<00:04:46.680> really<00:04:47.130> dirty<00:04:47.520> the

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
camera but it gets really dirty the

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.730 
camera but it gets really dirty the
controller<00:04:48.480> gets<00:04:48.690> really<00:04:49.139> dirty<00:04:49.260> sense<00:04:49.590> it's

or<00:04:54.480> any<00:04:54.980> stray<00:04:55.980> marks<00:04:56.280> that<00:04:56.580> you<00:04:56.730> had<00:04:56.910> from

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
or any stray marks that you had from

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.330 
or any stray marks that you had from

good all together and to turn it on and

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.190 
good all together and to turn it on and
off<00:05:17.610> all<00:05:17.940> you<00:05:18.090> have<00:05:18.210> to<00:05:18.360> do<00:05:18.510> is<00:05:18.780> click<00:05:18.960> on<00:05:19.080> this

off all you have to do is click on this

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.110 
off all you have to do is click on this
little<00:05:19.380> light<00:05:19.650> switch<00:05:19.919> which<00:05:20.580> will<00:05:20.760> turn<00:05:20.940> them

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
little light switch which will turn them

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.969 
little light switch which will turn them
on<00:05:21.300> and<00:05:21.360> off<00:05:21.600> so<00:05:21.930> that<00:05:21.960> you<00:05:22.139> guys<00:05:22.260> can<00:05:22.530> conserve

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
on and off so that you guys can conserve

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.580 
on and off so that you guys can conserve
battery<00:05:23.430> life<00:05:23.460> so<00:05:24.270> we<00:05:24.389> have<00:05:24.540> the<00:05:25.110> bumpers<00:05:25.560> in

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
battery life so we have the bumpers in

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.219 
battery life so we have the bumpers in
the<00:05:25.800> back<00:05:26.010> light<00:05:26.490> up<00:05:26.669> the<00:05:27.540> start<00:05:27.810> in<00:05:27.960> the<00:05:28.050> back

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
the back light up the start in the back

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.469 
the back light up the start in the back
we<00:05:28.979> have<00:05:29.010> the<00:05:29.250> center<00:05:29.729> as<00:05:29.910> you<00:05:30.150> guys<00:05:30.270> can<00:05:30.419> see

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
we have the center as you guys can see

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.600 
we have the center as you guys can see
it's<00:05:30.810> not<00:05:30.960> the<00:05:31.140> normal<00:05:31.500> and<00:05:31.680> we<00:05:32.010> have<00:05:32.130> all<00:05:32.400> of

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
it's not the normal and we have all of

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.520 
it's not the normal and we have all of
the<00:05:32.760> keys<00:05:33.060> which<00:05:33.330> is<00:05:33.510> my<00:05:33.660> favorite<00:05:34.110> part<00:05:34.229> of<00:05:34.410> it

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
the keys which is my favorite part of it

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.140 
the keys which is my favorite part of it
so<00:05:35.039> I'm<00:05:35.160> going<00:05:35.340> to<00:05:35.400> shut<00:05:35.610> that<00:05:35.700> off<00:05:35.760> for<00:05:36.030> now

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
so I'm going to shut that off for now

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.550 
so I'm going to shut that off for now
I'm<00:05:36.300> just<00:05:36.360> going<00:05:36.510> to<00:05:36.720> say<00:05:36.930> something<00:05:36.990> about

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
I'm just going to say something about

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.100 
I'm just going to say something about
the<00:05:38.550> making<00:05:38.820> of<00:05:39.060> the<00:05:39.180> controller<00:05:39.510> now<00:05:39.960> this

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
the making of the controller now this

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.320 
the making of the controller now this
was<00:05:40.289> my<00:05:40.440> first<00:05:40.710> time<00:05:40.979> ever<00:05:41.190> actually<00:05:41.490> creating

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
was my first time ever actually creating

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.830 
was my first time ever actually creating
a<00:05:42.419> controller<00:05:42.919> using<00:05:43.919> an<00:05:44.010> Xbox<00:05:44.430> shell<00:05:44.840> my

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
a controller using an Xbox shell my

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.529 
a controller using an Xbox shell my
first<00:05:46.110> time<00:05:46.320> taking<00:05:46.590> it<00:05:46.860> apart<00:05:47.130> and<00:05:47.450> what<00:05:48.450> I'm

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
first time taking it apart and what I'm

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:51.770 
first time taking it apart and what I'm
going<00:05:48.570> to<00:05:48.780> say<00:05:49.050> is<00:05:49.289> it<00:05:50.039> actually<00:05:50.340> is<00:05:50.850> a<00:05:51.210> little

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
going to say is it actually is a little

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.540 
going to say is it actually is a little
harder<00:05:52.169> your<00:05:52.320> first<00:05:52.560> time<00:05:52.800> around<00:05:52.919> now<00:05:53.280> once

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
harder your first time around now once

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.730 
harder your first time around now once
you've<00:05:53.700> taken<00:05:53.880> apart<00:05:54.240> once<00:05:54.479> and<00:05:54.780> you<00:05:55.470> keep

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
you've taken apart once and you keep

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.409 
you've taken apart once and you keep
taking<00:05:55.979> it<00:05:56.220> apart<00:05:56.520> like<00:05:56.789> for<00:05:57.000> your<00:05:57.090> second<00:05:57.360> or

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
taking it apart like for your second or

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:58.940 
taking it apart like for your second or
third<00:05:57.630> time<00:05:57.750> it<00:05:57.990> gets<00:05:58.169> a<00:05:58.260> lot<00:05:58.410> easier<00:05:58.470> it's

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
third time it gets a lot easier it's

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.469 
third time it gets a lot easier it's
kind<00:05:59.130> of<00:05:59.220> something<00:05:59.370> you<00:05:59.610> have<00:05:59.760> to<00:05:59.789> learn<00:06:00.180> and

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
kind of something you have to learn and

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:03.110 
kind of something you have to learn and
progress<00:06:00.900> into<00:06:01.410> doing<00:06:01.830> the<00:06:02.220> soldering<00:06:02.669> was<00:06:03.090> a

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
progress into doing the soldering was a

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.760 
progress into doing the soldering was a
little<00:06:03.479> difficult<00:06:03.690> because<00:06:04.110> it's<00:06:04.440> really

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
little difficult because it's really

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.650 
little difficult because it's really
small<00:06:05.039> and<00:06:05.250> I<00:06:05.700> have<00:06:05.850> a<00:06:05.880> little<00:06:06.210> larger

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
small and I have a little larger

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.659 
small and I have a little larger
soldering<00:06:06.990> kit<00:06:07.200> than<00:06:07.380> normal<00:06:07.680> but<00:06:08.070> you<00:06:08.550> have

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:08.669 
soldering kit than normal but you have

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.460 
soldering kit than normal but you have
to<00:06:08.789> be<00:06:08.850> very<00:06:08.910> careful<00:06:09.360> and<00:06:09.810> you<00:06:09.960> actually<00:06:10.139> can

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
to be very careful and you actually can

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.070 
to be very careful and you actually can
get<00:06:10.620> the<00:06:10.710> job<00:06:10.950> done<00:06:11.090> like<00:06:12.090> I<00:06:12.210> said<00:06:12.450> when<00:06:12.840> you<00:06:12.930> do

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
get the job done like I said when you do

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.860 
get the job done like I said when you do
it<00:06:13.200> very<00:06:13.350> carefully<00:06:13.650> now<00:06:14.479> after<00:06:15.479> all<00:06:15.600> the<00:06:15.750> work

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
it very carefully now after all the work

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.779 
it very carefully now after all the work
you<00:06:15.930> got<00:06:16.200> to<00:06:16.229> put<00:06:16.470> it<00:06:16.500> together<00:06:16.680> and<00:06:17.100> it<00:06:17.520> comes

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:17.789 
you got to put it together and it comes

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:19.550 
you got to put it together and it comes
with<00:06:17.880> time<00:06:18.180> it<00:06:18.539> took<00:06:18.870> me<00:06:19.020> a<00:06:19.050> little<00:06:19.260> longer

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
with time it took me a little longer

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.440 
with time it took me a little longer
than<00:06:19.830> I<00:06:19.919> suspected<00:06:20.100> but<00:06:20.940> it<00:06:21.030> was<00:06:21.120> my<00:06:21.240> first

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
than I suspected but it was my first

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.060 
than I suspected but it was my first
time<00:06:21.600> ever<00:06:21.720> doing<00:06:22.050> it<00:06:22.260> now<00:06:22.500> that<00:06:22.740> I<00:06:22.770> know<00:06:22.860> how

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
time ever doing it now that I know how

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.159 
time ever doing it now that I know how
to<00:06:23.130> do<00:06:23.340> it<00:06:23.460> all<00:06:23.610> it<00:06:23.880> will<00:06:24.210> be<00:06:24.330> a<00:06:24.360> lot<00:06:24.660> easier<00:06:24.870> if

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
to do it all it will be a lot easier if

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:26.930 
to do it all it will be a lot easier if
I<00:06:25.260> ever<00:06:25.380> try<00:06:25.620> to<00:06:25.650> do<00:06:25.860> this<00:06:25.979> again<00:06:26.160> but<00:06:26.789> yeah
