00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
pure white into transparent so I need to

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.100 
pure white into transparent so I need to
make<00:00:47.879> sure<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.150> background<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.720> actually

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
make sure the background is actually

make sure the background is actually
pure<00:00:49.379> white<00:00:49.730> to<00:00:50.730> do<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.030> I'll<00:00:51.180> select<00:00:51.210> all

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
pure white to do that I'll select all

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.360 
pure white to do that I'll select all
the<00:00:51.839> background<00:00:52.260> pieces<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.860> replace<00:00:53.159> them

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
the background pieces and replace them

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.520 
the background pieces and replace them
with<00:00:53.400> a<00:00:53.550> color<00:00:53.790> I<00:00:53.879> know<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.360> white<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:55.379> way<00:00:55.500> I

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
with a color I know is white that way I

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.960 
with a color I know is white that way I
can<00:00:55.739> be<00:00:55.860> sure<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.070> can<00:00:56.309> make<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> appropriate

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
can be sure I can make the appropriate

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:06.320 
can be sure I can make the appropriate
parts<00:00:57.210> transparent

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.290 

you

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.580 

next<00:01:14.300> I'll<00:01:14.420> crop<00:01:14.660> the<00:01:14.840> image<00:01:15.080> to<00:01:15.290> get<00:01:15.410> rid<00:01:15.560> of

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
next I'll crop the image to get rid of

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.110 
next I'll crop the image to get rid of
anything<00:01:15.890> that<00:01:16.220> I<00:01:16.280> don't<00:01:16.340> particularly<00:01:16.850> want

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
anything that I don't particularly want

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.690 
anything that I don't particularly want
in<00:01:17.510> the<00:01:17.630> spray<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:18.380> sprays<00:01:18.710> are<00:01:18.860> small<00:01:19.100> so<00:01:19.430> any

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
in the spray the sprays are small so any

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:29.070 
in the spray the sprays are small so any
wasted<00:01:20.120> space<00:01:20.330> is<00:01:20.510> not<00:01:20.660> cool

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.730 

you

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.500 

next<00:01:36.740> I<00:01:36.800> have<00:01:36.950> to<00:01:37.100> resize<00:01:37.430> the<00:01:37.670> image<00:01:37.730> into<00:01:38.420> an

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
next I have to resize the image into an

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.180 
next I have to resize the image into an
image<00:01:38.750> size<00:01:39.050> that<00:01:39.350> while<00:01:39.530> we<00:01:39.650> will<00:01:39.740> be<00:01:39.890> able<00:01:39.980> to

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
image size that while we will be able to

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.280 
image size that while we will be able to
convert<00:01:40.490> it<00:01:40.520> into<00:01:40.700> a<00:01:40.850> spray<00:01:41.180> if<00:01:42.140> you're

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
convert it into a spray if you're

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.990 
convert it into a spray if you're
wondering<00:01:42.650> what<00:01:42.800> possible<00:01:43.310> dimensions<00:01:43.790> your

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
wondering what possible dimensions your

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.150 
wondering what possible dimensions your
spray<00:01:44.300> can<00:01:44.480> be<00:01:44.630> Google<00:01:45.200> Counter<00:01:45.590> Strike<00:01:45.620> Spray

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
spray can be Google Counter Strike Spray

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.820 
spray can be Google Counter Strike Spray
size<00:01:46.430> or<00:01:47.150> something<00:01:47.600> similar<00:01:47.840> and<00:01:48.140> you<00:01:48.650> can

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
size or something similar and you can

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.190 
size or something similar and you can
find<00:01:49.040> a<00:01:49.130> table<00:01:49.400> like<00:01:49.520> this<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:50.720> dimensions

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
find a table like this the dimensions

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.380 
find a table like this the dimensions
have<00:01:51.350> to<00:01:51.410> be<00:01:51.530> divisible<00:01:51.860> by<00:01:52.070> 16<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.060> total

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
have to be divisible by 16 and the total

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.010 
have to be divisible by 16 and the total
area<00:01:53.630> needs<00:01:53.960> to<00:01:54.140> be<00:01:54.260> less<00:01:54.470> than<00:01:54.500> 14,000<00:01:55.490> pixels

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
area needs to be less than 14,000 pixels

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.300 
area needs to be less than 14,000 pixels
so<00:01:57.020> you<00:01:57.110> can<00:01:57.320> just<00:01:57.500> look<00:01:57.620> at<00:01:57.740> that<00:01:57.860> table<00:01:58.070> and

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
so you can just look at that table and

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.210 
so you can just look at that table and
find<00:01:58.580> which<00:01:59.120> one's<00:01:59.360> work<00:01:59.830> since<00:02:00.830> my<00:02:00.980> image

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
find which one's work since my image

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.560 
find which one's work since my image
looks<00:02:01.490> pretty<00:02:01.730> square<00:02:02.060> I'm<00:02:02.150> going<00:02:02.180> to<00:02:02.360> try

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
looks pretty square I'm going to try

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.450 
looks pretty square I'm going to try
first<00:02:03.050> to<00:02:03.350> resize<00:02:03.710> it<00:02:03.740> into<00:02:04.160> one<00:02:04.280> of<00:02:04.370> the

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
first to resize it into one of the

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.370 
first to resize it into one of the
pretty<00:02:04.790> square<00:02:05.120> possible<00:02:05.660> dimensions<00:02:06.110> such

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
pretty square possible dimensions such

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.840 
pretty square possible dimensions such

that will look like and how close it is

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.220 
that will look like and how close it is
to<00:02:21.620> one<00:02:21.710> of<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:21.890> possible<00:02:22.280> dimensions<00:02:23.200> when<00:02:24.200> I

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
to one of the possible dimensions when I

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.560 
to one of the possible dimensions when I
put<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.710> width<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:25.130> 112<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:26.000> height<00:02:26.180> ends<00:02:26.480> up

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
put the width to 112 the height ends up

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.400 
put the width to 112 the height ends up
at<00:02:26.690> 93<00:02:27.380> which<00:02:27.650> is<00:02:27.800> pretty<00:02:28.070> close<00:02:28.340> to<00:02:28.370> 96<00:02:29.090> and

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
at 93 which is pretty close to 96 and

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.740 
at 93 which is pretty close to 96 and
112<00:02:30.410> by<00:02:30.590> 96<00:02:31.250> is<00:02:31.520> one<00:02:31.910> of<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.060> possible<00:02:32.480> sizes

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
112 by 96 is one of the possible sizes

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.080 
112 by 96 is one of the possible sizes
so<00:02:33.680> I<00:02:33.710> will<00:02:33.890> unconstrained<00:02:34.490> the<00:02:34.580> proportion

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
so I will unconstrained the proportion

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.750 
so I will unconstrained the proportion
and<00:02:35.210> change<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.630> height<00:02:35.810> at<00:02:36.020> 96<00:02:36.620> that<00:02:37.430> way<00:02:37.580> the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
and change the height at 96 that way the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.340 
and change the height at 96 that way the
image<00:02:38.030> won't<00:02:38.210> get<00:02:38.360> too<00:02:38.540> stretched<00:02:38.900> out<00:02:39.110> either

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
different color blue and so it won't be

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.790 
different color blue and so it won't be
transparent<00:04:14.290> but<00:04:14.380> you'll<00:04:14.470> have<00:04:14.560> all<00:04:14.710> these

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
transparent but you'll have all these

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.789 
transparent but you'll have all these
random<00:04:15.190> blue<00:04:15.370> pixels<00:04:15.790> in<00:04:15.940> your<00:04:15.970> picture<00:04:16.799> it's

random blue pixels in your picture it's
important<00:04:18.220> to<00:04:18.280> do<00:04:18.400> this<00:04:18.549> step<00:04:18.790> even<00:04:19.090> if<00:04:19.210> you

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
important to do this step even if you

important to do this step even if you
don't<00:04:19.570> want<00:04:19.810> anything<00:04:20.049> transparent<00:04:20.770> in<00:04:20.860> your
