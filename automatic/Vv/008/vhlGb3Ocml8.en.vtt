00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.340
 expected hacker game in our video 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.189
 special we now deal with the 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.289
 ask in direct comparison to gta was 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.800
 Although friends may hacker title 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.800
 expect 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.530
 gta 5 offers partly plain 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.129
 Breathtaking views on the big one 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.570
 Game world and its sights

 skyscraper los santos county covers 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.770
 a huge area with different ones 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.969
 attractions and possibilities 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.090
 extensive scope is here 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.090
 motto 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.140
 In direct comparison, watchdog serves 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.120
 the motto less is more 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.189
 Although the game world is far from being 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.350
 so big, however , they tried at the 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.000
 fictional version of a large chicagos 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.909
 content density 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.770
 unlike gta 5 focused 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.479
 The designer of hot stocks he insists 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.830
 to put the devil in detail 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.479
 especially the diverse 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.330
 Architectural representation of the building 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.020
 and know the general lighting effects 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.869
 to please 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.700
 a little boisterous and funny 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.130
 By the way, detail concerns both games 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.710
 the reflections of the loading windows are 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.329
 at gta 5 like at stock stocks bare 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.590
 faÃ§ade that does not match the actual 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.590
 environment has to do 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.460
 maike trevor franklin that's just 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.080
 time the three main characters of gta 5 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.120
 and yet this already has 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.920
 Dreiergespann over enough charisma and 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.020
 a sophisticated character drawing 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.510
 the sympathy for at least one of the 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.430
 three guarantees arise 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.810
 There are many other interesting ones 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.610
 or crazy characters in the 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.380
 Gameplay with a freedom 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.050
 presented and embedded in the story 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.180
 the gta 5 will undoubtedly become the mega 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.750
 hit does it with every series 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.700
 represents dialogues action gta 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.680
 5 the medium celebrates video games 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.540
 downright and is probably what you are in 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.780
 call movie area at mega blockbuster 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.780
 would 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.410
 some are friends 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.360
 some are parts of revenge betrayal and 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.459
 intrigue is the story of hot stocks 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.630
 far from bad she gives away 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.790
 however much potential 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.620
 much is touched or even too short 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.750
 illogical the same applies to the 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.790
 characters big personalities 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.810
 does not own stocks or at least is 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.519
 not noticeable 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.930
 because of the presentation and 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.030
 character of the game remain 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.560
 motives or emotions of the digital 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.190
 actor incomprehensible and 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.440
 cool 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.549
 who would like a tear for a sexy 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.959
 character 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.070
 if the game does not manage this 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.070
 to get emotionally involved 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.010
 Vehicles in gta 5 are of course one 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.500
 important component of the game is 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.150
 car already participated in the game 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.580
 compared to the watchdog one created one 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.230
 However, the huge fleet of free and 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.730
 was designed creatively 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.430
 instead of directly to the original 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.260
 role models to keep gta 5 stand out 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.150
 by more driving pleasure from there cars 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.980
 little longer hold on easily 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.200
 drift curves and basically 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.420
 on fun are off if the card to 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.680
 The limit is now coming to the limit 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.959
 quite detailed damage model 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.440
 which also works well with the game environment 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.440
 includes 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.330
 in hot dogs , this is what the 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.090
 As play surroundings involvement 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.920
 something different arises at gta 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.500
 apply and block marks 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.260
 Do you drive these to renounced stocks 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.480
 completely reversed on such consequences 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.550
 Water hydrants shoot by the cart 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.280
 instead of gta correctly only on the 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.860
 affect highways staircases 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.720
 physically correct at gta single 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.670
 car tires while at rostocks 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.860
 just like a sloping but level one 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.630
 The cars also work in the area 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.490
 high floor are not original one holds 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.470
 However, closer than at gta 5 to the 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.720
 Real world template all cars have 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.350
 directly recognizable originals like the fiat 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.260
 500 golf gti mitsubishi evo subaru wrx 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.730
 or the range rover control the 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.740
 boliden falls slightly at workshops 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.870
 Stiffer and even if it still 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.630
 to harbor maneuvers can come 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.340
 the spectacular drama of gta 5 will be 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.810
 Rarely reached the cars drive themselves 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:40.500
 just something predictable and 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:42.570
 straightforward is only los santos county 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.580

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.920
 playground for open world pleasures and 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.840
 Sandbox joy of playing different

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.360
 mini games, numerous employments 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.280

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.310
 to drink something, etc 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.620
 the fun comes off the story 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.690
 in hot dogs especially from the npcs the 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.310

 side mission or even exciting stories 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:20.100
 can result in summary 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.590
 say openworld friends can also 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.540
 be happy with hotdogs what gta 5

 more tactical possibilities offered 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.830
 you should differentiate even more 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.110
 come up with or explicit reasons for and 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.710
 against one of the two titles expresses this 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.710
 in the comment section
