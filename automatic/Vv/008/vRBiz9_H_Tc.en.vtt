00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
hey guys so basically a startup company

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.559 
hey guys so basically a startup company
in<00:00:03.870> California<00:00:04.470> called<00:00:04.680> lead<00:00:05.009> role<00:00:05.569> basically

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
in California called lead role basically

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.280 
in California called lead role basically
they<00:00:06.750> created<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.580> camera<00:00:08.580> that<00:00:08.820> does<00:00:09.750> not<00:00:09.990> need

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
they created a camera that does not need

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.970 
they created a camera that does not need
to<00:00:10.440> be<00:00:10.469> focused<00:00:11.070> what<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:11.969> mean<00:00:12.300> this<00:00:12.570> is

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
to be focused what I mean this is

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.379 
to be focused what I mean this is
basically<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.160> mean<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.580> when<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.120> take<00:00:15.360> a

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
basically I mean is when you take a

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.080 
basically I mean is when you take a
picture<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:16.109> uses<00:00:16.740> all<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.279> light<00:00:17.580> sources

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
picture it uses all that light sources

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.450 
picture it uses all that light sources
right<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:18.900> will<00:00:19.260> never<00:00:19.560> need<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.859> focus<00:00:20.130> it

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
right so you will never need to focus it

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.830 
right so you will never need to focus it
there's<00:00:20.850> no<00:00:20.939> focus<00:00:21.359> nothing<00:00:21.630> like<00:00:21.720> that

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
there's no focus nothing like that

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.509 
there's no focus nothing like that
there's<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.350> zooming<00:00:22.710> thing<00:00:22.890> from<00:00:23.070> zoom<00:00:23.340> in

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
there's a zooming thing from zoom in

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.220 
there's a zooming thing from zoom in
obviously<00:00:24.029> but<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.660> don't<00:00:24.840> need<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.990> focus

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
obviously but you don't need to focus

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.859

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.179 
point-and-shoot cameras um with like a
zooming<00:01:42.810> feature<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.560> think<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:43.950> like<00:01:44.130> a

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
zooming feature so think of it like a

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.300 
zooming feature so think of it like a
DSLR<00:01:44.970> but<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:46.049> know<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.229> no<00:01:46.710> longer<00:01:46.920> need<00:01:47.189> to

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
DSLR but you know you no longer need to

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.179 
DSLR but you know you no longer need to
focus<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:48.170> actually<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.409> doing<00:01:49.619> me<00:01:49.740> very

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
focus it actually this is doing me very

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.830 
focus it actually this is doing me very
very<00:01:50.310> good<00:01:50.880> um<00:01:51.799> even<00:01:52.799> better<00:01:53.119> the<00:01:54.119> actual<00:01:54.299> size

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
very good um even better the actual size

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.929 
very good um even better the actual size
of<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.200> pictures<00:01:55.590> are<00:01:55.829> not<00:01:56.340> going<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.610> be<00:01:56.729> that

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
of the pictures are not going to be that

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.550 
of the pictures are not going to be that
bigger<00:01:57.420> than<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.869> current<00:01:58.110> size<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
bigger than the current size of the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.560 
bigger than the current size of the
pictures<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.070> are<00:01:59.430> normally<00:01:59.939> taken<00:02:00.390> today

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
pictures that are normally taken today

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.569 
pictures that are normally taken today
so<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.740> we're<00:02:01.829> going<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.009> be<00:02:02.070> around<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.399> same

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
so so we're going to be around the same

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.940 
so so we're going to be around the same
size<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.750> cost<00:02:04.049> for<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.350> camera<00:02:04.799> is

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
size and the cost for the camera is

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.270 
size and the cost for the camera is
going<00:02:05.159> to

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
going to

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.340 
going to
around<00:02:05.580> the<00:02:05.700> same<00:02:05.909> some<00:02:06.180> costs<00:02:07.080> with<00:02:07.290> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
around the same some costs with the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.559 
around the same some costs with the
cameras<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:08.009> are<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.399> market<00:02:08.520> today<00:02:08.819> so

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
cameras that are on the market today so

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.020 
cameras that are on the market today so
this<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.530> actually<00:02:10.950> like<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.400> pretty<00:02:11.670> nice

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
this is actually like a pretty nice

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.020 
this is actually like a pretty nice
thing<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.810> see<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:13.980> actually<00:02:14.160> being<00:02:14.520> created

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
thing to see it actually being created

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.380 
thing to see it actually being created
so<00:02:15.600> hopefully<00:02:15.810> um<00:02:16.670> when<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.790> comes<00:02:18.030> out<00:02:18.209> I'll

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
so hopefully um when it comes out I'll

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.210 
so hopefully um when it comes out I'll
got<00:02:18.660> it<00:02:18.780> I<00:02:18.900> hopefully<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.350> will<00:02:19.650> get<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.040> because

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
it's amazing technology like this is the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.570 
it's amazing technology like this is the
best<00:02:22.110> thing<00:02:22.319> to<00:02:22.440> happen<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.280> photo

industry since the evolution of the
point<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.500> two<00:02:28.680> cameras<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.250> DSLR<00:02:29.730> or<00:02:30.000> vice
