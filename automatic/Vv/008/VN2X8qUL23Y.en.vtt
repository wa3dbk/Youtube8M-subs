00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello to my subscribers and all those 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.340
 who will be my subscribers in the future 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.440
 I want to share this video 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.990
 why i choose exactly soviet 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.719
 the bike here they are modern 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:20.640
 multi-speed first here such 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:23.189
 will lead a dozen criteria for their choice 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.560
 before the first is its so-called not 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.349
 ugonyaemost rather not even something that is not 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.560
 Minimum percentage 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.739
 Ugoney here's an example of this Soviet 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.160
 people can see him 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:45.510
 he never drove me by the way 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:48.539
 But on such a castle to 90 pedophile only 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.370
 tried to eat it but in the end not 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.570
 perk 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.329
 what moment for example are people buying 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.190
 modern bikes that immediately 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.070
 buy these attacks bed darling 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.890
 expensive locks you chose for 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.680
 dawn is literally almost 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.430
 Belarusian bike there do not use 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.340
 it does not hang this million or 500 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.070
 that is, such a lull can be bought 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.630
 for the same money 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:24.090
 that is, you will have less cost for 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:28.080
 me and here is an important factor redeemed 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.440
 so socks the lock cut article when 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.220
 going out let's say 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:37.580
 examples there I do not know the store yes I do 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.760
 don't worry about being stolen so on 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:45.830
 that is, no problem and what I want 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.270
 notice it nice before the example from here 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.090
 from the glove compartment for what 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.590
 and is visited it does not twist the mirror 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.020
 do the same code too 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.770
 twisted by the way I had what was 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:04.100
 all my time and to put one of the reasons 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:08.179
 someone needed 2 xx main plus 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:12.680
 then its not ugonyaemost ie you are no longer 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:16.550
 worried about his safely droid 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.570
 its such an important point as both 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.350
 here is the durability of its assembly or 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:27.080
 examples too tired for a day carriage 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:33.110
 front and I probably don't change them 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:36.560
 already good years probably 82 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.660
 although I very often go on bicycle 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.840
 modern that there are constantly all the streets 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.840
 that is, or there were me friends, that is, this 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.709
 constantly here these investments depart in 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.650
 repair and spare parts so on so on 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.720
 3 points that I want to say it myself 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.550
 low cost of all spare 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.020
 parts 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.440
 especially here on the market when you can 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:03.320
 to get there even a blok there are 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:09.250
 normal for parts it is not worth arch 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:12.140
 kopecks minimum in spare parts 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:17.180
 still want to say such a point as comfortable 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:19.640
 design for driving now 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.910
 represents why i like 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:27.709
 design for example here throw 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:30.019
 tried to see the roll on the straight up here 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.120
 these many speed in modern 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.690
 you will get tired and so 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.940
 further live here do not appeal blow 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.180
 hold on I never know my hands 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.130
 never tired or let's say 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.680
 which is more convenient for me 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:49.790
 one here the other here somehow him so 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:56.960
 it is more convenient to see such a moment 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:04:00.920
 Convenience to such a steering will go away 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.870
 something like this and here yet 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.930
 such an item I want to say what that 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.590
 minimal content of it minutes ago 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.270
 this 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.890
 I'm sorry I stopped the video here 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.650
 with such as no so -called not 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:19.520
 cirrhosis citizens he passed so well 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.720
 then back to the chain but now we are almost not 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.940
 could have for them the outstanding 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.460
 occasionally when it's already hidden there 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.160
 signal that is, I have already explained why in 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.260
 past video 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:34.120
 even a thing to do is kill their mutations that 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:36.850
 smearing it if you ride this type 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:43.090
 distance does not follow yours. rides 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:46.360
 and I think so but you yourself are 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:49.570
 it is an idiot in our stirrups bike 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:54.010
 until then there should be for any there is 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:56.070
 quite a bit already and there this one 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.530
 chain design 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:02.680
 detached that you need to lubricate what else I want 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:06.250
 say pin on this type of soviet on 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.320
 4 and firstly she herself wears out 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.890
 much smaller then there is this here 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.830
 dishes in the modern compartment there and coins 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:18.160
 fly and the chains themselves are not all there transmission 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:22.360
 so on there a lot of problems here allow 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.480
 the cost of cents I want to say by 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.510
 brakes 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:31.180
 can be from Lebanese why in this in the very 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.070
 bike in modern there by disk 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:37.510
 this azarov broke hands somewhere in 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:39.040
 hike everything in this has not yet done these 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.040
 tied in the back and 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:45.540
 vase have bicycles up to 71 brake 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:48.340
 you have taken advantage of these 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:51.400
 such a stock but there is an option 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:54.190
 also here is a plus so yes and let them 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:58.170
 such an important factor as 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:00.840
 reliability well for example here you are 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:08.470
 modern secret up so in fall 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:11.560
 it is unfortunate that you these panties so on 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:14.590
 all this is necessary to buy coins then 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.660
 for two there is nothing to break just now 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.630
 the only thing that can be 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:22.960
 evolve before but stop 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:26.080
 again, I personally in what I was in accidents 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:29.350
 I personally did not break anything 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.770
 reliability one hundred percent he does not break and 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.850
 so to speak and in this very same 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.940
 modern then you can transmission 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:41.020
 break down and so on a bunch of problems this 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:44.500
 the extra cost but also the circuit has not even 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.180
 an act so important modern 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.180
 bike ride 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:52.780
 we ga speed protection can not be 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:55.090
 here you can test the protection 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:59.020
 dirt from cat anything 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:07:01.570
 why are you the most here I do not put 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.900
 because sometimes i have this 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:08.050
 chain times I changed and everything is much easier 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.490
 need to shoot there or by the way 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.310
 what to see better what I want 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:16.720
 say about me to this for and 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.960
 the workers' rate gem is reading 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.550
 Hall 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:23.139
 Belarusian manufacturers leave here 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:26.289
 brackets and so removable goes 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:30.900
 a basket once went somewhere in 

00:07:26.289 --> 00:07:35.910
 the store took the food put off 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:42.070
 here you can once again good luck 

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:45.160
 buy some extra right there 

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:46.690
 sight before small there will be there 

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.509
 Potato rosturizme 

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:52.449
 and so on, that is, there are some advantages everywhere 

00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:55.810
 pros and signs in political so 

00:07:52.449 --> 00:07:58.120
 long no so what I wanted to say about 

00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:01.330
 my wookieepedia why i choose 

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:05.289
 here is a Soviet-made bicycle 

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:08.169
 what do I like in general so to everyone 

00:08:05.289 --> 00:08:11.760
 like my video like and 

00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:11.760
