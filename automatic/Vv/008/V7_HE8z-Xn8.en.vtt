00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.710
 I'm still waiting for you 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.910
 because I know you will come back for me 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.349
 entered here just to give me the big ride 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.779
 a little paws because since you have me 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.629
 made the really interminable then 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.110
 has climbed oh no you can not have 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:39.269
 forgot about me it can't be so yes 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.430
 I am sure that in a moment he will be from 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:45.269
 new here I sit on the edge of the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.670
 street and waiting for you 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:51.360
 I'm afraid of cars going like this 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.650
 fast but I try to think of you and the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:59.129
 our games and good times wait 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.180
 maybe I knew that tomorrow morning 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.780
 you came back to get me 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.780
 hey hey 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:25.200
 three days have passed and I am still 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:29.570
 here I am dying of hunger pain 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.570
 thirst for soligo 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:38.729
 yet I know you'll come back and resist in 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:43.560
 a sign of my faith because you are not 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:47.610
 you can be bad my eyes not 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:53.460
 see farther only follow the 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:56.270
 beat of my heart tired track for 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.270
 stop 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:07.460
 so I fell asleep one last time and 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:11.860
 forever thinking why I was born if 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.860
 no one had ever really wanted to
