00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:08.160
 4 3 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:11.659
 no wonder the money has been the head coach at the 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:12.540
 law enforcement 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.159
 at the beginning of 2007 he also feels the hare of departing tenants 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:21.130
 as a player, the midfielder came out for clubs like Haarlem has English effect 

00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:25.549
 un roda jc and fc groningen and worked as an assistant at ado and roda 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.349
 atteveld tells how he prepares his team for a competition 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.060
 yes if normally preparing is what you are first 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.160
 look back to the owner the last game you own 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.150
 played and then especially looks at your own children what is a good thing there 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.860
 gone 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.370
 and what went less well the design could be improved 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.030
 They will go over mid-week and look at the coming opponent 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.810
 the competition lasted 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.180
 jogg city waiting 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.130
 watching the first part from that moment watching what 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.710
 the opponent has what we are with 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.950
 in possession of the ball, residents knew of the opponent doing what in the 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.950
 switching moments as they call it in the field of football 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.950
 and that last piece is actually euro had to get our country piece one 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.000
 bit the red cross has how can we our the quality has the best 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.150
 utilize in the match with the upcoming opponent 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.260
 well who always goes as far as possible from your own strength from only you can 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.720
 never implement in your own battle plan if not count to 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.840
 the opponent 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.280
 so you tried neutralizing what the power of the opponent was 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.240
 and that you are prepared for or calculated that you will not be surprised 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.320
 actually the whole 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.540
 happen how you look at an opponent after you are not surprised 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.920
 but also an opponent trains again the next week to the last 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.610
 against and will have worked on their 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.680
 Lesser things owners and restrictions they are good at we have improved 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.890
 so they too can give us 2 surprises for some how you come 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.460
 tries to make it as clear as possible for the players what kind of quality they have 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.150
 his house yes compared to our qualities where then maybe now 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.070
 the problems and where can we get for our profit 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.690
 it became a larger part 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.089
 just look at what you have in house and 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:12.089
 and cannot yet use agent 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.789
 of course the vulture in advance we get the lineup from the opponent 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:22.339
 then you look or 6 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:25.429
 will play formation that I once had in mind 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:30.049
 and in the a few more things that you go through with the players of my course one 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.739
 he therefore stays with him on one of the charging points 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.589
 and it finally organized for the first time we try 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:40.129
 such a good feeling measurement data preference to be interpreted 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.969
 and then forward as feeling good have a lot of confidence outside 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:47.069
 sometimes gone wanting to live up to techniques with young players 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:49.889
 who should be able to get something 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.499
 the rest is just a kind that they trust in myself 

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:55.559
 they are never in the team for nothing that means that you have the qualities 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:57.169
 I believe we have it 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:00.409
 and that trying to transfer it back to head you play 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.819
 yes we have a number of strong holders in the team for two years with two Jan postma 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.839
 this one of marcel meeuwis is the trigger 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:07.919
 in tactics 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:11.319
 and they sit a bit not decision making we are natural 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.169
 euros the technical staff end up properly taking that decision or themselves 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:18.399
 but it is nice for us to know what the players think and 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.959
 for them it is nice that you give them the feeling that they can think along and 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:22.989
 that they are one of them 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.989
 an important pawn 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.099
 in the preparations I have the best that you have to do a lot of rituals 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.299
 player actually the groningen that i 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.299
 enter with niklaas as the man who is the players home 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:47.449
 but sandwich with peanut butter and sprinkles packed and the botanical match 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:48.819
 two parts will be wrong 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.319
 cup of coffee and that was actually the only one who wanted to return 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.829
 feyenoord and mvv actually not 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.419
 and as a trainer and ex 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:01.109
 as a player was always known as a physical who regularly made a cheese 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:01.819
 grabbed 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.939
 as a coach stands remarkably calm along the sidelines 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:09.700
 well that is greeted because you I notice that if you are there as the seventh 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:13.230
 we jump that players pay more attention to you than to the field 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.340
 as a coach and it is trying that you had to achieve so that 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.000
 you must also try at a number of moments and no, sister is trying like that 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.160
 You try to convey JANSMA, she also tries to get rid of disappointment 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.180
 get lifting 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.099
 but then it must also remain but have the function and 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:32.289
 beforehand it had more the function for myself that I come to the menu cicruit 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:36.219
 then that it is a function for the players out and now again I am that far in it 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:39.219
 that had more to the players of az 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.679
 from here you can experience the competition nowadays you have a roof over their heads 

00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:51.289
 so that's nice 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.249
 rotterdam there is a lot of experience in the netherlands 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:55.210
 and 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.469
 can have a good overview 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:02.749
 yes you are now very different then you often experience rossi playing 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:03.409
 stuff 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:06.949
 I found for myself that I still wash quite a lot to live in 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.129
 in the opponent 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:13.229
 and you take as a player trainer you are busy with the whole team and that is a bigger one 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:14.080
 whole 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.180
 we can no longer be responsible councilor is also logical of course 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.520
 an ever more extensive one has become 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.229
 but you must be careful that your door does not 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.710
 she was completely filled with information 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.529
 he also needs a piece 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:30.739
 because so yasmine being intuition is purely about preparing them
