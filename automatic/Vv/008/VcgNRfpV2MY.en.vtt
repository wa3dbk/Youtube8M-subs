00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:09.650
 so dear people i am back and in 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:12.679
 This video is a short food substitute 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.330
 As a substitute a short feedback about it 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.490
 I will clear this product now 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.680
 test because my order is straight 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:25.490
 has arrived and now in this video 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:28.099
 it means yes what is this product and 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.220
 Although that is now for credit to eat 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.290
 protein me that's pretty much in america 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.300
 known and I just wanted it 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.490
 Try it because I'm the fender of 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.320
 I'm pretty much mobile to eat 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.390
 pretty much on the go so on the go 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.610
 one side because products as possible 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.050
 packed in 30 gram pack are like that 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.940
 that I shaker for one or the other 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.070
 simply the protein needed to cover 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.930
 as well as here that is an appeal 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.930
 send 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:59.150
 sunrise premier and short expression that 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.350
 This product made of matt in the park like 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:05.720
 believe health aging is already difficult 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.630
 tray-pcs campus in the range of protein 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.930
 ready - the tent on the cooking 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.140
 theologian freixenet became auto need for 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.760
 any artificial so this product wants 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.360
 extra does not seem artificial and it wants 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.370
 simply this exactly 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.470
 the problematics describe it many 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.910
 stop on the way and do not always have the 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.800
 possibility to eat that's why there is 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:33.980
 this nutritional supplement or milatz and 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.290
 the brief information on the energy balance 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.720
 so we have 100 here accordingly 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:44.030
 always calculated as a percentage 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.390
 Of the 135 kilocalories, 19 percent 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.510
 fat 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.830
 Unfortunately we have first, unfortunately 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.370
 that's often the case with them 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.470
 products 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.909
 but I hope the taste will 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.270
 remove again accordingly 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.770
 we have four grams of sugar protein at 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.390
 13 percent 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.310
 and since I think it's a 300 gram 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.229
 Pack is accordingly times 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:08.030
 we have almost 39 37 from 40 percent 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.020
 have a protein a bit salt 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.959
 we also have it in there 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.760
 and everything else then 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.140
 again on he basis with brown rice 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.770
 does not sound like it 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.170
 bad at 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.459
 how it all turns out to be the same 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.739
 I'll look at it all 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.989
 heat up and then eat and then test 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.920
 give judgment so choose this product in 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.989
 this fabled microwave card 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.450
 and I can warm up a bit 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.519
 Let's say how it just smelled 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.350
 I was not the hit now 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.180
 but of course I do not know if that 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.670
 perhaps due to this is here 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.470
 it may explode 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.420
 conditioned by this is what's going on there 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.810
 a bit noisy I will be too 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:55.549
 out but otherwise I do not believe 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:03:00.440
 good so delicious 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:03.500
 So look at the product stopped 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.660
 not quite bad and it smells 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.170
 no longer as before so hot 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.579
 definitely different 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.060
 Of course the testing is not 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.859
 recommends nothing says or appropriate 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.000
 not so fails when even a 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.810
 product is already known 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.030
 I recommend this for Carnival 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.350
 or for other occasions for that is so 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.269
 product very good you got out of this 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.250
 a hat tinker otherwise if it 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.200
 now the taste goes on test me 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.170
 it also so I have ever spoon 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.609
 So it's similar in consistency 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.370
 as to all other products 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:40.060
 it takes a lot of getting used to like that 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.260
 consistency is very happy though 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.720
 tasted not so bad 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.530
 the chic is underneath the 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.850
 So really stir all the time and 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.209
 according to yes the gift is 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.040
 according to it of course is like 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.870
 i am a very good addon but i would 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.140
 always have a friendly fork with you 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.300
 because it breaks up pretty long 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.680
 to unmoved when I was here as 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.510
 I thought okay the fork 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.810
 survives that does not reach the sole 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.980
 let stir the delight tastes 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.450
 good in any case but what can you 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.580
 already wrong 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.950
 yes, by being salt at all 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.079
 Now the case is not send here 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.000
 pretty good and are also very good 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.850
 many chunks in it really, too 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.919
 accordingly neat and otherwise 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.200
 Of course you expect exactly what you want 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.419
 from one time within a meter 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.240
 So set alimentary replacement also 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.770
 has accordingly because it is not 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.990
 so do not eat first class food 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.010
 compare like three or four 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.340
 eat stars 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:42.040
 it should simply fulfill the purpose of micro 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:46.030
 macro nutrients accordingly think that 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.650
 Whole as protein conscious as possible 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.690
 I give this product of ten 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.640
 I give this possible points 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.440
 Products I'll say 7 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.320
 and it is really good seven products 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.870
 the typical amount just not too 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.600
 compare how to cook properly 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.270
 product here the advantage is from the 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:09.090
 price performance in any case good me 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:11.520
 I paid almost three euros for it 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.810
 Of course there are different ones 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.880
 Shoppers just the whole time 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.120
 enter in google 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:21.370
 otherwise you can definitely go in 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.320
 invest if really no other 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.540
 possibility exists otherwise it is 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.020
 no replacement what you use permanently 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.510
 can 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.430
 In this sense, I will not stop 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:34.050
 continue to serve this product and 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.050
 otherwise see us
