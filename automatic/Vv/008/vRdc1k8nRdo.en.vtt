00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
reality TV I don't believe that if a

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.280 
reality TV I don't believe that if a
camera<00:02:43.130> is<00:02:43.340> in<00:02:43.490> your<00:02:43.610> face<00:02:43.850> it's<00:02:44.330> reality<00:02:44.810> you

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
know it's not really reality if there's

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.500 
know it's not really reality if there's
a<00:02:47.300> camera<00:02:47.570> in<00:02:47.780> your<00:02:47.810> face<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:49.120> you<00:02:50.120> know<00:02:50.270> they
