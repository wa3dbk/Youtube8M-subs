00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
hairiness the pop chips so there we go

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.969 
hairiness the pop chips so there we go
so<00:01:52.530> that's<00:01:52.799> how<00:01:52.920> they<00:01:53.100> look<00:01:53.450> price-wise

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
so that's how they look price-wise

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.510 
so that's how they look price-wise
roughly<00:01:55.979> there's<00:01:56.130> always<00:01:56.250> going<00:01:56.400> to<00:01:56.460> be

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
roughly there's always going to be

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.219 
roughly there's always going to be
cheaper<00:01:56.880> because<00:01:57.060> ladies<00:01:57.600> product<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.110> know

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.500 
I believe it's gonna cost about 20 or 30
