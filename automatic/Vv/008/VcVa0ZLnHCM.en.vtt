00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.680
 watermelon jam 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.910
 it's a delicious recipe especially if 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.030
 you bought a watermelon 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.830
 unpleasant wholesale so tracking month for 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.370
 have this delicious recipe of 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.370
 jam 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.450
 the 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.000
 so to make this jam I 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.210
 cleaned the watermelons I removed all 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.090
 the grains and I cut them in dice I 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.990
 go weighing and I'm going to weigh half 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.240
 of his weight on the pier and let 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.150
 turn macerate for two hours or 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.150
 well one night the weight of the expenses she 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.390
 made 3 kg so I did not add over 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.440
 a kilogram and a half of sugar then 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.450
 add sugar 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.110
 I'll leave like this for two 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.970
 hours or a whole night 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.960
 here you can see how are 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.140
 pieces of watermelons 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.170
 after a night marinating with sugar 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.259
 I will add a little lemon juice 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.040
 a little butter and a few grains of 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:47.310
 bad yen and i'm going to cook in 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.740
 a pot with a thick bottom at the beginning I 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.630
 cook on high heat 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.660
 because watermelons have rejected 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.290
 a lot of water and after I decrease the 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.300
 fire for my jam 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.490
 no I added some butter for 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.380
 avoid the white foam that is going to 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.220
 form at the top of the jam 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.459
 I put a little grain of bad yen and 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.350
 there I have frozen lemon juice from a 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.060
 account is the season of the site range I 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.989
 always keep juice and I put it in 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.790
 freezer 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.420
 here I think that my jam and 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.269
 retreat it's been almost an hour of 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.180
 cooking over high heat so I'm going to test 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.850
 it's jam is ready and for 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.030
 that I will pour some liquid 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:38.250
 in a plate 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:41.910
 if it will freeze a little bit 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:45.420
 so my jam is ready 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.420
 you see 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:56.760
 see how you see it's a little 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.650
 thick so I can stop cooking at 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.239
 this stage if no I leave a little bit 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.549
 if you like that the source of the 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.220
 jam are still a little faster s 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.439
 you can cook again 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.859
 few minutes there that my jam is 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:14.579
 ready I will fill but a lot of 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:16.939
 jam that I washed and I was gone 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:22.440

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:24.780
 scalded I will fill this job and 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.310
 then I will close it and put it on 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.260

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:34.620

 tight and I put sugar 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:44.849
 often in this way and I leave 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.030
