00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
questions down I overheard people were

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.100 
questions down I overheard people were
asking<00:01:50.520> install<00:01:51.000> time<00:01:51.300> like<00:01:51.810> how<00:01:51.930> long<00:01:52.050> does

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
asking install time like how long does

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.510 
asking install time like how long does
it<00:01:52.260> take<00:01:52.410> me<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.740> like<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.250> know<00:01:53.340> if<00:01:53.430> I

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
it take me to in like you know if I

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.340 
it take me to in like you know if I

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
ordered the kit I guess I probably

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.230 
ordered the kit I guess I probably
depend<00:01:55.800> on<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:55.980> model<00:01:56.370> but<00:01:56.550> it<00:01:56.850> depends<00:01:57.180> on
