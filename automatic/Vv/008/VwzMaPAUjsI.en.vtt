report on these this type of food
storage<00:00:26.609> stuff<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.230> stuff<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.499> we

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
storage stuff this is the stuff that we

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.579 
storage stuff this is the stuff that we
took<00:00:28.919> with<00:00:29.189> us<00:00:29.460> for<00:00:29.910> food<00:00:30.289> because<00:00:31.289> on<00:00:31.439> the

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:31.589 
took with us for food because on the

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:35.240 
took with us for food because on the
bikes<00:00:32.150> weight<00:00:33.150> was<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> real<00:00:33.660> issue<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.500> volume

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
bikes weight was a real issue and volume

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.400 
bikes weight was a real issue and volume
was<00:00:35.400> an<00:00:35.550> issue<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.060> so<00:00:36.210> we<00:00:36.360> just<00:00:36.570> thought<00:00:36.780> this

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
was an issue and so we just thought this

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.670 
was an issue and so we just thought this
would<00:00:37.620> be<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.920> best<00:00:38.160> way<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.430> go<00:00:39.379> you<00:00:40.379> know<00:00:40.500> and

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
would be the best way to go you know and

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.930 
would be the best way to go you know and
then<00:00:40.770> obviously<00:00:40.920> where<00:00:41.370> we<00:00:41.489> were<00:00:41.579> going<00:00:41.760> there

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
then obviously where we were going there

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.069 
then obviously where we were going there
was<00:00:42.059> always<00:00:42.180> going<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.420> be<00:00:42.449> plenty<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.809> water

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
was always going to be plenty of water

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.209 
was always going to be plenty of water
and<00:00:43.350> that's<00:00:43.469> really<00:00:43.620> all<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.859> need<00:00:43.980> to

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
and that's really all you need to

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.650 
and that's really all you need to
prepare<00:00:44.370> these<00:00:44.730> things<00:00:44.969> as<00:00:45.120> boiling<00:00:45.300> water

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
prepare these things as boiling water

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.400 
prepare these things as boiling water
and<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.800> was<00:00:46.949> our<00:00:47.070> plan<00:00:48.109> like<00:00:49.109> many<00:00:49.289> of

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
and so that was our plan like many of

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.229 
and so that was our plan like many of
you<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.559> put<00:00:49.829> these<00:00:49.949> this<00:00:50.730> type<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:50.940> food

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
your system is going to freak out a

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.909 
your system is going to freak out a
little<00:04:08.659> bit<00:04:08.900> when<00:04:09.109> you<00:04:09.199> first<00:04:09.409> start<00:04:09.680> eating

little bit when you first start eating
the<00:04:10.040> soly<00:04:11.560> so<00:04:12.560> you<00:04:12.680> know<00:04:12.739> you're<00:04:12.829> going<00:04:12.949> to

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
the soly so you know you're going to

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.089 
the soly so you know you're going to
have<00:04:13.099> that<00:04:13.220> little<00:04:13.579> transitional<00:04:14.359> point

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
have that little transitional point

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:17.379 
have that little transitional point
where<00:04:16.099> your<00:04:16.250> systems<00:04:16.729> figuring<00:04:17.120> out<00:04:17.239> what<00:04:17.359> to

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
where your systems figuring out what to

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.300 
where your systems figuring out what to
do<00:04:17.599> with<00:04:17.630> it<00:04:17.900> now<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.440> other<00:04:18.620> thing<00:04:18.739> is<00:04:19.039> is

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
do with it now the other thing is is

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.250 
do with it now the other thing is is
that<00:04:19.459> you<00:04:19.699> know<00:04:19.820> like<00:04:20.299> this<00:04:20.510> package<00:04:20.930> here<00:04:21.139> it

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
that you know like this package here it

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.590 
that you know like this package here it
says<00:04:21.440> it's<00:04:21.650> for<00:04:21.919> adult<00:04:22.370> servings<00:04:22.940> okay

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
says it's for adult servings okay

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.760 
says it's for adult servings okay
and<00:04:24.800> so<00:04:25.800> if<00:04:26.100> one<00:04:26.430> person<00:04:27.120> eats<00:04:27.570> us<00:04:27.870> her<00:04:28.050> package

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
and so if one person eats us her package

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.520 
and so if one person eats us her package
he's<00:04:29.040> going<00:04:29.190> to<00:04:29.280> get<00:04:29.400> 840<00:04:30.360> calories<00:04:30.810> now

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
he's going to get 840 calories now

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.520 
he's going to get 840 calories now
riding<00:04:32.010> the<00:04:32.250> bike<00:04:32.460> I<00:04:32.730> list<00:04:33.060> that<00:04:33.270> as<00:04:33.450> light<00:04:33.930> to

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
riding the bike I list that as light to

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.760 
riding the bike I list that as light to
maybe<00:04:35.310> moderate<00:04:36.180> physical<00:04:36.660> activity<00:04:37.110> and

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
maybe moderate physical activity and

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.010 
maybe moderate physical activity and
there<00:04:38.400> was<00:04:38.550> no<00:04:38.730> we're<00:04:39.030> on<00:04:39.210> vacation<00:04:39.360> there<00:04:39.870> was

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
there was no we're on vacation there was

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.080 
there was no we're on vacation there was
no<00:04:40.170> stress<00:04:40.620> really<00:04:40.920> involved<00:04:41.460> very<00:04:41.760> little

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
no stress really involved very little

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.900 
no stress really involved very little
stress<00:04:42.420> and<00:04:43.010> so<00:04:44.010> obviously<00:04:44.160> if<00:04:44.490> you're<00:04:44.670> in<00:04:44.760> a

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
stress and so obviously if you're in a

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.060 
stress and so obviously if you're in a
disaster<00:04:45.690> situation<00:04:45.720> an<00:04:46.530> emergency

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
disaster situation an emergency

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.700 
disaster situation an emergency
situation<00:04:47.540> your<00:04:48.540> physical<00:04:48.750> activities<00:04:49.500> going

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
situation your physical activities going

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.460 
situation your physical activities going
to<00:04:49.800> probably<00:04:49.980> be<00:04:50.160> pretty<00:04:50.580> high<00:04:50.880> and<00:04:51.470> your

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
to probably be pretty high and your

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.410 
to probably be pretty high and your
stress<00:04:53.010> is<00:04:53.370> going<00:04:53.550> to<00:04:53.610> be<00:04:53.700> high<00:04:53.880> and<00:04:54.150> both<00:04:54.390> of

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
stress is going to be high and both of

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.270 
stress is going to be high and both of
those<00:04:54.660> are<00:04:54.810> going<00:04:54.840> to<00:04:54.990> require<00:04:55.230> your<00:04:55.440> body<00:04:55.770> to

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
those are going to require your body to

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.370 
those are going to require your body to
take<00:04:56.490> in<00:04:56.640> more<00:04:56.820> calories<00:04:57.020> which<00:04:58.020> these<00:04:58.200> are

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
take in more calories which these are

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.780 
take in more calories which these are
not<00:04:58.530> going<00:04:58.710> to<00:04:58.830> really<00:04:58.950> provide<00:04:59.430> unless

not going to really provide unless

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.410 
not going to really provide unless
you're<00:05:00.000> eating<00:05:00.390> more<00:05:00.960> of<00:05:01.410> these<00:05:02.280> a<00:05:02.310> day<00:05:02.520> and

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
you're eating more of these a day and

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.270 
you're eating more of these a day and
that's<00:05:03.660> what<00:05:03.840> ended<00:05:04.140> up<00:05:04.230> happening<00:05:04.290> with<00:05:05.250> us

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280
