00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 welcome to a small 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.130
 first impression video of a year 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.299
 half hour I have the xbox 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.000
 event involved 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.340
 That's when the xbox one became very proud 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.650
 presented and all yes all things do 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.150
 so now she can and has been at the very end 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.850
 then stop a trailer presented by 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.529
 call of duty ghost and yes I will you 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.240
 Now some info to call a few 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.380
 Impressions of me a small opinion 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.820
 but not the fierce trailer 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.220
 analysis like for example in black ops 2 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.420
 or in mw3 I'm simply honest 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.789
 said not to have realized so much 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.160
 trailer there is really no longer dark 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.870
 was too fast and sometimes too 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.920
 may not use the material 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.180
 that's why only a few here 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.620
 screenshots to be seen 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.910
 but let's start the normal anja 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.930
 new forces called call of duty 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.280
 Ghosts and it will be just such a 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.649
 history has that such a big one 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.860
 team has what is made up of elite soldiers 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.140
 from different groups and the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.910
 has to fight against the big bad thing 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.579
 not really called yet 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.980
 In any case, opel has seen that it 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.899
 gives a new engine and am with the bin 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.070
 i partly convinced as i do not have to 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.750
 For example, they show honestly 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.090
 the one behind looks very nice new 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.820
 york nice or show it then 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.159
 this black man here for me 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.570
 looks like a back guy from mw2 for 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.430
 so not unconvincing example 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.610
 or mp3 then show then 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.869
 in turn, as the building collapses 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.850
 looks really cool, I have to say 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.229
 but then see you in the next scene 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.750
 we come to the water like the water then 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.490
 she is now not sooo cool off after 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.009
 and no idea we say so 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.720
 Trainer the trailer shows graphics moderately 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.400
 a few things where that really nice 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.840
 looks like a scene where it is so dark 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.009
 is in the jungle and then you see lens 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.210
 flares and so it looks 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.240
 actually not that bad 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.700
 but then again an explosion 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.040
 which I from mw2 the trailer kennedy the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.259
 Explosion looks like 1 1 almost like that 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.610
 the wii 2 trailer or out 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.990
 There is the motto for three days under 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.950
 also a scene from the trader so out 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.320
 the big trailer 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.240
 the incredible of a scene from mw3 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.450
 i have to see if that is ok 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.890
 screenshots but we will well 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.360
 see, wait and drink tea 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.750
 somehow the right keyword here 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.079
 there is a leader or an author of the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.209
 because I can not do that 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.580
 pronounce I think but there is the 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.110
 has the films yes or was the author of 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.670
 make the movie and she is rihanna 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.200
 Maybe some of you know me 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.080
 black ops 2 also gave the here from 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.560
 the dark knight series , the author 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.120
 from here by batman trilogy because 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.220
 so now I finally have it 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.930
 See how story becomes moderate on everyone 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.420
 case I found a few points funny where 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.280
 They said so two new ones 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.780
 features we will shoot you purely 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.700
 here in this presentation, that's all 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.800
 before they have to tailor shown 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.459
 namely that there are dynamic maps 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.160
 will be where there are so destructible doors 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.980
 will fall and again wild life 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.050
 So you live on animals and stuff like that 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.940
 the kind and you soja dynamic maps 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.989
 we had everything somehow 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.670
 So I do not know in black ops 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.349
 celebration's this one have threatened abo 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.390
 we also have dynamic water, etc 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.610
 I wish I wish I actually 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.140
 that finally say if the engine 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.670
 it really is that she too 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.769
 destructible objects finally on 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.200
 can show that we are not always that 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:11.370
 same have the one in b4 or bf3 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.170
 complete house goes down while in mw3 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.780
 Gradmann window broke 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.090
 Well, in any case, they have too 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.519
 said that is a multiplayer 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.110
 character customization will be where 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.849
 that then will be that one is 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.159
 can adjust what a helmet is 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.269
 what s.richard seeber what i contribute 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.530
 say I thought then automatically 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.540
 okay, I'm in the pink helmet 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.700
 take red pants and a blue shirt 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.799
 Let's see if you still do not want to 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.030
 recognizes there in the bushes no idea 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.860
 anyway, if I think that's funny 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.010
 call that the two big ones 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.810
 features there what then yes one 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.129
 had a big focus was the dog 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.590
 that's how they got it right 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:49.620
 so your compagnie is new pro 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.420
 so to speak and how they say this here for 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.959
 the first time in the franchise system 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.280
 Jugene but the very first time in 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.260
 the story of call of duty you have 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.439
 Now a dog as a friend and he will 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.629
 to protect a team of four terrorists 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:05.400
 he will sniff and bomb 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.069
 other things not so yeah okay then 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.209
 it will be as dramatic as it is now 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.830
 For this reason, they also have a big one 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.800
 focus grabbed the trailer so always 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.720
 really dramatic a man 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.459
 stands with his dog you have too 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.010
 said that they are more dramaturgy more 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.870
 infuse emotions into the characters 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.310
 They do not want to be that flat 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.330
 appear as they are always bare 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.920
 I have to say honestly when I am 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.900
 then see something like there was for example 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.790
 it 110 in the trailer or type me right 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.650
 lifeless to look where I'm so good 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.910
 not feel she has no fear for it 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.930
 no big cans with that sometimes 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.700
 thought so that's why in any case 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.970
 will it be so for the 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.860
 xbox user that yes that with kinect 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.410
 also so voice commands can do so 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.820
 you can regulate something with your voice 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.740
 I do not know yet in what supply 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.740
 but that was already confirmed 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.810
 and well that's the way they are 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.520
 very first info just so shown again 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.900
 also been in the trailer and before that too 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.240
 announced in the presentation 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.780
 are and I have to say quite honestly 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.670
 totally, everything does not flash me no that 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.930
 not but you can not do it now 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.220
 satisfied because the whole but too early 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.210
 that's why we do not have any gameplay yet 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.190
 We do not know how 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.660
 multiplayer will be we do not know 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.710
 how the game can play because of it 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.150
 you are actually only a picture 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.010
 make it if you have the game or 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.720
 if you borrowed it somehow beforehand 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.490
 has or on the e3 will then 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.030
 they have shown a lot of content 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:25.700
 said and I'm very curious 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.380
 yes and I hope you too and that 's it 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.480
 then as first of a spontaneous 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.910
 first opinion video or first impression 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.690
 video of me and me personally and me 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.690
 hope we will see us
