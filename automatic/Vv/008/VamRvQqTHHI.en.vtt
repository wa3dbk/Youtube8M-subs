coffee<00:00:07.319> table<00:00:07.440> that<00:00:07.919> we<00:00:08.040> really<00:00:08.280> liked<00:00:08.429> but

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
coffee table that we really liked but

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.370 
coffee table that we really liked but

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
tables that you like but why not

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.700 
tables that you like but why not
repurpose<00:00:12.389> something<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:13.259> make<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.590> into

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
repurpose something and make it into

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.010 
repurpose something and make it into
something<00:00:13.799> really<00:00:14.400> unique<00:00:14.610> that<00:00:15.540> nobody<00:00:15.570> else

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
something really unique that nobody else

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.810 
something really unique that nobody else
has<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.529> that's<00:00:16.740> what<00:00:16.890> we<00:00:16.980> did<00:00:17.010> here<00:00:18.590> these<00:00:19.820> the

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
has so that's what we did here these the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.990 
has so that's what we did here these the
the<00:00:21.240> bottom<00:00:21.539> part<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.930> coffee<00:00:22.230> table<00:00:22.740> is

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
the bottom part of the coffee table is

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.730 
the bottom part of the coffee table is
actually<00:00:24.000> two<00:00:24.750> end<00:00:25.430> tables<00:00:26.840> that<00:00:27.840> were<00:00:28.560> from

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
actually two end tables that were from

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.240 
actually two end tables that were from
the<00:00:28.890> 1970s<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:30.510> they<00:00:30.840> actually<00:00:30.990> were<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:32.130> know

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
the 1970s so they actually were you know

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.479 
the 1970s so they actually were you know
either<00:00:32.940> in<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.360> living<00:00:33.540> room<00:00:33.660> or<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.500> bedroom<00:00:35.340> I'm

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
either in a living room or a bedroom I'm

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.180 
either in a living room or a bedroom I'm
not<00:00:35.610> really<00:00:35.790> sure<00:00:36.140> my<00:00:37.140> neighbor<00:00:37.380> was<00:00:37.770> moving

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
not really sure my neighbor was moving

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.630 
not really sure my neighbor was moving
and<00:00:38.309> she's<00:00:39.059> older<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.450> she<00:00:40.190> decided<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.520> she

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
and she's older and she decided that she

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.479 
and she's older and she decided that she
wanted<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.059> get<00:00:42.120> rid<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.329> them<00:00:42.620> so<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.190> bottom

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
wanted to get rid of them so the bottom

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.940 
wanted to get rid of them so the bottom
part<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.879> made<00:00:45.480> out<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.629> solid<00:00:45.870> wood<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.500> has<00:00:46.739> a

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
part is made out of solid wood and has a

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.020 
part is made out of solid wood and has a
draw<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:48.530> these<00:00:49.530> were<00:00:49.739> actually<00:00:50.100> two

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
draw and these were actually two

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.930 
draw and these were actually two
separate<00:00:51.559> tables<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.829> what<00:00:53.340> we<00:00:53.460> did<00:00:53.670> was<00:00:53.730> we

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
separate tables and what we did was we

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.000 
separate tables and what we did was we
put<00:00:54.329> them<00:00:54.480> together<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.559> bottom<00:00:55.710> part

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
put them together so the bottom part

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.560 
put them together so the bottom part
actually<00:00:56.280> looks<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:56.789> one<00:00:56.969> piece<00:00:57.180> but<00:00:57.449> it

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
actually looks like one piece but it

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.990 
actually looks like one piece but it
wasn't<00:00:58.370> originally<00:00:59.370> one<00:00:59.520> piece<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.910> was

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
wasn't originally one piece it was

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.869 
wasn't originally one piece it was
actually<00:01:00.300> two<00:01:00.600> two<00:01:01.410> end<00:01:01.559> tables<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.190> they<00:01:02.670> had

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
actually two two end tables and they had

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.969 
actually two two end tables and they had
a<00:01:02.910> different<00:01:03.359> type<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.719> top<00:01:04.260> on<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.559> which<00:01:04.830> was

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
a different type of top on it which was

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.390 
a different type of top on it which was
like<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.159> particle<00:01:05.549> board<00:01:05.850> type<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.180> top<00:01:06.390> and

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
like a particle board type the top and

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.789 
like a particle board type the top and
you<00:01:08.400> know<00:01:08.520> was<00:01:08.760> nasty<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.330> was<00:01:09.479> just<00:01:09.770> you<00:01:10.770> know

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
you know was nasty it was just you know

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.580 
you know was nasty it was just you know
you<00:01:10.920> could<00:01:11.130> tell<00:01:11.250> us<00:01:11.280> from<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.610> 1970s<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:12.590> what

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
you could tell us from the 1970s so what

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.490 
you could tell us from the 1970s so what
we<00:01:13.680> decided<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.220> do<00:01:14.430> was<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:15.390> join<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.320> two

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
we decided to do was to join the two

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.070 
we decided to do was to join the two
tables<00:01:16.890> together<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.549> as<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.600> see<00:01:18.630> there

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
tables together and as you can see there

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.770 
tables together and as you can see there
join<00:01:19.320> right<00:01:19.500> there<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.830> middle<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.780> all

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
join right there in the middle and all

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.749 
join right there in the middle and all
we<00:01:21.990> had<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.140> do<00:01:22.350> was<00:01:22.530> cut<00:01:22.770> off<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.340> front<00:01:23.580> and

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
we had to do was cut off the front and

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.330 
we had to do was cut off the front and
the<00:01:23.850> back<00:01:23.880> legs<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.780> were<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.040> center

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
the back legs that were in the center

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.240 
the back legs that were in the center
right<00:01:26.490> there<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:27.470> you<00:01:28.470> know<00:01:28.619> sand<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.100> down<00:01:29.130> a

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
right there and you know sand it down a

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.620 
right there and you know sand it down a
little<00:01:29.490> bit<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.850> now<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.150> looks<00:01:30.240> like<00:01:30.360> one

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
little bit so now it looks like one

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.630 
little bit so now it looks like one
piece<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.259> can't<00:01:31.560> even<00:01:31.619> tell<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.220> it

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
piece so you can't even tell that it

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.580 
piece so you can't even tell that it
actually<00:01:32.790> was<00:01:33.090> two<00:01:33.450> different<00:01:33.960> separate

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
actually was two different separate

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.980 
actually was two different separate
tables<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.189> then<00:01:35.850> we<00:01:35.939> took<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.240> well<00:01:36.780> first

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
tables and then we took the well first

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.530 
tables and then we took the well first
we<00:01:37.110> took<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.380> tops<00:01:37.619> off<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.299> which<00:01:39.299> they

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
we took the tops off of it which they

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.999 
we took the tops off of it which they
was<00:01:39.689> screwed<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.380> was<00:01:40.470> really<00:01:40.590> easy<00:01:40.740> to

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
was screwed on so it was really easy to

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.039 
was screwed on so it was really easy to
just<00:01:41.460> take<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.729> off<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.570> then<00:01:42.720> we<00:01:42.810> had<00:01:42.930> to

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
just take that off so then we had to

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.469 
just take that off so then we had to
create<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.530> top<00:01:43.950> for<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.850> what<00:01:45.119> we<00:01:45.240> did<00:01:45.420> was

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
create a top for it so what we did was

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.990 
create a top for it so what we did was
we<00:01:45.720> got<00:01:46.110> these<00:01:46.470> from<00:01:46.829> home<00:01:47.040> depot<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.700> these

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
we got these from home depot and these

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.350 
we got these from home depot and these
are<00:01:48.149> like<00:01:48.299> planks<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.869> wood<00:01:49.970> so<00:01:50.970> they<00:01:51.180> just

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
are like planks of wood so they just

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.420 
are like planks of wood so they just
come<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:52.259> don't<00:01:53.009> know<00:01:53.159> what<00:01:53.369> the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
come like that I don't know what the

top so that's what we did and then what
we<00:01:59.880> did<00:02:00.060> was<00:02:00.240> we<00:02:00.420> connected<00:02:00.869> them<00:02:00.990> together<00:02:01.409> so

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
we did was we connected them together so

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.520 
we did was we connected them together so
there's<00:02:02.460> four<00:02:02.700> pieces<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.689> wood<00:02:03.869> we<00:02:04.140> cut<00:02:04.380> them

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
there's four pieces of wood we cut them

there's four pieces of wood we cut them
to<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.920> size<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.659> the<00:02:06.659> table<00:02:06.860> so<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.890> know<00:02:08.190> we

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
to the size of the table so you know we

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.880 
to the size of the table so you know we
measured<00:02:08.700> how<00:02:09.300> long<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:09.720> table<00:02:10.709> would<00:02:10.830> be

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
measured how long this table would be

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.369 
measured how long this table would be
and<00:02:11.310> made<00:02:12.120> sure<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.599> you<00:02:12.930> know<00:02:13.050> we'd<00:02:13.230> have

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
and made sure that you know we'd have

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.880 
and made sure that you know we'd have
some<00:02:13.530> over

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
some over

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.440 
some over
right<00:02:14.160> there<00:02:14.370> as<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:16.560> can<00:02:16.710> see<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.220> so<00:02:18.150> then

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
right there as you can see and so then

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.870 
right there as you can see and so then
we<00:02:18.600> put<00:02:18.780> them<00:02:18.900> together<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.760> painted<00:02:20.760> them

we put them together and painted them

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.410 
we put them together and painted them
painted<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.959> pieces<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.380> wood<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.910> we<00:02:23.910> use<00:02:24.090> I

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
painted the pieces of wood and we use I

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.120 
painted the pieces of wood and we use I
believe<00:02:24.690> we<00:02:24.840> use<00:02:24.959> just<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.319> spray<00:02:25.590> paint<00:02:25.830> like<00:02:26.040> a

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
believe we use just a spray paint like a

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.490 
believe we use just a spray paint like a
chocolate<00:02:26.610> brown<00:02:26.880> spray<00:02:27.810> paint<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.200> make<00:02:28.350> it

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
chocolate brown spray paint to make it

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.040 
chocolate brown spray paint to make it
nice<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.830> easy<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.280> then<00:02:29.940> over<00:02:30.090> that<00:02:30.390> once

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
nice and easy and then over that once

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.010 
nice and easy and then over that once
that<00:02:31.200> was<00:02:31.260> dry<00:02:31.500> we<00:02:31.709> put<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.250> clear<00:02:32.910> coat<00:02:33.240> of<00:02:33.480> like

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
that was dry we put a clear coat of like

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.760 
that was dry we put a clear coat of like
a<00:02:34.050> satin<00:02:34.560> or<00:02:35.160> matt<00:02:35.959> polyurethane<00:02:36.959> so<00:02:37.350> that<00:02:37.530> it

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
a satin or matt polyurethane so that it

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.680 
a satin or matt polyurethane so that it
would<00:02:37.890> get<00:02:38.070> protected<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:38.730> when<00:02:38.820> chip<00:02:39.209> off<00:02:39.420> or

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
would get protected and when chip off or

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.330 
would get protected and when chip off or
anything<00:02:39.870> like<00:02:39.989> that<00:02:40.110> so<00:02:40.830> that's<00:02:41.100> exactly

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
anything like that so that's exactly

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.120 
anything like that so that's exactly
what<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.850> looks<00:02:42.030> like<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.800> it<00:02:43.800> kind<00:02:44.069> of

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
what it looks like and it kind of

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.650 
what it looks like and it kind of
reminds<00:02:44.430> me<00:02:44.550> of<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.850> little<00:02:44.940> bit<00:02:45.150> like<00:02:45.270> a<00:02:45.300> picnic

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
reminds me of a little bit like a picnic

reminds me of a little bit like a picnic
table<00:02:46.020> but<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.410> little<00:02:47.070> more<00:02:47.250> modern<00:02:47.880> and<00:02:48.270> chic

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
end table is quite short these were

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.319 
end table is quite short these were
short<00:03:38.700> and<00:03:38.870> tabled<00:03:39.870> so<00:03:40.049> obviously<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:40.799> know

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
short and tabled so obviously you know

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.830 
short and tabled so obviously you know
it<00:03:42.329> was<00:03:42.720> it's<00:03:43.049> vintage<00:03:43.470> so<00:03:43.860> it's<00:03:43.980> it's<00:03:44.310> smaller

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
it was it's vintage so it's it's smaller

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.330 
it was it's vintage so it's it's smaller
maybe<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:45.989> beds<00:03:46.170> were<00:03:46.260> smaller<00:03:46.620> back<00:03:46.890> then<00:03:46.920> or

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
maybe the beds were smaller back then or

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.920 
maybe the beds were smaller back then or
whatever<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.970> living<00:03:48.180> room<00:03:48.329> furniture<00:03:48.480> so

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
whatever the living room furniture so

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.930 
whatever the living room furniture so
that's<00:03:49.079> why<00:03:49.200> it's<00:03:49.829> not<00:03:49.950> that<00:03:50.250> tall<00:03:50.489> so<00:03:50.730> we

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
that's why it's not that tall so we

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.449 
that's why it's not that tall so we
could<00:03:51.090> use<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.269> as<00:03:51.450> a<00:03:51.510> coffee<00:03:51.870> table<00:03:52.100> but<00:03:53.100> yeah

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
could use it as a coffee table but yeah

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.900 
could use it as a coffee table but yeah
this<00:03:53.790> is<00:03:53.850> exactly<00:03:54.390> what<00:03:54.780> I<00:03:54.810> what<00:03:55.170> we<00:03:55.260> did<00:03:55.470> and

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
this is exactly what I what we did and

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.509 
this is exactly what I what we did and
let<00:03:56.910> me<00:03:57.000> give<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.269> like<00:03:57.510> a<00:03:57.540> different<00:03:57.930> angle

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
let me give you like a different angle

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.340 
let me give you like a different angle
it's<00:03:59.519> you<00:03:59.910> know<00:04:00.000> a<00:04:00.030> nice<00:04:00.329> size<00:04:00.630> it's<00:04:01.079> pretty

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
it's you know a nice size it's pretty

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.949 
it's you know a nice size it's pretty
wide<00:04:02.030> you<00:04:03.030> just<00:04:03.239> got<00:04:03.360> to<00:04:03.390> be<00:04:03.480> careful<00:04:03.600> if<00:04:03.870> you

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
wide you just got to be careful if you

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.020 
wide you just got to be careful if you
have<00:04:04.049> children<00:04:04.260> because<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:05.190> corners<00:04:05.610> can<00:04:05.880> be

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
have children because the corners can be

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.509 
have children because the corners can be
sharp<00:04:06.630> so<00:04:07.530> if<00:04:07.739> anything<00:04:07.980> you<00:04:08.190> could<00:04:08.340> round

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
sharp so if anything you could round

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:09.740 
sharp so if anything you could round
them<00:04:08.730> off<00:04:08.910> we<00:04:09.180> didn't<00:04:09.360> round<00:04:09.510> them<00:04:09.630> off

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
them off we didn't round them off

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.990 
them off we didn't round them off
because<00:04:09.840> I<00:04:10.019> like<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.310> square<00:04:11.310> design<00:04:11.549> of<00:04:11.880> it

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
because I like the square design of it
