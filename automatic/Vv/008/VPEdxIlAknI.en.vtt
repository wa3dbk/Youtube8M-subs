00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.620
 friends you have morning lucio study 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.020
 pierri federica riccio and staff all 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.580
 today we eat in simplicity because 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.620
 maybe one day it's a beautiful day 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.389
 only I do when I go there 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.460
 I go a little to the sea but even if I don't 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.509
 I have to dive into the sea I go to 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.850
 look so i make a nice one 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.670
 spilled with friends for when 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.619
 He decides to go out to eat do 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.420
 a lunch ordering a la carte 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.949
 certainly the simplicity rewards but 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.949
 especially when when it takes when 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.170
 the fish is fresh which is why they are arrested 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.329
 at the lighthouse fresh fish but we must 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.860
 explain why what happens there 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.050
 evening at a certain time 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.059
 down the steps of marechiaro after 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.460
 we say to close around one o'clock 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.129
 night all retire with fishermen 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.410
 them 1 and we buy fresh fish there 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.920
 they carry beginning type from these 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.140
 prawns lobsters sea bream a bit of 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.420
 huge fish and then there is nothing 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.059
 better than the prawn is fresh 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.280
 eat it in total simplicity then 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.649
 today we teach you chef claudio 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.379
 capasso will teach you to cook gods 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.780
 very simple spaghetti with prawns 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.320
 to be able to do them are necessary 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.600
 fresh prawns garlic parsley salt 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.729
 cherry tomatoes and linguine because the tongue 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.350
 in steel in the follow we already have 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.100
 home to earn a moment of time 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.320
 obviously paste cooking the pasta 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.530
 let's go to coordinate we add a 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.990
 little oil our leading edge 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.229
 unfortunately because the fish therefore goes alone 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:36.610
 thank you must be cooked only with garlic is 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:41.260
 a daughter and then we roll brown 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:44.110
 the prawns just like that 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.330
 two minutes because room less painful 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:52.480
 the less the brand newer is more 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:57.780
 tasty and is already a bit of parsley po 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:02:03.250
 of salt and for people the linguine cook 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:05.110
 in the passing of time it seems that yes 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:10.570
 will approach to price we do not reach a 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:12.490
 we have some very important cherry tomatoes 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.739
 watched discussed over this is its own 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:22.660
 a typical dish to order one 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:25.870
 bari for 1 place claudio for the hours of 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.630
 sensations gentlemen this terrace that 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.270
 see behind us reproduced the 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.040
 you will find real abroad but 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.350
 certainly one of the places and of the 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.060
 most enchanting locations in Naples 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.760
 so what you will find here escapes me 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.440
 ready to welcome you the dish is almost 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.799
 ready or we go lure 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.799
 linguine facing away millions have been 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.150
 browned with parsley in the other 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.180
 we have freed some water from the 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.750
 peace for pasta that takes time to 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.750
 mix everything together 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.280
 some more parsley and mix well 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:19.790
 two seconds more the dish is ready 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:28.980
 here it is and then prayer 10 10 9 8 7 6 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:32.040
 5 to 4 seconds chef 4 3 2 1 0 we have 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.190
 still the jailer mixed up format 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.320
 television bit of confusion 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.950
 so obviously we first have the 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:53.400
 linguine or on the bottom and then all the 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:56.060
 other ingredients really nor a bit of 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.060
 scooters 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:04.320
 here is the linguine on the piano 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.780
 fresh Veronese from the restaurant at 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.350
 I am facing my yields like 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.299
 heavy to connect in heavy taste 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.010
 consistency because then I want to say 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:18.140
 appearance to do so also abounds 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.140
 forces don't even eat this silvia
