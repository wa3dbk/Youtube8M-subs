00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:11.690
 The work to restore the so- called red brick station to its original appearance about 100 years ago is almost over 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:18.580
 The 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:24.520
 Prior to the grand opening on the 1st of a month, Kusunsha was released to the press 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:28.630
 What was released was the 1914 Taisho 3 year of its opening at the time of its opening 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:31.750
 Located in the dome roof station building and station building on the north and south sides 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:36.280
 Tokyo Station Hotel 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:40.840
 We set service counter for foreigners in dome on the north side 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:46.400
 English and China also offer travel advice in Korean 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:50.210

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:59.930
 Station gallery revives 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:08.400
 The bricks and steel frames of the wall, etc. use the ones at the time the Marunouchi station building was made 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:11.730
 The black burnt between the bricks was burned in the air raid of May 1945, 1945. 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:16.620
 Even now if you touch with your finger charcoal will be during the war 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:21.090
 I can see that Tokyo Station was burned down by air raid 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:26.220
 The hotel sector is the most watched in this restoration 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:29.330
 Most of the upper part of the building is the hotel area, which has not been used before 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:35.320
 Was transformed into a room 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:38.960
 Located in the center of the building, this Royal Suite is 800,000 yen per night 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:42.729

 And what's on it 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:52.650
 The lounge of this hotel is located in the middle of the building of Tokyo Station 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:57.350
 It is that before this lounge regained was used as delivery date 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:02:00.760
 On the other hand , rooms were set up in the newly created part 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:05.380
 Where there is a round window on the top floor of the building 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:09.340
 This place like attic beer has only one bedroom 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:14.590
 It is a maisonette suite of 200,000 yen per night 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:18.430
 You can see the former Tokyo central post office and Marunouchi from the round window 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:22.870
 It is a room that seems to be popular with women 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:29.470

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:39.260
 We introduce the latest building technology such as seismic isolation of the building instead 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:45.160
 I can see parts of history and new life 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.160
 Grand opening of Tokyo Station Marunouchi Station building is one day next month
