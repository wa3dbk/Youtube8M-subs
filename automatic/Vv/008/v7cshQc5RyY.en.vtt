frame nuke body in a deep configuration

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.160 
frame nuke body in a deep configuration
and<00:00:22.500> if<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.740> are<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.730> deep<00:00:24.180> frame<00:00:24.539> beekeeper

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
and if you are a deep frame beekeeper

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.410 
and if you are a deep frame beekeeper
you<00:00:25.830> want<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.189> add<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> shim<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.970> about<00:00:27.180> two

inches to the bottom of it increase the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.279 
inches to the bottom of it increase the
height<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.029> little<00:00:30.390> bit<00:00:30.480> so<00:00:30.660> there's<00:00:30.990> plenty<00:00:31.140> of

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
height a little bit so there's plenty of

little weight in the side of it and you

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.390 
little weight in the side of it and you
open<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.930> up<00:01:22.110> like<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.650> where<00:01:22.920> your<00:01:23.100> frame

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
open it up like so where your frame

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.490 
open it up like so where your frame
would<00:01:23.640> sit<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.270> here<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.960> happens<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.380> be<00:01:25.470> a

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
deep and you can see that there's not

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.050 
deep and you can see that there's not
that<00:01:28.080> much<00:01:28.290> distance<00:01:28.560> at<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.340> bottom<00:01:29.670> it's

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
that much distance at the bottom it's

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.380 
that much distance at the bottom it's
dark<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.780> inside<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.350> painted<00:01:31.710> black<00:01:32.390> so

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
dark on the inside is painted black so

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.539 
dark on the inside is painted black so
it<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.600> keep<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.960> as<00:01:34.170> much<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.979> their<00:01:35.189> natural

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
it you keep it as much to their natural

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.910 
it you keep it as much to their natural
state<00:01:35.820> as<00:01:36.240> possible<00:01:36.479> well<00:01:37.170> when<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.439> go<00:01:37.590> into

simplest<00:03:38.489> thing<00:03:38.819> to<00:03:38.849> do<00:03:39.120> is<00:03:39.329> just<00:03:39.510> simply

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:39.689 
simplest thing to do is just simply

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:50.800 
simplest thing to do is just simply
close<00:03:40.109> this<00:03:41.389> close<00:03:42.389> your<00:03:42.629> lid<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.139> your<00:03:43.620> hinge

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.920 

is<00:03:51.470> modified<00:03:52.190> where<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:52.819> rod<00:03:53.120> can<00:03:53.420> be<00:03:53.450> taken

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
is modified where the rod can be taken

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.370 
is modified where the rod can be taken
out<00:03:54.110> of<00:03:54.410> the<00:03:54.560> hinge<00:03:55.690> now<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.780> lid<00:03:57.050> comes

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
out of the hinge now the lid comes

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.300 
out of the hinge now the lid comes
completely<00:03:57.860> off<00:03:59.319> set<00:04:00.319> it<00:04:00.440> to<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.680> side<00:04:00.920> and

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
completely off set it to the side and

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.070 
completely off set it to the side and
take<00:04:01.580> this<00:04:01.760> rod<00:04:02.060> the<00:04:02.300> best<00:04:02.480> thing<00:04:02.690> to<00:04:02.720> do<00:04:02.870> is<00:04:02.959> to

take this rod the best thing to do is to

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.809 
take this rod the best thing to do is to
stick<00:04:03.319> it<00:04:03.440> in<00:04:03.500> the<00:04:03.620> ground<00:04:03.860> so<00:04:04.130> you<00:04:04.190> don't<00:04:04.430> step

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
stick it in the ground so you don't step

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.520 
stick it in the ground so you don't step
on<00:04:05.000> it<00:04:05.150> and<00:04:05.270> bend<00:04:05.480> it<00:04:05.599> that's<00:04:06.020> the<00:04:06.140> worst<00:04:06.319> thing

we're finding out that stress is an

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.620 
we're finding out that stress is an
extreme<00:04:30.500> part<00:04:31.070> of<00:04:31.340> a<00:04:31.910> lot<00:04:32.090> of<00:04:32.210> the<00:04:32.270> problems

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
extreme part of a lot of the problems

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.600 
extreme part of a lot of the problems
with<00:04:32.720> CCD<00:04:33.260> and<00:04:33.290> everything<00:04:33.889> else<00:04:34.100> in<00:04:34.340> some

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
with CCD and everything else in some

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.790 
with CCD and everything else in some
cases<00:04:34.850> it's<00:04:35.120> a<00:04:35.240> trigger<00:04:35.600> to<00:04:35.960> whatever<00:04:36.169> the

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
cases it's a trigger to whatever the

cases it's a trigger to whatever the
problem<00:04:37.220> is<00:04:37.360> it's<00:04:38.360> always<00:04:38.900> gonna<00:04:39.080> have<00:04:39.320> stress

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
problem is it's always gonna have stress

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.280 
problem is it's always gonna have stress
hanging<00:04:40.010> in<00:04:40.130> the<00:04:40.220> background<00:04:41.050> keep<00:04:42.050> your

hanging in the background keep your
