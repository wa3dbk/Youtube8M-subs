is<00:02:16.090> what<00:02:16.240> we're<00:02:16.390> going<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.540> do<00:02:16.690> for<00:02:16.900> Minecraft

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
is what we're going to do for Minecraft

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.260 
is what we're going to do for Minecraft
so<00:02:18.190> basically<00:02:18.580> there<00:02:18.730> are<00:02:18.760> these<00:02:18.910> different

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
so basically there are these different

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.170 
so basically there are these different
protocols<00:02:19.840> out<00:02:20.020> there<00:02:20.260> for<00:02:20.590> certain<00:02:21.310> headsets

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
protocols out there for certain headsets

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.740 
protocols out there for certain headsets
like<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:23.290> track<00:02:23.620> I<00:02:23.830> are<00:02:24.070> like<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.210> oculus

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
like the track I are like the oculus

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.880 
like the track I are like the oculus
rift<00:02:25.840> um<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:27.690> those<00:02:28.690> are<00:02:28.900> basically<00:02:29.200> special

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
rift um and those are basically special

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.820 
rift um and those are basically special
protocols<00:02:30.490> that<00:02:30.990> talk<00:02:31.990> to<00:02:32.290> their<00:02:32.530> specific

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
protocols that talk to their specific

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.580 
protocols that talk to their specific
headsets<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:33.910> when<00:02:34.510> people<00:02:34.870> design<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.230> game

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
headsets and when people design a game

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.850 
headsets and when people design a game
they<00:02:36.250> can<00:02:36.490> configure<00:02:36.970> their<00:02:37.360> game<00:02:37.690> to<00:02:38.440> use

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
they can configure their game to use

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.830 
they can configure their game to use
those<00:02:39.280> specific<00:02:39.520> protocols<00:02:40.480> for<00:02:40.720> those

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
those specific protocols for those

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.040 
those specific protocols for those
specific<00:02:41.080> headsets<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.940> really<00:02:43.450> neat<00:02:43.690> part

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
specific headsets the really neat part

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.220 
specific headsets the really neat part
about<00:02:44.170> that<00:02:44.620> is<00:02:45.010> that<00:02:45.630> so<00:02:46.630> if<00:02:46.870> you're<00:02:47.020> playing

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
about that is that so if you're playing

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.560 
about that is that so if you're playing
like<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:47.470> first-person<00:02:48.010> shooter<00:02:48.250> say<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:49.150> your

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
like a first-person shooter say and your

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.920 
like a first-person shooter say and your
character<00:02:50.020> is<00:02:50.140> holding<00:02:50.470> a<00:02:50.560> gun<00:02:51.660> your<00:02:52.660> head

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
character is holding a gun your head

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.070 
character is holding a gun your head
tracking<00:02:53.350> where<00:02:53.830> you<00:02:54.010> look<00:02:54.570> doesn't<00:02:55.570> affect

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
tracking where you look doesn't affect

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.020 
tracking where you look doesn't affect
where<00:02:56.500> you're<00:02:56.740> pointing<00:02:57.250> your<00:02:57.280> gun<00:02:57.610> so<00:02:57.880> your

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
where you're pointing your gun so your

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.450 
where you're pointing your gun so your
head<00:02:58.390> moves<00:02:58.720> independently<00:02:58.990> of<00:02:59.890> where<00:03:00.250> you're

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
head moves independently of where you're

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.140 
head moves independently of where you're
pointing<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:03.190> that<00:03:03.580> requires<00:03:04.000> some

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
pointing and and that requires some

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.000 
pointing and and that requires some
extra<00:03:04.600> programming<00:03:05.050> to<00:03:05.350> be<00:03:05.440> able<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.710> get<00:03:05.860> that

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
extra programming to be able to get that

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.640 
extra programming to be able to get that
to<00:03:06.250> work<00:03:06.490> but<00:03:07.270> for<00:03:07.870> games<00:03:08.140> that<00:03:08.380> don't

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
to work but for games that don't

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.000 
to work but for games that don't
natively<00:03:09.250> support<00:03:10.060> head<00:03:10.510> tracking<00:03:11.140> you<00:03:11.830> can

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
natively support head tracking you can

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.980 
natively support head tracking you can
still<00:03:12.280> simulate<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.300> head<00:03:13.510> tracking<00:03:13.920> by<00:03:14.920> um

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
still simulate the head tracking by um

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.949 
still simulate the head tracking by um
basically<00:03:16.990> making<00:03:17.650> it<00:03:17.830> so<00:03:18.070> that<00:03:18.480> you<00:03:19.480> moving

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
basically making it so that you moving

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.100 
basically making it so that you moving
your<00:03:20.140> head<00:03:20.410> is<00:03:20.709> equivalent<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:22.209> moving<00:03:22.720> your

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
your head is equivalent to moving your

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.280 
your head is equivalent to moving your
mouse<00:03:23.350> cursor<00:03:23.770> so<00:03:24.670> it<00:03:24.959> even<00:03:25.959> though<00:03:26.140> it

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
mouse cursor so it even though it

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.199 
mouse cursor so it even though it
doesn't<00:03:26.440> give<00:03:26.680> you<00:03:26.770> that<00:03:26.800> sort<00:03:27.250> of<00:03:27.459> you<00:03:28.030> can

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
doesn't give you that sort of you can

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.699 
doesn't give you that sort of you can
look<00:03:28.390> in<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.630> different<00:03:28.810> spot<00:03:29.350> than<00:03:29.380> you're

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
look in a different spot than you're

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.070 
look in a different spot than you're
pointing<00:03:30.190> type<00:03:30.520> of<00:03:30.670> thing<00:03:30.850> like<00:03:31.030> a<00:03:31.180> game

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
pointing type of thing like a game

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.930 
pointing type of thing like a game
that's<00:03:32.320> actually<00:03:32.770> set<00:03:32.950> up<00:03:32.980> to<00:03:33.220> use<00:03:33.400> virtual

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
that's actually set up to use virtual

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.480 
that's actually set up to use virtual
reality<00:03:34.540> is<00:03:34.720> it's<00:03:34.990> still<00:03:35.650> a<00:03:35.709> really<00:03:36.280> cool

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
reality is it's still a really cool

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.840 
reality is it's still a really cool
experience<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:38.190> playing<00:03:39.190> Minecraft

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
experience and playing Minecraft

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.050 
experience and playing Minecraft
especially<00:03:40.780> in<00:03:40.959> 3d<00:03:41.650> with<00:03:42.250> this<00:03:42.820> Google

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
especially in 3d with this Google

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.370 
especially in 3d with this Google
cardboard<00:03:43.390> headset<00:03:43.750> is<00:03:44.170> pretty<00:03:44.590> cool<00:03:44.940> so

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
cardboard headset is pretty cool so

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.590 
cardboard headset is pretty cool so
there's<00:03:47.380> a<00:03:47.500> couple<00:03:47.709> of<00:03:47.950> different

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
there's a couple of different

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.370 
there's a couple of different
applications<00:03:49.600> and<00:03:49.720> stuff<00:03:49.959> that<00:03:50.140> you're<00:03:50.260> going

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
applications and stuff that you're going

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.720 
applications and stuff that you're going
to<00:03:50.440> need<00:03:50.590> to<00:03:50.739> download<00:03:50.890> I'm<00:03:51.310> going<00:03:51.520> to<00:03:51.580> show

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
to need to download I'm going to show

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.300 
to need to download I'm going to show
you<00:03:51.760> what<00:03:52.090> I<00:03:52.120> think<00:03:52.239> is<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:53.050> simplest<00:03:53.860> set<00:03:54.160> up

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
you what I think is the simplest set up

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.160 
you what I think is the simplest set up
using<00:03:57.310> a<00:03:57.370> program<00:03:57.700> called<00:03:57.730> into<00:03:58.420> game<00:03:58.630> VR

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
using a program called into game VR

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.530 
using a program called into game VR
that's<00:03:59.590> basically<00:04:00.040> designed<00:04:00.670> specifically

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
that's basically designed specifically

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.840 
that's basically designed specifically
to<00:04:01.690> implement<00:04:02.320> virtual<00:04:02.709> reality<00:04:03.340> in<00:04:03.520> games

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
to implement virtual reality in games

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.479 
to implement virtual reality in games
that<00:04:04.090> don't<00:04:04.450> natively<00:04:05.410> support<00:04:06.040> virtual

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
that don't natively support virtual

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.910 
that don't natively support virtual
reality<00:04:07.110> and<00:04:08.110> we're<00:04:08.230> also<00:04:08.350> going<00:04:08.500> to<00:04:08.560> be<00:04:08.680> using

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
reality and we're also going to be using

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.090 
reality and we're also going to be using
this<00:04:09.040> minecraft<00:04:09.910> mod<00:04:10.209> called<00:04:10.540> minecraft

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
this minecraft mod called minecraft

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.580 
this minecraft mod called minecraft
which<00:04:12.100> is<00:04:12.280> this<00:04:12.690> minecraft<00:04:13.690> mod<00:04:14.170> that<00:04:14.470> was

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
which is this minecraft mod that was

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.590 
which is this minecraft mod that was
basically<00:04:14.920> designed<00:04:15.220> to<00:04:15.760> make<00:04:15.940> Minecraft

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
basically designed to make Minecraft

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.220 
basically designed to make Minecraft
compatible<00:04:17.260> with<00:04:17.410> the<00:04:17.500> oculus<00:04:17.650> rift<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:19.570> even

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
compatible with the oculus rift and even

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.230 
compatible with the oculus rift and even
though<00:04:20.350> we're<00:04:20.530> not<00:04:20.560> going<00:04:20.859> to<00:04:20.890> be<00:04:21.010> able<00:04:21.609> to<00:04:21.850> use

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
though we're not going to be able to use

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.680 
though we're not going to be able to use
the<00:04:22.870> actual<00:04:23.410> virtual<00:04:24.250> reality<00:04:24.789> functions<00:04:25.360> in

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
the actual virtual reality functions in

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
the actual virtual reality functions in
that

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
that

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.340 
that
um<00:04:26.770> in<00:04:27.580> that<00:04:27.639> program<00:04:28.240> because<00:04:28.660> we<00:04:29.110> don't<00:04:29.289> have

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
um in that program because we don't have
