00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:17.750
 Welcome with their new edition of my iPhone and I this one 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:20.970
 long, very long, it is already back that the last episode next 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.519
 with the other van der sar 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.089
 Wasmeier did not work out much better but of course there is mine 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:31.119
 Age I continue to do a very frugal accomplishment 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.880
 and I'm excited about it today has a new issue 11 here too 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.420
 Present and it is a Super Super Super App the values ​​of the last 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.310
 6 to 8 weeks 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.370
 per barrel used daily 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.300
 it's about them on the market 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.140
 no other device anymore which team will do it as the iPad around it 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.280
 Watching it has the perfect size 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.389
 Lyon easy good Ako 

00:00:56.389 --> 00:01:00.189
 and theoretically you can take it anywhere with you Watch the video 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.770
 You also want to be on the couch or in bed 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.050
 on the terrace or in the hammock is super to watch videos 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.790
 The shortcoming was there but always the videos in the right format 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.100
 had to bring and how Enke and animals 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.350
 and it took again levich Charlene merged then dropped the program 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.740
 Sammer was quite stupid just to impress the formats 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.400
 because iTunes had to be there for the reason Siren it was not somehow 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.340
 like that 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.030
 AR that was comfortable with spontaneously because it plays on it 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.299
 it bothered me a lot of talker so somehow short form but ten 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.320
 Hours train ride stood 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.350
 Ott days as I wanted to watch but nothing I wanted to see 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.080
 with the format was 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.050
 Hefti was nothing to look at or look like I just now these wars 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.130
 Normally, unsupported formats avoid both Doc and Doc 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.710
 I'm there 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.840
 Looked at different EPS while the 5 looked at four of them are pretty 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.700
 miserable 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.950
 had almost given up hope but the app I have now is 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.030
 Great 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.010
 and plays all possible harvest mines very quite a lot 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.720
 Video formats on the iPad though they officially do not support the field we 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.539
 look further at the program called ORF also closer HD 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.190
 and now he gives several points I em-norm some exploration and the same 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:15.989
 I can see that I can always do Eddersheim with folders and Overweight 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:16.989
 not completely full 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.349
 but I see how we are in Faro 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.719
 the FSV 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.839
 and also Barbie MKV up wife 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:27.629
 everything possible if every employee 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.360
 As the most common and coolest I want that the World Cup was open there is Windows 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.389
 Media Video Format 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.160
 here again and look around to see if he 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.950
 we want to come in here and look at each other 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.950
 if it actually happens yes it does 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:48.859
 it may be more on his from my very first lectures perhaps 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:49.529
 not everyone 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:52.779
 should next to Tor but to large companies give lectures on the subject 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:56.059
 It should be something like this, it was one of my first I received this at the telecom 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:59.459
 there is also that if that new WMV 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.209
 running 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.209
 Great nationwide, I want to have one 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:08.730
 Here I had to adapt in my presentation on a video that in the 

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:10.330
 Background it is further 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.430
 it dip WMV format 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.579
 I also go great on the iPad 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.349
 At some point we have to go again the previous day 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.860
 To serve many many more times at the Tinners would be another option 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:25.719
 been attentive and here she had taken care of coded anyway 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.789
 I can remember the flight many features can be so cool filters 

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:31.769
 apply 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.769
 Percent for what that should be good because they work 

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:38.069
 is not here again 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.599
 the program also supports subtitles under defend titles 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:42.839
 if you have some 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:46.839
 I can let me view the file information and here 

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:48.699
 turn on European 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:52.569
 4 I can make the video faster that it plays faster 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.419
 up to double speed because it works too 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.269
 slowing down for them 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.269
 and I can be very important with these Beleites 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.799
 and 10 seconds forward 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:08.839
 why could 

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:11.839
 five jump 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:16.949
 Percent the program automatically detects the aspect ratio you can 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:18.590
 however, fit like mans 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:19.600
 personally 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.220
 would like to have 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.540
 it's really a great thing that Dante supporters but tv-out 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.500
 So partners 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.919
 the video work you want to connect to the television to see the start height 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.139
 under 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.699
 usually not supported by Michel's form as a plain cable 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.319
 Light that van Sant and best just runs 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:39.450
 the program 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.850
 like the combo the home daughter on more options than it goes very fast 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.900
 is easy to plug into iTunes in Eichendorf and rider heart go and there 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.280
 is he then under enjoyed this case browser because I just came in 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.449
 and SPD after a few seconds impossibility 2 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:56.449
 he's all over w-lan to do that means you go here 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.630
 in the acclaim Krenz Club gives this address in his vomit at 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.710
 Computer a prerequisite, of course, must be very valuable 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.100
 and then you get there as a nice mask Norm Milley measure taken like that 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.830
 Weather Rheine 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.830
 and then transferred 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.270
 in the settings can by creaming certain-Wattens percent 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.690
 Percent resolution is but should be extensive with the subtitles and so on 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.770
 on and on 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.180
 There is also the option that there is the password protection program that means 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.509
 that you can only be as if you have a special password for that 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:35.290
 People 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.129
 The important thing is that the percentage of content that one person does not do is important 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:41.530
 Everyone should look up like this 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.569
 secret documents% secret videos percent you know 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:48.699
 and definitely wants dollars 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:51.789
 a great thing i am saying i am and that almost 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:52.979
 daily 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:54.650
 a shortcoming is if 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.590
 McGrady videos too big burden with full hd is regulated under all the 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:59.639
 must become 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:03.990
 then recognized fine that may not even synchronize the sound hundred percent 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.569
 serious 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:07.680
 so far, however, has never himself the problem yes he really has 

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:11.669
 it will always be clean even big video files 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:16.210
 by the way, 4 more FLV so not flat flat flat what he even 

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:17.250
 not together but here 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.309
 met / sda that is 

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:22.499
 The excellent here so too 

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:24.439
 you have to say 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:27.439
 the developers of these ladies super super 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:29.020
 done 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.020
 a single shortcoming Messi still concluding call Insight Health is 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.990
 it gets the incident excellent I finally got my iPhone 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.830
 Issue and use 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.520
 these search dogs of a Sennheiser Bluetooth headset here 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.330
 presented 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.960
 Bluetooth pair anyway he is just so horny so unknown that I can not help it 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.240
 see - I hope that this is great 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.839
 I'm still that 

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:52.059
 In the meantime the iPad has gotten around that when I actively put it on 

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:54.469
 Watching the iPad videos that sound 

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:57.409
 is sent from a little earlier because the bluetooth headphones at that time 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:58.240
 stage 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.080
 Erfurt filling of the mine half second percent da Red the iPad itself 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.750
 hin that then the 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.550
 Video image basically sda the age something stressed then already that we on the 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:08.720
 Headphones are there and then 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.920
 synchronously arrives with me brings the ORF on Reha HD yet but not know 

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.930
 What the half second can be but not too careful attention 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:18.809
 none 

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:19.810
 that does not fall at all 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.559
 but especially on 

00:07:21.559 --> 00:07:25.319
 only program but really all file formats to play videos app 

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:29.239
 Costs 2 Euro 39 A real bargain is cheaper than a coffee at 

00:07:29.239 --> 00:07:30.279
 Starbucks 

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:34.709
 Percent my absolute recommendation for today's episode I'm glad that 

00:07:34.709 --> 00:07:38.689
 we despite the cooling off of the time after he was last out of issue 

00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:42.279
 Once again, she was moved by Haifa and because one did not go to 

00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:45.149
 Re-election yes Brandt two to three weeks 

00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:46.360
