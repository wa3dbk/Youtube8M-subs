00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.200
 hey people welcome back at lahti 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.940
 like today I would like to be a focus 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.010
 I test myself recently brought've 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.070
 and this is a one 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.810
 Spent from the company Praktika it comes 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.960
 with the advertise 25 to 75 x 90 therefore 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.820
 and yes it costs only 140 euro just that 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.590
 means I'm not wondering now 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.480
 I do not like it at all 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.840
 big time there will be no chance 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.690
 to have 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.850
 but the money for a ko I have 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.129
 just not ready because of that 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.170
 me okay before I get in cuba 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.930
 Try it with the cheap one here 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.910
 I would like to keep it so long as I'm 30 years old 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.559
 caliber extinguisher at 300 meters in the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.280
 can recognize black and want that 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.280
 Let's try it now 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.470
 the black bag lies here in front of me 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.780
 sees that is included there is that 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.810
 spicy in it is also included 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.170
 a microfiber cloth and lens protection 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.170
 fold 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.900
 so then we pack the whole thing now 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.340
 from a few technical data 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.450
 while I get this look of the bag 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:20.630
 the spotting only weighs 1700 grams then 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.789
 as I said supply area 25 to 75 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.710
 weak I think at 75 times 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:26.140
 we have a good loss of detail 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.430
 but we'll see that soon 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:33.140
 that has coated several times 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:37.009
 lenses have a light intensity of 13 to 14 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:41.319
 the viewpoint should be watertight and yes 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.319
 it is completely rubbery wrong 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.689
 so i hope you can despite the against 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.110
 not anything seen here are 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.950
 not to see it either 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:02.640
 As I said it is from the company Praktika 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:05.130
 We have this lens 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:12.420
 number off the eyepiece is behind it 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:15.200
 Adjustment range 25 50 and 75 times leaves 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.200
 turn very easily 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.730
 we have a sheepfold area of 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.310
 ten meters to infinity is something nice 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.910
 we can screw this hold 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.519
 to solve 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:35.489
 then you can go to the spotting in the 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:39.690
 turn direction - want to have advice 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:43.410
 again sorry sorry it is gummed 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:48.150
 completely here in front we have the 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:51.390
 gigantic diameter of 90 mm and 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.250
 we have a sun visor which we completely 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.370
 just in and out can pull and 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.750
 avoid stray light 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.700
 Okay, but let's have a look 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:06.090
 which we also 300 meters at all 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:08.010
 see with it and not in spite of it 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.780
 Of course, tripod is very heavy 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.549
 through an objective through 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.190
 take pictures because you too 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.440
 basically loss of detail so in 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.540
 reality, it is sharper because of please 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.680
 I just trust you me me 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.030
 Now show the three of you easily 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.670
 images of the respective 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.989
 magnification and I'll tell you something 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.609
 I could still recognize and what 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.239
 not if you see it here on the pictures 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.239
 do not see for yourself 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.150
 at 25 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.070
 I could magnify the 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.760
 bullet holes playing in the white 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.980
 easy to recognize 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.050
 in the black I could but very 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.130
 not really recognize that now 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.600
 I say okay that's mine now 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.630
 bullet hole or not 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.730
 because with the disc anyway hard 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.800
 I have the whole thing with my iphone 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:54.030
 photographed it is clearer in reality 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.030
 as what he sows 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.310
 of the 50-fold 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.240
 100 meters I was very confident me 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.530
 I must honestly say 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.350
 had no problems 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.300
 to recognize bullet holes in the black 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.880
 that on a lightly cloudy day and 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.080
 but this weird tailor behind 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.320
 So I really could 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.850
 recognize bullet holes well 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.900
 much more detailed than it is now 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.900
 see here in the picture 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.889
 at the 75th 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.560
 larger at 300 meters distance from me 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:33.680
 personally stated that anyway 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.150
 with my eyesight that the picture with 50 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.069
 times magnification was sharper 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.240
 I also have 75 times 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:41.750
 increase the bullet holes 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.220
 but can recognize more of the picture with 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.669
 the 50 times magnification better 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.669
 like 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.030
 So as I said I have 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.159
 a wound awaits but it does 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.770
 do what it should do i could 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:02.190
 so that on 300 meters the bullet holes 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.449
 recognize it and do it in black too 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.129
 Of course, it is not comparable to 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:06.780
 already mentioned at the beginning with the curve 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:08.849
 or zeiss we had here at the 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.400
 shoot each event a copper 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:13.199
 and 1 1 still on the spot I could 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.539
 play easily at 600 meters the 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.009
 recognize bullet holes that is with the 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:17.629
 of course, not feasible here 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.830
 been 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:22.800
 but still you can say for this 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:26.009
 Price class is that praktika spective 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.979
 his money more than worth no question for 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.569
 140 euros you have a spective with 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.460
 you run 300 meters or 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:35.260
 At least one can recognize bullet holes 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.360
 the caliber in the 1930s 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.800
 For my part, I will definitely 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.980
 keep this in mind here 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.390
 the use then as long as prospectively to 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.210
 the money for a high quality 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.170
 have saved suitcases together and afterwards 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.910
 it will probably still be 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.460
 to serve the film it will and yet 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:54.790
 Bayonetta and then I can 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.680
 synonymous to longer distances film ok 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.880
 people that's it from my side me 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.380
 Hope you have the little video here 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.240
 Of course I would like myself 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.070
 Always look forward to reviews comments 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.360
 Thank you very much for seeing 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.650
 and would say so soon 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.650
