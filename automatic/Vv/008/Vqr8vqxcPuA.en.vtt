at<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.799> Coleman<00:00:08.809> fire<00:00:09.809> starter<00:00:10.349> magnesium

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
at the Coleman fire starter magnesium

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.190 
at the Coleman fire starter magnesium
fire<00:00:11.219> starter<00:00:11.389> comes<00:00:12.389> from<00:00:12.540> Walmart<00:00:12.929> comes

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
fire starter comes from Walmart comes

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.990 
fire starter comes from Walmart comes
from<00:00:13.349> pretty<00:00:13.530> much<00:00:13.650> like<00:00:13.980> any<00:00:14.370> sporting<00:00:14.820> goods

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
from pretty much like any sporting goods

wherever it's about six to seven dollars
comes<00:00:22.380> with<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.619> little<00:00:23.600> scraper<00:00:24.600> for<00:00:25.189> it<00:00:26.189> and

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
comes with a little scraper for it and

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.390 
comes with a little scraper for it and
essentially<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.570> whole<00:00:27.750> whole<00:00:28.220> idea<00:00:29.220> behind

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
essentially the whole whole idea behind

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.209 
essentially the whole whole idea behind
the<00:00:29.730> magnesium<00:00:30.119> fire<00:00:30.449> starter<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.349> couple

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
the magnesium fire starter is a couple

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.770 
the magnesium fire starter is a couple
different<00:00:32.489> parts<00:00:32.940> number<00:00:33.210> one<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.570> take<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
different parts number one you take the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.240 
different parts number one you take the
scraper<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.440> scrape<00:00:34.710> off<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.920> bunch<00:00:35.160> of

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
scraper you scrape off a bunch of

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.319 
scraper you scrape off a bunch of
magnesium<00:00:35.820> filings<00:00:36.649> and<00:00:37.649> then<00:00:38.489> on<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.210> back

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
magnesium filings and then on the back

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.790 
magnesium filings and then on the back
of<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.629> here<00:00:39.840> there's<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.110> flint<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.649> can

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
of it here there's a flint you can

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.280 
of it here there's a flint you can
actually<00:00:40.950> use<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.460> strike<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> spark<00:00:42.290> that

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
actually use to strike a spark that

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.860 
actually use to strike a spark that
ignites<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.280> magnesia<00:00:44.969> pile<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.390> magnesium

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
ignites that magnesia pile of magnesium

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.639 
ignites that magnesia pile of magnesium
filings<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.760> lets<00:00:47.760> magnesium<00:00:48.600> burns<00:00:48.809> for<00:00:49.379> a

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
filings and lets magnesium burns for a

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.439 
filings and lets magnesium burns for a
little<00:00:49.800> bit<00:00:49.950> longer<00:00:50.219> than<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:51.090> know<00:00:51.180> some

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
little bit longer than you know some

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.860 
little bit longer than you know some
tender<00:00:51.750> would<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.289> little<00:00:52.649> bit<00:00:52.829> hotter<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.879> with

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
tender would a little bit hotter so with

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.380 
tender would a little bit hotter so with
that<00:00:55.020> little<00:00:55.170> tiny<00:00:55.530> small<00:00:56.280> pile<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.820> magnesium

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
that little tiny small pile of magnesium

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.040 
that little tiny small pile of magnesium
filings<00:00:57.870> lit<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:59.250> can<00:00:59.520> coax<00:01:00.239> your<00:01:00.510> other<00:01:00.600> you

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
filings lit you can coax your other you

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.460 
filings lit you can coax your other you
know<00:01:01.079> pieces<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.859> fire<00:01:02.449> into<00:01:03.449> admission<00:01:03.899> like

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
know pieces of fire into admission like

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.590 
know pieces of fire into admission like
your<00:01:04.650> little<00:01:04.799> small<00:01:05.189> grass<00:01:05.610> tinder<00:01:06.360> or<00:01:06.390> where

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
your little small grass tinder or where

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.660 
your little small grass tinder or where
else<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.080> it's<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:07.619> kind<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.979> first<00:01:08.340> step

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
else so it's just kind of a first step

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.499 
else so it's just kind of a first step
and<00:01:09.350> in<00:01:10.350> theory<00:01:11.280> it's<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:12.170> good<00:01:13.170> way<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:14.509> quickly

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
and in theory it's a good way to quickly

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.780 
and in theory it's a good way to quickly
get<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.869> spark<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.409> burns<00:01:16.650> hotter<00:01:16.979> than<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.340> lot

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
get a spark that burns hotter than a lot

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.880 
get a spark that burns hotter than a lot
of<00:01:17.880> tender<00:01:18.150> would<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.630> maybe<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.650> guys<00:01:19.740> will

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
of tender would so maybe you guys will

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.030 
of tender would so maybe you guys will
look<00:01:20.100> at<00:01:20.280> exactly<00:01:20.580> how<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.119> how<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.770> works<00:01:22.770> I

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
look at exactly how it how it works I

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.460 
look at exactly how it how it works I
started<00:01:23.490> making<00:01:23.729> my<00:01:23.820> little<00:01:24.140> pile<00:01:25.140> of

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
started making my little pile of

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.289 
started making my little pile of
magnesium<00:01:26.009> filings<00:01:26.369> here<00:01:26.580> I'm<00:01:26.970> going<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.180> go<00:01:27.270> a

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
magnesium filings here I'm going to go a

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.880 
magnesium filings here I'm going to go a
little<00:01:27.630> bit<00:01:27.869> bigger<00:01:28.080> than<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.439> I'm<00:01:28.680> going<00:01:28.799> to

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
little bit bigger than this I'm going to

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.530 
little bit bigger than this I'm going to
scrape<00:01:29.430> away<00:01:29.610> some<00:01:29.909> more<00:01:30.090> but<00:01:30.270> I'm<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:30.450> gonna

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
scrape away some more but I'm just gonna

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.789 
scrape away some more but I'm just gonna
give<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.750> guys<00:01:30.900> kind<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.320> look<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.619> real

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
give you guys kind of a look in real

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.240 
give you guys kind of a look in real
time<00:01:32.100> here<00:01:32.400> at<00:01:32.579> exactly<00:01:33.570> how<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:34.070> how<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.100> can

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
time here at exactly how you how you can

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.210 
time here at exactly how you how you can
do<00:01:35.400> this

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.990 

it's<00:01:39.220> a<00:01:39.250> little<00:01:39.310> bit<00:01:39.430> hard<00:01:39.640> to<00:01:39.670> work<00:01:39.820> with

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
it's a little bit hard to work with

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.450 
it's a little bit hard to work with
because<00:01:40.150> the<00:01:40.800> instruments<00:01:41.800> are<00:01:41.860> so<00:01:42.040> small<00:01:42.310> but

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
because the instruments are so small but

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.520 
because the instruments are so small but
you<00:01:42.550> can<00:01:42.700> see<00:01:42.850> there<00:01:43.060> I'm<00:01:43.750> getting<00:01:44.050> a<00:01:44.110> slightly

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
you can see there I'm getting a slightly

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.210 
you can see there I'm getting a slightly
bigger<00:01:44.800> pile<00:01:45.160> of<00:01:45.400> magnesium<00:01:46.000> filings<00:01:49.980> it<00:01:50.980> can

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
bigger pile of magnesium filings it can

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.460 
bigger pile of magnesium filings it can
be<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.970> can't<00:01:55.240> be<00:01:55.330> a<00:01:55.360> little<00:01:55.570> bit<00:01:55.810> difficult<00:01:56.020> to

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
be it can't be a little bit difficult to

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.160 
be it can't be a little bit difficult to
get<00:01:56.620> this<00:01:56.650> stuff<00:01:56.979> lit<00:01:57.510> with<00:01:58.510> just<00:01:58.750> a<00:01:58.870> spark

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
get this stuff lit with just a spark

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.820 
get this stuff lit with just a spark
from<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:01.210> know<00:02:01.330> spark<00:02:01.750> from<00:02:01.810> flint<00:02:02.229> so<00:02:02.770> I'm

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
from you know spark from flint so I'm

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.140 
from you know spark from flint so I'm
going<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:02.979> keep<00:02:03.130> keep<00:02:03.430> going<00:02:03.700> even<00:02:03.820> just<00:02:04.060> a

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
going to keep keep going even just a

to start a fire i could be putting some

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.890 
to start a fire i could be putting some
grass<00:02:47.620> in<00:02:47.890> there<00:02:48.239> those<00:02:49.239> filings<00:02:49.720> are<00:02:49.810> gonna

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
grass in there those filings are gonna

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.640 
grass in there those filings are gonna
make<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.709> nice<00:02:50.890> in<00:02:50.950> my<00:02:51.130> room<00:02:52.530> it's<00:02:53.530> like

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
what this thing really looked like

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.060 
what this thing really looked like
inside<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.810> house<00:03:13.989> probably<00:03:14.830> not<00:03:14.890> the<00:03:15.040> best

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
inside the house probably not the best

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.340 
inside the house probably not the best
idea<00:03:15.370> but<00:03:15.850> I<00:03:16.150> didn't<00:03:16.840> want<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:16.989> do<00:03:17.110> it<00:03:17.230> outside

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
idea but I didn't want to do it outside

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.500 
idea but I didn't want to do it outside
because<00:03:17.799> it's<00:03:18.340> pretty<00:03:18.549> loud<00:03:18.730> noisy<00:03:19.180> out<00:03:19.299> there

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
because it's pretty loud noisy out there

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.640 
because it's pretty loud noisy out there
um<00:03:19.870> anyway<00:03:21.209> so<00:03:22.209> one<00:03:22.870> thing<00:03:23.019> I<00:03:23.110> will<00:03:23.170> say<00:03:23.320> about

you are um one thing I'll say about this
magnesium<00:03:33.430> fire<00:03:33.580> starter<00:03:33.640> is<00:03:34.590> this<00:03:35.590> is<00:03:35.799> a<00:03:35.829> very

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
magnesium fire starter is this is a very

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.440 
magnesium fire starter is this is a very
very<00:03:36.489> small<00:03:38.400> it's<00:03:39.400> a<00:03:39.579> very<00:03:39.850> small<00:03:40.090> thing<00:03:40.329> which

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
very small it's a very small thing which

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.670 
very small it's a very small thing which
is<00:03:40.480> good<00:03:40.810> for<00:03:40.840> putting<00:03:41.200> in<00:03:41.290> your<00:03:41.320> bug<00:03:41.500> out<00:03:41.620> bag

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
is good for putting in your bug out bag

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.190 
is good for putting in your bug out bag
I'm

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
I'm

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.380 
I'm
it's<00:03:42.530> tiny<00:03:42.830> you<00:03:43.430> could<00:03:43.580> have<00:03:43.670> in<00:03:43.849> your<00:03:43.970> pocket

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
it's tiny you could have in your pocket

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.180 
it's tiny you could have in your pocket
you<00:03:44.750> can<00:03:44.780> almost<00:03:45.020> break<00:03:45.470> this<00:03:45.650> thing<00:03:45.709> in<00:03:46.010> half

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
you can almost break this thing in half

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.160 
you can almost break this thing in half
you<00:03:46.849> know<00:03:46.879> cut<00:03:47.180> this<00:03:47.300> thing<00:03:47.360> in<00:03:47.629> half<00:03:47.750> somehow

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
you know cut this thing in half somehow

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.380 
you know cut this thing in half somehow
and<00:03:48.410> have<00:03:48.590> it<00:03:48.709> like<00:03:48.920> a<00:03:48.950> really<00:03:49.250> small<00:03:49.580> EDC<00:03:50.150> kit

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
and have it like a really small EDC kit

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.470 
and have it like a really small EDC kit
because<00:03:51.170> it<00:03:51.620> is<00:03:51.800> a<00:03:52.010> pretty<00:03:52.459> effective<00:03:52.610> method

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
because it is a pretty effective method

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.970 
because it is a pretty effective method
of<00:03:53.680> getting<00:03:54.680> a<00:03:55.390> hotspot<00:03:56.390> going<00:03:56.660> but<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:57.860> only

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
of getting a hotspot going but the only

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.640 
of getting a hotspot going but the only
downside<00:03:58.430> i<00:03:58.459> think<00:03:58.730> is<00:03:58.849> it<00:03:59.000> so<00:03:59.330> small<00:03:59.650> it's

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
downside i think is it so small it's

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.440 
downside i think is it so small it's
very<00:04:00.860> easy<00:04:01.040> to<00:04:01.160> cut<00:04:01.459> yourself<00:04:01.580> it's<00:04:02.209> kind<00:04:02.420> of

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
very easy to cut yourself it's kind of

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.910 
very easy to cut yourself it's kind of
hard<00:04:02.720> it's<00:04:02.810> a<00:04:02.959> lot<00:04:03.110> of<00:04:03.200> pressure<00:04:03.440> to<00:04:03.650> like<00:04:03.800> be

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
hard it's a lot of pressure to like be

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.020 
hard it's a lot of pressure to like be
putting<00:04:04.250> it's<00:04:04.400> kind<00:04:04.580> of<00:04:04.610> hard<00:04:04.790> on<00:04:04.880> your

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
putting it's kind of hard on your

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.120 
putting it's kind of hard on your
fingers<00:04:05.440> if<00:04:06.440> you're<00:04:06.620> gonna<00:04:06.739> if<00:04:06.890> you're<00:04:07.010> gonna

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
fingers if you're gonna if you're gonna

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.570 
fingers if you're gonna if you're gonna
die<00:04:07.430> it's<00:04:08.239> okay<00:04:08.750> but<00:04:09.560> in<00:04:09.799> a<00:04:09.830> thing<00:04:10.099> to<00:04:10.400> think

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
die it's okay but in a thing to think

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.160 
die it's okay but in a thing to think
about<00:04:10.640> and<00:04:11.150> probably<00:04:11.360> more<00:04:11.599> importantly<00:04:11.660> as

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
about and probably more importantly as
