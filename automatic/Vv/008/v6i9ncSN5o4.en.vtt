presentation to your clients and here's
the<00:01:38.520> same<00:01:38.790> image<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.600> 5x7<00:01:40.049> version<00:01:40.890> we've

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
the same image in a 5x7 version we've

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.969 
the same image in a 5x7 version we've
placed<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.939> inside<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> 5<00:01:42.600> by<00:01:42.780> 7<00:01:42.810> folder<00:01:43.590> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
placed it inside a 5 by 7 folder the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.550 
placed it inside a 5 by 7 folder the
cost<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.549> folder<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.119> approximately<00:01:46.049> 55

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
cost of the folder is approximately 55

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.580 
cost of the folder is approximately 55
cents<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.729> have<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> total<00:01:48.479> cost<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:49.140> the

cents so you have a total cost in the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.399 
cents so you have a total cost in the
print<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.340> presentation<00:01:51.060> folder<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.659> $1

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409
