00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.200 
recording it's in the key of B I think

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.999 
recording it's in the key of B I think
the<00:00:11.470> BPM<00:00:11.920> is<00:00:12.070> around<00:00:12.900> 1:30<00:00:13.900> estimate<00:00:15.029> I<00:00:16.230> go<00:00:17.230> 135

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:18.009 
the BPM is around 1:30 estimate I go 135

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:19.499 
the BPM is around 1:30 estimate I go 135
usually<00:00:18.369> when<00:00:18.490> I<00:00:18.550> play<00:00:18.699> a<00:00:18.730> lot<00:00:18.910> because<00:00:19.150> it's

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:19.509 
usually when I play a lot because it's

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.739 
usually when I play a lot because it's
uh<00:00:19.650> it's<00:00:20.650> a<00:00:20.710> better<00:00:20.939> better<00:00:21.939> feel<00:00:22.240> to<00:00:22.449> it<00:00:22.599> a

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:22.749 
uh it's a better better feel to it a

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:24.929 
uh it's a better better feel to it a
little<00:00:23.079> bit<00:00:23.230> dragging<00:00:23.619> at<00:00:23.679> 1:30<00:00:24.099> when<00:00:24.820> you

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
little bit dragging at 1:30 when you

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:26.759 
little bit dragging at 1:30 when you
when<00:00:25.179> you<00:00:25.239> hear<00:00:25.419> it<00:00:25.539> on<00:00:25.599> there<00:00:25.810> you<00:00:26.739> know

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:26.769 
when you hear it on there you know

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.159 
when you hear it on there you know
recording<00:00:27.249> it's<00:00:27.339> a<00:00:27.429> lot<00:00:27.550> better<00:00:27.759> but<00:00:28.169> yeah

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:29.169 
recording it's a lot better but yeah

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:31.769 
recording it's a lot better but yeah
it's<00:00:30.099> always<00:00:30.310> very<00:00:30.609> easy<00:00:30.789> I'll<00:00:31.210> first<00:00:31.599> go

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
it's always very easy I'll first go

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.620 
it's always very easy I'll first go
through<00:00:31.810> the<00:00:32.050> rhythm<00:00:32.380> parts<00:00:32.730> because<00:00:33.730> it's

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 
through the rhythm parts because it's

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.570 
through the rhythm parts because it's
beyond<00:00:34.930> simple<00:00:35.440> it<00:00:35.530> just<00:00:35.710> fills<00:00:36.040> in<00:00:36.280> and<00:00:36.460> it

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580 
beyond simple it just fills in and it

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.690 
beyond simple it just fills in and it
gives<00:00:36.970> that<00:00:37.060> um<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:38.590> know<00:00:38.740> got<00:00:39.280> electric

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
gives that um you know got electric

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.840 
gives that um you know got electric
guitar<00:00:39.970> driving<00:00:40.510> power<00:00:41.500> chord<00:00:41.830> sound<00:00:42.100> but

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
guitar driving power chord sound but

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.390 
guitar driving power chord sound but
only<00:00:43.300> I<00:00:43.600> do<00:00:43.930> power<00:00:44.260> chords<00:00:44.620> only<00:00:45.250> thing

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
only I do power chords only thing

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.100 
only I do power chords only thing
different<00:00:45.580> the<00:00:46.180> only<00:00:46.390> different<00:00:46.780> things<00:00:46.990> that

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
different the only different things that

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.130 
different the only different things that
I<00:00:47.170> do<00:00:47.290> is<00:00:47.560> the<00:00:47.590> e<00:00:47.740> chord<00:00:48.220> and<00:00:48.870> instead<00:00:49.870> of<00:00:49.960> doing

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
I do is the e chord and instead of doing

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.350 
I do is the e chord and instead of doing
this<00:00:51.010> class<00:00:51.370> of<00:00:51.580> ecore<00:00:52.000> I<00:00:52.320> bar<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:54.520> 2nd<00:00:55.120> fret

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
this class of ecore I bar the 2nd fret

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.700 
this class of ecore I bar the 2nd fret
of<00:00:55.540> the<00:00:55.660> a<00:00:56.200> D<00:00:56.860> and<00:00:57.220> g<00:00:57.580> string<00:00:57.940> and<00:00:58.120> add<00:00:58.960> my<00:00:59.230> pinky

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
of the a D and g string and add my pinky

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:10.850 
of the a D and g string and add my pinky
to<00:01:00.130> the<00:01:00.250> 4th<00:01:00.579> fret<00:01:00.790> of<00:01:01.060> the<00:01:01.150> g<00:01:01.570> string

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.420 

so<00:01:11.520> from<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.850> B<00:01:12.030> B<00:01:12.990> power<00:01:13.260> chord<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:14.130> just<00:01:14.280> let

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
so from a B B power chord you just let

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.280 
so from a B B power chord you just let
go<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.670> ring<00:01:14.850> finger<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.630> bar<00:01:16.080> down

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
go of the ring finger and you bar down

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:25.480 
go of the ring finger and you bar down
on<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.500> second<00:01:16.890> fret

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.340 

I<00:01:26.170> think<00:01:27.170> it<00:01:27.260> sounds<00:01:27.470> a<00:01:27.530> lot<00:01:27.650> better<00:01:27.710> like<00:01:28.100> that

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
I think it sounds a lot better like that

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.510 
I think it sounds a lot better like that
other<00:01:30.350> than<00:01:30.440> that<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.950> chords<00:01:31.220> are<00:01:31.340> very

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
other than that the chords are very

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.460 
other than that the chords are very
straightforward<00:01:31.850> it's<00:01:32.810> just<00:01:33.020> that<00:01:33.230> you<00:01:33.380> know

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
straightforward it's just that you know

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.700 
straightforward it's just that you know
the<00:01:33.500> chorus<00:01:33.890> chords<00:01:34.220> are<00:01:34.430> de<00:01:35.060> G<00:01:35.900> sharp<00:01:36.140> minor<00:01:36.320> F

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
the chorus chords are de G sharp minor F

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.420 
the chorus chords are de G sharp minor F
sharp<00:01:37.190> to<00:01:37.550> e<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:39.500> verses<00:01:39.920> you<00:01:40.040> don't<00:01:40.220> play

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
sharp to e the verses you don't play

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.830 
sharp to e the verses you don't play
you're<00:01:40.610> completely<00:01:41.060> silent<00:01:41.479> you<00:01:41.540> looked<00:01:41.720> at<00:01:41.810> a

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
you're completely silent you looked at a

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.870 
you're completely silent you looked at a
lead<00:01:42.500> electric<00:01:43.010> swell<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:43.520> you<00:01:43.610> let<00:01:43.760> the

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
lead electric swell and you let the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.400 
lead electric swell and you let the
synth<00:01:44.120> fill<00:01:44.900> in<00:01:45.020> everything<00:01:46.930> the<00:01:47.930> pre-course

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
synth fill in everything the pre-course

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.070 
synth fill in everything the pre-course
is<00:01:48.560> a<00:01:48.590> little<00:01:48.860> confusing<00:01:49.220> but<00:01:49.369> I<00:01:49.490> think<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:50.510> G

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
is a little confusing but I think the G

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.740 
is a little confusing but I think the G
sharp<00:01:51.110> minor<00:01:51.440> F<00:01:51.740> sharp<00:01:52.130> then<00:01:52.700> eg<00:01:53.330> sharp<00:01:53.570> minor

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
sharp minor F sharp then eg sharp minor

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.320 
sharp minor F sharp then eg sharp minor
E<00:01:54.110> sounds<00:01:54.710> good<00:01:56.979> yeah<00:01:57.979> and<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:58.580> other<00:01:58.610> only

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
E sounds good yeah and the other only

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.200 
E sounds good yeah and the other only
other<00:01:59.479> thing<00:01:59.750> is<00:01:59.930> uh<00:01:59.960> at<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:01.100> end<00:02:01.130> very<00:02:01.790> end<00:02:02.060> of

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
other thing is uh at the end very end of

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.990 
other thing is uh at the end very end of
the<00:02:02.330> song<00:02:02.540> he'll<00:02:03.380> do<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.619> chorus<00:02:04.490> progression

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
the song he'll do the chorus progression

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.600 
the song he'll do the chorus progression
but<00:02:05.660> the<00:02:05.780> second<00:02:06.170> time<00:02:06.320> he<00:02:06.470> does<00:02:06.649> it<00:02:06.830> he'll<00:02:07.430> do

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
but the second time he does it he'll do

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.860 
but the second time he does it he'll do
a<00:02:10.630> deep<00:02:11.630> B<00:02:11.930> over<00:02:12.170> D<00:02:12.200> sharp

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
a deep B over D sharp

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.809 
a deep B over D sharp
so<00:02:14.870> that<00:02:15.260> I<00:02:15.500> didn't<00:02:15.920> play<00:02:16.069> that<00:02:16.099> in<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.489> cover

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
so that I didn't play that in the cover

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.020 
so that I didn't play that in the cover
but<00:02:17.019> sounds<00:02:18.019> a<00:02:18.049> little<00:02:18.140> tricky<00:02:18.579> but<00:02:19.579> uh<00:02:19.640> for

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
but sounds a little tricky but uh for

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.080 
but sounds a little tricky but uh for
the<00:02:20.090> lead<00:02:20.299> lines<00:02:21.040> very<00:02:22.040> simple<00:02:22.730> very<00:02:22.909> very

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
the lead lines very simple very very

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.690 
the lead lines very simple very very
easy<00:02:23.620> it's<00:02:24.620> just<00:02:24.799> uh

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
easy it's just uh

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.000 
easy it's just uh
you<00:02:26.629> just<00:02:26.780> hold<00:02:26.870> out<00:02:27.019> a<00:02:27.049> B<00:02:27.260> in<00:02:27.379> the<00:02:27.469> beginning<00:02:27.739> a

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
you just hold out a B in the beginning a

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.449 
you just hold out a B in the beginning a
B<00:02:28.430> power<00:02:28.670> chord<00:02:28.730> I<00:02:32.560> think<00:02:33.560> that's<00:02:33.769> right<00:02:34.010> but

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
B power chord I think that's right but

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.030 
B power chord I think that's right but
you<00:02:34.819> know<00:02:35.239> I<00:02:35.540> tried<00:02:36.409> a<00:02:36.439> bunch<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.980> different

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
you know I tried a bunch of different

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.770 
you know I tried a bunch of different
chords<00:02:37.579> that<00:02:37.849> something<00:02:38.180> looks<00:02:38.269> right<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.569> me

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
chords that something looks right to me

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.319 
chords that something looks right to me
but<00:02:39.140> uh<00:02:39.920> you<00:02:40.730> know<00:02:40.790> if<00:02:40.879> you<00:02:40.939> find<00:02:41.090> a<00:02:41.209> better

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
but uh you know if you find a better

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.599 
but uh you know if you find a better
course<00:02:41.629> and<00:02:41.780> you<00:02:41.840> can<00:02:41.870> play<00:02:42.109> that<00:02:42.370> but<00:02:43.370> the

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:43.609 
course and you can play that but the

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:47.949 
course and you can play that but the
lead<00:02:44.450> line<00:02:44.750> after<00:02:45.170> that<00:02:45.200> is<00:02:45.680> e<00:02:46.239> d<00:02:47.239> sharp<00:02:47.599> d

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
lead line after that is e d sharp d

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.149 
lead line after that is e d sharp d

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.500 

very<00:03:15.410> very<00:03:16.040> straightforward<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:17.060> pre-course

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
very very straightforward the pre-course

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.180 
very very straightforward the pre-course
took<00:03:17.720> me<00:03:17.840> a<00:03:17.870> long<00:03:18.380> time<00:03:18.440> to<00:03:18.860> figure<00:03:19.010> out

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
took me a long time to figure out

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.750 
took me a long time to figure out
because<00:03:19.490> the<00:03:20.209> course<00:03:20.540> that<00:03:20.720> he<00:03:20.870> uses<00:03:21.020> are<00:03:21.260> very

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
because the course that he uses are very

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:32.020 
because the course that he uses are very
interesting<00:03:22.760> but<00:03:23.209> I<00:03:23.240> think<00:03:23.600> these<00:03:23.750> fits<00:03:31.030> so

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
interesting but I think these fits so

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.150 
interesting but I think these fits so
you<00:03:32.090> slide<00:03:32.390> from<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.780> D<00:03:32.959> sharp<00:03:33.260> to<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.620> E<00:03:33.650> and

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
you slide from the D sharp to the E and

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.240 
you slide from the D sharp to the E and
you<00:03:34.640> play<00:03:34.790> that<00:03:34.970> high<00:03:35.209> B<00:03:37.540> 8<00:03:38.540> to<00:03:38.900> 9<00:03:39.140> on<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:39.890> g

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
you play that high B 8 to 9 on the g

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.990 
you play that high B 8 to 9 on the g
string<00:03:40.280> and<00:03:40.819> in<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:42.100> 7th<00:03:43.100> fret<00:03:43.280> on<00:03:43.550> the<00:03:43.610> E

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
string and in the 7th fret on the E

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:57.259 
string and in the 7th fret on the E
string

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.360 

and<00:03:58.269> then<00:03:58.569> you<00:03:58.689> play<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:59.079> line<00:03:59.980> goat

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
and then you play the the line goat

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.280 
and then you play the the line goat
leading<00:04:00.670> into<00:04:00.849> the<00:04:00.969> chorus

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.040 

so<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.800> explain<00:04:08.130> those<00:04:08.280> chords<00:04:08.760> it's<00:04:08.970> a<00:04:09.060> behold

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050

difference<00:06:48.210> because<00:06:48.510> in<00:06:48.690> you<00:06:49.350> know<00:06:49.440> brings

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.010 
difference because in you know brings

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.980 
difference because in you know brings
dynamic<00:06:50.520> to<00:06:50.640> this<00:06:50.760> song<00:06:51.140> I'm<00:06:52.140> a<00:06:52.290> pretty

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 
dynamic to this song I'm a pretty

00:06:53.990 --> 00:07:03.260 
dynamic to this song I'm a pretty
standard<00:06:55.010> reverb<00:06:56.010> too<00:06:59.780> and<00:07:00.920> then<00:07:01.920> in<00:07:02.490> the

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.270 
standard reverb too and then in the

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.700 
standard reverb too and then in the
verse<00:07:03.480> I<00:07:03.780> actually<00:07:03.930> have<00:07:04.200> a<00:07:04.230> shimmer<00:07:04.530> effect

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:04.710 
verse I actually have a shimmer effect

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.690 
verse I actually have a shimmer effect
on<00:07:05.040> my<00:07:05.160> blue<00:07:05.400> sky<00:07:05.640> pedal<00:07:06.000> and<00:07:07.400> lets<00:07:08.400> me<00:07:08.490> have

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:08.700 
on my blue sky pedal and lets me have

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.860 
on my blue sky pedal and lets me have
this<00:07:10.100> that<00:07:11.100> sound<00:07:11.460> I<00:07:11.730> put<00:07:12.240> a<00:07:12.270> little<00:07:12.600> bit<00:07:12.810> on

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:12.870 
this that sound I put a little bit on

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.600 
this that sound I put a little bit on
because<00:07:13.350> I<00:07:13.440> left<00:07:13.590> the<00:07:13.650> synth<00:07:13.980> do<00:07:14.190> most<00:07:14.400> of<00:07:14.490> the

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.610 
because I left the synth do most of the

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.670 
because I left the synth do most of the
work<00:07:14.660> and<00:07:15.660> all<00:07:16.020> I'm<00:07:16.200> doing<00:07:16.410> is<00:07:16.500> really

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 
work and all I'm doing is really

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.680 
work and all I'm doing is really
bringing<00:07:17.010> another<00:07:17.430> layer<00:07:17.880> of<00:07:18.030> sound<00:07:18.300> to<00:07:18.540> it

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:18.690 
bringing another layer of sound to it

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.110 
bringing another layer of sound to it

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.570

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:26.580

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:42.580 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.049 

and<00:07:43.580> I<00:07:44.360> don't<00:07:44.989> have<00:07:45.199> a<00:07:45.259> delay<00:07:45.589> to<00:07:46.009> like<00:07:46.159> blend

00:07:47.049 --> 00:07:47.059 
and I don't have a delay to like blend

00:07:47.059 --> 00:07:49.059 
and I don't have a delay to like blend
the<00:07:47.719> swells<00:07:48.080> together<00:07:48.499> you<00:07:48.830> don't<00:07:48.979> really

00:07:49.059 --> 00:07:49.069 
the swells together you don't really

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:50.799 
the swells together you don't really
need<00:07:49.309> it<00:07:49.369> because<00:07:49.610> a<00:07:49.729> synth<00:07:50.089> does<00:07:50.360> most<00:07:50.569> of<00:07:50.749> the

00:07:50.799 --> 00:07:50.809 
need it because a synth does most of the

00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:53.769 
need it because a synth does most of the
work<00:07:51.019> and<00:07:51.309> in<00:07:52.309> a<00:07:52.669> band<00:07:52.879> setting<00:07:53.269> the<00:07:53.449> you

work and in a band setting the you
wouldn't<00:07:53.929> hear<00:07:54.169> as<00:07:54.259> much<00:07:54.499> of<00:07:54.679> the<00:07:54.830> electric

00:07:55.449 --> 00:07:55.459 
wouldn't hear as much of the electric

00:07:55.459 --> 00:07:57.489 
wouldn't hear as much of the electric
