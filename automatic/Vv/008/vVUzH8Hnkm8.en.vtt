to<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.500> right<00:01:07.890> side<00:01:08.750> isn't<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:09.840> great<00:01:10.170> fun

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
to the right side isn't this great fun

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.539 
to the right side isn't this great fun
see<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.580> bird<00:01:11.760> again<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.990> bail<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.130> lifting

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
see this bird again it's bail is lifting

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.060 
see this bird again it's bail is lifting
and<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.360> just<00:01:15.630> dips<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> right<00:01:16.560> side<00:01:16.860> now

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
and it just dips to the right side now

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.160 
and it just dips to the right side now
this<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.369> what's<00:01:17.549> happening<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.509> triangles

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
this is what's happening the triangles

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.160 
this is what's happening the triangles
inside<00:01:19.710> open<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:21.270> shifts<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.990> center

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
inside open and this shifts the center

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.050 
inside open and this shifts the center
of<00:01:22.380> gravity<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.549> bird<00:01:23.759> tips<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.619> fun<00:01:25.619> toy

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
of gravity and the bird tips a fun toy

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.730 
of gravity and the bird tips a fun toy
absolutely<00:01:27.060> see<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.869> once<00:01:28.080> again<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.560> tail

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
absolutely see this once again the tail

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.789 
absolutely see this once again the tail
is<00:01:28.890> lifting<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.030> bird<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.240> tipping<00:01:31.110> this

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
is lifting and the bird is tipping this

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.149 
is lifting and the bird is tipping this
is<00:01:31.979> what<00:01:32.130> happens<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:33.570> triangles<00:01:34.170> open<00:01:34.799> and

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
is what happens the triangles open and

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.090 
is what happens the triangles open and
this<00:01:35.850> opening<00:01:36.689> shifts<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.680> center<00:01:38.009> of

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
this opening shifts the center of

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.420 
this opening shifts the center of
gravity<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.720> enough<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:41.040> tip<00:01:41.400> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
gravity and this is enough to tip the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.819 
gravity and this is enough to tip the
bird<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.600> other<00:01:42.750> side<00:01:43.049> now<00:01:43.560> with<00:01:43.740> the
