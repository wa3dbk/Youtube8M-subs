00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
combines um the three disciplines of

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.410 
combines um the three disciplines of
technology<00:00:43.079> business<00:00:43.500> &amp;<00:00:43.710> design<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.280> you

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
technology business &amp; design and you

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.220 
technology business &amp; design and you
really<00:00:45.420> get<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.570> lot<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.780> cross-pollination

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
really get a lot of cross-pollination

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.950 
really get a lot of cross-pollination
between<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.670> different<00:00:48.000> disciplines<00:00:48.450> and

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
between the different disciplines and

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.549 
between the different disciplines and
some<00:00:49.770> business<00:00:50.219> guys<00:00:50.700> giving<00:00:51.360> design<00:00:52.110> ideas

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
some business guys giving design ideas

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.439 
some business guys giving design ideas
and<00:00:52.980> technology<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.579> guys<00:00:53.670> doing<00:00:54.000> business

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
and technology you guys doing business

ideas I think that's really what the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.160 
ideas I think that's really what the
course<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.780> all<00:00:58.020> about<00:00:59.600> dan<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.629> giving<00:01:01.050> a

projects sponsored by industry here in a
practical<00:01:46.770> way<00:01:46.800> you'll<00:01:47.190> learn<00:01:47.220> from<00:01:47.490> each

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
practical way you'll learn from each

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.880 
practical way you'll learn from each
other<00:01:48.060> then<00:01:48.780> how<00:01:48.930> will<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.170> work<00:01:49.230> it's

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
other then how will this work it's

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.320 
other then how will this work it's
really<00:01:50.070> about<00:01:50.250> getting<00:01:50.520> yourself<00:01:50.970> used<00:01:51.210> to

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
really about getting yourself used to

back any of your ideas thoughts and

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.390 
back any of your ideas thoughts and
knowledge<00:01:57.770> if<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.920> come<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.160> from<00:01:59.340> a

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
knowledge if you come in from a

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.100 
knowledge if you come in from a
technology<00:01:59.880> background<00:02:00.000> you'll<00:02:00.510> take<00:02:00.750> two<00:02:01.080> of

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
technology background you'll take two of

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.500 
technology background you'll take two of
the<00:02:01.320> modules<00:02:01.770> one<00:02:02.580> understanding<00:02:03.240> design

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
the modules one understanding design

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.850 
the modules one understanding design
context<00:02:04.080> in<00:02:04.170> one<00:02:04.260> understanding<00:02:04.770> business

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
context in one understanding business

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.920 
context in one understanding business
context<00:02:05.610> if<00:02:05.760> you<00:02:05.910> from<00:02:06.090> design<00:02:06.420> you'll<00:02:06.780> do

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
context if you from design you'll do

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.290 
context if you from design you'll do
business<00:02:07.230> and<00:02:07.380> technology<00:02:07.620> and<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.100> on<00:02:08.300> these

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
business and technology and so on these

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.000 
business and technology and so on these
when<00:02:09.540> do<00:02:09.690> semester<00:02:10.260> one<00:02:10.380> semester<00:02:10.740> team

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
when do semester one semester team

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.500 
when do semester one semester team
building<00:02:11.490> up<00:02:11.580> your<00:02:11.730> core<00:02:11.970> knowledge<00:02:12.150> and

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
building up your core knowledge and

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.260 
building up your core knowledge and
learning<00:02:12.720> how<00:02:12.870> others<00:02:13.410> work<00:02:13.940> assume<00:02:14.940> from<00:02:15.150> a

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
learning how others work assume from a

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.300 
learning how others work assume from a
technology<00:02:15.630> course<00:02:16.110> background<00:02:16.710> it's<00:02:17.010> great

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
technology course background it's great

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.980 
technology course background it's great
to<00:02:17.460> be<00:02:17.520> involved<00:02:17.820> with<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.210> MDI<00:02:18.510> course

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
to be involved with the MDI course

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.980 
to be involved with the MDI course

those<00:03:05.730> disciplines<00:03:06.270> were<00:03:06.890> using<00:03:07.890> their<00:03:08.070> own

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
those disciplines were using their own

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.430 
those disciplines were using their own
knowledge<00:03:08.460> and<00:03:08.970> knowledge<00:03:09.870> that<00:03:10.230> they've

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
knowledge and knowledge that they've
