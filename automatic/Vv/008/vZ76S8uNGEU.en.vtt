00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
then you do your mutes in between so

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:51.310 
then you do your mutes in between so
let's<00:00:26.880> let's<00:00:27.269> use<00:00:27.509> again<00:00:27.990> your<00:00:28.320> d<00:00:28.560> c<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.609> g

you do know up-strum this is all down

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:21.530 
you do know up-strum this is all down
strums

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.100 

this<00:01:22.500> really<00:01:22.980> helps<00:01:23.430> your<00:01:23.580> songs<00:01:23.870> sound<00:01:24.870> a<00:01:24.990> lot

this really helps your songs sound a lot

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.330 
this really helps your songs sound a lot
different<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.710> be<00:01:25.800> honest<00:01:26.040> with<00:01:26.160> you<00:01:26.220> and

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
different and to be honest with you and

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.220 
different and to be honest with you and
I'm<00:01:26.430> first<00:01:26.760> learning<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.210> song<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.110> what

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
I'm first learning the song this is what

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.980 
I'm first learning the song this is what
I<00:01:28.260> always<00:01:28.590> do<00:01:28.950> I'm<00:01:29.520> first<00:01:29.790> time<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> chords<00:01:30.600> on

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
I always do I'm first time the chords on

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.710 
I always do I'm first time the chords on
Google<00:01:31.440> whatever<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.310> song<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.760> chords<00:01:33.300> see

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
Google whatever the song is chords see

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.460 
Google whatever the song is chords see
the<00:01:33.870> chord<00:01:34.110> chart<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.860> I'll<00:01:34.950> start<00:01:35.250> out<00:01:36.470> just

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
the chord chart and I'll start out just

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.630 
the chord chart and I'll start out just
doing<00:01:37.680> this<00:01:37.740> right<00:01:37.920> here<00:01:38.070> until<00:01:38.220> it's<00:01:38.400> time<00:01:38.550> to

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
doing this right here until it's time to

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.560 
doing this right here until it's time to
change<00:01:43.220> and<00:01:44.220> I'll<00:01:44.310> see<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.670> timing<00:01:44.970> how<00:01:45.390> many

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
change and I'll see the timing how many

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:58.390 
change and I'll see the timing how many
beats

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.280 

so<00:01:59.400> again<00:01:59.700> this<00:01:59.820> is<00:01:59.970> all<00:02:00.180> down<00:02:00.540> shops<00:02:00.960> and

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
so again this is all down shops and

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.630 
so again this is all down shops and
there's<00:02:01.620> really<00:02:01.920> made<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.160> difference<00:02:02.220> in<00:02:02.550> my

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
there's really made a difference in my

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.220 
there's really made a difference in my
plane<00:02:02.910> working<00:02:03.900> on<00:02:04.190> not<00:02:05.190> too<00:02:05.460> loud<00:02:05.840> so<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:07.050> is

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
plane working on not too loud so this is

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.960 
plane working on not too loud so this is
just<00:02:07.350> no<00:02:07.800> fair<00:02:08.040> you<00:02:08.100> don't<00:02:08.340> mean<00:02:08.430> to<00:02:08.520> laugh<00:02:08.729> but

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
just no fair you don't mean to laugh but

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.920 
just no fair you don't mean to laugh but
now<00:02:09.810> chime<00:02:10.380> in<00:02:10.530> there<00:02:11.210> so<00:02:12.210> this<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.570> a<00:02:12.600> tall

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
now chime in there so this is a tall

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.670 
now chime in there so this is a tall
mute<00:02:13.340> that's<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.490> total<00:02:14.850> strum<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:16.470> want<00:02:16.620> to

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
mute that's a total strum you want to

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.560 
mute that's a total strum you want to
get<00:02:16.830> word<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.040> solve<00:02:17.550> right<00:02:17.970> in<00:02:18.150> between

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
get word to solve right in between

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:37.640 
get word to solve right in between
none<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.230> you

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.399 

as<00:02:37.890> another<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:38.939> recommend<00:02:39.420> using<00:02:39.870> that<00:02:40.079> finger

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
as another I recommend using that finger

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:41.869 
as another I recommend using that finger
makes<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.739> big<00:02:40.950> difference<00:02:41.340> rather<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.670> pick

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
makes a big difference rather the pick

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.210 
makes a big difference rather the pick
because<00:02:42.450> how<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:43.409> gives<00:02:43.560> works<00:02:43.799> at<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:43.950> point

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
because how that gives works at a point

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:54.260 
because how that gives works at a point
a<00:02:44.400> harsher<00:02:44.879> sound<00:02:45.180> but<00:02:46.049> using<00:02:46.409> your<00:02:46.439> finger

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:04.830 

that's<00:02:55.270> the<00:02:55.390> track<00:02:55.690> chords

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.970 

the<00:03:05.840> other<00:03:06.020> times<00:03:06.200> if<00:03:06.290> I'm<00:03:06.410> out<00:03:06.560> somewhere

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
the other times if I'm out somewhere

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.440 
the other times if I'm out somewhere
just<00:03:07.160> just<00:03:07.580> with<00:03:07.730> a<00:03:07.760> guitar<00:03:07.880> not<00:03:08.270> really

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
just just with a guitar not really

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.000 
just just with a guitar not really
singing<00:03:08.690> or<00:03:08.900> do<00:03:08.990> anything<00:03:09.380> not<00:03:09.590> teaching<00:03:09.950> a

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
singing or do anything not teaching a

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.760 
singing or do anything not teaching a
song<00:03:10.220> just<00:03:10.910> playing<00:03:11.270> I'll<00:03:12.110> use<00:03:12.410> this<00:03:12.530> myth

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
song just playing I'll use this myth

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.260 
song just playing I'll use this myth
because<00:03:13.040> it<00:03:13.160> kind<00:03:13.310> of<00:03:13.340> has<00:03:13.490> a<00:03:13.520> pleasant<00:03:13.850> sound

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
because it kind of has a pleasant sound

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.580 
because it kind of has a pleasant sound
instead<00:03:14.720> of<00:03:14.810> just

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.830 

that<00:03:18.590> kind<00:03:19.070> of<00:03:19.130> sound<00:03:19.400> just<00:03:20.180> mundane<00:03:20.540> and<00:03:20.660> over

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
that kind of sound just mundane and over

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:34.229 
that kind of sound just mundane and over
and<00:03:20.930> over<00:03:20.990> but

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.250 

so<00:03:35.239> roadwork<00:03:35.690> on<00:03:35.870> its<00:03:36.019> off<00:03:36.260> mute

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
so roadwork on its off mute

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.350 
so roadwork on its off mute
and<00:03:38.800> again<00:03:39.129> before<00:03:39.340> you<00:03:39.730> learn<00:03:40.000> particular

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
and again before you learn particular

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.259
