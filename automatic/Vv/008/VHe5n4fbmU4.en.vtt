00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 Welcome to the smart games my 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.910
 name will bring and today it works 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.049
 namely supplements and first of all 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.240
 I want you a bit 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.150
 tell how the whole thing was with me 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.280
 because I also spend a lot of money 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.650
 for sacraments I was ignorant at that time 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.910
 and of course I want you too 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.960
 save a bit 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.910
 i was 16 17 and mine at that time 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.920
 normal pocket money because it is not so 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.050
 rosy becomes another student 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.300
 now also remember that it was back 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.859
 no hundreds of euros so I am 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.320
 At that time I always had a vacation job 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.050
 made that most of the time as me on the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.969
 construction or somehow 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.040
 among other company I had walls 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.079
 to brush 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.510
 and I remember one summer I have 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.340
 then worked on the construction he had 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.039
 eight hours a day must be rubble 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.739
 Invite a show car and then had to 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.210
 I this full wheelbarrow me so the 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.129
 ramp up and race in this 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.050
 container of the box and purely dumped the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.510
 I've been working for eight hours and for that 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.460
 I got that time 850 or 9 euro 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.080
 It was cool the money for me back then 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.360
 I was also happy when I do 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.390
 was allowed to read after the first day then 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.010
 not so cool anymore i was totally orange 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.420
 and I got that four weeks back then 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.820
 ass opened up so I then money 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.290
 had so available and then i can 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.000
 finally my hard-saved money 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.450
 together and then I'm in at that time 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.840
 told my environment in the shop 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.000
 here 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.020
 I want to build muscles and me 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.970
 I want it all right now 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.840
 professional approach as professional 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.329
 in the sense of games and yes then have the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.540
 Practical this or the bulk 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.310
 I have my working money 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.560
 the course to more or less the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.380
 Hand pressed because I wanted to buy yes 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.689
 because it makes me so that the dutiful 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.270
 Duty program for muscle building 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.890
 That was my thinking at the time and I know 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.130
 even as I will turn taken a job 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.469
 after saying hey he's too muscle 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.090
 this and that and he just has me 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:00.320
 some tin in the hand 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.090
 well so that started pcs glutamine 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.789
 tests to and booster I have everything like that 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.190
 how they get pressed with the hand 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.780
 I had no idea everything 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.400
 thank accepted arguments stop in 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.769
 my purse opened things 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.769
 paid to go home then I had 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.319
 at home many cans are standing 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.840
 say ultras 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.849
 magic one to 4000 any weight 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.739
 gainer I had the whole 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.650
 imprints were so krasner so 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.010
 Actually, one is already formal 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.750
 Now write down from the view of the box 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.880
 and yes I have it secretly then 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.799
 everything was taken and then somehow 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.590
 She then became the bulk of the set 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.170
 the end and the result was not then 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.220
 as I had imagined 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.530
 and that was pretty much for me then 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.510
 hard serve because I have three four 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.069
 weeks on the construction like a ass 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.380
 I still looked up 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.640
 not cool and that's just what 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.890
 many people always think so 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.450
 proven supplements extremely high we 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.819
 have an extremely high priority 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.730
 hope it is impossible and 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.569
 Actually it's just like that 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.970
 we have a benefit we can 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.769
 Supplemente look after their benefits 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.260
 so if somebody is now for example 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.840
 says he wants to take crew appointment then 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.150
 You can go on exams, for example 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.920
 See what brings glutamine as is 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.260
 So the receptivity became that 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.709
 check yes there are studies then 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.049
 This segment is a grid different 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.579
 categories so how meaningful 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.739
 the more you can continue throughout the 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.959
 easily understand what this rejected 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.830
 bring in so if so 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.230
 I would just have known 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.280
 probably 90s sachs the lot 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.510
 I would have just bought 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.010
 can save what I want to say 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.260
 Supplemente games for most 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.710
 people only my complete 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.530
 subordinate role 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.060
 So first, if you have something with somehow 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.130
 you have to build muscle 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.280
 No supplemente supplements are nice 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.200
 to have but no must have so for 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.460
 for example, a protein product as a preparation 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.740
 Just help you with the technical 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.140
 Achieving protein needs that's cool 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.630
 and you can also spend the whole day 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.280
 or you can also very much meat 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.710
 eat with it, for example, no problem 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.240
 has with dairy products and no 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.630
 problem for ethical reasons meat too 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.459
 eat 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.260
 then you could just do that 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.470
 is a protein needed to reach 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.269
 you would not refuse that but one 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.310
 white powder helps us there right away 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.310
 to come on so the next stop 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.240
 so in another can do this as 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.220
 health things with with typical 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.130
 other materials have that reminds me 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.870
 actually so directly a vitamin d3 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.490
 magnesium zinc or omega 3 months 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.530
 for fish is and so what 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.720
 these are things that can make sense 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.760
 but that's what they do themselves 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.770
 are from health aspect and 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.030
 not further from ultra musculature 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.310
 build up or something 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:49.120
 The same goes for the whey protein 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.530
 It provides you with protein but as I said 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.650
 you can also cover a white with the white 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.690
 food this argument talks when 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.760
 one would set up such pyramids and 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.460
 the meaning of the significance of 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.160
 all categorizations would have to be categorized 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.050
 most people are down 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.330
 supplemente that is the most important in 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.220
 basic thing but if you agree at the end 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.290
 would have to rate then it would be rejected 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.450
 make the top of the pyramid from 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.420
 yes you can get it now from ribery 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.670
 could 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.310
 you would re- integrate the whole time 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.620
 See how much really matter 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.720
 yes the next com is what I still have 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.050
 appealing is actually that one 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.610
 partly partially a bit 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.160
 is ripped off and in the sense 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.450
 I also see that some complete 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.250
 make a mistake 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.170
 That's where you get 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.330
 not really the information in there 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:41.900
 this is product containing as 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.690
 some magic metric burmeister blend 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.540
 x1000 and then you can do so little 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.650
 guess what's in there 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.760
 and then you probably have two 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.160
 products in it 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.020
 perhaps make sense of the 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.640
 others are more like that a little bit 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.280
 now times per science products or 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.630
 products which are completely under-dosed 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.400
 rather of which you do not use any 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.320
 where you can just over 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.630
 things are stretched or simply 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.880
 be added to it so that one 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.910
 ingredient more on the ingredient list more often 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.280
 can write down the motto and 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.840
 and for these two ingredients train her 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.430
 by delivering a benefit 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.130
 In principle, they can also be simple 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.760
 buy and you would be a fraction of it 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.350
 ca 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.500
 that's the next one next 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:26.390
 rip-off so reason why friends considered 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.580
 Feel good for what kind of when 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.800
 she spends if she really needs it and 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.040
 do not believe that our element 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.300
 can transport half 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.730
 that should be kinda meanwhile 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:41.090
 to have come over it and 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:43.130
 all seem ok pleased logically 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.900
 I thank you as always for listening 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.610
 such a bit my story of the film 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.560
 I want one or the other 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.780
 of course preserved and if it is you 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.670
 liked and helped you know 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.230
 We can then give it up 

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.640
 Support smart games and then look forward to it 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.690
 I'll see you next time 

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.690
 It's good to see you again
