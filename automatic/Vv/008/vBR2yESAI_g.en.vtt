00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
fried here so I'm gonna just sprinkle a

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:37.409 
fried here so I'm gonna just sprinkle a
little<00:03:32.079> more<00:03:32.349> salt<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:33.040> pepper<00:03:35.940> just<00:03:36.940> a

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:37.419 
little more salt and pepper just a

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:42.539 
little more salt and pepper just a
little<00:03:37.690> bit<00:03:37.870> and<00:03:39.329> then<00:03:40.329> add<00:03:40.569> the<00:03:40.959> onions<00:03:41.549> this

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
little bit and then add the onions this

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.870 
little bit and then add the onions this
is<00:03:42.639> a<00:03:42.669> good<00:03:42.849> idea<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.239> add<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.480> onions<00:03:43.959> now

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
is a good idea to add the onions now

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.860 
is a good idea to add the onions now
because<00:03:47.069> it's<00:03:48.069> gonna<00:03:48.280> cook<00:03:48.519> along<00:03:48.910> with<00:03:49.780> the

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
because it's gonna cook along with the

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:58.080 
because it's gonna cook along with the
balanced<00:03:50.260> cooking<00:03:50.620> with<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:50.829> potatoes<00:03:51.220> need

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.800 

so<00:03:58.900> both<00:03:59.140> onions<00:03:59.650> and<00:03:59.920> potatoes<00:04:00.099> are<00:04:00.810> almost

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
so both onions and potatoes are almost

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.790 
so both onions and potatoes are almost
cooked<00:04:02.459> it's<00:04:03.459> just<00:04:03.760> kind<00:04:04.720> of<00:04:04.780> move<00:04:05.410> them<00:04:05.680> to

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
cooked it's just kind of move them to

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.440 
cooked it's just kind of move them to
the<00:04:05.890> center<00:04:06.310> and<00:04:06.489> it's<00:04:06.640> time<00:04:06.880> for<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.120> extra

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
the center and it's time for the extra

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.930 
the center and it's time for the extra
going<00:04:07.720> I<00:04:07.930> don't<00:04:08.620> really<00:04:08.860> like<00:04:09.099> overcrowding

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
going I don't really like overcrowding

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.270 
going I don't really like overcrowding
my<00:04:10.120> omelettes<00:04:10.840> with<00:04:10.959> onions<00:04:11.410> but<00:04:11.620> if<00:04:11.830> you<00:04:12.010> wish

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.520 
my omelettes with onions but if you wish
to<00:04:12.580> go<00:04:13.120> ahead<00:04:13.209> and<00:04:13.599> use<00:04:13.959> more<00:04:14.230> onion<00:04:15.810> so<00:04:16.810> in

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
to go ahead and use more onion so in

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:26.220 
to go ahead and use more onion so in
goes<00:04:17.950> the<00:04:17.980> eggs<00:04:18.519> just<00:04:24.480> turn<00:04:25.480> around<00:04:25.660> and<00:04:26.139> make

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
goes the eggs just turn around and make

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.040 
goes the eggs just turn around and make
sure<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:27.880> liquid<00:04:28.210> spreads<00:04:28.630> evenly

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050

throughout<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.740> pan<00:04:31.410> and<00:04:32.410> let<00:04:33.250> it<00:04:33.310> sit<00:04:34.139> I'd

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
throughout the pan and let it sit I'd

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.670 
throughout the pan and let it sit I'd
put<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.620> gas<00:04:35.830> on<00:04:36.130> low<00:04:37.120> heat<00:04:37.680> because

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
put the gas on low heat because

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.080 
put the gas on low heat because
otherwise<00:04:38.919> you<00:04:39.250> don't<00:04:39.430> want<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:39.669> other<00:04:39.850> side

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
otherwise you don't want the other side
