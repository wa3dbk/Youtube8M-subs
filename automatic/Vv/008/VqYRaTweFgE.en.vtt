00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello and welcome to my new one 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.020
 video today I present you one time 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.070
 Ceramic pocket knife in front of the home 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.440
 rosestone zone or pearl de the whole 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.880
 I bought on Amazon and for 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.580
 9 euros 85 including shipping and yes ten 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.900
 euro is not much 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.840
 Let's see if in this video 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.029
 it 's also worth it is usually that 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:33.360
 the box james came the small pack 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:36.469
 a huge thing we always look at ourselves 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:42.770
 you know that's the packaging 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:45.329
 so is anything but spectacular 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.200
 You can actually do it nicely now 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.719
 do not say anything that is negative 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.370
 I mean well padded is one 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.430
 gift wrapping you but then 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:06.180
 throw away and here we have that 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:07.710
 black knife the social or i am 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.830
 I am very sure that plastic is but it 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.000
 quality really works so much 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.890
 heavier than I thought 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.040
 These three keep the whole thing 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.090
 together one pages are none 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.110
 imprint or something that surprises me 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.360
 because everyone is for what actually 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.030
 always in a good mood but that's how it looks 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.479
 bad on the back 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.759
 Nothing 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.939
 and that really makes me feel very much 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.240
 inconspicuous but then at the other 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:42.060
 side you can find the knee 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:46.170
 Okay we got out of the way so you did 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.750
 here is no thing to the goal is a 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.090
 classic as with victorinox man holds 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.259
 The blade just stuck 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:58.229
 but that works better than you might think 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:59.340
 thinks it could be a bit difficult 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.720
 tolerate a little oil 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.160
 absolutely 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.140
 then up here is the Russian zone 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.070
 Pretty chic lettering the cinema 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:15.780
 looks very good visually so 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:18.360
 black is just ceramic with sage 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.100
 then I like a white one again 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.400
 so I link a description 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.780
 think this optics but very very chic 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.120
 It's really hard, really hard 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.120
 I have a classic dress up 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.460
 So what else you have when you have one 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.530
 metal klinger has just a few houses 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.650
 because the clean is still the cost here 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.920
 the blade is very narrow it is chosen 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.120
 a paring knife for peeling or one man 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.220
 Of course, everything can do with it 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.650
 what I would not do is cut 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.330
 Carve something blessing or something because 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.370
 the bell can always break 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.370
 high load can be 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.480
 amick knife but let's see how 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.220
 sheep are 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.850
 that's pretty new too 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.650
 paper 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:09.450
 although I know that no real 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:10.739
 Sharpness is a lot of cutting the paper 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.720
 Alright, I needed three attempts 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:17.040
 and is a bit spherical looking though 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.730
 in the first is now waiting 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.730
 decide 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.930
 you have to set the right angle 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:36.590
 that soon you will be like 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:39.950
 so bad not as one-sided as that 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.950
 right winkelhaid 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:53.450
 These are extremely sharp but not then 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.450
 is not watching 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:05.040
 So I would have thought that is sharper 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:09.209
 I think that's why I 'm just where 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:12.269
 you should use the comments 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.730
 So somehow the airport fair Rhein 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.350
 to smuggle is nonsense or if 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.100
 I now this stotzem of metal 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.139
 either i realized my there is 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.979
 not a knife which has no metal parts 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:28.889
 or in any case is a folding knife 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:31.470
 it's pretty nice to go after 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.530
 because I did not know it because the whole 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:37.310
 fair Scherber also consist of ceramics 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.450
 steam engines grindstone or let 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:43.550
 but I think that here 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.550
 maybe it should look 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:59.340
 you hit the angle 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:02.000
 then it is really sharp but if 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.099
 I already imagined 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.720
 okay that's the mechanism 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:07.710
 quite primitive but most of it is 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.590
 really beautifull 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.450
 I would eat it now what the kids 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.740
 but it does not work out with me but me 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.460
 really does not want it now 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.289
 break something 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:23.000
 That's why I'll let you have it 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:27.450
 compare for ten euros 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.280
 That's what I get for other knives 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.430
 think that's not a bad choice it 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.700
 here is just a blade that is not 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.889
 really handy why should you look 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.330
 to buy that 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.090
 I do not know, I really know 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.060
 Not 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:48.250
 is quite chic but 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:51.139
 if it really came out that way 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:54.110
 what to expect from a ceramics 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:55.730
 Penknife is now handy I must 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.380
 say it 's really fancy 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.950
 Also, it should be okay 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.900
 even sharpen as a gift or something 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.700
 is not it really that bad 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.669
 low price of ten euro so finds 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:11.870
 make it relatively low now 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:13.130
 actually ok after redmond the 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.600
 description of what you are actually using 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.310
 a ceramic pocket knife does what 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.200
 the raison d'Ãªtre is spring 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.880
 fewer 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.979
 and so have interest as I said 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:25.660
 is linked in the description henk 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:25.660
 visch look new max salzberg
