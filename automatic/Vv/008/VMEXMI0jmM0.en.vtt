00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.339 
hey guys welcome back to a video today
I'm<00:00:08.189> doing<00:00:08.309> another<00:00:08.610> madden<00:00:09.000> 16<00:00:09.240> card<00:00:09.780> concept

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
I'm doing another madden 16 card concept

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.140 
I'm doing another madden 16 card concept
design<00:00:10.620> so<00:00:11.099> does<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.340> second<00:00:11.759> one<00:00:11.849> I've<00:00:11.940> done

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
design so does the second one I've done

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.879 
design so does the second one I've done
in<00:00:12.300> this<00:00:12.389> time<00:00:12.630> it's<00:00:12.809> much<00:00:13.019> more<00:00:13.230> original<00:00:13.679> and

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
in this time it's much more original and

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.029 
in this time it's much more original and
it<00:00:14.280> has<00:00:14.400> less<00:00:14.670> parts<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.210> madden<00:00:15.540> 15<00:00:16.039> card

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
it has less parts of a madden 15 card

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.160 
it has less parts of a madden 15 card
used<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.580> design<00:00:17.730> so<00:00:18.510> basically<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.109> is

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
used in the design so basically this is

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.900 
used in the design so basically this is
again<00:00:19.560> what<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.830> think<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.279> card<00:00:20.550> could<00:00:20.699> look

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
again what I think a card could look

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.970 
again what I think a card could look
like<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:21.150> madden<00:00:21.630> 16<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.410> if<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.740> liked<00:00:22.859> the
