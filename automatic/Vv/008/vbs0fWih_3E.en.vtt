00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
entertaining and enjoyable because you

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.920 
entertaining and enjoyable because you
have<00:01:05.309> two<00:01:05.489> conflicting<00:01:05.820> characters<00:01:06.510> that

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
both seem to be trying to get to the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.420 
both seem to be trying to get to the
same<00:01:09.210> place<00:01:09.500> now<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.560> controls<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.250> game

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
same place now the controls in the game

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.920 
same place now the controls in the game
were<00:01:11.670> designed<00:01:11.970> really<00:01:12.270> well<00:01:12.600> for<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
were designed really well for the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.810 
were designed really well for the
touchscreen<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.860> has<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> nice<00:01:14.340> mix<00:01:14.700> of

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
touchscreen it has a nice mix of

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.609 
touchscreen it has a nice mix of
instances<00:01:15.450> where<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.750> developers<00:01:16.320> are<00:01:16.560> a

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
instances where the developers are a

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.920 
instances where the developers are a
forgiving<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.939> other<00:01:18.180> times<00:01:18.450> where<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.750> do

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
forgiving and other times where you do

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.929 
forgiving and other times where you do
need<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.200> be<00:01:19.320> pretty<00:01:19.650> precise<00:01:20.100> with<00:01:20.340> your<00:01:20.490> with

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
need to be pretty precise with your with

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.999 
need to be pretty precise with your with
your<00:01:20.970> key<00:01:21.210> hits<00:01:21.450> now<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.290> battle<00:01:22.740> system

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
your key hits now the battle system

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.380 
your key hits now the battle system
works<00:01:23.159> really<00:01:23.340> well<00:01:23.580> there<00:01:24.150> are<00:01:24.240> some

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
works really well there are some

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.810 
works really well there are some
limitations<00:01:24.990> with<00:01:25.080> touchscreen<00:01:25.710> controls<00:01:26.130> so

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
limitations with touchscreen controls so

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.310 
limitations with touchscreen controls so
they<00:01:27.180> actually<00:01:27.330> put<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.720> some<00:01:27.960> really<00:01:28.080> nice

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
they actually put in some really nice

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.260 
they actually put in some really nice
pacing<00:01:29.009> as<00:01:29.130> far<00:01:29.340> as<00:01:29.460> when<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> enemies<00:01:30.090> can

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
pacing as far as when the enemies can

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.179 
pacing as far as when the enemies can
attack<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.780> when<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:30.990> can<00:01:31.170> move<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.590> it

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
attack and when you can move and it

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.399 
attack and when you can move and it
actually<00:01:32.520> feels<00:01:32.700> pretty<00:01:33.210> pretty<00:01:33.840> fluid<00:01:34.229> I

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
actually feels pretty pretty fluid I

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.609 
actually feels pretty pretty fluid I
know<00:01:34.979> eventually<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:36.240> battle<00:01:36.570> system<00:01:36.930> will

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
know eventually this battle system will

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.830 
know eventually this battle system will
get<00:01:37.799> pretty<00:01:38.040> repetitive<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.880> largely

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
get pretty repetitive and largely

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.190 
get pretty repetitive and largely
because<00:01:40.259> it's<00:01:40.470> not<00:01:40.740> too<00:01:40.950> difficult<00:01:41.460> so

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
because it's not too difficult so

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.810 
because it's not too difficult so
outside<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:44.040> battle<00:01:44.280> controls<00:01:44.640> I

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
outside of the the battle controls I

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.789 
outside of the the battle controls I
want<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.299> say<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.869> navigation<00:01:46.619> through

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
want to say that the navigation through

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.280 
want to say that the navigation through
the<00:01:46.829> world<00:01:47.070> also<00:01:47.340> works<00:01:47.790> really<00:01:48.030> well<00:01:48.290> even

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
the world also works really well even

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.620 
the world also works really well even
though<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.740> very<00:01:49.829> linear<00:01:50.310> game<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
though this is a very linear game the

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
the game and this brings me to really my

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.430 
the game and this brings me to really my
only<00:03:04.060> complaint<00:03:04.330> about<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.750> game<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.290> it's

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
only complaint about the game and it's

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.870 
only complaint about the game and it's
the<00:03:05.560> fact<00:03:05.800> that<00:03:06.010> there's<00:03:06.190> way<00:03:06.520> too<00:03:06.580> much

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
the fact that there's way too much

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.560 
the fact that there's way too much
repetition<00:03:07.209> and<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:08.709> found<00:03:09.340> myself<00:03:09.519> getting<00:03:09.970> a

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
repetition and I found myself getting a

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.240 
repetition and I found myself getting a
little<00:03:10.840> irritated<00:03:11.560> that<00:03:11.590> I<00:03:11.709> couldn't<00:03:12.130> get

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
little irritated that I couldn't get

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.860 
little irritated that I couldn't get
further<00:03:12.580> along<00:03:12.790> in<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.239> story<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.720> then<00:03:13.810> I

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
further along in the story and then I

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.570 
further along in the story and then I
would<00:03:14.049> have<00:03:14.170> to<00:03:14.290> just<00:03:14.350> sort<00:03:14.650> of<00:03:14.769> grind<00:03:15.400> through

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
would have to just sort of grind through

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.210 
would have to just sort of grind through
a<00:03:15.640> new<00:03:15.880> area<00:03:16.150> with<00:03:16.810> almost<00:03:17.230> exactly<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.190> same

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
a new area with almost exactly the same

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.460 
a new area with almost exactly the same
obstacles<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.269> it<00:03:19.780> just<00:03:19.989> starts<00:03:20.200> to<00:03:20.260> take<00:03:20.440> a

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
obstacles and it just starts to take a

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.990 
obstacles and it just starts to take a
little<00:03:20.709> bit<00:03:20.799> of<00:03:20.950> time<00:03:21.130> and<00:03:21.430> makes<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:21.970> game

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
little bit of time and makes the game

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.289 
little bit of time and makes the game
feel<00:03:22.420> a<00:03:23.200> little<00:03:23.620> boring<00:03:23.890> disconnected<00:03:24.610> was

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
feel a little boring disconnected was

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:26.490 
feel a little boring disconnected was
hoping<00:03:25.600> for<00:03:25.660> maybe<00:03:25.900> a<00:03:26.019> little<00:03:26.170> bit<00:03:26.380> better

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
hoping for maybe a little bit better

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.310 
hoping for maybe a little bit better
pacing<00:03:27.390> well<00:03:28.390> those<00:03:28.630> are<00:03:28.750> my<00:03:28.810> thoughts<00:03:28.870> on

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
pacing well those are my thoughts on
