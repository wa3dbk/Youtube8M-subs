00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
the photoelectric effect was first

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.259 
the photoelectric effect was first
described<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.810> little<00:00:07.589> bit<00:00:07.770> before<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.730> 1900s

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
described a little bit before the 1900s

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.280

and<00:00:09.900> Albert<00:00:10.380> Einstein<00:00:10.940> explained<00:00:11.940> it<00:00:12.120> in<00:00:12.360> 1905

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
and Albert Einstein explained it in 1905

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.410 
and Albert Einstein explained it in 1905
and<00:00:13.590> received<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.130> Nobel<00:00:14.490> Prize<00:00:14.519> in<00:00:15.150> Physics

and received the Nobel Prize in Physics

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.830 
and received the Nobel Prize in Physics
for<00:00:15.900> his<00:00:16.590> explanation<00:00:17.460> in<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.850> early<00:00:18.420> 20s

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
for his explanation in the early 20s

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.460 
for his explanation in the early 20s
maybe<00:00:19.400> 1921<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.689> was<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:21.960> idea<00:00:22.199> that

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
maybe 1921 and that was this idea that

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.380 
maybe 1921 and that was this idea that
if<00:00:22.650> we<00:00:22.769> had<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.920> light<00:00:23.160> here<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.670> see<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.939> light

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
if we had a light here you see a light

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.700 
if we had a light here you see a light
shining<00:00:25.380> on<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> piece<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.130> metal<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.699> if<00:00:27.449> we

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
shining on a piece of metal and if we

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.339 
shining on a piece of metal and if we
change<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:29.010> wavelength<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.730> light<00:00:30.349> to

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
change the wavelength of that light to

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.030 
change the wavelength of that light to
make<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:32.219> light<00:00:32.489> carry<00:00:33.270> more<00:00:33.630> energy<00:00:34.170> here

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
make that light carry more energy here

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.520 
make that light carry more energy here
I'm<00:00:35.190> lowering<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.329> wavelength<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.200> see

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
I'm lowering the wavelength and you see

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.950 
I'm lowering the wavelength and you see
that<00:00:37.950> electrons<00:00:38.610> are<00:00:38.910> being<00:00:39.059> ejected<00:00:39.239> from

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
that electrons are being ejected from

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.670 
that electrons are being ejected from
the<00:00:40.140> surface<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.579> sodium<00:00:42.059> metal<00:00:42.960> with

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
the surface of that sodium metal with

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.639 
the surface of that sodium metal with
this<00:00:44.010> bluish<00:00:44.730> green<00:00:45.270> light<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.550> so<00:00:48.410> that<00:00:49.410> is

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
this bluish green light and so that is

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.340 
this bluish green light and so that is
the<00:00:49.680> photoelectric<00:00:50.550> effect<00:00:50.809> that<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:52.110> where

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
the photoelectric effect that is where

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.299 
the photoelectric effect that is where
the<00:00:52.500> first<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.840> minimum<00:00:55.710> amount<00:00:56.129> of

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
the first the the minimum amount of

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.849 
the first the the minimum amount of
energy<00:00:56.760> required<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:58.100> start<00:01:00.859> ejecting

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
energy required to start ejecting

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.280 
energy required to start ejecting
electrons<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.850> we<00:01:02.940> can<00:01:03.120> find<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.570> ionization

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.670 
electrons and we can find the ionization
energy<00:01:04.710> how<00:01:05.220> with<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.729> process<00:01:06.950> now<00:01:09.650> where<00:01:10.650> I

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.469 
we start with hydrogen that's what we're
looking<00:01:40.439> at<00:01:40.560> here<00:01:40.770> for<00:01:41.009> hydrogen<00:01:41.369> here<00:01:42.150> we<00:01:42.299> see

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
looking at here for hydrogen here we see

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.330 
looking at here for hydrogen here we see
along<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.840> bottom<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.680> grow-op<00:01:43.860> along

here<00:01:52.950> we<00:01:53.070> see<00:01:53.250> with<00:01:53.399> hydrogen<00:01:53.939> we<00:01:54.450> have<00:01:54.600> one

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
here we see with hydrogen we have one

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.350 
here we see with hydrogen we have one
electron<00:01:55.399> ejected<00:01:56.570> and<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:58.229> that's<00:01:58.439> our<00:01:58.590> 1s

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360

electron if we move to helium you will
see<00:02:03.469> well<00:02:04.469> we<00:02:04.619> would<00:02:04.770> predict<00:02:05.159> from<00:02:05.250> Coulomb's

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
see well we would predict from Coulomb's

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.570 
see well we would predict from Coulomb's
law<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.810> because<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.560> larger<00:02:08.160> charge

the<00:02:14.350> ionization<00:02:15.350> energy<00:02:15.770> would<00:02:16.610> be<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.819> little

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
the ionization energy would be a little

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.960 
the ionization energy would be a little
bit<00:02:17.180> higher<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.720> in<00:02:18.080> fact<00:02:18.410> it<00:02:19.010> is<00:02:19.250> if<00:02:19.580> we<00:02:19.730> click

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
bit higher and in fact it is if we click

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.809 
bit higher and in fact it is if we click
on<00:02:20.020> helium<00:02:21.020> here<00:02:21.500> we<00:02:21.620> see<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:22.130> peak<00:02:22.520> that's

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
on helium here we see a peak that's

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.420 
on helium here we see a peak that's
twice<00:02:23.180> as<00:02:23.420> large<00:02:23.800> indicating<00:02:24.800> we<00:02:24.890> live<00:02:25.100> twice

identify three electrons and here we
have<00:02:36.590> them<00:02:36.860> now<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.459> thing<00:02:37.700> not<00:02:37.880> to<00:02:38.060> keep

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
have them now the thing not to keep

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.309 
have them now the thing not to keep
straight<00:02:38.660> here<00:02:39.200> is<00:02:39.350> this<00:02:39.950> one<00:02:40.720> electron<00:02:41.720> that

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
straight here is this one electron that

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.440 
straight here is this one electron that
has<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.680> lowest<00:02:42.890> binding<00:02:43.730> energy<00:02:43.940> is

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
has the lowest binding energy is

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.080 
has the lowest binding energy is
actually<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.440> electron<00:02:45.890> that's<00:02:46.160> farthest

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
actually the electron that's farthest

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.580 
actually the electron that's farthest
from<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.989> nucleus<00:02:48.500> so<00:02:48.709> this<00:02:48.890> is<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:51.880> 2s<00:02:52.910> one

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
from the nucleus so this is the 2s one

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.300 
from the nucleus so this is the 2s one
electron<00:02:54.590> of<00:02:54.739> lithium<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.370> these<00:02:56.060> are<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.660> 1s

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
electron of lithium and these are the 1s

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.350 
electron of lithium and these are the 1s
electrons<00:02:58.310> of<00:02:58.489> lithium<00:02:58.910> that<00:02:59.060> have<00:02:59.239> the

electrons of lithium that have the
higher<00:02:59.510> binding<00:03:00.110> energy<00:03:00.470> let's<00:03:00.680> go<00:03:00.830> on<00:03:00.950> to

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
higher binding energy let's go on to

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.390 
higher binding energy let's go on to
beryllium<00:03:02.269> and<00:03:02.630> take<00:03:02.810> a<00:03:02.840> look<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.290> see<00:03:03.320> here<00:03:04.250> we

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
beryllium and take a look to see here we

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.729 
beryllium and take a look to see here we
have<00:03:04.640> flow<00:03:05.180> electrons<00:03:05.750> of<00:03:05.959> beryllium<00:03:06.290> and

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
have flow electrons of beryllium and

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.840 
have flow electrons of beryllium and
you'll<00:03:07.370> notice<00:03:07.550> that<00:03:07.730> on<00:03:08.150> this<00:03:08.920> bottom<00:03:09.920> axis

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
you'll notice that on this bottom axis

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.960 
you'll notice that on this bottom axis
we're<00:03:11.150> going<00:03:11.420> up<00:03:11.540> to<00:03:11.570> a<00:03:11.720> binding<00:03:12.170> energy<00:03:12.290> of<00:03:12.530> 10

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
we're going up to a binding energy of 10

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.430 
we're going up to a binding energy of 10
we<00:03:13.970> don't<00:03:14.150> know<00:03:14.209> exactly<00:03:14.690> what<00:03:14.900> those<00:03:15.050> units

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
we don't know exactly what those units

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.310 
we don't know exactly what those units
are<00:03:15.620> here<00:03:15.980> but<00:03:16.220> up<00:03:16.940> on<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.360> next<00:03:17.660> line<00:03:17.870> they<00:03:18.140> go

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
are here but up on the next line they go

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.430 
are here but up on the next line they go
from<00:03:18.500> ten<00:03:18.799> to<00:03:19.040> a<00:03:19.070> hundred<00:03:19.160> so<00:03:20.440> approximately

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
from ten to a hundred so approximately

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.400 
from ten to a hundred so approximately
ten<00:03:22.340> times<00:03:22.640> as<00:03:22.970> much<00:03:23.120> energy<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.900> the

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
ten times as much energy and the

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.229 
ten times as much energy and the
electrons<00:03:24.890> with<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.220> lowest<00:03:25.760> amount<00:03:26.120> of

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
electrons with the lowest amount of

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.530 
electrons with the lowest amount of
binding<00:03:27.170> energy<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:27.739> ones<00:03:27.890> that<00:03:28.070> are<00:03:28.540> bound

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
binding energy the ones that are bound

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.030 
binding energy the ones that are bound
the<00:03:29.840> most<00:03:30.760> lightly<00:03:32.230> remove<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.530> most<00:03:33.709> easily

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
the most lightly remove the most easily

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.220 
the most lightly remove the most easily
those<00:03:34.519> would<00:03:34.700> be<00:03:34.820> the<00:03:34.940> outer<00:03:35.180> electrons<00:03:35.420> and

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
those would be the outer electrons and

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.090 
those would be the outer electrons and
those<00:03:36.380> would<00:03:36.530> be<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:37.989> two<00:03:38.989> electrons<00:03:39.890> that

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
those would be the two electrons that

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.880 
those would be the two electrons that
are<00:03:40.250> in<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.459> 2's<00:03:40.970> level<00:03:41.570> and<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:42.410> electrons

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
are in the 2's level and the electrons

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.660 
are in the 2's level and the electrons
up<00:03:43.340> here<00:03:43.610> in<00:03:44.420> the<00:03:44.840> graph<00:03:45.079> are<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:46.070> electrons

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
up here in the graph are the electrons

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.090 
up here in the graph are the electrons
closest<00:03:47.299> to<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:47.540> nucleus<00:03:47.690> and<00:03:48.260> so<00:03:48.890> they<00:03:49.040> are

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
closest to the nucleus and so they are

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.460 
closest to the nucleus and so they are
bound<00:03:49.340> much<00:03:49.640> more<00:03:49.940> tightly<00:03:50.239> and<00:03:50.600> have<00:03:51.230> a<00:03:51.260> much

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
bound much more tightly and have a much

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.280 
bound much more tightly and have a much
higher<00:03:51.709> binding<00:03:52.579> energy<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:53.239> so<00:03:54.049> this

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
higher binding energy and so this

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.720 
higher binding energy and so this
evidence<00:03:54.890> supports<00:03:55.959> the<00:03:57.160> quantum<00:03:58.160> mechanical

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
evidence supports the quantum mechanical

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.330 
evidence supports the quantum mechanical
model<00:03:58.790> of<00:03:59.299> the<00:03:59.420> atom<00:03:59.540> have<00:04:00.530> to<00:04:00.920> show<00:04:01.130> its

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
model of the atom have to show its

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.190 
model of the atom have to show its
energy<00:04:01.730> levels<00:04:02.120> and<00:04:02.239> all<00:04:02.390> of<00:04:02.510> that<00:04:02.690> kind<00:04:03.019> of

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
energy levels and all of that kind of

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.000 
energy levels and all of that kind of
stuff<00:04:03.950> we're<00:04:04.220> gonna<00:04:04.280> jump<00:04:04.670> up<00:04:04.850> to<00:04:04.880> nitrogen

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
stuff we're gonna jump up to nitrogen

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.590 
stuff we're gonna jump up to nitrogen
and<00:04:07.010> now<00:04:07.220> we're<00:04:07.400> just<00:04:07.430> gonna<00:04:07.640> go<00:04:07.880> to<00:04:07.940> boron<00:04:08.329> you

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
and now we're just gonna go to boron you

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.340 
and now we're just gonna go to boron you
see<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:08.930> five<00:04:09.170> electrons<00:04:10.450> these<00:04:11.450> would<00:04:11.959> be

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
see the five electrons these would be

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.300 
see the five electrons these would be
the<00:04:12.650> hot<00:04:13.579> in<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:14.209> 2p<00:04:14.720> sublevel<00:04:15.440> these<00:04:15.980> would

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
the hot in the 2p sublevel these would

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.289 
the hot in the 2p sublevel these would
be<00:04:16.570> into<00:04:17.570> s<00:04:17.810> sublevel<00:04:18.200> and<00:04:18.769> these<00:04:19.459> would<00:04:19.760> be<00:04:19.970> in

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
be into s sublevel and these would be in

it<00:04:27.420> is<00:04:27.510> something<00:04:27.810> like<00:04:27.960> magnesium<00:04:28.500> we<00:04:29.430> should

it is something like magnesium we should

it is something like magnesium we should
be<00:04:29.760> able<00:04:29.940> to<00:04:30.090> count<00:04:30.330> 12<00:04:30.870> electrons<00:04:31.200> and<00:04:31.830> here

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
be able to count 12 electrons and here

they are going from the the most tightly
bound<00:04:36.180> electrons<00:04:36.900> this<00:04:37.860> would<00:04:38.130> be<00:04:38.570> the<00:04:39.570> 1s

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
yes anyhow the the most lightly bound

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.550 
yes anyhow the the most lightly bound
electrons<00:05:02.270> here<00:05:03.270> with<00:05:03.660> magnesium<00:05:04.110> these

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
electrons here with magnesium these

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:11.830 
electrons here with magnesium these
would<00:05:04.740> be<00:05:04.920> the<00:05:05.810> 3s<00:05:07.370> electrons<00:05:08.370> so<00:05:08.730> 3<00:05:09.690> less<00:05:10.520> 2p

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
would be the 3s electrons so 3 less 2p

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.250 
would be the 3s electrons so 3 less 2p
to<00:05:12.840> us<00:05:13.080> and<00:05:13.470> 1s<00:05:14.460> in<00:05:14.760> case<00:05:14.940> I<00:05:15.090> got<00:05:15.270> that<00:05:15.510> mixed<00:05:16.020> up

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
to us and 1s in case I got that mixed up

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.860 
to us and 1s in case I got that mixed up
earlier<00:05:16.650> that's<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:17.070> way<00:05:17.160> these<00:05:17.370> would<00:05:17.580> be<00:05:17.870> so

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
earlier that's the way these would be so

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.630 
earlier that's the way these would be so
if<00:05:19.050> you<00:05:19.170> move<00:05:19.350> on<00:05:19.560> something<00:05:20.070> like<00:05:20.250> chlorine

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
if you move on something like chlorine

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.970 
if you move on something like chlorine
we<00:05:21.120> should<00:05:21.300> be<00:05:21.420> able<00:05:21.540> to<00:05:21.690> identify<00:05:21.980> 17

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
we should be able to identify 17

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.790 
we should be able to identify 17
electrons<00:05:23.490> and<00:05:24.030> the<00:05:24.810> lower<00:05:25.110> the<00:05:25.380> binding

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.010 
electrons and the lower the binding
energy<00:05:26.220> means<00:05:26.670> those<00:05:27.030> are<00:05:27.180> the<00:05:27.270> electrons<00:05:27.750> in

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
energy means those are the electrons in

these<00:05:36.990> are<00:05:37.290> the<00:05:37.440> s<00:05:37.890> electrons<00:05:38.790> in<00:05:39.060> the<00:05:39.150> third

this that I want to leave you with

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.650 
this that I want to leave you with

this picture of a photoelectron
spectroscopy<00:06:09.570> spectrum<00:06:10.500> and<00:06:10.620> you'll<00:06:10.710> see<00:06:10.950> to

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 
spectroscopy spectrum and you'll see to

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.770 
spectroscopy spectrum and you'll see to
see<00:06:11.520> you<00:06:11.700> have<00:06:11.820> to<00:06:11.910> look<00:06:11.940> carefully<00:06:12.360> and

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
see you have to look carefully and

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.260 
see you have to look carefully and
you'll<00:06:13.620> see<00:06:13.800> that<00:06:13.919> in<00:06:14.070> a<00:06:14.160> lot<00:06:14.340> of<00:06:14.400> cases<00:06:14.820> they

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
you'll see that in a lot of cases they

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.460 
you'll see that in a lot of cases they
reverse<00:06:15.810> this<00:06:16.080> order<00:06:16.500> on<00:06:17.210> the<00:06:18.210> x<00:06:18.419> axis<00:06:19.110> here<00:06:19.140> we

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
reverse this order on the x axis here we

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.400 
reverse this order on the x axis here we
have<00:06:19.650> a<00:06:19.680> high<00:06:20.040> energy<00:06:20.360> going<00:06:21.360> to<00:06:21.480> a<00:06:21.660> low<00:06:21.930> energy

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
have a high energy going to a low energy

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.610 
have a high energy going to a low energy
and<00:06:22.590> so<00:06:23.250> for<00:06:23.520> this<00:06:23.700> particular<00:06:24.090> spectrum<00:06:24.660> we

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
and so for this particular spectrum we

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.500 
and so for this particular spectrum we
see<00:06:25.790> the<00:06:26.790> lowest<00:06:27.060> energy<00:06:27.600> clear<00:06:28.260> to<00:06:28.440> the<00:06:28.560> right

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510 
see the lowest energy clear to the right

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.900 
see the lowest energy clear to the right
because<00:06:31.039> we've<00:06:32.039> kind<00:06:32.280> of<00:06:32.310> reversed<00:06:32.669> that

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:32.910 
because we've kind of reversed that

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.170 
because we've kind of reversed that
spectrum<00:06:33.479> on<00:06:33.600> the<00:06:33.690> bottom

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
spectrum on the bottom

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.320 
spectrum on the bottom
and<00:06:34.270> so<00:06:34.990> you<00:06:35.050> have<00:06:35.410> the<00:06:35.530> higher<00:06:35.910> energy<00:06:36.910> levels

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
and so you have the higher energy levels

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.380 
and so you have the higher energy levels
most<00:06:38.170> easily<00:06:38.440> removed<00:06:39.250> the<00:06:39.550> lowest<00:06:39.880> binding

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.390 
most easily removed the lowest binding

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.870 
most easily removed the lowest binding
level<00:06:41.040> looking<00:06:42.040> like<00:06:42.190> it's<00:06:42.370> farther<00:06:42.730> to<00:06:42.850> the

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 
level looking like it's farther to the

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.340 
level looking like it's farther to the
right<00:06:42.970> because<00:06:43.780> we've<00:06:44.140> reversed<00:06:44.650> that<00:06:46.350> scale

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:47.350 
right because we've reversed that scale

00:06:47.350 --> 00:07:11.950 
right because we've reversed that scale
on<00:06:47.740> the<00:06:48.010> x-axis

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.020
