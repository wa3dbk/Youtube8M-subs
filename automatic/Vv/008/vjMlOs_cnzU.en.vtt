 Hello Nita In the kitchen you are welcome. 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.160
 Today we are going to make milk masala. 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.420
 Milk Masala will not only increase the taste of milk 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.700
 You eat it kheer, kulfi, ice cream 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.100
 You can use it even while making it. 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.420
 Let us see what we need as a milk masala. 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.260
 We need to make milk masala 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.280
 50 grams almonds, 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.380
 50 grams pistachios, 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.620
 1. 1/2 small leather jaffer 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.660
 This jerry can be found in any grocery store. 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.460
 This jaffer we have grinded in the mixer 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.800
 And by grinding we have made its powder. 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.840
 10 grams of green cardamom, 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.800
 And 1/2 grams of saffron 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.420
 First we will take a pan and turn on the gas 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:10.280
 And we will fill almonds and pistachios a little bit. 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:19.180
 After running it 2-4 times, we will now put cardamom in it. 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.900
 Now you will see a slow smile has started. 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.020
 Now we will bind it. 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.460
 We will not roast it a lot, we will take it lightly 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.540
 And it'll get out 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.200
 We have tied the gas and our pan is too hot 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.100
 Now we will put saffron leaves in it. 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.160
 And the jaifer will dal. 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.060
 And keep it on this pan for two minutes. 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.940
 Now we have a mixture of a mixture which we 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.500
 We will grind almonds, pistachios and cardamom that we were roasted. 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.120
 After grinding it, 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.960
 Which we kept warm for 2 minutes 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.280
 That too we will get involved in it. 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.660
 And once again the mixer will run. 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.880
 Very sweet smile. 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.020
 Now see our milk masala in a few minutes 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.660
 Be ready. 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.780
 See how cute it's color is. 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.460
 Now our milk is ready as a spice. 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.880
 You will see that it is very cheap from the market. 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.860
 You can refrigerate it in air-box. 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.300
 And whenever you want to use it 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.960

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.700
