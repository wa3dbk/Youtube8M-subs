00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.950 
morning which are the triggermen
naturals<00:01:28.210> that<00:01:29.080> apparently<00:01:30.600> they<00:01:31.600> said<00:01:31.840> that

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960

they make hair 10 times stronger after

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.090 
they make hair 10 times stronger after
the<00:01:33.970> first<00:01:34.180> use<00:01:34.510> which<00:01:35.260> I<00:01:35.350> think<00:01:35.560> if<00:01:35.830> that's

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
the first use which I think if that's

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.240 
the first use which I think if that's
true<00:01:36.340> that's<00:01:36.580> pretty<00:01:36.910> amazing<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:39.130> they

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
true that's pretty amazing so they

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.900 
true that's pretty amazing so they
haven't<00:01:39.430> got<00:01:39.610> sulfates<00:01:40.120> in<00:01:40.360> them<00:01:40.510> are<00:01:40.780> silicon

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
haven't got sulfates in them are silicon

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.310 
haven't got sulfates in them are silicon
it<00:01:42.910> says<00:01:43.120> the<00:01:43.479> competition<00:01:43.930> has<00:01:43.990> not<00:01:44.170> got

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
it says the competition has not got

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.080 
it says the competition has not got
silicone<00:01:44.560> this<00:01:44.979> one<00:01:45.100> hasn't<00:01:45.250> got<00:01:45.400> sulfate<00:01:45.820> so

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
silicone this one hasn't got sulfate so

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.660 
silicone this one hasn't got sulfate so
I<00:01:46.330> think<00:01:46.780> sulfates<00:01:47.500> wash<00:01:47.680> out<00:01:47.920> hair<00:01:47.979> color<00:01:48.430> so

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
I think sulfates wash out hair color so

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.940 
I think sulfates wash out hair color so
the<00:01:48.820> fact<00:01:49.000> that<00:01:49.090> this<00:01:49.270> hasn't<00:01:49.600> got<00:01:49.720> it<00:01:49.810> in

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
the fact that this hasn't got it in

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.130 
the fact that this hasn't got it in
that's<00:01:50.950> brilliant<00:01:51.330> this<00:01:52.330> a<00:01:52.360> massive<00:01:52.840> for<00:01:53.020> like

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
that's brilliant this a massive for like

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.170 
that's brilliant this a massive for like
nine<00:01:53.650> hundred<00:01:53.680> mil<00:01:55.170> massive<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.850> these<00:01:57.970> were

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
nine hundred mil massive so these were

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.930 
nine hundred mil massive so these were
two<00:01:58.690> for<00:01:59.050> 599<00:01:59.590> so<00:02:00.130> I<00:02:00.340> thought<00:02:00.520> that<00:02:00.580> was<00:02:00.729> quite

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
two for 599 so I thought that was quite

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.850 
two for 599 so I thought that was quite
a<00:02:01.000> good<00:02:01.330> buy<00:02:01.509> for<00:02:01.540> how<00:02:01.869> big<00:02:02.140> these<00:02:02.350> things<00:02:02.650> are
