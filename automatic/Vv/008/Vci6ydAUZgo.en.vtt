speech<00:02:09.130> you<00:02:09.670> know<00:02:09.759> just<00:02:10.030> like<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.179> start<00:02:10.450> of

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
speech you know just like the start of

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.780 
speech you know just like the start of
it<00:02:10.600> but<00:02:11.380> you<00:02:11.470> know<00:02:11.500> is<00:02:11.739> really<00:02:12.040> kind<00:02:12.250> of<00:02:12.400> you

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
it but you know is really kind of you

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.069 
it but you know is really kind of you
could<00:02:12.910> feel<00:02:13.150> it<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.630> was<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.870> lot<00:02:14.049> more

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:14.079 
could feel it and it was a lot more

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:15.479 
could feel it and it was a lot more
emotion<00:02:14.530> especially<00:02:14.769> the<00:02:15.070> instruments<00:02:15.459> I

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
emotion especially the instruments I

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:16.440 
emotion especially the instruments I
think<00:02:15.700> that's<00:02:15.850> what<00:02:16.000> made<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.269> lot<00:02:16.390> better

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
think that's what made it a lot better

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.810 
think that's what made it a lot better
for<00:02:16.780> me<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:18.010> know<00:02:18.100> it<00:02:18.130> just<00:02:18.280> built<00:02:18.610> on<00:02:18.760> the

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
for me and you know it just built on the

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.740 
for me and you know it just built on the
story<00:02:18.880> you<00:02:19.180> know<00:02:19.269> that's<00:02:19.420> what<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.570> like<00:02:19.690> about

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
story you know that's what I like about

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.810 
story you know that's what I like about
the<00:02:19.959> concept<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:20.680> kind<00:02:20.890> of<00:02:20.920> builds<00:02:21.130> on<00:02:21.610> this

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
the concept it kind of builds on this

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.250 
the concept it kind of builds on this
story<00:02:22.090> that<00:02:22.239> keeps<00:02:22.420> going<00:02:22.720> through<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:22.959> album

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
story that keeps going through the album

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.780 
story that keeps going through the album
and<00:02:23.410> again<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.070> just<00:02:24.100> makes<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:24.519> really

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
and again it just makes it really

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.520 
and again it just makes it really
enjoyable<00:02:25.299> the<00:02:25.570> album<00:02:25.840> features<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.200> lot<00:02:26.440> of

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
enjoyable the album features a lot of

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.020 
enjoyable the album features a lot of
really<00:02:26.739> great<00:02:26.860> songs<00:02:27.220> but<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:27.760> get<00:02:27.880> into

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
expected to go so good but there's a

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.110 
expected to go so good but there's a
part<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.540> song<00:02:55.750> where<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.950> Andy<00:02:57.879> and

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
part of the song where the Andy and

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.819 
part of the song where the Andy and
Burt's<00:02:58.329> voice<00:02:58.780> overlap<00:02:59.290> maybe<00:02:59.590> halfway

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
Burt's voice overlap maybe halfway

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.649 
Burt's voice overlap maybe halfway
through<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:00.340> you<00:03:00.670> got<00:03:01.060> to<00:03:01.150> pay<00:03:01.239> attention<00:03:01.269> to

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
through and you got to pay attention to

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.119 
through and you got to pay attention to
it<00:03:01.720> but<00:03:01.930> if<00:03:02.019> you<00:03:02.319> listen<00:03:02.470> it's<00:03:02.709> really<00:03:02.950> awesome

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
it but if you listen it's really awesome

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.059 
it but if you listen it's really awesome
and<00:03:03.489> they<00:03:04.000> they<00:03:04.540> go<00:03:04.720> so<00:03:04.989> well<00:03:05.140> together<00:03:05.290> in<00:03:05.739> my

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
and they they go so well together in my

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.160 
and they they go so well together in my
opinion<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.579> I<00:03:07.329> think<00:03:07.629> it's<00:03:07.750> one<00:03:07.900> of<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.019> last
