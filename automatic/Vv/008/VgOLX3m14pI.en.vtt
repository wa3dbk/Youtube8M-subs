00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
cuz I to me I thought to myself you know

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.340 
cuz I to me I thought to myself you know
he<00:01:41.909> was<00:01:41.970> probably<00:01:42.210> talent<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.960> crustal

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
he was probably talent to the crustal

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.480 
he was probably talent to the crustal
thinking<00:01:43.590> I'm<00:01:43.649> gonna<00:01:43.770> go<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.070> stuff<00:01:44.250> Fox

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
thinking I'm gonna go for the stuff Fox

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.030 
thinking I'm gonna go for the stuff Fox
Nicki<00:01:44.759> no<00:01:45.090> se<00:01:45.270> exchange<00:01:45.570> his<00:01:45.810> drugs<00:01:46.079> but<00:01:46.829> he

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
Nicki no se exchange his drugs but he

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.270 
Nicki no se exchange his drugs but he
has<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.340> weakness<00:01:47.670> policy<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.280> crustal

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
has the weakness policy on the crustal

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.490 
has the weakness policy on the crustal
so<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.399> think<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.909> his<00:01:51.210> mind<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.750> was<00:01:51.899> gonna<00:01:52.049> he's
