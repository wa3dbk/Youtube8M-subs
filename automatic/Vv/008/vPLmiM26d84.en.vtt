THE PRACTICAL GUY

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.460
Welcome to my video

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.840
Today I'm going to show you how to make a water pump

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:31.020
I will use a bottle, 3 plastic straws, silicon, a lighter, tape, scissors and two glasses

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.940
One of the glasses need to be placed on a higher platform

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.960
Tape two straws to each other

00:01:07.675 --> 00:01:11.395
Two straws need to fit together perfectly 

00:01:11.395 --> 00:01:12.962
They will become one straw

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.440
Make two holes on the lid of the bottle

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.400
The straws need to fit the holes

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.220
Place both the longer straw you taped and the other 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.900
the longer one should be placed the way you see

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.120
Place the straws exactly the way I did

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.280
Melt the silicon and use it to close the tiny bits of the holes on the lid 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.040
However, there's already one which is ready

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.930
I made it before the video

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:58.260
Put the short straw into the glass which stands on a platform

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.140
And the longer straw into the other glass

00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:16.778
it's simple

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.687
the other glass is being filled 

00:03:26.574 --> 00:03:28.574
Take a closer look 

00:03:31.657 --> 00:03:33.657
See how the level of water decreases

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.820
This is it

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.720
Homemade water pump!
