lick is the same there we go
seven<00:05:27.849> times<00:05:28.029> seven<00:05:29.939> times<00:05:30.939> seven<00:05:31.619> ten<00:05:32.619> on<00:05:32.739> the

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
seven times seven times seven ten on the

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:48.779 
seven times seven times seven ten on the
a<00:05:37.589> 10-9<00:05:38.589> Center

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:52.930 

so<00:05:49.789> one<00:05:50.449> whole<00:05:50.659> round
