mean by that is inside this is there's

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.959 
mean by that is inside this is there's
multiple<00:00:40.950> inserts<00:00:41.430> with<00:00:41.640> different

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
multiple inserts with different

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.090 
multiple inserts with different
densities<00:00:42.480> what<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.840> allows<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.290> do<00:00:43.559> is

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
densities what that allows you to do is

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.310 
densities what that allows you to do is
change<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.789> inserts<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.989> different

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
change the inserts for the different

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.810 
change the inserts for the different
density<00:00:46.680> depending<00:00:47.039> on<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.280> shooter<00:00:47.579> what

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
density depending on the shooter what

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.369 
density depending on the shooter what
that'll<00:00:48.090> do<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.239> if<00:00:48.809> you're<00:00:48.960> shootin<00:00:49.230> we've

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
more dense up front and allows the arrow

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.170 
more dense up front and allows the arrow
to<00:00:55.350> penetrate<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.949> little<00:00:56.160> bit<00:00:56.280> less<00:00:56.489> if<00:00:57.000> you

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180

softer ones in there and that way

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.520 
softer ones in there and that way
they're<00:01:00.420> gonna<00:01:00.480> get<00:01:00.660> penetration<00:01:01.109> as<00:01:01.350> well

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
they're gonna get penetration as well

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.529 
they're gonna get penetration as well
and<00:01:01.649> even<00:01:01.710> bill<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.010> see<00:01:02.129> what's<00:01:02.309> going<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
and even bill to see what's going on the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.000 
and even bill to see what's going on the
cool<00:01:03.719> thing<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.989> like<00:01:04.140> about<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.500> target<00:01:04.890> is

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
cool thing I like about this target is

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.010 
cool thing I like about this target is
once<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.850> shoot<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.270> into<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> target<00:01:06.840> you

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
once you shoot it into the target you

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.570 
once you shoot it into the target you
can<00:01:07.200> remove<00:01:07.439> your<00:01:07.650> arrow<00:01:07.920> off<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.340> there<00:01:08.460> just

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
can remove your arrow off of there just

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.190 
can remove your arrow off of there just
through<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.850> arrow<00:01:09.000> off<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.930> could<00:01:10.080> then

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
through the arrow off you could then

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.810 
through the arrow off you could then
pull<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.590> inserts<00:01:10.979> out<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.490> get<00:01:11.640> your

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
pull the inserts out and get your

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.580 
pull the inserts out and get your
broadhead<00:01:12.180> out<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.540> way<00:01:12.720> for<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.350> fixed

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
broadhead out that way for the fixed

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
broadhead out that way for the fixed
plagues<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.979> really<00:01:14.159> doesn't<00:01:14.460> make<00:01:14.549> a

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
plagues it really doesn't make a

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.070 
plagues it really doesn't make a
difference<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:15.090> for<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.390> mechanicals<00:01:15.990> it

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
difference but for the mechanicals it

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.450 
difference but for the mechanicals it
definitely<00:01:16.409> does<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.740> they<00:01:16.890> get<00:01:16.979> hung<00:01:17.220> up<00:01:17.369> in

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
definitely does is they get hung up in

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.440 
definitely does is they get hung up in
there<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.700> that's<00:01:17.790> how<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.000> end<00:01:18.090> up<00:01:18.270> ripping

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
there and that's how you end up ripping

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.120 
there and that's how you end up ripping
your<00:01:18.630> blades<00:01:18.900> out<00:01:19.110> by<00:01:19.619> doing<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.070> way

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
your blades out by doing it this way

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.440 
your blades out by doing it this way
you're<00:01:20.400> going<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.610> get<00:01:20.700> into<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.000> target<00:01:21.210> eat

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
you're going to get into the target eat

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.850 
you're going to get into the target eat
your<00:01:21.630> blade<00:01:21.810> out<00:01:21.840> without<00:01:22.170> damaging<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
your blade out without damaging the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.160 
your blade out without damaging the
broad<00:01:23.070> head<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:24.450> other<00:01:24.540> thing<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.020> like

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.420 
and you get individuals of different
densities<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.780> want<00:01:34.079> they're<00:01:34.439> all<00:01:34.560> color

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
densities you want they're all color

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.590 
densities you want they're all color
coded<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.850> you'll<00:01:36.090> know<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.299> different

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
coded so you'll know the different

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.630 
coded so you'll know the different
densities<00:01:37.020> inside<00:01:37.409> here<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:38.340> other<00:01:38.460> thing

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
densities inside here the other thing

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.090 
densities inside here the other thing
that's<00:01:38.759> neat<00:01:39.000> too<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.360> once<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.720> get<00:01:39.990> into<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
that's neat too is once you get into the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.950 
that's neat too is once you get into the
target<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:42.030> pull<00:01:42.210> your<00:01:42.360> insert<00:01:42.630> out<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.840> can

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
target you pull your insert out you can

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.929 
target you pull your insert out you can
actually<00:01:43.079> see<00:01:43.380> for<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.590> mechanical<00:01:44.220> where<00:01:44.790> it

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
actually see for a mechanical where it

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.550 
actually see for a mechanical where it
opened<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.450> how<00:01:45.570> big<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.899> cut<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.470> what

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
opened and how big the cut is and what

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.520 
opened and how big the cut is and what
its<00:01:46.710> gonna<00:01:46.829> look<00:01:46.920> like<00:01:47.070> inside<00:01:48.200> really<00:01:49.200> cool

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530

back here and now that we know that

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.690 
back here and now that we know that
Kevin's<00:02:23.470> first<00:02:23.709> shots<00:02:24.010> gonna<00:02:24.280> be<00:02:24.520> with<00:02:24.670> a

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
Kevin's first shots gonna be with a

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.500 
Kevin's first shots gonna be with a
fixed<00:02:25.060> blade

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
fixed blade

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.300 
fixed blade
we<00:02:25.660> got<00:02:25.780> fixed<00:02:26.080> plate<00:02:26.260> here<00:02:26.500> we<00:02:26.770> know<00:02:27.130> we're

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
we got fixed plate here we know we're

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.400 
we got fixed plate here we know we're
gonna<00:02:27.459> use<00:02:27.730> fix<00:02:28.300> plate<00:02:28.540> -<00:02:28.720> yalla<00:02:28.959> file<00:02:29.230> by

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
gonna use fix plate - yalla file by

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.170 
gonna use fix plate - yalla file by
three<00:02:29.650> white<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:30.489> that's<00:02:30.580> what<00:02:30.730> we<00:02:30.819> have<00:02:30.970> -

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
three white so that's what we have -

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.840 
three white so that's what we have -
yellow<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.720> then<00:02:31.840> three<00:02:32.080> white<00:02:32.760> so<00:02:33.760> we're

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
yellow and then three white so we're

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.229 
yellow and then three white so we're
gonna<00:02:33.970> slide<00:02:34.270> this<00:02:34.480> back<00:02:34.720> in<00:02:35.970> make<00:02:36.970> sure<00:02:37.000> we

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
gonna slide this back in make sure we

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.440 
gonna slide this back in make sure we
get<00:02:37.360> it<00:02:37.480> in<00:02:37.600> there<00:02:37.690> nice<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:37.959> tight<00:02:39.150> okay<00:02:40.150> real

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
get it in there nice and tight okay real

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.180 
get it in there nice and tight okay real
simple<00:02:40.900> we<00:02:41.530> go<00:02:41.650> ahead<00:02:41.709> and<00:02:41.800> close<00:02:41.980> the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
simple we go ahead and close the

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:59.190 
simple we go ahead and close the
trapdoor<00:02:42.670> here

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.010 

so<00:02:59.680> again<00:02:59.920> we<00:03:00.099> did<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.280> fix<00:03:00.580> plane<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.840> go<00:03:01.959> to

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
so again we did a fix plane and go to

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.630 
so again we did a fix plane and go to
the<00:03:02.200> fixed<00:03:02.440> plate<00:03:02.530> side

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.670 

there<00:03:07.210> we<00:03:07.300> go<00:03:07.420> that's<00:03:07.930> pretty<00:03:08.140> cool<00:03:08.410> he's<00:03:08.590> got

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
there we go that's pretty cool he's got

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.670 
there we go that's pretty cool he's got
just<00:03:09.010> closed<00:03:09.250> braids<00:03:09.490> back<00:03:09.700> up<00:03:10.319> this<00:03:11.319> goes<00:03:11.560> to

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
just closed braids back up this goes to

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.900 
just closed braids back up this goes to
show<00:03:11.860> it's<00:03:12.040> gonna<00:03:12.160> last<00:03:12.370> you<00:03:12.520> a<00:03:12.580> very<00:03:12.610> long

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
time you see where we hit it there the

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.199 
time you see where we hit it there the
little<00:03:15.100> cut<00:03:15.400> but<00:03:15.550> look<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:15.790> looks<00:03:15.940> like<00:03:16.060> it's

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
little cut but look it looks like it's

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.000 
little cut but look it looks like it's
almost<00:03:16.300> disappeared<00:03:16.990> that<00:03:17.200> quick<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:17.680> that

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
almost disappeared that quick and that

almost disappeared that quick and that
was<00:03:18.069> with<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.310> fixed<00:03:18.610> plate<00:03:18.819> at<00:03:19.030> 15<00:03:20.340> so<00:03:21.340> we'll<00:03:21.459> go

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
was with a fixed plate at 15 so we'll go

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.949 
was with a fixed plate at 15 so we'll go
ahead<00:03:21.610> now<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:21.940> we're<00:03:22.390> gonna<00:03:22.480> flip<00:03:22.750> it<00:03:22.840> around

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
ahead now and we're gonna flip it around

ahead now and we're gonna flip it around
have<00:03:23.770> him<00:03:23.920> shoot<00:03:24.130> a<00:03:24.190> mechanical<00:03:24.730> side<00:03:25.020> again

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
have him shoot a mechanical side again

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.690 
have him shoot a mechanical side again
they<00:03:26.170> have<00:03:26.290> it<00:03:26.380> set<00:03:26.590> up<00:03:26.620> for<00:03:26.890> the<00:03:26.950> mechanical<00:03:27.490> a

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
they have it set up for the mechanical a

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.970 
they have it set up for the mechanical a
little<00:03:28.090> stiffer<00:03:28.330> on<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.630> side<00:03:28.840> so<00:03:29.170> see<00:03:29.830> how<00:03:29.920> it

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
little stiffer on the side so see how it

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:44.020 
little stiffer on the side so see how it
goes

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.180 

let's<00:03:44.450> glad<00:03:44.660> to<00:03:44.720> shoot<00:03:44.900> a<00:03:44.990> real<00:03:45.200> mechanical

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
let's glad to shoot a real mechanical

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:58.020 
let's glad to shoot a real mechanical
broadhead<00:03:46.550> now

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.150 

all<00:03:58.510> right<00:03:58.660> so<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:58.930> first<00:03:59.140> shot<00:03:59.380> we<00:03:59.950> have<00:04:00.070> the

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
all right so the first shot we have the

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.670 
all right so the first shot we have the
Raven<00:04:00.550> 2.3<00:04:01.450> inch<00:04:01.570> cut<00:04:01.810> you<00:04:02.140> can<00:04:02.230> see<00:04:02.320> there's

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
Raven 2.3 inch cut you can see there's

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.250 
Raven 2.3 inch cut you can see there's
your<00:04:02.830> cut<00:04:03.070> you<00:04:03.880> can<00:04:04.000> see<00:04:04.060> also<00:04:04.420> the<00:04:04.630> head<00:04:05.080> where

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
your cut you can see also the head where

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.590 
your cut you can see also the head where
it<00:04:05.380> goes<00:04:05.530> in<00:04:05.770> the<00:04:05.920> two<00:04:06.100> sides<00:04:06.370> and<00:04:07.180> then<00:04:07.330> above

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
it goes in the two sides and then above

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.770 
it goes in the two sides and then above
here<00:04:07.840> we<00:04:07.960> got<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.320> carving<00:04:08.860> Express<00:04:09.780> head

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
here we got the carving Express head

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.690 
here we got the carving Express head
that's<00:04:11.560> got<00:04:11.830> it's<00:04:12.010> just<00:04:12.160> one<00:04:12.520> of<00:04:12.580> their

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
that's got it's just one of their

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.810 
that's got it's just one of their
mechanicals<00:04:13.420> they<00:04:13.540> got<00:04:14.400> let's<00:04:15.400> go<00:04:15.520> and<00:04:15.670> pull

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
mechanicals they got let's go and pull

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.970 
mechanicals they got let's go and pull
them<00:04:15.970> out

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
them out

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.330 
them out
however<00:04:17.980> Express<00:04:18.310> came<00:04:18.579> right<00:04:18.730> out<00:04:20.340> rubber

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
however Express came right out rubber

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.890 
however Express came right out rubber
band<00:04:21.579> still<00:04:21.820> attached<00:04:22.120> and<00:04:22.390> now<00:04:22.540> let's<00:04:22.690> do<00:04:22.810> the

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
band still attached and now let's do the

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.360 
band still attached and now let's do the
raven<00:04:24.330> and<00:04:25.330> that<00:04:25.510> came<00:04:25.720> out<00:04:25.950> and<00:04:26.950> actually<00:04:27.310> the

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
raven and that came out and actually the

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.830 
raven and that came out and actually the
rubber<00:04:27.580> bands<00:04:27.760> still<00:04:27.970> on<00:04:28.120> it<00:04:28.240> you<00:04:28.540> can<00:04:28.690> go

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
rubber bands still on it you can go

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.470 
rubber bands still on it you can go
ahead<00:04:28.900> and<00:04:28.990> shoot<00:04:29.350> this<00:04:29.530> one<00:04:30.270> so<00:04:31.270> there<00:04:31.419> you

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
ahead and shoot this one so there you

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.300 
ahead and shoot this one so there you
have<00:04:31.510> it<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:32.080> transform<00:04:32.770> from<00:04:32.890> bates<00:04:33.130> our

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
have it the transform from bates our

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.280 
have it the transform from bates our
targets<00:04:33.730> go<00:04:33.850> to<00:04:33.910> big<00:04:34.090> shot<00:04:34.300> targets<00:04:34.660> comm<00:04:35.110> to
