motor fail to take this off you have
these<00:02:29.900> little<00:02:30.200> tabs<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:33.920> you<00:02:33.950> just<00:02:34.220> have<00:02:34.400> to

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
these little tabs so you just have to

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:43.259 
these little tabs so you just have to
give<00:02:35.180> a<00:02:35.209> push<00:02:35.720> forward<00:02:39.940> unclip<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.120> end

funky smell from the evaporator because

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.039 
funky smell from the evaporator because
some<00:03:26.010> bacteria<00:03:26.639> is<00:03:27.209> actually<00:03:27.719> starting<00:03:28.019> to

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
some bacteria is actually starting to

some bacteria is actually starting to
grow<00:03:28.319> on<00:03:28.439> the<00:03:28.769> evaporator<00:03:29.069> and<00:03:29.700> it<00:03:30.030> can

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
grow on the evaporator and it can

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.360 
grow on the evaporator and it can
actually<00:03:30.389> be<00:03:30.599> pretty<00:03:30.629> foul<00:03:31.139> sometimes<00:03:31.739> so

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
actually be pretty foul sometimes so

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.839 
actually be pretty foul sometimes so
this<00:03:32.489> is<00:03:32.609> a<00:03:32.639> great<00:03:32.969> way<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:33.269> actually<00:03:33.420> access

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
this is a great way it actually access

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.580 
this is a great way it actually access
the<00:03:35.849> evaporator<00:03:36.659> without<00:03:37.049> taking<00:03:37.379> the<00:03:37.439> whole

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
the evaporator without taking the whole

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.679 
the evaporator without taking the whole
dash<00:03:37.829> out<00:03:38.159> you<00:03:38.670> spray<00:03:38.969> it<00:03:39.090> right<00:03:39.269> in<00:03:39.480> there

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:39.689 
dash out you spray it right in there

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:41.899 
dash out you spray it right in there
make<00:03:40.439> sure<00:03:40.469> that<00:03:40.920> you<00:03:41.129> roll<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.549> windows<00:03:41.879> down

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
make sure that you roll the windows down

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.899 
make sure that you roll the windows down
and<00:03:42.359> vent<00:03:42.599> the<00:03:42.659> vehicle<00:03:43.079> really<00:03:43.379> well<00:03:43.879> so<00:03:44.879> you

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:44.909 
and vent the vehicle really well so you

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:53.660 
and vent the vehicle really well so you
don't<00:03:45.090> pass<00:03:45.269> that<00:03:45.480> one<00:03:45.689> drive

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.869 

you

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.670 

it<00:03:59.269> really<00:03:59.569> does<00:03:59.750> make<00:03:59.959> a<00:04:00.019> good<00:04:00.260> difference

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
it really does make a good difference

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.899 
it really does make a good difference
and<00:04:01.329> can<00:04:02.329> eliminate<00:04:02.599> those<00:04:02.989> odors<00:04:03.760> you<00:04:04.760> want

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:04.909 
and can eliminate those odors you want

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:06.399 
and can eliminate those odors you want
to<00:04:05.000> keep<00:04:05.090> this<00:04:05.239> area<00:04:05.450> clean<00:04:05.870> too<00:04:06.109> because

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:06.409 
to keep this area clean too because

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:08.740 
to keep this area clean too because
actually<00:04:06.769> actually<00:04:07.340> that's<00:04:07.549> a<00:04:07.790> big<00:04:08.450> reason

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
actually actually that's a big reason

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.670 
actually actually that's a big reason
why<00:04:08.989> those<00:04:09.950> smells<00:04:10.700> occur<00:04:11.090> is<00:04:11.349> some<00:04:12.349> debris

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
why those smells occur is some debris

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.380 
why those smells occur is some debris

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
actually does still work its way into

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.900 
actually does still work its way into
the<00:04:14.689> system<00:04:15.079> and<00:04:15.500> you<00:04:15.560> know<00:04:16.430> you<00:04:16.489> a<00:04:16.759> lot<00:04:16.850> of
