00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:02.859 
rolling you feel some support coming

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:03.870 
rolling you feel some support coming
through<00:02:03.009> and<00:02:03.130> that's<00:02:03.249> the<00:02:03.340> hydraulic

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
through and that's the hydraulic

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.250 
through and that's the hydraulic
suspension<00:02:04.030> so

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
suspension so

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.440 
suspension so
yeah<00:02:06.860> interesting<00:02:07.100> I've<00:02:07.610> got<00:02:07.790> quite<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.090> soft

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
yeah interesting I've got quite a soft

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.390 
yeah interesting I've got quite a soft
car<00:02:08.930> at<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.230> moment<00:02:09.350> because<00:02:09.920> I've<00:02:10.040> got<00:02:10.220> no

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
car at the moment because I've got no

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.340 
car at the moment because I've got no
roll<00:02:10.580> stiffens<00:02:11.000> everything's<00:02:11.360> set<00:02:11.570> to<00:02:11.600> normal

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
roll stiffens everything's set to normal

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.320 
roll stiffens everything's set to normal
powertrain<00:02:13.220> feels<00:02:13.640> quite<00:02:13.880> ordinary<00:02:14.090> at<00:02:14.270> the

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
powertrain feels quite ordinary at the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.120 
powertrain feels quite ordinary at the
moment<00:02:14.600> I've<00:02:14.690> not<00:02:14.870> got<00:02:15.020> much<00:02:15.200> noise<00:02:15.500> doesn't

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
moment I've not got much noise doesn't

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.950 
moment I've not got much noise doesn't
really<00:02:16.250> sound<00:02:16.460> like<00:02:16.610> a<00:02:16.700> v8<00:02:17.030> throttle<00:02:17.870> response

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
really sound like a v8 throttle response

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.480 
really sound like a v8 throttle response
is<00:02:18.380> quite<00:02:18.800> lazy

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
is quite lazy

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.730 
is quite lazy
and<00:02:19.880> it<00:02:19.970> doesn't<00:02:20.150> want<00:02:20.240> to<00:02:20.300> kick<00:02:20.480> that<00:02:20.660> much

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
and it doesn't want to kick that much

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.180 
and it doesn't want to kick that much

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
[Music]

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.150 
[Music]
so<00:02:25.820> I<00:02:25.850> changed<00:02:26.240> from<00:02:26.390> active<00:02:27.020> and<00:02:27.920> I'm<00:02:28.070> gonna

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
so I changed from active and I'm gonna

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.360 
so I changed from active and I'm gonna
move<00:02:28.430> from<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.820> normal<00:02:29.210> setting<00:02:29.570> to<00:02:29.870> sport<00:02:30.800> in

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
move from the normal setting to sport in

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.630 
move from the normal setting to sport in
both<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:32.600> I'm<00:02:32.720> gonna<00:02:32.810> have<00:02:33.050> a<00:02:33.340> manual<00:02:34.340> gear

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
both and I'm gonna have a manual gear

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.680 
both and I'm gonna have a manual gear
change<00:02:34.670> now<00:02:35.210> let's<00:02:36.200> try<00:02:36.350> that

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
change now let's try that

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.290 
change now let's try that
now<00:02:38.200> immediately<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:39.160> powertrain<00:02:39.640> sounds

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
now immediately the powertrain sounds

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.940 
now immediately the powertrain sounds
different<00:02:40.720> of<00:02:40.870> what<00:02:41.050> more<00:02:41.320> induction<00:02:41.800> noise

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
different of what more induction noise

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.580 
different of what more induction noise
and<00:02:42.550> I've<00:02:42.670> got<00:02:42.990> very<00:02:43.990> different<00:02:44.290> fought

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
and I've got very different fought

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.020 
and I've got very different fought
Ulrich's<00:02:45.070> and<00:02:45.550> of<00:02:45.640> course<00:02:45.760> I'm<00:02:45.880> now

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
Ulrich's and of course I'm now

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.170 
Ulrich's and of course I'm now
controlling<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.630> gearbox<00:02:47.050> manually

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
controlling the gearbox manually

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.460 
controlling the gearbox manually
steering<00:02:49.180> doesn't<00:02:49.960> feel<00:02:50.110> a<00:02:50.140> whole<00:02:50.410> lot

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
steering doesn't feel a whole lot

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.290 
steering doesn't feel a whole lot
different<00:02:51.130> but<00:02:51.190> you<00:02:51.280> can<00:02:51.460> feel<00:02:51.670> immediately

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
different but you can feel immediately

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.930 
different but you can feel immediately
there's<00:02:52.750> a<00:02:52.840> level<00:02:53.050> of<00:02:53.200> support<00:02:53.620> and<00:02:53.890> yeah<00:02:54.460> you

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
there's a level of support and yeah you

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:55.890 
there's a level of support and yeah you
get<00:02:55.090> that<00:02:55.210> engine<00:02:55.450> nice

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
get that engine nice

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.030 
get that engine nice
I<00:02:55.930> am<00:02:56.490> got<00:02:57.490> its<00:02:57.700> fast<00:02:58.530> still<00:02:59.530> not<00:02:59.740> that

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
I am got its fast still not that

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.560 
I am got its fast still not that
aggressive<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.640> mean<00:03:00.670> this<00:03:00.910> does<00:03:01.060> not<00:03:01.240> feel

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
aggressive I mean this does not feel

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.850 
aggressive I mean this does not feel
like<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:01.840> four<00:03:02.080> five<00:03:02.230> eight<00:03:02.380> of<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.560> moment

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
like a four five eight of the moment

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.950 
like a four five eight of the moment
this<00:03:03.640> is<00:03:03.790> interesting<00:03:04.330> now<00:03:04.450> with<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.750> roll

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
this is interesting now with the roll

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.100 
this is interesting now with the roll
stiffness<00:03:05.620> of<00:03:05.770> the<00:03:05.890> car<00:03:06.180> I've<00:03:07.180> still<00:03:07.570> got<00:03:07.840> an

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
stiffness of the car I've still got an

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.680 
stiffness of the car I've still got an
amazingly<00:03:08.620> compliant<00:03:09.280> ride<00:03:09.370> over<00:03:10.270> the<00:03:10.360> bumps

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
amazingly compliant ride over the bumps

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.330 
amazingly compliant ride over the bumps
down<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:10.990> straights<00:03:11.320> at<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:11.890> moment<00:03:12.130> I<00:03:12.160> pitch

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
down the straights at the moment I pitch

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.640 
down the straights at the moment I pitch
the<00:03:12.520> car<00:03:12.760> in<00:03:12.970> I<00:03:13.150> can<00:03:13.420> actually<00:03:13.540> feel<00:03:14.050> all<00:03:14.410> that

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
the car in I can actually feel all that

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.280 
the car in I can actually feel all that
support<00:03:15.070> coming<00:03:15.520> up

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
support coming up

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.649 
support coming up
I've<00:03:17.890> definitely<00:03:18.129> got<00:03:18.519> more<00:03:18.939> flipping

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:19.659 
I've definitely got more flipping

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:22.350 
I've definitely got more flipping
allowed<00:03:19.900> by<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.200> chassis<00:03:20.709> so<00:03:20.939> what<00:03:21.939> car<00:03:22.180> have

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
allowed by the chassis so what car have

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.660 
allowed by the chassis so what car have
I<00:03:22.390> got<00:03:22.720> at<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:22.900> moment<00:03:23.079> then<00:03:23.379> in<00:03:23.530> in<00:03:23.829> in<00:03:24.069> sport

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
I got at the moment then in in in sport

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.429 
I got at the moment then in in in sport
mode<00:03:24.760> with<00:03:25.090> a<00:03:25.150> manual<00:03:25.420> gearbox<00:03:25.599> I'd<00:03:26.049> say<00:03:26.290> I've

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:26.439 
mode with a manual gearbox I'd say I've

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.880 
mode with a manual gearbox I'd say I've
got<00:03:27.870> something<00:03:28.870> that<00:03:28.989> approximates<00:03:29.260> to<00:03:29.769> uh

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
got something that approximates to uh

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.970 
got something that approximates to uh
sort<00:03:30.220> of<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:30.519> normal<00:03:31.090> 430<00:03:31.480> Ferrari<00:03:32.349> that's<00:03:32.860> what

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
sort of a normal 430 Ferrari that's what

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.309 
sort of a normal 430 Ferrari that's what
I'd<00:03:33.069> say<00:03:33.099> but<00:03:33.730> with<00:03:34.269> a<00:03:34.299> lot<00:03:34.569> more<00:03:34.720> ride<00:03:34.930> comfort

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
I'd say but with a lot more ride comfort

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.649 
I'd say but with a lot more ride comfort
and<00:03:35.500> an<00:03:35.560> ability<00:03:35.769> to<00:03:36.220> to<00:03:36.790> go<00:03:36.909> over<00:03:36.940> bumps<00:03:37.540> that

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:37.659 
and an ability to to go over bumps that

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:40.170 
and an ability to to go over bumps that
you<00:03:37.720> wouldn't<00:03:38.079> believe<00:03:38.260> so<00:03:39.099> now<00:03:39.430> let's<00:03:39.819> go

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
you wouldn't believe so now let's go

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.080 
you wouldn't believe so now let's go
into<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:42.040> last<00:03:42.640> mode<00:03:42.879> which<00:03:43.000> is<00:03:43.120> track<00:03:43.450> mode

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
into the last mode which is track mode

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.300 
into the last mode which is track mode
so<00:03:46.090> track<00:03:46.329> mode<00:03:46.510> gives<00:03:46.750> me<00:03:46.959> maximum<00:03:47.650> supports

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
so track mode gives me maximum supports

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.759 
so track mode gives me maximum supports
on<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.269> chassis<00:03:49.450> for<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:49.930> handling<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:50.409> it

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
on the chassis for the handling and it

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.099 
on the chassis for the handling and it
gives<00:03:51.010> me<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.819> most<00:03:51.970> aggressive<00:03:52.599> powertrain

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
gives me the most aggressive powertrain

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:54.449 
gives me the most aggressive powertrain
settings<00:03:53.440> as<00:03:53.500> well<00:03:53.530> so<00:03:53.769> I've<00:03:53.829> got<00:03:53.950> a<00:03:53.980> fast<00:03:54.250> gear

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
settings as well so I've got a fast gear

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.059
