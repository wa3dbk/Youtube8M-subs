and<00:02:27.200> nest<00:02:27.410> so<00:02:28.010> I<00:02:28.040> thought<00:02:28.250> this<00:02:28.340> is<00:02:28.520> really

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
and nest so I thought this is really

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.040 
and nest so I thought this is really
cute<00:02:28.940> because<00:02:29.090> they<00:02:29.390> do<00:02:29.450> actually<00:02:29.930> like

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
cute because they do actually like

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.420 
cute because they do actually like
chewing<00:02:30.319> on<00:02:30.530> hay<00:02:30.770> products<00:02:31.569> so<00:02:32.569> yay<00:02:33.430> that's

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
chewing on hay products so yay that's

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.949 
chewing on hay products so yay that's
that<00:02:34.700> one<00:02:34.910> and<00:02:35.270> I<00:02:36.020> think<00:02:36.080> that<00:02:36.709> this<00:02:36.950> is<00:02:37.280> the

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
that one and I think that this is the

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.020 
that one and I think that this is the
