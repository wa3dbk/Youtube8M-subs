00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 Hi girls, how are you? I brought the 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.839
 review of another basis is a basis for 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.559
 mycap colleague 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.950
 This is the match veil but I like it 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.730
 much of that basis because it is to the test 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.090
 water for those who sweat a lot 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:23.460
 she is super indicated because she holds 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.199
 for a long time it's pretty dry 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.199
 it comes in plastic packaging 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.239
 she is very little is different from 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.969
 others like a very small shop 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.520
 but it comes 30 ml as well as 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.160
 all other bases are 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.500
 all are 30 mm 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.050
 She has this plastic cap too. 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.600
 She's like a little bishop. 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.629
 It's also cool when it comes to controlling 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:01:01.710
 amount that we put my 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:04.049
 color is the 40 come down here all right 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:10.430
 so it is a base that is not very 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.430
 cheap but look for buy on site 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.040
 she said 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.180
 when I use it is waterproof so 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.790
 so I transfer a lot in the face 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.390
 so I feel she holds it for long. 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.850
 more time than a common base knows 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.650
 so I really like and apply for 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.439
 You see the difference she has a 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:42.689
 really cool coverage 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:45.299
 I like to brush I will use up 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.250
 because she is very special I think with the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.619
 brush gives to us get a jump 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.600
 more natural finish then I go 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.270
 apply for you to see the difference 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.479
 my face and baseless no such we 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.479
 over there 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.430
 I just applied it already is 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.219
 dry on my face 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.379
 very small I can not put most 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:12.510
 from my bases I do not I do not finalize 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.159
 with the powder has a face like to pass 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.950
 because they are wetter but the 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:19.590
 most I leave is of course this 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.840
 even though I think it looks more beautiful 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.719
 without that dusty appearance 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.609
 so it's yours do not pass the dust 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:29.370
 she leaves I think she leaves the skin 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:35.760
 very beautiful also a clear case the student 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:37.739
 better it rained a little bit more 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.280
 clear but I think're ok even the 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.959
 hostel for sale 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.230
 so this is what I like the most about it 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.659
 base is sure to be the duration of it 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.439
 It lasted a lot like this on my skin. 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.209
 same 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:53.730
 it helps to give a controlled in the 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:58.040
 oiliness because it is more 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:01.079
 dyed by them and matte finish knows 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.620
 I think it's a people base for who has 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:06.419
 mixed skin for those with oily skin I 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.120
 I think that whoever has dry skin has to 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:12.239
 moisturize your skin before applying it 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.790
 because I think it can can seal a 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.099
 little did she know that for them and 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.909
 matt does not leave that aspect of 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:24.330
 plaster knows she still covers get mate 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:27.720
 stay cool but with a nice finish 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:30.870
 You know the legal marriage, yes, without staying. 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.289
 very so with that very face 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.419
 rebel knows so I tell you a lot 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.580
 a quick review just to show the 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.289
 difference even I very much hope that 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.120
 did you like 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:43.979
