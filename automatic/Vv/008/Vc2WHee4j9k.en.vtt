is<00:00:15.699> a<00:00:15.879> good<00:00:16.119> example<00:00:19.289> populus<00:00:20.289> deltoides

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
is a good example populus deltoides

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.550 
is a good example populus deltoides
because<00:00:21.820> the<00:00:22.000> leaf<00:00:22.210> is<00:00:22.449> in<00:00:22.840> the<00:00:22.960> shape<00:00:23.200> of<00:00:23.380> a

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
because the leaf is in the shape of a

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.150 
because the leaf is in the shape of a
delta<00:00:23.980> or<00:00:24.160> a<00:00:24.190> triangle<00:00:24.960> but<00:00:25.960> I<00:00:26.320> got<00:00:26.920> a<00:00:26.950> whole

sticky buds which even though it's late
August<00:00:36.930> I'm<00:00:37.930> finding<00:00:38.590> the<00:00:38.710> sticky<00:00:39.069> buds<00:00:39.280> on

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
August I'm finding the sticky buds on

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:40.739 
August I'm finding the sticky buds on
here<00:00:39.760> and<00:00:39.879> that's<00:00:40.030> what<00:00:40.179> they<00:00:40.269> used<00:00:40.480> to<00:00:40.659> make

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:40.749 
here and that's what they used to make

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:43.680 
here and that's what they used to make
balm<00:00:41.050> of<00:00:41.230> Gilead<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:42.730> can<00:00:42.940> use<00:00:43.149> that<00:00:43.420> to

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
balm of Gilead you can use that to

balm of Gilead you can use that to
relieve<00:00:44.589> aching<00:00:44.979> muscles<00:00:45.010> and<00:00:46.559> also<00:00:47.559> the

Bloods themselves and little end twigs
contain<00:00:51.489> a<00:00:51.519> compound<00:00:52.449> that<00:00:53.429> is<00:00:54.429> there<00:00:54.809> it's

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
contain a compound that is there it's

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.540 
contain a compound that is there it's
the<00:00:55.960> equivalent<00:00:56.199> of<00:00:56.499> aspirin<00:00:57.010> I<00:00:57.100> just<00:00:57.280> ate<00:00:57.429> one

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
the equivalent of aspirin I just ate one

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.200 
the equivalent of aspirin I just ate one
of<00:00:57.579> those<00:00:57.760> buds<00:00:58.139> so<00:00:59.139> I've<00:00:59.260> got<00:00:59.469> the<00:01:00.210> sticky

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
of those buds so I've got the sticky

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.410 
of those buds so I've got the sticky
resin<00:01:01.539> all<00:01:01.659> over<00:01:01.839> my<00:01:01.989> teeth

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
resin all over my teeth

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.660 
resin all over my teeth
but<00:01:03.989> there's<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:04.619> another<00:01:04.860> plant<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.549> it's

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
but there's just another plant and it's

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.300 
but there's just another plant and it's
growing<00:01:05.939> right<00:01:06.000> next<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.630> willow<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:07.310> can

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
growing right next to the willow I can

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.149 
growing right next to the willow I can
go<00:01:08.460> down<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.850> trail<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.680> probably<00:01:10.680> name<00:01:10.920> off

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
go down this trail and probably name off

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.600 
go down this trail and probably name off
hundred<00:01:12.060> different<00:01:12.240> plants<00:01:12.899> and<00:01:13.610> probably

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
hundred different plants and probably

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.020 
hundred different plants and probably
give<00:01:14.759> two<00:01:14.939> or<00:01:15.090> three<00:01:15.240> uses<00:01:15.450> for<00:01:15.840> each<00:01:15.899> one<00:01:17.030> I'm

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
give two or three uses for each one I'm

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.370 
give two or three uses for each one I'm
definitely<00:01:18.299> not<00:01:18.600> going<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.840> make<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.259> my

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
definitely not going to make it to my

the trail again directly across from
those<00:01:25.049> Aspen's<00:01:25.649> and<00:01:26.369> here's<00:01:27.060> some<00:01:27.330> stinging

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
those Aspen's and here's some stinging

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.350 
those Aspen's and here's some stinging
nettle<00:01:28.080> growing<00:01:28.439> now<00:01:29.310> stinging<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.119> is

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
nettle growing now stinging that it is

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.029 
nettle growing now stinging that it is
another<00:01:30.750> good<00:01:30.960> planting<00:01:31.409> role<00:01:31.649> because

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
another good planting role because

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:34.429 
another good planting role because
edible<00:01:32.700> leaves<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.299> wouldn't<00:01:33.840> even<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.229> late

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
edible leaves I wouldn't even this late

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.960 
edible leaves I wouldn't even this late
in<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.619> season<00:01:34.710> because<00:01:35.250> from<00:01:35.759> what<00:01:35.909> I

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
in the season because from what I

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.800 
in the season because from what I
understand<00:01:37.159> once<00:01:38.159> nettle<00:01:38.610> gets<00:01:38.850> too<00:01:39.119> big<00:01:39.360> it

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
understand once nettle gets too big it

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.320 
understand once nettle gets too big it
starts<00:01:40.740> developing<00:01:41.009> compounds<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.149> can

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
starts developing compounds that can

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.630 
starts developing compounds that can
cause<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:43.110> some<00:01:43.560> kind<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.890> problems<00:01:44.340> kidney

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
cause you some kind of problems kidney

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.080 
cause you some kind of problems kidney
problem<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.390> liver<00:01:45.630> problems<00:01:46.080> i'm<00:01:46.200> not<00:01:46.409> sure

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
problem is liver problems i'm not sure

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.669 
problem is liver problems i'm not sure
i've<00:01:48.090> seen<00:01:48.330> a<00:01:48.360> few<00:01:48.479> reports<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.229> said<00:01:49.440> that

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
i've seen a few reports that said that

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:52.219 
i've seen a few reports that said that
so<00:01:50.009> once<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.819> gets<00:01:51.030> big<00:01:51.299> once<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.810> gets<00:01:51.959> up<00:01:52.080> in

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
so once it gets big once it gets up in

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.160 
so once it gets big once it gets up in
the<00:01:52.259> summer<00:01:52.560> i<00:01:52.740> don't<00:01:52.920> mess<00:01:53.100> with<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.929> but<00:01:54.929> it's

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
the summer i don't mess with it but it's

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.740 
the summer i don't mess with it but it's
another<00:01:55.470> good<00:01:55.679> cordage<00:01:56.130> plan

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
another good cordage plan

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.880 
another good cordage plan
it<00:01:58.050> goes<00:01:58.230> tall<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.130> straight

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.679 

take<00:02:05.890> those<00:02:06.100> fibers<00:02:06.609> out<00:02:06.759> of<00:02:06.909> there<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:07.299> use

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
take those fibers out of there and use

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.719 
take those fibers out of there and use
it<00:02:07.869> to<00:02:07.990> make<00:02:08.110> rope<00:02:08.410> reportage<00:02:09.039> and<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:09.340> makes<00:02:09.550> a

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
it to make rope reportage and it makes a

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.559 
it to make rope reportage and it makes a
pretty<00:02:09.940> strong<00:02:11.310> rope<00:02:12.310> so<00:02:12.910> it's<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.180> good<00:02:13.360> plan

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
pretty strong rope so it's a good plan

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.259 
pretty strong rope so it's a good plan
to<00:02:13.780> know<00:02:13.959> because<00:02:14.650> it's<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:15.010> great<00:02:15.250> edible<00:02:15.730> for

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
to know because it's a great edible for

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.050 
to know because it's a great edible for
one<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.720> leaves

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.460 

contain<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:20.090> huge<00:02:20.390> amount<00:02:20.660> of<00:02:20.750> protein<00:02:20.990> and

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
contain a huge amount of protein and

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.960 
contain a huge amount of protein and
that's<00:02:21.620> hard<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:22.010> find<00:02:22.190> in<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.490> plant<00:02:22.760> world

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
that's hard to find in the plant world

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.540 
that's hard to find in the plant world
in<00:02:23.300> a<00:02:23.420> green<00:02:23.660> plant<00:02:24.020> so<00:02:24.800> it's<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.100> good<00:02:25.280> plan<00:02:25.490> to

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
in a green plant so it's a good plan to

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.280 
in a green plant so it's a good plan to
know<00:02:25.820> for<00:02:26.000> that<00:02:26.150> because<00:02:26.450> it's<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.840> huge<00:02:27.050> source

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
know for that because it's a huge source

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.290 
know for that because it's a huge source
of<00:02:27.440> protein<00:02:27.890> which<00:02:28.430> is<00:02:28.610> something<00:02:28.850> our<00:02:29.120> body

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
of protein which is something our body

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.350 
of protein which is something our body
needs<00:02:29.720> a<00:02:30.470> lot<00:02:30.650> of
