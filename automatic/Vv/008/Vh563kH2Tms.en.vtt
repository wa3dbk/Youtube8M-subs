hi<00:00:07.589> i'm<00:00:07.769> ali<00:00:08.010> with<00:00:08.250> photography<00:00:08.700> company

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.030 
hi i'm ali with photography company

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.539 
hi i'm ali with photography company
Sunstone<00:00:10.540> Sunstone<00:00:11.200> it<00:00:11.349> is<00:00:11.410> a<00:00:11.500> feldspar<00:00:12.190> stone

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:12.549 
Sunstone Sunstone it is a feldspar stone

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:14.850 
Sunstone Sunstone it is a feldspar stone
that<00:00:13.059> is<00:00:13.179> actually<00:00:13.660> a<00:00:13.690> calcite<00:00:14.410> mineral

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
that is actually a calcite mineral

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.339 
that is actually a calcite mineral
that's<00:00:15.789> why<00:00:15.940> it<00:00:16.000> gives<00:00:16.150> it<00:00:16.270> kind<00:00:16.539> of<00:00:16.630> it's<00:00:16.810> a

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:17.349 
that's why it gives it kind of it's a

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:19.230 
that's why it gives it kind of it's a
little<00:00:17.800> bit<00:00:17.890> of<00:00:17.949> a<00:00:18.010> cloudy<00:00:18.580> look<00:00:18.759> to<00:00:18.910> it<00:00:19.029> and

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
little bit of a cloudy look to it and

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.659 
little bit of a cloudy look to it and
its<00:00:19.750> reflection<00:00:20.349> that<00:00:20.919> it<00:00:21.009> has<00:00:21.189> when<00:00:21.550> you're

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:21.669 
its reflection that it has when you're

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:23.370 
its reflection that it has when you're
looking<00:00:21.939> at<00:00:22.119> it<00:00:22.240> it<00:00:22.539> usually<00:00:22.720> has<00:00:23.050> kind<00:00:23.259> of<00:00:23.289> a

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
looking at it it usually has kind of a

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.370 
looking at it it usually has kind of a
sparkle<00:00:24.099> or<00:00:24.340> a<00:00:24.400> little<00:00:24.849> reflection<00:00:25.539> to<00:00:25.779> it<00:00:25.810> and

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
sparkle or a little reflection to it and

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.630 
sparkle or a little reflection to it and
it's<00:00:26.649> hard<00:00:26.800> to<00:00:26.829> see<00:00:27.009> in<00:00:27.099> the<00:00:27.189> light<00:00:27.369> here<00:00:27.610> but

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
it's hard to see in the light here but

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.249 
it's hard to see in the light here but
there's<00:00:27.939> almost<00:00:28.119> like<00:00:28.329> little<00:00:28.630> sparkles<00:00:29.140> in

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
there's almost like little sparkles in

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.109 
there's almost like little sparkles in
it<00:00:29.349> and<00:00:29.590> it<00:00:29.829> really<00:00:30.040> reflects<00:00:30.610> the<00:00:30.730> light<00:00:30.969> it

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
it and it really reflects the light it

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.450 
it and it really reflects the light it
has<00:00:31.210> a<00:00:31.270> lot<00:00:31.480> of<00:00:31.570> that<00:00:31.689> feldspar<00:00:32.200> going<00:00:32.469> on<00:00:32.619> and

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
has a lot of that feldspar going on and

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.310 
has a lot of that feldspar going on and
what<00:00:33.790> that<00:00:33.940> is<00:00:34.090> is<00:00:34.300> it's<00:00:34.480> from<00:00:34.690> copper<00:00:35.050> so

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
what that is is it's from copper so

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.720 
what that is is it's from copper so
that's<00:00:35.500> how<00:00:35.590> it<00:00:35.649> gets<00:00:35.800> its<00:00:35.950> kind<00:00:36.190> of<00:00:36.280> reddish

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
that's how it gets its kind of reddish

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:37.619 
that's how it gets its kind of reddish
pinkish<00:00:37.180> color

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
pinkish color

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:39.450 
pinkish color
it's<00:00:38.020> from<00:00:38.170> the<00:00:38.290> copper<00:00:38.620> that's<00:00:38.800> included<00:00:39.280> and

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
it's from the copper that's included and

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.920 
it's from the copper that's included and
the<00:00:39.550> inclusions<00:00:40.059> when<00:00:40.239> you're<00:00:40.420> looking<00:00:40.719> at<00:00:40.899> it

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
the inclusions when you're looking at it

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.509 
the inclusions when you're looking at it
and<00:00:41.200> different<00:00:41.710> pieces<00:00:41.860> you're<00:00:42.129> gonna<00:00:42.219> see

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:42.519 
and different pieces you're gonna see

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:44.220 
and different pieces you're gonna see
that<00:00:42.699> shine<00:00:43.030> and<00:00:43.059> sparkle<00:00:43.420> a<00:00:43.719> little<00:00:43.989> bit<00:00:44.079> more

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
that shine and sparkle a little bit more

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.419 
that shine and sparkle a little bit more
this<00:00:44.620> piece<00:00:44.920> here

00:00:45.419 --> 00:00:45.429 
this piece here

well off-camera you can see a little bit

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.720 
well off-camera you can see a little bit
more<00:00:46.960> with<00:00:47.320> the<00:00:47.499> different<00:00:48.219> lights<00:00:48.399> there<00:00:48.640> it

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
more with the different lights there it

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.029 
more with the different lights there it
has<00:00:48.850> that<00:00:49.030> shine<00:00:49.269> and<00:00:49.300> sparkle<00:00:49.629> it's<00:00:50.530> known<00:00:50.829> as

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
has that shine and sparkle it's known as

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:52.829 
has that shine and sparkle it's known as
the<00:00:51.070> Aven<00:00:51.670> tree<00:00:51.820> and<00:00:51.940> feldspar<00:00:52.210> because<00:00:52.719> it

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:52.839 
the Aven tree and feldspar because it

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.250 
the Aven tree and feldspar because it
has<00:00:52.989> this<00:00:53.199> color<00:00:53.499> here<00:00:54.010> it's<00:00:54.789> gonna<00:00:54.940> be<00:00:55.239> a<00:00:55.569> lot

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
has this color here it's gonna be a lot

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.470 
has this color here it's gonna be a lot
of<00:00:56.289> the<00:00:56.440> same<00:00:56.679> makes<00:00:56.949> up<00:00:57.219> makeups<00:00:57.999> of<00:00:58.269> the

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
of the same makes up makeups of the

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.509 
of the same makes up makeups of the
calcite<00:00:58.870> I've<00:00:59.769> been<00:00:59.920> trained<00:01:00.100> and<00:01:00.249> that's<00:01:00.370> one

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
calcite I've been trained and that's one

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.209 
calcite I've been trained and that's one
of<00:01:00.550> its<00:01:00.670> colors<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:02.260> color<00:01:02.559> is<00:01:02.859> going<00:01:03.010> to<00:01:03.100> be

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
of its colors the color is going to be

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.070 
of its colors the color is going to be
the<00:01:03.370> darkest<00:01:03.819> in<00:01:03.999> the<00:01:04.150> middle<00:01:04.510> of<00:01:04.690> the<00:01:04.839> stone

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
the darkest in the middle of the stone

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.719 
the darkest in the middle of the stone
so<00:01:05.620> here's<00:01:05.830> a<00:01:05.890> lighter<00:01:06.190> one<00:01:06.370> that<00:01:06.520> you<00:01:06.610> can

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
so here's a lighter one that you can

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.210 
so here's a lighter one that you can
kind<00:01:06.909> of<00:01:07.000> see<00:01:07.270> and<00:01:07.510> the<00:01:08.260> color<00:01:08.440> gets<00:01:08.620> darkest

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
kind of see and the color gets darkest

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.560 
kind of see and the color gets darkest
in<00:01:09.370> the<00:01:09.460> middle<00:01:09.700> and<00:01:09.880> then<00:01:10.000> as<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.270> crystal

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
in the middle and then as the crystal

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.790 
in the middle and then as the crystal
forms<00:01:10.870> it's<00:01:11.020> actually<00:01:11.260> gonna<00:01:11.350> get<00:01:11.500> lighter

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
forms it's actually gonna get lighter

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.530 
forms it's actually gonna get lighter
and<00:01:11.979> lighter<00:01:12.040> on<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:12.370> outside<00:01:12.790> so<00:01:13.240> a<00:01:13.270> lot<00:01:13.510> of

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
and lighter on the outside so a lot of

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.420 
and lighter on the outside so a lot of
the<00:01:13.750> reflection<00:01:14.229> is<00:01:14.350> happening<00:01:14.799> away<00:01:15.159> from

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
the reflection is happening away from

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.179 
the reflection is happening away from
the<00:01:15.579> center<00:01:16.000> of<00:01:16.210> the<00:01:16.540> actual<00:01:17.140> stone<00:01:17.560> when<00:01:18.100> you

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
the center of the actual stone when you

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:19.679 
the center of the actual stone when you
cut<00:01:18.340> it<00:01:18.460> in<00:01:18.579> gemstones<00:01:18.790> it's<00:01:19.180> kind<00:01:19.329> of<00:01:19.360> hard<00:01:19.570> to

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
cut it in gemstones it's kind of hard to

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:20.969 
cut it in gemstones it's kind of hard to
tell<00:01:19.810> because<00:01:19.930> you're<00:01:20.140> not<00:01:20.259> exactly<00:01:20.619> sure

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
tell because you're not exactly sure

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.100 
tell because you're not exactly sure
where<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.670> center<00:01:21.939> of<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.060> gemstone<00:01:22.450> was<00:01:22.689> but

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
where the center of the gemstone was but

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.719 
where the center of the gemstone was but
you<00:01:23.200> will<00:01:23.350> see<00:01:23.530> different<00:01:23.920> portions<00:01:24.340> of<00:01:24.520> it

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
you will see different portions of it

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.999 
you will see different portions of it
where<00:01:25.180> different<00:01:25.689> pieces<00:01:25.930> it's<00:01:26.409> darker<00:01:26.979> in

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
where different pieces it's darker in

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.069 
where different pieces it's darker in
sections<00:01:27.549> and<00:01:27.759> then<00:01:28.000> kind<00:01:28.329> of<00:01:28.390> gets<00:01:28.750> a<00:01:28.869> lighter

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
sections and then kind of gets a lighter

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:31.310 
sections and then kind of gets a lighter
as<00:01:29.259> it<00:01:29.409> goes<00:01:29.560> away<00:01:29.740> from<00:01:29.890> that<00:01:30.219> dark<00:01:30.579> section

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
as it goes away from that dark section

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.319 
as it goes away from that dark section
it<00:01:32.320> is<00:01:32.500> it<00:01:33.100> was<00:01:33.189> first<00:01:33.369> found<00:01:33.549> in<00:01:33.640> Norway<00:01:34.030> and

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
it is it was first found in Norway and

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:37.969 
it is it was first found in Norway and
now<00:01:34.960> it's<00:01:35.320> really<00:01:35.680> found<00:01:36.159> primarily<00:01:36.789> in

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
