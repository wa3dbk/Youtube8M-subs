so<00:01:42.170> that<00:01:42.530> was<00:01:42.650> my<00:01:42.770> second<00:01:43.340> on<00:01:43.880> to<00:01:44.150> it<00:01:44.300> so<00:01:45.200> it's

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
so that was my second on to it so it's

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.280 
so that was my second on to it so it's
even<00:01:45.470> fatal<00:01:45.830> anymore<00:01:46.750> just<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:47.870> little<00:01:48.110> bit

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
even fatal anymore just a little bit

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.350 
even fatal anymore just a little bit
left<00:01:48.530> probably<00:01:49.430> all<00:01:49.850> gone<00:01:50.560> so<00:01:52.240> this<00:01:53.240> is

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
left probably all gone so this is

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.020 
left probably all gone so this is
probably<00:01:53.720> last<00:01:53.930> braid<00:01:54.170> like<00:01:54.440> maybe<00:01:55.130> another

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
probably last braid like maybe another

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:31.000 
probably last braid like maybe another
spray<00:02:13.989> should<00:02:14.989> almost<00:02:15.260> be<00:02:15.560> about<00:02:29.860> seems<00:02:30.860> like

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
spray should almost be about seems like

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.670 
spray should almost be about seems like
it<00:02:31.130> really<00:02:31.160> fits<00:02:31.910> break<00:02:32.239> and<00:02:32.930> I<00:02:33.290> think<00:02:33.560> I've
