00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.170
 hello, let's make some worms 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.660
 pretty disgusting gelatin if they the 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.600
 truth let's put 30 grams of 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.840
 neutral gelatin or 36 I'm putting myself 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.550
 because each sachet has 12 grams of 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.530
 this gelatin that comes in powder and from 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.960
 flavor we add the same amount can 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.369
 be strawberry for example or lemon that 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.750
 I'm putting her because the worms 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.400
 mine are going to be green 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.370
 I also add two cups of hot water 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.410
 but one move well and I add the other 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.940
 if it makes them red is when you can put 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.219
 the strawberry jelly that always gives a 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.610
 little bit of color if I eat earthworms 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.610
 example 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.920
 stir well so that the gelatin is 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.530
 go dissolving in the water 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.050
 and we're going to add three quarters of a cup 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.789
 of cream to mount in English is wave 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.589
 king in what I say because in some countries 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.839
 you ask me what his name is and I do not know 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.609
 look for the translation for example in 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.920
 google but they are attacking by beating the 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.010
 It is made as chantilly or cream 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.950
 mounted we call you in Spain 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.110
 to strawberries for example for pies 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.850
 we mix everything well and now I 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.720
 I'll give a little green with 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:18.150
 green food coloring 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.150
 It can be liquid or a gel or paste 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.479
 now let's see I will tell you the 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.950
 sorrows that I have spent doing this 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.800
 tutorial because I've tried it up 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.980
 three times 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.050
 what is it like to use straws or 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.300
 soda reeds as you are seeing 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.090
 that we have to place like this together 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.680
 studying them with some rubber bands and now 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.840
 how do we do it so that it does not come out 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.150
 below when filling them with our 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.640
 mixture that is liquid because my idea 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.890
 number 1 was how are you seeing put 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.860
 aluminum foil albal paper closing 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.510
 well the bottom part with gums and lusa 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.270
 from me I thought that he was not going to leave by 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:59.730
 here it fit in a glass so that it is 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.730
 vertically and I'm adding the liquid 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:07.450
 inside the straws so that they form 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.450
 the worms and this is going to go to the fridge 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.860
 As you can see , everything is coming out 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.080
 and I put it in the fridge 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.060
 my attempt number 2 that I'm going to 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.250
 teach the results was to do what 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.750
 but in this case the straws 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.220
 I'm opening a little bit because they're from 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.750
 these that are bent to be marked 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.940
 those folds but well this is 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.280
 indifferent one 50th position because I would 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.230
 are you going to ask 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.150
 and I say good because I'm going to put a little 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.980
 of fondant on the bottom so that 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.850
 make a kind of stopper and do not leave 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.220
 the liquid and I put red fondant 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.070
 since it seems like blood quotes in case 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.640
 there was some of the rest in the straw 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.640
 mixed with gelatin 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.030
 as you can see, I'm just 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.950
 clicking and put a little bit of 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.910
 fondant just at the tip as a 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.160
 plug 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.230
 I repeat the operation by tying them with rubber bands 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.230
 and leaving the bottom part down 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.000
 be tight 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.879
 and it fits here but to make sure 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.390
 more again to repeat the action is of 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:16.550
 paper so witty or albal paper 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.660
 good aluminum foil to vouchers not 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.520
 brand and filled it with my mix 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.050
 the first mix that you saw that was 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.490
 Greener is because I did not have the cream and 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.740
 I did not mind walking is 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.450
 well I'm adding and as you can see 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.970
 I came back out below but I said 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.500
 well maybe it will not come out much and I can 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.470
 serve and I immediately put it to the 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.160
 fridge 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.580
 my attempt number 3 was with a few pages 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.040
 thicker 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.690
 how are you seeing here says 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.910
 less because it is that I was already spending 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.720
 a lot of jelly but I insisted that the 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:54.100
 video came out and I put zeal in the part 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.100
 from below to close them well 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.120
 and MiddleOUT oneouldrof desafÃ­o differential 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:06.620
 pretty and the networks in this case seems 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.620
 that the jelly was less 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.390
 you will see also to be transparent here 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.319
 it looks better than I fill them and what 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.319
 we put in the fridge 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.310
 Y 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.190
 I put it in the fridge and now I'm going to 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.170
 teach the results of the first do not 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.880
 I dared to record it because it all came out 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.940
 of the glass by the fridge and it was a 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.400
 authentic disaster the 'number two' remains 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.900
 with the fondant here you have it left 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.840
 quite and the majority has stayed in 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.050
 the glass cut the part that had the 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.220
 fondant so that it will not mix and now 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.249
 at the time of taking it out that is a bit 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.379
 complicated 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:47.839
 What I did was to dunk them a little with 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:49.819
 hot water so they would stick 

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:51.770
 little bit of the straw but I'm going to do now 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:53.930
 same 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.940
 I realized that we were getting a little 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.879
 late and you can see that the bullet is 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.009
 It comes out a lot easier but as you can see 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:03.830
 they come out just pieces because I think that 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:06.530
 they were not like air gaps in the 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.479
 small, being so narrow some 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.870
 As you can see, the red fondant has had 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.870
 little worms 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.380
 and here I have them in me as I have left 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.870
 gelatin also prepare here in these 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.520
 molds milestones gelatin taquitos 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.920
 but let's just dream a dream so that 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.110
 It does not have the one that you have left too much 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.000
 that you can also make other jellies 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.890
 to eat directly these are the 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.780
 worms that get with the experiment 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.280
 number 2 and the result number 3 me 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.010
 it turned out better than although it also 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.780
 It wasted a lot when it was wider 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:42.810
 they filled completely and get 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.810
 thicker and longer worms 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.610
 cut out the part of the sky obviously 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:49.409
 so that he does not eat and could get well 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.060
 because you have to press on one side of the 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:53.729
 straw for the worm to come out of the 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.259
 another one is very easy to take out if not 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:56.789
 well the straws with a little water 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:57.569
 hot what do I do now 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:00.210
 is 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:02.069
 you see explode almost alone then squeezing 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.270
 on the one hand the worms come out and with 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:05.270
 we are going to remove them 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.759
 Y 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.470
 another way in the right way that 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:14.350
 then I was investigating not to do 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.880
 as many experiments as I 'm putting 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.560
 a little bit of gelatin in the straws 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.229
 with a little bit of the mixture that you have 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.600
 done and put it in the freezer not at 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:24.669
 refrigerator or the fridge that happens to me 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.560
 freezers of drawers and I could not fit 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:28.210
 standing then if the lying down I was going 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.009
 to leave all the gelatin but if you are 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.930
 It fits if you can stand you do not have to 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:33.490
 do all these inventions but which one 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.960
 freezes at the bottom and is the 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.790
 own gelatin which does a little 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.470
 stopper in the magic 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.760
 good this experiment 3 that you have 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.590
 seen with cards wider than you 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.090
 I recommend using not the stars of the 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:47.470
 everything seems to be much better 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.450
 conclusions of my experiment and my 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.130
 recommendations is not as easy as 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.500
 it seems like you're ready 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.930
 mentally you are going to lose and waste 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:58.350
 ingredients in the glass ask yourself if 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.640
 you really need to make these worms 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:02.740
 I hope you liked it despite 

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.720
 all networks like you subscribe and what 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.160
 share with your friends and do not forget 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.570
 look for us in the social networks that 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.780
 you have below the links that we are 

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:12.970
 practically in all I leave you two ideas 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:16.480
 more easier and you're for halloween if 

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:19.890
 is your case a ghost and a punch that 

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.890
 he has a hand of the dead
