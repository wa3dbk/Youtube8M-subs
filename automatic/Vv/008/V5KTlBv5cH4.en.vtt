00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:07.180
 this is my second excuse I believe it is 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.400
 instead it will be the video 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:13.299
 the covers for my samsung galaxy core 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:16.210
 plus many grandfather not just four because 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:18.520
 anyway I have it recently and I will do well 

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.160
 see then the first one I received is 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:27.970
 this is what I really like 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:30.460
 and so we say it is not smooth inside and there 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.259
 they are these but I forget about them 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.960
 old men with a bow on it and it 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.539
 background we say here black that red and me 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.429
 also like this contrast a lot 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:42.789
 of colors on my phone anyway 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:44.649
 i like how it looks we say e 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:46.629
 my father gave it to me 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.329
 tramelan give yourself all 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.039
 my father all the covers I will show you 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.399
 that is, that they are 3 to 3 3 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:59.319
 all given away my relatives so not 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:02.469
 must the price is nothing either where 

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:05.950
 we bought it, however, I believe you are from 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:11.380
 Chinese or stalls and if mine 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:13.780
 friend shin so this I had it 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.100
 I'll make the video with him then 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.350
 we said 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.990
 this is the street cover one of my things 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.390
 and there will be very very pretty instead 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.330
 very plastic and then also 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:30.130
 because it protects the very very well 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:34.590
 phone because it is closed then there is this 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:37.660
 that I received from my cousin Anna who 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.300
 I really like 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.070
 sorry for your average I liked the 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.350
 cover a little awkward if I have to say it 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.490
 truth then here 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:53.260
 sorry here we say this is mirrored 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:56.260
 those who opened it the door 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.720
 and here you can put the documents ok 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:05.650
 but it is not that there are those who at least put it 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:07.900
 limit and here then put the phone and the 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.880
 uncomfortable thing that almost drops the phone 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.230
 you could even break your own is not 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.550
 covered 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.040
 but now you are comfortable that you want to take it 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.830
 so then really like the color because a 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.040
 ultramarine blue a dark threat 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:24.970
 since this that I used we say that 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:29.130
 I broke because this is not film 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:32.260
 so immediately we know this and this 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:36.790
 I believe they have cox bought it to 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.250
 my father remember why he said in the 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.310
 shop at volla that is called from 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.600
 telephony I don't think we have it 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.819
 all ok, all you have to do is go to a 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.610
 I think you find the cover store part 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.400
 there were all this while this 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.620
 they bought it from or from mediaworld or from 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.410
 expert slope 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.450
 one of these two then there is this who 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.700
 unfortunately I have already broken because this 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.650
 film as I said a lot too 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.930
 nice I really like it because it stands out 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.550
 even with the color that is darker than 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.270
 that which is 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:13.930
 and there is spongebob that I hate, but it 's nice 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:16.510
 I don't like the canine over the phone 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.990
 or don't like looking at the oil and 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.599
 goodnight and look kept having 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:32.530
 looked at point 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:33.590
 bambi here I wondered oh here it is 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.950
 my dog 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.959
 I wouldn't do normal and finally there is this 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:44.810
 that we say to the chemistry there is a bit 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:47.870
 more and it is to create mini these two 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:52.519
 has given away the non- witch in quotation marks 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:56.080
 I know if the witch and makes me be 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:59.870
 especially this because it chews me up 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.450
 minion asti counter a lot because if 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.660
 not a fund and in fact never forced me 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.329
 sailing cover and a puzzle of 104 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:12.140
 pieces that I did see my 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:14.650
 some of my epiphany presents are many 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:20.120
 nice when you finish it I'll show you 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:22.450
 and this is very very pretty and I like it 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.450
 lot 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:33.680
 ok i'm an idiot i know these well 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:35.389
 they were my four covers 4 and these 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.979
 two in teams 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.590
 I believe that I have this I think 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.990
 took it from the Chinese or brands 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.110
 I don't know this but I think he has it 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.810
 taken by expert because it was the same 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:51.169
 expert because then there was the brand above 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:54.110
 that I have removed that they know the notes and 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.750
 ekspert was written about this instead 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.870
 nothing is written then a piece 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.370
 that she bought from expert 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.690
 this is also paradise from 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:08.630
 mediaworld is this from telephony e 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.000

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:16.479
