playing off one another and having an

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.240 
playing off one another and having an
idea<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.899> would<00:01:43.020> just<00:01:43.619> simply<00:01:43.740> not<00:01:43.920> have

idea that would just simply not have

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.130

occurred to anyone on his or her own and

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.590 
occurred to anyone on his or her own and
I<00:01:46.619> think<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.070> frankly<00:01:47.700> part<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.240> what<00:01:48.450> our

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
I think that is frankly part of what our

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.560 
I think that is frankly part of what our
students<00:01:49.079> learn<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.590> campus<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.220> that's<00:01:51.210> part

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
students learn on campus and that's part

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.080 
students learn on campus and that's part
of<00:01:51.689> teaching<00:01:51.869> entrepreneurship<00:01:52.530> is

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
of teaching entrepreneurship is

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.010 
of teaching entrepreneurship is
understanding<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.240> all<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.540> ideas<00:01:54.869> don't

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
understanding that all the ideas don't

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.319 
understanding that all the ideas don't
come<00:01:55.229> out<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.439> your<00:01:55.560> own<00:01:55.619> head<00:01:55.909> but<00:01:56.909> they<00:01:57.149> come

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
come out of your own head but they come

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.410 
come out of your own head but they come
out<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.750> real<00:01:58.040> culture<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.130> collaboration
