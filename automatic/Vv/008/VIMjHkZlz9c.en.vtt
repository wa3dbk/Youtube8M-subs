many more phones these days are starting

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.230 
many more phones these days are starting
to<00:00:02.820> be<00:00:02.909> manufactured<00:00:03.780> with<00:00:04.430> NFC<00:00:05.430> capabilities

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
to be manufactured with NFC capabilities

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.720 
to be manufactured with NFC capabilities
and<00:00:08.960> the<00:00:09.960> majority<00:00:10.440> of<00:00:10.469> people<00:00:10.800> that<00:00:10.950> have

and the majority of people that have

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.299 
and the majority of people that have
this<00:00:12.240> capability<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.809> know<00:00:12.990> they<00:00:13.170> do<00:00:13.309> are

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
this capability and know they do are

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.590 
this capability and know they do are
just<00:00:14.849> using<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.120> for<00:00:15.210> Google<00:00:15.540> Wallet<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:17.600> many

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
just using it for Google Wallet and many

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.630 
just using it for Google Wallet and many
of<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.810> phones<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.770> fact<00:00:20.010> most<00:00:20.279> phones<00:00:20.520> that

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
of the phones in fact most phones that

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.509 
of the phones in fact most phones that
have<00:00:20.789> NFC<00:00:20.970> um<00:00:21.710> actually<00:00:22.710> can't<00:00:22.980> use<00:00:23.189> Google

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
have NFC um actually can't use Google

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.670 
have NFC um actually can't use Google
Wallet<00:00:23.640> because<00:00:24.240> carriers<00:00:24.779> don't<00:00:24.930> allow<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.470> I

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
Wallet because carriers don't allow it I

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.220 
Wallet because carriers don't allow it I
mean<00:00:26.310> there's<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.519> hack<00:00:26.760> for<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.300> but<00:00:27.570> it

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
mean there's a hack for it but it

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.929 
mean there's a hack for it but it
doesn't<00:00:28.470> always<00:00:28.560> work<00:00:28.650> properly<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.550> it

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
doesn't always work properly and it

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.870 
doesn't always work properly and it
requires<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.830> D<00:00:31.830> freeze<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.520> freeze<00:00:32.730> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
requires you to D freeze and freeze the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.370 
requires you to D freeze and freeze the
app<00:00:33.000> every<00:00:33.360> time<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.570> set<00:00:33.719> up<00:00:33.809> your<00:00:33.899> phone<00:00:34.079> and

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
app every time you set up your phone and

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.810 
app every time you set up your phone and
tricky<00:00:34.530> for<00:00:34.739> anything<00:00:34.890> it's<00:00:35.160> thinking<00:00:35.579> it's<00:00:35.730> a

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
tricky for anything it's thinking it's a

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.819 
tricky for anything it's thinking it's a
different<00:00:36.180> phone<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.450> it's<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.600> lot<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.809> it's<00:00:37.710> a

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
different phone so it's a lot of it's a

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.889 
different phone so it's a lot of it's a
lot<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.100> work<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:39.300> often<00:00:39.629> times<00:00:39.780> it

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
lot of work and it often times it

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:40.850 
lot of work and it often times it
doesn't<00:00:40.050> even<00:00:40.200> work

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
doesn't even work

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.970 
doesn't even work
anyways<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.260> what's<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.410> practical<00:00:43.590> use<00:00:43.829> for

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
anyways so what's the practical use for

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.740 
anyways so what's the practical use for
for<00:00:44.700> NFC<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.210> I'm<00:00:45.360> going<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.539> show<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.660> a

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
for NFC you I'm going to show you a

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.500 
for NFC you I'm going to show you a
couple<00:00:46.250> of<00:00:47.250> things<00:00:47.700> here<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.329> probably

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
couple of things here that you probably

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.939 
couple of things here that you probably
haven't<00:00:48.989> thought<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:50.750> so<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:52.199> have<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> couple

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
haven't thought of so I have a couple

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.040 
haven't thought of so I have a couple
tags<00:00:53.280> here<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:53.910> my<00:00:54.059> bus<00:00:54.270> card<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.690> used<00:00:54.870> to

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
tags here this is my bus card it used to

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.770 
tags here this is my bus card it used to
go<00:00:55.140> get<00:00:55.350> around<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> city<00:00:55.860> here<00:00:56.390> it's<00:00:57.390> still

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
go get around the city here it's still

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
go get around the city here it's still
active<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:58.469> still<00:00:58.879> it's<00:00:59.879> still<00:01:00.090> usable<00:01:00.800> for

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
active it's still it's still usable for

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.350 
active it's still it's still usable for
a<00:01:01.829> while<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:03.080> this<00:01:04.729> this<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> tectile

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
a while and this this is a tectile

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.390 
a while and this this is a tectile
samsung<00:01:07.170> cells<00:01:07.439> are<00:01:07.619> little<00:01:07.830> stickers<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.340> i

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
samsung cells are little stickers and i

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.789 
samsung cells are little stickers and i
actually<00:01:08.700> put<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.030> on<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.840> card<00:01:10.140> here<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.650> make

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
actually put it on the card here to make

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.399 
actually put it on the card here to make
it<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> little<00:01:11.070> more<00:01:11.930> resilient<00:01:12.930> because<00:01:13.170> it's

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
it a little more resilient because it's

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.310 
it a little more resilient because it's
just<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.680> sticker<00:01:14.270> and<00:01:15.270> then<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.869> have<00:01:16.110> another

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
just a sticker and then I have another

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.170 
just a sticker and then I have another
one<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:16.740> my<00:01:16.830> wall<00:01:17.009> here<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.670> another<00:01:17.939> bus

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
one on my wall here this is another bus

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.240 
one on my wall here this is another bus
card<00:01:18.830> and<00:01:20.119> I'm<00:01:21.119> gonna<00:01:21.270> show<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.450> kind<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.810> what

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
card and I'm gonna show you kind of what

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.859 
card and I'm gonna show you kind of what
you<00:01:23.250> can<00:01:23.430> do<00:01:23.610> with<00:01:23.759> this

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
you can do with this

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.170 
you can do with this
well<00:01:25.680> first<00:01:26.490> problem<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.090> not

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
well first problem is this is not

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.210 
well first problem is this is not
writable<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.840> can't<00:01:28.080> write<00:01:28.770> anything<00:01:29.040> to

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
writable so I can't write anything to

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.140 
writable so I can't write anything to
this<00:01:29.310> because<00:01:29.490> it's<00:01:29.640> encrypted

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
this because it's encrypted

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.020 
this because it's encrypted
anyways<00:01:30.540> plus<00:01:30.900> I'm<00:01:31.079> using<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:32.579> even<00:01:32.759> if<00:01:32.880> it

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
anyways plus I'm using it but even if it

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.969 
anyways plus I'm using it but even if it
wasn't<00:01:33.259> like<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.380> one<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.650> wall<00:01:34.770> here's

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
wasn't like the one in the wall here's

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.149 
wasn't like the one in the wall here's
actually<00:01:35.159> old<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.909> not<00:01:36.150> being<00:01:36.479> used<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:37.470> I

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
actually old it's not being used I I

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.350 
actually old it's not being used I I
couldn't<00:01:38.610> write<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.030> anyways<00:01:39.270> because

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
couldn't write to it anyways because

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.789 
couldn't write to it anyways because
there's<00:01:39.600> an<00:01:39.689> encryption<00:01:39.900> key<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.500> Metro

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
there's an encryption key that Metro

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.800 
there's an encryption key that Metro
Transit<00:01:41.159> uses<00:01:41.460> that's<00:01:42.060> just<00:01:42.420> when<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.540> can

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
Transit uses that's just when I can

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.240 
Transit uses that's just when I can
write<00:01:43.020> too<00:01:43.200> but<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.380> can<00:01:43.500> only<00:01:43.619> make<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:43.979> do

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
write too but I can only make it do

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.219 
write too but I can only make it do
certain<00:01:44.970> things<00:01:45.000> without<00:01:45.600> there<00:01:46.020> being<00:01:46.049> an

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
certain things without there being an

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.350 
certain things without there being an
app<00:01:46.380> installed<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.070> phone<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.579> can<00:01:48.240> only

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
app installed on the phone I can only

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.760 
app installed on the phone I can only
really<00:01:48.600> make<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.220> you<00:01:50.220> know<00:01:50.310> just<00:01:50.460> have<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> URL

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
really make it you know just have a URL

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.760 
really make it you know just have a URL
tracking<00:01:52.770> with<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.070> like<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.869> location<00:01:54.899> doing

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
tracking with you like a location doing

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.139 
tracking with you like a location doing
a<00:01:55.799> few<00:01:55.950> things<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.250> can<00:01:56.310> really<00:01:56.549> do<00:01:56.820> with<00:01:56.969> it

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
a few things I can really do with it

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.209 
a few things I can really do with it
basically<00:01:57.960> what<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.320> can<00:01:58.350> do<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.950> what<00:01:59.159> you

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
basically what you can do that what you

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.289 
basically what you can do that what you
can<00:01:59.250> do<00:01:59.490> with<00:01:59.640> a<00:02:00.140> QR<00:02:01.140> code<00:02:01.590> or<00:02:01.860> barcode<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:03.149> can

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
can do with a QR code or barcode you can

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.120 
can do with a QR code or barcode you can
do<00:02:03.420> with<00:02:03.570> these<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:04.500> can<00:02:04.530> write<00:02:04.799> into<00:02:05.009> these

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
do with these you can write into these

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.930 
do with these you can write into these
tags<00:02:05.430> otherwise<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.030> need<00:02:06.090> an<00:02:06.270> application

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
tags otherwise you need an application

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.389 
tags otherwise you need an application
so<00:02:08.560> there's<00:02:09.560> a<00:02:09.649> there's<00:02:09.920> an<00:02:10.009> application

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
so there's a there's an application

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.140 
so there's a there's an application
called<00:02:10.520> retag<00:02:11.180> and<00:02:11.600> this<00:02:12.380> allows<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:12.830> to<00:02:13.150> take

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
called retag and this allows you to take

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.610 
called retag and this allows you to take
the<00:02:14.270> ID<00:02:14.420> number<00:02:14.960> because<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.230> doesn't<00:02:15.440> write

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
the ID number because it doesn't write

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.470 
the ID number because it doesn't write
to<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.890> tag<00:02:16.100> just<00:02:16.550> take<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.820> ID<00:02:16.970> number<00:02:17.390> and

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
to the tag just take the ID number and

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.350 
to the tag just take the ID number and
then<00:02:17.600> it<00:02:17.690> keys<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.560> list<00:02:18.950> of<00:02:19.220> commands<00:02:19.940> I

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
then it keys it to a list of commands I

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.230 
then it keys it to a list of commands I
have<00:02:20.870> this<00:02:20.959> in<00:02:21.110> my<00:02:21.140> phone<00:02:21.470> here<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:23.120> can

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
have this in my phone here and you can

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.960 
have this in my phone here and you can
find<00:02:23.360> this<00:02:23.480> in<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.660> Play<00:02:23.870> Store<00:02:24.170> so<00:02:24.850> if<00:02:25.850> you

find this in the Play Store so if you

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.310 
find this in the Play Store so if you
want<00:02:26.180> that<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:26.540> can<00:02:26.660> download<00:02:26.810> it<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.230> you

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
want that you can download it and you

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.230 
want that you can download it and you
can<00:02:27.440> reuse<00:02:27.620> any<00:02:27.950> NFC<00:02:28.640> tags<00:02:28.850> you<00:02:28.940> might<00:02:29.090> happen

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
can reuse any NFC tags you might happen

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.150 
can reuse any NFC tags you might happen
to<00:02:29.420> be<00:02:29.570> carrying<00:02:30.380> around<00:02:30.500> maybe<00:02:30.890> you<00:02:30.980> have<00:02:31.130> a

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
to be carrying around maybe you have a

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.020 
to be carrying around maybe you have a
pass<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:32.180> your<00:02:32.300> wallet<00:02:32.930> that<00:02:33.050> you<00:02:33.110> use<00:02:33.350> for

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
pass and your wallet that you use for

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.980 
pass and your wallet that you use for
your<00:02:35.030> work<00:02:35.300> or<00:02:35.480> something

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
your work or something

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.720 
your work or something
nothing<00:02:36.260> will<00:02:36.350> be<00:02:36.440> right<00:02:36.680> into<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.040> tag<00:02:37.250> so

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
nothing will be right into the tag so

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.980 
nothing will be right into the tag so
you<00:02:38.060> don't<00:02:38.600> have<00:02:38.690> to<00:02:38.780> worry<00:02:38.900> about

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
you don't have to worry about

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.210 
you don't have to worry about
overwriting<00:02:39.380> or<00:02:39.770> anything<00:02:39.950> like<00:02:40.160> that

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
overwriting or anything like that

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.320 
overwriting or anything like that
because<00:02:40.459> it<00:02:40.640> won't<00:02:40.790> happen<00:02:40.970> with<00:02:41.300> that

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
because it won't happen with that

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.070 
because it won't happen with that
application<00:02:42.080> unless<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.440> tell<00:02:42.650> it<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:44.540> um

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
application unless you tell it to so um

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.010 
application unless you tell it to so um
the<00:02:45.790> practical<00:02:46.790> uses<00:02:47.120> for<00:02:47.270> this<00:02:47.360> is<00:02:47.570> well

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
the practical uses for this is well

there's<00:02:48.650> a<00:02:48.739> couple<00:02:48.860> things<00:02:49.040> I<00:02:49.190> do<00:02:49.250> when<00:02:49.550> I<00:02:49.640> go

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
there's a couple things I do when I go

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.740 
there's a couple things I do when I go
out<00:02:50.000> of<00:02:50.209> my<00:02:50.330> house<00:02:51.100> I<00:02:52.100> turn<00:02:52.580> on<00:02:52.610> Bluetooth<00:02:53.540> in

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
out of my house I turn on Bluetooth in

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.160 
out of my house I turn on Bluetooth in
the<00:02:53.840> phone<00:02:54.050> and<00:02:54.290> then<00:02:54.860> activate<00:02:55.510> my<00:02:56.510> pen<00:02:56.750> my

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
the phone and then activate my pen my

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.240 
the phone and then activate my pen my
pen<00:02:57.350> door<00:02:57.500> application<00:02:57.980> make<00:02:58.070> sure<00:02:58.100> the

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
pen door application make sure the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.770 
pen door application make sure the
volumes<00:02:58.610> all<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:58.790> way<00:02:58.880> up<00:02:59.000> now<00:02:59.540> these<00:02:59.660> things

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
volumes all the way up now these things

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.800 
volumes all the way up now these things
are<00:02:59.959> hard<00:03:00.320> to<00:03:00.440> do<00:03:00.830> but<00:03:01.840> I<00:03:03.370> mean<00:03:04.370> it<00:03:04.810> isn't

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
are hard to do but I mean it isn't

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.870 
are hard to do but I mean it isn't
really<00:03:05.900> taking<00:03:06.200> much<00:03:06.320> time<00:03:06.590> but<00:03:06.830> still<00:03:07.250> would

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
really taking much time but still would

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.240 
really taking much time but still would
be<00:03:07.970> nice<00:03:08.120> if<00:03:08.300> I<00:03:08.390> could<00:03:08.540> just<00:03:08.660> touch<00:03:09.050> this<00:03:09.410> code

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
be nice if I could just touch this code

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.620 
be nice if I could just touch this code
here<00:03:10.489> and<00:03:10.640> it<00:03:10.940> would<00:03:11.060> do<00:03:11.180> all<00:03:11.299> those<00:03:11.420> things

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
here and it would do all those things

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.380 
here and it would do all those things
for<00:03:11.840> me<00:03:11.959> so<00:03:12.230> that's<00:03:13.100> what<00:03:13.190> I<00:03:13.250> ever<00:03:13.370> do<00:03:13.549> search

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
for me so that's what I ever do search

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
phone in silent mode so now it's back

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.330 
phone in silent mode so now it's back
and<00:03:50.870> this<00:03:51.110> will<00:03:51.290> operate<00:03:51.620> through<00:03:51.950> my<00:03:52.070> wallet

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
and this will operate through my wallet

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.620 
and this will operate through my wallet
-<00:03:52.640> which<00:03:52.820> is<00:03:52.940> where<00:03:53.090> usually<00:03:53.180> where<00:03:53.420> I<00:03:53.450> keep<00:03:53.570> my

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
- which is where usually where I keep my

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.229 
- which is where usually where I keep my
bus<00:03:53.900> card<00:03:54.170> so<00:03:54.500> if<00:03:55.370> I<00:03:55.489> put<00:03:55.670> that<00:03:55.700> inside<00:03:56.060> there

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
bus card so if I put that inside there

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.850 
bus card so if I put that inside there
and<00:03:56.450> they<00:03:56.690> put<00:03:56.840> on<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.019> back<00:03:57.200> pocket<00:03:57.440> it<00:03:57.829> will

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
and they put on the back pocket it will

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.880 
and they put on the back pocket it will
activate<00:03:58.579> through<00:03:59.360> my<00:04:00.110> wallet<00:04:00.440> so<00:04:00.650> I<00:04:00.680> guess

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
activate through my wallet so I guess

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.170 
activate through my wallet so I guess
you<00:04:01.010> scan<00:04:01.250> it<00:04:01.310> through<00:04:01.430> my<00:04:01.489> pocket<00:04:01.820> if<00:04:01.940> I<00:04:02.000> want

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
you scan it through my pocket if I want

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.370 
you scan it through my pocket if I want
it<00:04:02.239> to<00:04:04.299> so<00:04:05.299> those<00:04:05.570> are<00:04:05.720> some<00:04:05.810> practical<00:04:06.140> uses

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
it to so those are some practical uses

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.250 
it to so those are some practical uses
for<00:04:06.590> these<00:04:06.890> NFC<00:04:07.730> cards<00:04:08.120> this<00:04:08.570> one<00:04:08.780> again<00:04:09.079> like

for these NFC cards this one again like

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.800 
for these NFC cards this one again like
it<00:04:09.440> also<00:04:09.620> contains<00:04:10.130> my<00:04:10.459> contact<00:04:10.810> information

and just in case I lose my keys what
which<00:04:16.820> isn't<00:04:16.970> likely<00:04:17.239> but<00:04:17.570> if<00:04:17.900> it<00:04:18.019> does<00:04:18.169> happen

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620
