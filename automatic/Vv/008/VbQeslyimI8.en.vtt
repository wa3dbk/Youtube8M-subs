00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.810
 youtube inspirations i'll show you in 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.620
 this video how to skewer so small 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.690
 can make 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.280
 There are blueberries in it and the whole thing 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.259
 is covered with chocolate 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.540
 It's easy and it tastes good 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.859
 Delicious that you can already as a small 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.650
 make a party snack 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.529
 on a kid's birthday or just 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.930
 so delicious in between times 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.090
 is fruit with in hall contained 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.800
 chocolate really is a whole 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.939
 great snack maybe you want 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.830
 to copy this 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.730
 if so, just look at mine now 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:39.350
 video you need fresh fruits for 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.850
 example blueberries 75 grams of couverture 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.350
 I have dark chocolate here you can 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.770
 Of course, it's also chocolate with hella 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.390
 make and small wood skewers I have so 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.039
 skewers but you can also easily 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.739
 use small toothpicks 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.030
 First, I prepare small skewers 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:00.079
 I simply stab skewers for that 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.079
 through the fruits 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.510
 It works best when you are here 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.510
 above purely engraving 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.210
 about four pieces fit on it and 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.130
 some of it is now preparing for this 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.500
 One time I impaled all of them 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.939
 and there we are still a lot of bears 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.110
 I will be left over now 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.590
 just leave it that way 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.080
 to be precise, I have 56 bears now 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.530
 used and I leave now first 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.570
 stand here and goes especially microwave 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.369
 and heat the chocolate until it is nice 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.409
 Liquid is too after a few minutes 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.200
 that my chocolate melted 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.820
 I just put it in the microwave 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.459
 The microwave is best not quite so 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.280
 make hot and then always such a 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:54.319
 minute then sit again stirring neither 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.810
 heat for a minute and keep it up 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:02:00.080
 until it finally melted completely 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:05.689
 is like that and here I dive mine now 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:08.929
 Just eat in the chocolate 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:11.110
 dive in then drain a bit 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.110
 to let 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.620
 a little twist and on the 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.250
 put the plate and the whole comes 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.250
 in the refrigirator 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.740
 Of course you can also use the spoon 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.380
 little help out and make a 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.570
 Cover a bit so all games are 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.610
 now immersed in chocolate and who 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.040
 Well , I've seen that 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.820
 already made two I could not 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.070
 resist 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.830
 The whole thing is now in the fridge 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.530
 and west for an hour and then came 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.040
 Serve that beautifully after some time 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.990
 in the fridge the skewers are ready 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.760
 even as a small tip is the skewers 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.410
 not too close to each other 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.330
 chocolate does not flow together and 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.180
 when it gets hard that's one 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.130
 large area is so nice 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.230
 apart and if you have the whole 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.670
 then I want to solve the dish I have that 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.700
 With a fork you can do it too 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.720
 with a knife just make careful of 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.550
 solve the plate 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.720
 and there are the spits now that can 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.000
 party go 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.420
 really easy and I 'm sooo 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.470
 delicious so who wants to imitate 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.480
 you can of course with all 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.070
 imitate possible fruits and so on 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.990
 chocolate skewers that reminds me then 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.640
 always a bit to the fair 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.630
 or so or christmas market then gives 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.100
 it always does 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.140
 and something you can also have very 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.519
 just do it yourself at home and with 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.950
 then you can do this blueberry like that 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.140
 make lovely little jokes 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.610
 it will not be very nice and that 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.760
 Of course it's great as well 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.810
 parties was yes if it wants to do it 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.620
