00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.627
 Music &amp; Lyrics : Mezame-P 

00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:33.427
 "liar home" 

00:00:37.426 --> 00:00:39.175
 The mood you want to see 

00:00:39.176 --> 00:00:44.278
 Beating casual noise in the opposite hand 

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:46.175
 a theory of love that wants to be tight 

00:00:46.176 --> 00:00:48.337
 Mutual test of emotions 

00:00:48.338 --> 00:00:51.293
 I was in a state of uneasiness. 

00:00:51.416 --> 00:00:53.231
 Words to you 

00:00:53.232 --> 00:00:54.988
 ●●●●●●● 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.874
 Listen attentively 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:00:59.756
 Ah, forget it. 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.492
 Have no idea 

00:01:01.493 --> 00:01:04.671
 I want to disappear like this. 

00:01:04.672 --> 00:01:08.622
 Assimilate with you among me 

00:01:08.623 --> 00:01:12.493
 Just sleep in this perfect posture. 

00:01:15.956 --> 00:01:17.725
 I’m going to cry out. 

00:01:17.726 --> 00:01:22.734
 a few rays of light in your hand 

00:01:22.735 --> 00:01:24.714
 Emotional theory that wants to block 

00:01:24.715 --> 00:01:26.894
 This mood of mutual test 

00:01:26.895 --> 00:01:29.760
 So heavy until worn out 

00:01:29.886 --> 00:01:31.753
 At my fingertips 

00:01:31.754 --> 00:01:33.520
 ●●●●●●● 

00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:35.456
 Let's unlock it. 

00:01:37.027 --> 00:01:38.286
 Ah, forget it. 

00:01:38.296 --> 00:01:40.135
 No way? 

00:01:40.136 --> 00:01:43.059
 To forget your business 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.026
 But this mood still stays here. 

00:01:47.027 --> 00:01:50.993
 Heavy rain pouring down in my eyes 

00:02:12.032 --> 00:02:13.587
 Ah, forget it. 

00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:15.326
 This is enough 

00:02:17.276 --> 00:02:18.575
 Already enough 

00:02:18.576 --> 00:02:20.379
 Let’s all pour out 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.405
 Have to leave from my side? 

00:02:23.406 --> 00:02:27.374
 The rising light flashes 

00:02:27.375 --> 00:02:30.385
 Beautiful, people want to cry 

00:02:30.386 --> 00:02:34.379
 Infiltrate the world and go beyond it. 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.326
 Discard everything 

00:02:37.327 --> 00:02:39.595
 Among me 

00:02:39.596 --> 00:02:41.375
 forever and ever 

00:02:41.376 --> 00:02:45.479
 I hope that you will be at your favorite
