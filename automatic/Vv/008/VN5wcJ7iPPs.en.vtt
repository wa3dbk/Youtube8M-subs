00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
it took us a long time to find this we

could produce the lakes malt and this is

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.459 
could produce the lakes malt and this is
perfect<00:00:35.310> it's<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.360> great<00:00:36.539> situation<00:00:36.750> we're

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
perfect it's a great situation we're

now<00:02:32.290> in<00:02:32.320> one<00:02:32.530> of<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.710> old<00:02:32.860> cattle<00:02:33.190> sheds<00:02:33.580> this

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
now in one of the old cattle sheds this

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.449 
now in one of the old cattle sheds this
used<00:02:34.570> to<00:02:34.600> be<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.780> working<00:02:35.110> farm<00:02:35.410> 15<00:02:35.980> years<00:02:36.280> ago

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
used to be a working farm 15 years ago

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.520 
used to be a working farm 15 years ago
so<00:02:36.850> it's<00:02:37.000> been<00:02:37.060> unused<00:02:37.630> for<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.840> long<00:02:38.020> time<00:02:38.320> now

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
and you can see where the cattle would

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.690 
and you can see where the cattle would
have<00:02:40.900> been<00:02:41.050> sitting<00:02:41.530> there<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.980> this<00:02:42.310> will<00:02:42.520> be

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
have been sitting there and this will be
