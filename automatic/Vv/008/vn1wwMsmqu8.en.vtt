00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello this is Ignat the amount of water on 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.480
 Our planet is huge land can safely 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.610
 call the water world 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.440
 Yuri Gagarin did not accidentally call her 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.049
 beautiful blue bowl after about 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.150
 71 percent of the earth's surface is covered 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.970
 water and the average depth of the oceans 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.740
 is 3 kilometers 700 meters volume 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.260
 of all the rivers of Mary of the oceans on earth 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.420
 so great that if you submit them 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.820
 all kind of a huge water column 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.680
 kilometer per kilometer thick then 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.289
 the height of this pillar would be so 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.809
 big that he would get about 9 times 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.399
 from earth to sun and back will remind 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.149
 the distance from the earth to the sun is 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.309
 approximately 150000000 kilometers 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.680
 by the way funny and similarities like i said 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.690
 approximately 71 percent of the earth's surface 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.610
 covered with water and about the same 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.039
 percent the human body is made up of 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.770
 water interesting is just random 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.860
 coincidence well anyway where there is no 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.899
 water is no life I have a question 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.640
 whence did she even appear when 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.289
 the land was formed it was just 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.600
 huge melted ball 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.700
 it's as if from all volcanoes at once 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.010
 spilled all the lava would flood and all 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.570
 surface to the same off the ground for the first 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.340
 several million years atmosphere 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.320
 consisted almost entirely of 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.900
 poisonous gases that are allocated first 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.610
 volcano we know what a volcano usually 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.430
 throw out lava and ash that is 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.320
 actually fire however as I found out 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.840
 it turns out all the same volcano emit 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.939
 water and volcanic gases water vapor 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.280
 is about 60 percent 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.229
 scientists believe that we are water land under 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.840
 exposure to high temperatures which 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.030
 were in the core as it were stratified into layers 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.340
 hydrogen and oxygen which entered into 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.020
 reaction due to this reaction to the ground 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.420
 then through volcanoes began to go out 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.189
 water vapor later cypress 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.829
 condensed rain fell out and 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.630
 The first oceans were Japanese scientists 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.220
 in confirmation of that hypothesis discovered in 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.680
 terrestrial water the so-called heavy 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.090
 hydrogen which they think originated 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.130
 at the first chemical reactions 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.990
 flowing inside the earth but how would 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.759
 convincing theory didn't sound many 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.310
 scientists disagree with her that 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.860
 water was brought to earth by asteroids 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.689
 containing water ice when steroids 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.759
 burned in the atmosphere of the earth water from them 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.340
 evaporated and then it condensed 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.800
 and it rained on 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.569
 not ocean and immediately after forming on 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.220
 billion ice 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.349
 asteroids that brought us here 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.750
 water is amazing but consensus 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.849
 there are no scientists about water 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.709
 however, most agree 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.379
 that water on earth has both earthly and 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.299
 cosmic origin is established that 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.980
 every year with asteroids comes on 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.080
 the earth is about one and a half cubic 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.000
 kilometers of water for example such a view 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.950
 asteroids both are depressed and very rich 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.720
 water ice in general scientists lead 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.580
 heated debate over which 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.920
 proportions water flew in from space and 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.319
 appeared on earth I have also emerged 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.660
 another question from where at all in space 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.700
 I took the led because as far as I heard the water 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.680
 in space they evaporate somewhere 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.599
 an ice planet exploded and and shards 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.819
 scattered like asteroids and comets 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.980
 there is no definite answer here either 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.840
 scientists tend to hypothesis that water 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.370
 possibly formed during thermal 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.590
 reactions some time after 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.410
 the rise of the solar system on 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.730
 distance a little further than earth and mars 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.470
 then under the influence of gravity she 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.349
 stuck together in a piece of ice of which 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.879
 Ledin and asteroids and comets appeared 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.100
 by the way scientists say that at that time in 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.900
 the asteroid belt was so warm that 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.760
 perhaps it was there that arose 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.370
 the first organic molecules of which 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.889
 there was life on earth the next question 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.650
 and that the land is one so lucky that water 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:29.030
 only appeared on it as it turned out 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.040
 water is very much where 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.500
 for example, mars is not orange at all 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.510
 the desert seems to him as well as on 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.950
 Earth has polar caps consisting of 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.380
 million cubic kilometers 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.760
 frozen water and recently space 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.069
 phoenix device found under 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.079
 surface huge reserves of ice from 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.480
 photos before immediately under a layer of dust 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.130
 if all this ice melted to mars 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.349
 would be covered with a layer of water as thick as 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.239
 several hundred meters the problem is that 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.099
 Mars has very low pressure 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.709
 atmosphere and water there because of this 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.329
 there may be a liquid state but in 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.160
 past the atmosphere was there significantly 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.359
 denser is that the planet was 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.250
 covered by the ocean 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.480
 water is also on other planets 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.639
 solar system 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.470
 for example on the satellites of Jupiter Europe 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:11.989
 water as it turned out twice as much 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.000
 on earth nasa believe that this is the most 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.070
 probable candidate for existence 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.690
 life because there is liquid water 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.570
 most likely have a life 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.940
 By the way, more about Mars, we know that 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.660
 it has a reddish tint to that color 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.460
 he is obliged 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.780
 why amounts of iron oxide that is 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.270
 roughly rust 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.220
 iron oxide occurs when iron 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.410
 reacts with the oxygen contained in 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.200
 air turns out that on mars once 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.850
 there was a lot of oxygen only 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.390
 the source of so many 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.860
 oxygen is living plant organisms 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.510
 it turns out that the answer to the question is if 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.670
 life or at least was life 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.890
 on mars is literally on the surface 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.990
 maybe all these space investigators and 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.850
 we do not agree on something big 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.440
 Thanks for watching, don't forget 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.440
 subscribe we will understand that 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.730
 going on with this world further 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.190
 gravity us mass is only 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.650
 only eight thousandths of gravity on 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.020
 surface of the earth so on the surface 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:09.430
 meme you would be able to jump as much 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.430
 at 125 meters
