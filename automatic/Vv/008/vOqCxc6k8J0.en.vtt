00:00:59.429 --> 00:00:59.439 
getting it allows for us to be able to

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:01.740 
getting it allows for us to be able to
do<00:00:59.650> composting<00:01:00.250> and<00:01:00.430> then<00:01:00.519> once<00:01:00.760> we<00:01:01.360> were<00:01:01.390> able

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750

do composting and then once we were able
to<00:01:01.780> do<00:01:02.110> that<00:01:02.320> we<00:01:02.589> immediately<00:01:03.070> got<00:01:03.309> into

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
to do that we immediately got into

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.270 
to do that we immediately got into
stores<00:01:03.900> our<00:01:04.900> schaumburg<00:01:05.379> location<00:01:05.920> was<00:01:06.100> one

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
stores our schaumburg location was one

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.039 
stores our schaumburg location was one
of<00:01:06.369> the<00:01:06.430> first<00:01:06.580> stores<00:01:07.000> to<00:01:07.299> have<00:01:07.540> it<00:01:07.720> and<00:01:07.900> now

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
of the first stores to have it and now

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.690 
of the first stores to have it and now
it's<00:01:08.200> expanding<00:01:08.770> across<00:01:08.979> our<00:01:09.220> region<00:01:09.610> there

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
it's expanding across our region there

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.630 
it's expanding across our region there
definitely<00:01:10.150> some<00:01:10.570> hurdles<00:01:10.930> to<00:01:11.830> incorporating

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
definitely some hurdles to incorporating

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.420 
definitely some hurdles to incorporating
composting<00:01:13.509> most<00:01:14.500> of<00:01:14.650> it<00:01:14.770> has<00:01:14.950> to<00:01:15.100> do<00:01:15.340> with

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
composting most of it has to do with

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.100 
composting most of it has to do with
just<00:01:15.670> training<00:01:15.909> people<00:01:16.240> getting<00:01:16.689> them<00:01:16.840> into

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
just training people getting them into

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.530 
just training people getting them into
the<00:01:17.140> habit<00:01:17.380> it's<00:01:17.740> a<00:01:17.860> daily<00:01:18.100> habit<00:01:18.400> of<00:01:19.119> doing

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
the habit it's a daily habit of doing

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.870

this<00:01:19.810> every<00:01:20.590> single<00:01:20.770> day<00:01:20.950> and<00:01:21.100> getting<00:01:21.700> used

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
this every single day and getting used

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.370 
this every single day and getting used
to<00:01:22.090> having<00:01:22.329> them<00:01:22.630> be<00:01:22.780> a<00:01:22.810> part<00:01:22.869> of<00:01:23.140> your<00:01:23.259> life

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
but once you get over that it's really

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.120 
but once you get over that it's really

paper dough flour sugar
I<00:02:08.959> even<00:02:09.959> have<00:02:10.289> things<00:02:10.560> are<00:02:10.709> coated<00:02:11.039> and

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
I even have things are coated and

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.370 
I even have things are coated and
elapsed<00:02:11.730> now<00:02:12.300> this<00:02:12.540> stuff<00:02:12.810> even<00:02:13.140> though<00:02:13.230> it's

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
elapsed now this stuff even though it's

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.290 
elapsed now this stuff even though it's
shiny<00:02:13.680> it's<00:02:14.040> still<00:02:14.310> biodegrades

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
shiny it's still biodegrades

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.740 
shiny it's still biodegrades
so<00:02:15.569> it's<00:02:15.690> just<00:02:15.810> paper<00:02:16.080> or<00:02:16.290> wax<00:02:17.390> again<00:02:18.390> anything

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
so it's just paper or wax again anything

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.729 
so it's just paper or wax again anything
that<00:02:18.870> biodegrades

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
that biodegrades

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.240

it<00:02:19.980> brought<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.780> an<00:02:21.780> actual<00:02:22.250> composting

their<00:02:53.750> compactor<00:02:54.320> so<00:02:54.860> what<00:02:55.040> we<00:02:55.130> determined<00:02:55.610> is

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
their compactor so what we determined is

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.180 
their compactor so what we determined is
about<00:02:55.910> 80<00:02:56.240> to<00:02:56.480> 90<00:02:56.810> percent<00:02:57.200> of<00:02:57.470> their<00:02:57.830> trash

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
about 80 to 90 percent of their trash

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.610 
about 80 to 90 percent of their trash
was<00:02:58.730> compostable<00:02:59.120> material<00:02:59.810> one<00:03:00.410> way<00:03:00.560> to

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
was compostable material one way to

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.050 
was compostable material one way to
illustrate<00:03:00.830> how<00:03:01.370> successful<00:03:01.940> this<00:03:02.000> program

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
illustrate how successful this program

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.230 
illustrate how successful this program
is<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:02.750> me<00:03:02.840> or<00:03:03.350> has<00:03:04.100> been<00:03:04.370> is<00:03:04.670> to<00:03:04.880> look<00:03:05.000> at<00:03:05.150> the

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
is to me or has been is to look at the

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.570 
is to me or has been is to look at the
compactor<00:03:05.900> behind<00:03:06.230> me<00:03:06.440> this<00:03:06.860> is<00:03:06.920> our<00:03:07.160> compost

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
compactor behind me this is our compost

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.390 
compactor behind me this is our compost
compactor<00:03:08.270> prior<00:03:09.110> to<00:03:09.380> our<00:03:09.620> composting

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
compactor prior to our composting

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.160 
compactor prior to our composting
program<00:03:10.880> this<00:03:11.360> would<00:03:11.630> have<00:03:11.750> been<00:03:11.960> our

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
program this would have been our

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.740 
program this would have been our
landfill<00:03:12.710> and<00:03:13.220> not<00:03:13.370> only<00:03:13.460> was<00:03:14.240> it<00:03:14.270> this<00:03:14.510> size

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
landfill and not only was it this size

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.460 
landfill and not only was it this size
but<00:03:14.990> it's<00:03:15.110> actually<00:03:15.470> one<00:03:16.990> if<00:03:17.990> you<00:03:18.110> look<00:03:18.260> behind

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
but it's actually one if you look behind

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.420 
but it's actually one if you look behind
me<00:03:18.950> over<00:03:19.100> here<00:03:19.520> what<00:03:19.940> we<00:03:20.090> have<00:03:20.300> now<00:03:20.540> is<00:03:20.900> our

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
me over here what we have now is our

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.520 
me over here what we have now is our
garbage<00:03:22.430> so<00:03:22.970> these<00:03:23.180> two<00:03:23.480> bins<00:03:23.720> over<00:03:23.990> here<00:03:24.230> are

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
garbage so these two bins over here are

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.990 
garbage so these two bins over here are
all<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:25.040> lands<00:03:25.220> those<00:03:27.130> whole<00:03:28.130> foods<00:03:28.430> has<00:03:28.730> been

we've completely reversed that too we're

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.320 
we've completely reversed that too we're
only<00:05:05.390> now<00:05:05.540> like<00:05:05.870> 10%<00:05:06.320> goes<00:05:06.830> into<00:05:07.250> landfill<00:05:07.790> and

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
only now like 10% goes into landfill and

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.810 
only now like 10% goes into landfill and
that<00:05:08.390> means<00:05:08.660> 80%<00:05:09.170> or<00:05:09.830> so<00:05:10.010> of<00:05:10.160> our<00:05:10.340> waste<00:05:10.580> is

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
that means 80% or so of our waste is

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.120
