00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
for a got to be able to hold your block

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.110 
for a got to be able to hold your block
so<00:05:15.100> that's<00:05:15.310> what<00:05:15.430> I<00:05:15.490> got<00:05:15.639> to<00:05:15.699> do<00:05:15.789> a<00:05:15.820> little<00:05:15.940> bit

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
so that's what I got to do a little bit

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.219 
so that's what I got to do a little bit
more<00:05:16.240> when<00:05:16.389> I<00:05:16.419> decided<00:05:16.780> to<00:05:16.870> do<00:05:16.930> like<00:05:17.110> an

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
more when I decided to do like an

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.050 
more when I decided to do like an
outside<00:05:17.560> run<00:05:17.800> a<00:05:18.010> sweep<00:05:18.520> or<00:05:18.820> anything<00:05:19.030> like

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
outside run a sweep or anything like

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.510 
outside run a sweep or anything like
that<00:05:19.150> it's<00:05:19.780> just<00:05:19.840> better<00:05:20.139> to<00:05:20.260> add<00:05:20.979> some<00:05:21.280> tight

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520
