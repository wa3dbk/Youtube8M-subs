00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
here's where the water is coming into

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.150 
here's where the water is coming into
the<00:00:29.730> house<00:00:29.939> from<00:00:30.420> underground<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.500> splits<00:00:31.949> off

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
the house from underground it splits off

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.430 
the house from underground it splits off
into<00:00:32.250> house<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.969> sprinklers<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.570> have<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.750> line

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
into house and sprinklers I have a line

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.979 
into house and sprinklers I have a line
to<00:00:34.620> drain<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.130> pipe<00:00:35.340> which<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.390> do<00:00:36.450> when<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.750> win

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
to drain the pipe which I do when I win

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.380 
to drain the pipe which I do when I win
tries<00:00:37.260> but<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.250> also<00:00:38.370> use<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.910> hose<00:00:39.149> to

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
tries but I can also use this hose to

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.040 
tries but I can also use this hose to
fill<00:00:39.629> up<00:00:39.870> these<00:00:40.649> drums<00:00:41.210> every<00:00:42.210> year<00:00:42.660> every

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
fill up these drums every year every

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.430 
fill up these drums every year every
year<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.590> should<00:00:43.829> change<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.640> out<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.809> once

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
year you should change it out so once

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.650 
year you should change it out so once
they're<00:00:46.800> full<00:00:47.160> they<00:00:47.460> are<00:00:47.579> extremely<00:00:48.300> heavy

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
they're full they are extremely heavy

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.209 
they're full they are extremely heavy
but<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:49.140> can<00:00:49.410> kind<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.860> walk<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.399> out<00:00:51.020> a<00:00:52.020> bit<00:00:52.559> so

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
but you can kind of walk it out a bit so

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.549 
but you can kind of walk it out a bit so
it's<00:00:53.520> okay<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:54.539> under<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.899> shelf<00:00:55.289> and

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
it's okay that it's under a shelf and

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.729 
it's okay that it's under a shelf and
then<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.520> can<00:00:56.730> use<00:00:56.910> one<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.210> these<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:58.230> siphon

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
then you can use one of these to siphon

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.670 
then you can use one of these to siphon
out<00:00:59.359> the<00:01:00.359> water<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.989> put<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.879> flexible<00:01:02.879> part

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
out the water you put the flexible part

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.980 
out the water you put the flexible part
wherever<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.769> want<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.220> go<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.990> part

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
wherever you want it to go and this part

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.700 
wherever you want it to go and this part
goes<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.860> tank<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.430> use<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.909> as<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> pump<00:01:09.710> to

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
goes in the tank and use it as a pump to

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.690 
goes in the tank and use it as a pump to
pump<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.580> out<00:01:11.670> once<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.119> start<00:01:13.700> there's

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
pump it out once you start there's

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.149 
pump it out once you start there's
another<00:01:15.000> one<00:01:15.270> let's<00:01:16.200> go<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.350> long<00:01:16.619> handle<00:01:17.070> you

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
another one let's go to long handle you

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.789 
another one let's go to long handle you
just<00:01:17.220> pump<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.119> up<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.390> down<00:01:18.479> once<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.530> start

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
just pump it up and down once you start

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.499 
just pump it up and down once you start
it<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.130> starts<00:01:20.369> siphoning<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.210> then<00:01:21.330> it

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
it just starts siphoning and then it

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.710 
it just starts siphoning and then it
just<00:01:21.689> keeps<00:01:21.900> flowing<00:01:22.259> out<00:01:22.939> so<00:01:24.860> you<00:01:25.860> can<00:01:26.720> change

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
just keeps flowing out so you can change

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.929 
just keeps flowing out so you can change
it<00:01:27.900> like<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.320> now<00:01:28.860> for<00:01:29.729> 55<00:01:30.270> gallons<00:01:31.939> you're

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
it like that now for 55 gallons you're

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.399 
it like that now for 55 gallons you're
gonna<00:01:33.090> need<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.630> use<00:01:33.659> about<00:01:34.049> 7<00:01:35.009> teaspoons<00:01:35.670> of

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
gonna need to use about 7 teaspoons of

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.380 
gonna need to use about 7 teaspoons of
bleach<00:01:37.409> just<00:01:38.070> regular<00:01:38.670> bleach<00:01:38.939> with<00:01:39.210> no

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
bleach just regular bleach with no

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.539

smells or anything fancy about it and

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.069 
smells or anything fancy about it and
it's<00:01:44.549> not<00:01:44.790> very<00:01:45.000> much<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.479> like<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.720> shot

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
it's not very much it's like a shot

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.230 
it's not very much it's like a shot
glass<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:48.710> if<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:50.430> don't<00:01:50.579> know<00:01:50.670> teaspoons

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
glass and if you don't know teaspoons

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.899 
glass and if you don't know teaspoons
are<00:01:51.570> abbreviated<00:01:52.530> TSP<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.759> about

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
are abbreviated TSP so this is about

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:05.080 
are abbreviated TSP so this is about
seven<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:57.229> I'm<00:01:58.229> just<00:01:58.439> gonna<00:01:58.560> dump<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.009> in<00:01:59.159> here

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:18.430 

and<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.210> can<00:02:06.420> take<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.869> hose<00:02:09.500> put<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.679> in

from falling out and then turn it on so
this<00:02:26.910> is<00:02:27.090> gonna<00:02:27.209> take<00:02:27.540> some<00:02:27.780> time<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:28.080> fill<00:02:28.470> up

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
this is gonna take some time to fill up

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.070 
this is gonna take some time to fill up
I<00:02:31.880> shine<00:02:32.880> light<00:02:33.090> down<00:02:33.330> in<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.630> so<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:33.810> can<00:02:33.840> see

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
I shine light down in it so I can see

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.199 
I shine light down in it so I can see
how<00:02:34.230> full<00:02:34.470> it's<00:02:34.620> getting<00:02:34.880> it's<00:02:35.880> gonna<00:02:36.060> have<00:02:36.180> to

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
how full it's getting it's gonna have to

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.250 
how full it's getting it's gonna have to
guess<00:02:36.569> and<00:02:36.900> this<00:02:37.860> took<00:02:38.069> about<00:02:38.390> 17<00:02:39.390> minutes<00:02:39.810> so

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
guess and this took about 17 minutes so

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.589 
guess and this took about 17 minutes so
far<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.650> fill<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:40.950> up<00:02:41.040> this<00:02:41.220> one<00:02:41.450> well<00:02:42.450> that's

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
far to fill it up this one well that's

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.910 
far to fill it up this one well that's
going<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.840> depend<00:02:43.110> on<00:02:43.230> your<00:02:43.380> water<00:02:43.620> pressure

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
going to depend on your water pressure

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.990 
going to depend on your water pressure
and<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.340> size<00:02:44.580> of<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.790> hose<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:45.150> have<00:02:47.000> and

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
and the size of the hose you have and

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.259 
and the size of the hose you have and
this<00:02:48.120> is<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.360> five<00:02:48.660> gallon<00:02:48.959> drum<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:50.670> has<00:02:50.880> a

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
this is a five gallon drum and it has a

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.960 
this is a five gallon drum and it has a
cap<00:02:51.900> here<00:02:52.230> it's<00:02:52.650> actually<00:02:52.829> not<00:02:53.310> punctured<00:02:53.849> on

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
cap here it's actually not punctured on

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.740 
cap here it's actually not punctured on
this<00:02:54.180> side<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:55.200> allows<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.799> if<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.190> wanted

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
this side it allows you to if you wanted

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.020 
this side it allows you to if you wanted
to<00:02:57.750> use<00:02:57.930> that<00:02:57.959> so<00:02:58.620> that's<00:02:58.920> just<00:02:59.160> they<00:02:59.819> kept

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030
