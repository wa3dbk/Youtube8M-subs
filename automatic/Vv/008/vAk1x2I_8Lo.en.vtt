00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.480
 there are specific products for 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.250
 then or very much rabbits puppies 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.980
 young and products instead of later 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.810
 will be suitable for adult rabbits 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.390
 then we go to a store and buy 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.539
 something for our puppy like 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.669
 every being like every creature being 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.720
 living will need to eat what it is 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.190
 suitable for a puppy as for food 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.650
 many products exist on the market 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.829
 those I especially recommend 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.630
 they are products that do not have cereals 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.450
 so they have nothing of those things 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:52.340
 colored that please our people 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.170
 eyes but little pleasure to their stomach and 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.270
 or that there are cereals in quantity 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.149
 really minimal products for i 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.030
 puppies must have inside too 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.649
 of alfalfa in good quantity 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.039
 there are some brands that a lot 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:09.119
 who are in Italy as lab years 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:11.060
 you will have to be careful being a 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.009
 puppy that alone there is written young 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.660
 precisely for puppies the product 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.090
 main power of the 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.009
 rabbit is hay when the rabbit is 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.259
 a lot of puppy will need a 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.700
 greater protein intake then we will have 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.700
 need to give you alfalfa 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:37.540
 we will find written or alfalfa or 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:40.180
 farfa to this should be given every day 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.460
 along with the more classic plan that 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.990
 said policy or that made of 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.820
 all the various herbs in the field that 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.860
 it will be the same plan we will give instead 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.410
 even to an adult rabbit 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.090
 naturally then once purchased 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.260
 these things for our little one 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.650
 we'll have to make a trip from 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:00.310
 greengrocer then why then where 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.090
 buy other things for her 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.790
 supply 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.000
 instead if we find inside our house 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.940
 an adult naturally the animal feed 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.120
 it must be slightly different so 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.740
 there will be a need for 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.040
 lower proteins then a minor 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.410
 intake of alfalfa and alfa alpha 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.020
 trade there are other products 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.710
 just for adult rabbits starting from 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:30.430
 always the bathrooms that there is its basis 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:32.920
 or 48 types of plants that 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.970
 they come just from the lawn mass 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.950
 together they form one of the small cylinders 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.330
 a little bit older than 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.330
 those we are used to thinking 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.190
 or as I always told you about pinky 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.770
 the whole line of four-leaf clovers brighten 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.080
 our rabbit also with 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.660
 at the internal entrance with 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.020
 precisely to the integrations of fruit such as 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.930
 bananas like blackberries like blueberries 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:06.640
 strawberries or with vegetables like 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.440
 paintings like chicory fennel or celery 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.930
 carrots 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.990
 besides this there are other products like 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.130
 I told you in commerce 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.950
 the important thing is that ta face attention 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.810
 I repeat that there are few inside 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.120
 there are no cereals at all or that are 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.110
 their quantity is very small indeed 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.110
 very low horn
