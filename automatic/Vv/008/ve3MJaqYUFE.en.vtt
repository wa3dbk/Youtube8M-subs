 Hello, this is Maria Luisa Marquez in 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.110
 this video will teach you certain 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.330
 tricks that I use for my makeup 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.700
 television especially to prepare the 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.070
 skin and create contours tips that you 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.250
 they give in my image courses here I am 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.230
 without makeup you can see the difference 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.259
 I will use as colored corrector mag 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.630
 of three cryo land and I'll apply it where 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:27.359
 there are dark areas like below 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.759
 the eyes in triangular shape and in the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.820
 eyelids to the bone of the eyebrows 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:35.430
 As you can see it is yellow, you see that 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.960
 It is ideal for my skin type because this 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.960
 you have to know how to choose it very well 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:51.420
 the base that he used is the leo de crÃ­o la 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.120
 Cndh also applied it in small 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.760
 Touch with a sponge to create 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.699
 contours used this concealer in 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.329
 cream mack is much darker than my 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.659
 skin and placed it under the cheekbones this 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.210
 it's two fingers lower than the eyes in 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.840
 linear shape and blurring with small 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.210
 touches 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.350
 To seal the base, use several 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:21.130
 powders by parts a very clear for the 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.549
 eye area blush tanned low 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.340
 the cheekbones and sides of the forehead for the 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.469
 rest of the face I used this powder 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.920
 translucent is my favorite 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:34.959
 steele 4 cryo land as you will see what 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.289
 I placed in the remaining areas of 

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:40.810
 face may also observe that 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:43.090
 place enough light powder under the 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.819
 eyes because this has a purpose not 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.739
 it looks like this is really to protect 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:50.229
 any shade color that falls 

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:52.420
 while we make up the eyelids here 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.390
 i'm also using shadows i think lan 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:07.689
 mate is not advised on television that 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:10.810
 Use shiny makeup though in 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:13.840
 this case apply a very pearly shadow 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.819
 subtle in the bone of the eyebrows 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.819
 then delineated to the lashes 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.650
 fake etcetera the dust is removed 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.060
 clear under the eyes so that the look 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.250
 is fully illuminated 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.080
