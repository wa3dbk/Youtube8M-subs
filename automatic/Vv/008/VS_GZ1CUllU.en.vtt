00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.040
 then 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.040
 Well 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.089
 an office for all the kids here and ricky 

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:27.640
 of the staff of the last fifa italy team 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.980
 and today we are with the 2000 special 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.349
 first of all, we want you 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.870
 thank for all the registrations that 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.729
 you did for the shares for the mi 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.729
 like for visualizations 

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:41.260
 we are very happy to thank you 

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:43.659
 we say that we also made a 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.120
 give us no more than do it to you 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:48.839
 we wanted to bring you the review of 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.839
 zlatan ibrahimovic 

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:54.970
 ii see 12 games in 28 goals and there are 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:56.530
 also went slow a few times guys 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.720
 a phenomenal player 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.150
 we wanted to bring you this review 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.019
 exactly as already mentioned for the special 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.699
 2000 members 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.270
 then we send to speak of immediately 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.909
 this player while you see all the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.820
 features scroll in the video I will 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.439
 I'm going to talk about the features in 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.500
 more detailed way 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.899
 then we leave immediately for zlatan 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.060
 ibrahimovic a nice 90 ball control 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:23.979
 what guys are phenomenal 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.020
 practically never loses a ball there 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.470
 ball is always attached to the foot then 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.170
 let's talk about the steps he took at 1 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:36.370
 81 as general statistic that yes 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:40.270
 they turn into 76 of long passages and 84 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:43.229
 of courts however having 83 capita division 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.060
 well as he does the phenomenal passages 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.970
 I think the shorts are better like 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.520
 passages for which dialogues well with maybe 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.310
 the playmaker or the second striker though 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.320
 even the long ones and 76 thanks to the 83 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.570
 division I would say that are fine 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.729
 because he made pitch changes 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.700
 really done well and then we go to 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:08.379
 talk about a pro how can we not 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.090
 mention the shooting at an effect 80 that 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:12.489
 guys make you react or 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.840
 spectacular I do not speak of the throws of 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.730
 precision I talk about shooting 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:21.330
 from outside and then to 1 88 of longshot that 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.459
 boys and spectacular 93 of power of 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.269
 I understand well that he is throwing mines 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.230
 absurd and 91 finalization boys is 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.330
 a value 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.709
 amazing in front they carry it 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.659
 especially in the air 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.349
 practically how obvious and it is he to 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:39.209
 you can never shoot and score 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.970
 miss the goal because he practically 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.340
 sail will always put in any 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.890
 what happens in the air maybe even in a 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.319
 rebound as you see in the clips maybe 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.370
 a somewhat confusing action but he did 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:55.379
 will always put out from outside maybe not 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.450
 always marks but I have to say that 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.579
 he behaved well then to a 91 of 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.489
 rigori ne activated several draws 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:04.049
 everyone is a little against are the kicks 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.000
 of punishment I in this piva liso 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.799
 pull really well but never 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.150
 I managed to score with him I don't know 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.730
 I put between the cons 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.670
 even if it is not really meeting however there 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.859
 then there is a speed of 76 that is 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.870
 transforms into 74 of accelerations that 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.090
 absolutely a counter he takes 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.099
 speed is a diesel let's say yes 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.319
 it picks up speed is fine though 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:28.139
 acceleration 74 is too low 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:31.139
 whereas it is also quite large 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.799
 physically but then the speed 77 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.109
 maxim 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:37.950
 thanks to the 93 of physical strength that it 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:40.530
 helps a casino is fine then at 1 86 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.850
 and agility that maybe doing right and 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.920
 left and taking advantage of physical strength 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.520
 it can help you a lot we say so 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.050
 then to 88 dribbling with four stars 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.150
 schir understand well that you go away 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.710
 easily always helped with strength 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.770
 physics maybe if you miss dribbling 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:59.500
 which helps physical strength to throw away 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.090
 the opponents go ahead and then to 1 84 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.800
 of aggressiveness that I liked 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.820
 so much he just loses the ball 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.410
 recovers immediately manages to do 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.320
 share the action 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:14.320
 then to a 76 header but is tall 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:17.950
 195 therefore could also have 50 between 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.980
 quotes and it was fine with 72 of salt 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:24.460
 but being exactly 81 95 is fine 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.140
 both on the spizzate and on the shots test 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.210
 making goals is excellent then four stars 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.100
 feet and weak last year had 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.570
 five chance 5 star weak foot 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.090
 I don't know why they have it this year 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.940
 lowered but okay and then to a warcraft 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.370
 really good medium low though 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.590
 consider that it has 86 positioning 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.530
 so it helps a lot and I would say that 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.870
 the low level of defense is excellent 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.090
 because with better maybe sometimes a little to 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.760
 midfield, however, makes the team go up 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.530
 I used it in many modules but I did 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.810
 I'm better off in a two-man attack 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.670
 I have to tell the truth because he could 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.510
 dialogue well with the second chaff 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:03.400
 had the midfielders enter 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.650
 I also used gourcouff inform that 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.600
 among other things, he was an excellent player 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.220
 then inserting a playmaker is good 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.290
 it also gave excellent assists 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.590
 but guys who say this player 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.000
 phenomenal if you have all those credits 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.580
 spend it and take yourself for me 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.110
 the striker is the strongest tt in the game 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.670
 sincerely at least until now I have 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.400
 he then tried the various versions 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.350
 in the form of the various players is another 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.630
 thing 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.150
 well the review is going to end here 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.330
 I tell you 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.730
 I will list the pros and cons of this 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.650
 too much control player 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.080
 power ball shooting finalization force 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.420
 physical and header and flop 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.700
 acceleration and I kicked him 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.760
 punishment then we say the players 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.470
 alternative that is only one at the end but 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.390
 it's just that alternative if maybe 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.740
 you want to spend less and get closer 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.310
 it's just like him though 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.100
 approach 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:59.040
 I would say benzema because we say yes 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:01.680
 they resemble little can however ibra and ibra 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.680
 there is no question the good guys 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.450
 review ends here 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.900
 I would say at least 50 like it for this 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:13.350
 phenomenon for this amazing point 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:15.420
 you have to bring us maybe we have 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:18.990
 put the maximum effort 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:20.760
 nothing left a like as said is 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.950
 go to the facebook page in 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.140
 description we see ourselves in a 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:28.100
 next video hello to all guys and 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.100
 all good
