00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.709
 so Julian for 100 m eyelashes this participation 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.279
 it's my second year 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.169
 this year passed to the first turn buyer 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:21.109
 sixth place is already laps 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.789
 cellectis is to eliminate freedom quarter-finals at roland-garros five 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:24.410
 last months 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.440
 only one person good road so much better 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:30.179
 we will see tomorrow 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.230
 tomorrow the match 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.140
 if we know that he is 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.370
 and the terrain like the US consider the animalists and then that's 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.400
 it's pretty funny 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.660
 titan up 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.580
 it's in order to become a press release 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.749
 I vote 

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:45.749
 keystone women and four men like women and it's a very big 

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:48.190
 player also a shame 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.070
 she kept swinging at the stage you're there 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.030
 the man who was possible it's still a free kick for a lot worked 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.030
 so 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.500
 we find many relied on him when navy pen 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.860
 everyone believes 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.360
 but I mean little saying that missouri this new a form of 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.380
 pressure that we try to avoid because of course the player's team 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.550
 which emphasizes another 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.790
 but I promise you that I know a little 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.420
 more precisely then say they are already putting a lot of pressure 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.290
 constant compared to coaches compared to parents we hope we 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.520
 hope everyone had to flourish in this sport that have the most 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.520
 part because there are huge possibilities 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.750
 that they tie up to protect him all blacks on weekends which more is 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.970
 sponsors and two tempting offers you can already do it 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.299
 for now popular welcome in advance of course he was holding 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.530
 by its equipment manufacturers not even more tennis or textile rackets and 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.650
 textile 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.930
 but who do not play the game is clearly not playing for money 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.670
 playing with having this or that thing so that's already very good 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.460
 conducted 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.170
 it's true that what we want 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.550
 it is necessary to show the attraction of paris there are certain players 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.390
 it's already gone into a kind of star system we try at all costs 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.390
 avoid 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.880
 I speak only at 30% 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.470
 preferring races 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.910
 when an experience
