00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.179 
two little holes there and what those do
those<00:01:28.340> are<00:01:29.150> it's<00:01:29.780> a<00:01:29.869> light<00:01:30.110> reader<00:01:30.409> so<00:01:30.890> what

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
those are it's a light reader so what

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.069 
those are it's a light reader so what
happens<00:01:31.490> is<00:01:31.610> when<00:01:31.790> I<00:01:31.850> turn<00:01:31.909> it<00:01:32.150> on<00:01:32.299> there's<00:01:32.869> two

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
happens is when I turn it on there's two

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:34.780 
happens is when I turn it on there's two
modes<00:01:33.290> to<00:01:33.530> it<00:01:33.619> but<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.829> first<00:01:33.979> mode<00:01:34.280> when<00:01:34.729> I

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
modes to it but the first mode when I

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.550 
modes to it but the first mode when I
turn<00:01:35.000> it<00:01:35.090> on<00:01:35.180> it's<00:01:35.659> really<00:01:35.869> difficult<00:01:36.020> to<00:01:36.290> hear

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
turn it on it's really difficult to hear

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.740 
turn it on it's really difficult to hear
but<00:01:36.979> as<00:01:37.070> I<00:01:37.220> put<00:01:37.430> my<00:01:37.460> hand<00:01:37.820> over<00:01:38.000> it<00:01:38.329> it's

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
but as I put my hand over it it's

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.350 
but as I put my hand over it it's
sending<00:01:39.320> a<00:01:39.500> light<00:01:39.680> beam<00:01:39.890> up<00:01:40.159> and<00:01:40.520> bouncing<00:01:41.270> it

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
sending a light beam up and bouncing it

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.660 
sending a light beam up and bouncing it
back<00:01:41.540> down<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.259> once<00:01:42.680> it's<00:01:42.890> registered<00:01:43.400> the

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
back down and once it's registered the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.600 
back down and once it's registered the
distance<00:01:44.119> I<00:01:44.360> then<00:01:44.900> press<00:01:45.229> just<00:01:46.100> like<00:01:46.159> Ben<00:01:46.430> does

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
distance I then press just like Ben does

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.410 
distance I then press just like Ben does
in<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:46.850> cartoon

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
in the cartoon

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.719 
in the cartoon
and<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:49.110> hear<00:01:49.290> an<00:01:49.380> alien's<00:01:49.740> voice<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.549> there's

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
and you hear an alien's voice so there's

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.370 
and you hear an alien's voice so there's
ten<00:01:50.970> different<00:01:51.000> voices<00:01:51.659> in<00:01:51.689> here<00:01:52.020> so

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
ten different voices in here so

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.469 
ten different voices in here so
depending<00:01:52.710> on<00:01:52.770> how<00:01:52.950> far<00:01:53.250> my<00:01:53.520> hand<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.030> away

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
depending on how far my hand is away

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.469 
depending on how far my hand is away
from<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.960> watch<00:01:55.680> face<00:01:56.100> it's<00:01:56.939> registering

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
from the watch face it's registering

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.999 
from the watch face it's registering
that<00:01:57.630> distance<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.350> then<00:01:58.619> when<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.770> press<00:01:58.979> down

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
that distance and then when I press down

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.859 
that distance and then when I press down
it's<00:01:59.790> gonna<00:01:59.939> give<00:02:00.119> me<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.270> different<00:02:00.570> aliens

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
it's gonna give me a different aliens

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.660 
it's gonna give me a different aliens
voice<00:02:01.080> so<00:02:01.619> there's<00:02:01.770> ten<00:02:01.950> different<00:02:02.250> voices<00:02:02.549> in

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
voice so there's ten different voices in

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.399 
voice so there's ten different voices in
there<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:03.180> based<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.509> wherever<00:02:03.689> my<00:02:03.930> hand<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.380> a

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
there so based on wherever my hand is a

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.080 
there so based on wherever my hand is a
relation<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.039> that<00:02:05.190> thing<00:02:05.670> I'll<00:02:05.909> get<00:02:06.060> a

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
relation to that thing I'll get a

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.820 
relation to that thing I'll get a
different<00:02:06.390> aliens<00:02:06.720> voice<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.409> be<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.590> lot<00:02:07.740> of

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
different aliens voice so be a lot of

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.380 
different aliens voice so be a lot of
fun<00:02:08.009> for<00:02:08.190> kids<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.459> try<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.729> figure<00:02:08.850> out<00:02:09.000> how

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
fun for kids to try and figure out how

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.210 
fun for kids to try and figure out how
far<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.929> distance<00:02:10.050> they<00:02:10.500> need<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.890> go<00:02:11.009> in

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
far of a distance they need to go in

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.920 
far of a distance they need to go in
order<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.489> get<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.760> right<00:02:11.850> alien<00:02:12.060> because<00:02:12.780> all

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
Omnitrix so just like him you're gonna

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.370 
Omnitrix so just like him you're gonna
have<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.910> figure<00:02:18.060> out<00:02:18.180> what<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.870> distance<00:02:19.019> is

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
have to figure out what the distance is

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.470 
have to figure out what the distance is
to<00:02:19.530> dial<00:02:19.769> in<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.010> exact<00:02:20.340> alien<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.850> want<00:02:21.060> so

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
to dial in the exact alien you want so

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.720 
to dial in the exact alien you want so
that's<00:02:21.600> about<00:02:21.720> one<00:02:22.110> in<00:02:22.140> Moe<00:02:22.530> -<00:02:22.590> we<00:02:23.310> switch<00:02:23.550> that

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
that's about one in Moe - we switch that

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.550 
that's about one in Moe - we switch that
over<00:02:23.970> this<00:02:24.540> will<00:02:24.690> be<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.840> switch<00:02:25.170> here<00:02:25.380> on<00:02:25.470> the

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
over this will be a switch here on the

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.250 
over this will be a switch here on the
watch<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.890> course<00:02:26.130> it<00:02:26.970> turns<00:02:27.209> into<00:02:27.450> kind<00:02:28.140> of<00:02:28.170> a

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
watch of course it turns into kind of a

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.350 
watch of course it turns into kind of a
sound<00:02:28.500> effects<00:02:28.830> machine<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:29.610> same<00:02:29.910> type<00:02:30.330> of

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
sound effects machine so same type of

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.120 
sound effects machine so same type of
principle<00:02:30.900> when<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.260> have<00:02:31.500> your<00:02:31.620> hand<00:02:31.799> closer

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
principle when you have your hand closer

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.800 
principle when you have your hand closer
or<00:02:32.400> farther<00:02:32.549> away<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:33.120> don't<00:02:33.420> know<00:02:33.540> if<00:02:33.600> you<00:02:33.690> can

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
or farther away I don't know if you can

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.720 
or farther away I don't know if you can
hear<00:02:34.019> that<00:02:34.140> at<00:02:34.260> all<00:02:34.380> but<00:02:35.190> it's<00:02:35.310> making<00:02:35.489> a

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
hear that at all but it's making a

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.640 
hear that at all but it's making a
different<00:02:36.090> kind<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.569> a<00:02:36.660> sound<00:02:36.930> like<00:02:37.620> a

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
different kind of a sound like a

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.340 
different kind of a sound like a
keyboard<00:02:38.519> sound<00:02:38.940> almost<00:02:39.239> so<00:02:39.660> if<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:39.930> go<00:02:40.049> higher

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
keyboard sound almost so if I go higher

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.780 
keyboard sound almost so if I go higher
and<00:02:40.530> lower<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:41.040> sound<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:41.340> gonna<00:02:41.459> go<00:02:41.610> higher

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
and lower the sound is gonna go higher

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.430 
and lower the sound is gonna go higher
and<00:02:42.030> lower<00:02:42.150> just<00:02:42.660> like<00:02:42.810> if<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:43.019> was<00:02:43.110> taking<00:02:43.350> my

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
and lower just like if I was taking my

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.960 
and lower just like if I was taking my
hand<00:02:43.739> across<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:44.010> keyboard<00:02:44.459> from<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.790> base

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
hand across the keyboard from the base

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.789 
hand across the keyboard from the base
Keys<00:02:45.209> all<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:45.510> down<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.900> high<00:02:46.019> Keys<00:02:46.290> it'll

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
Keys all you down to the high Keys it'll

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.289 
Keys all you down to the high Keys it'll
go<00:02:46.890> up<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.220> down<00:02:47.310> up<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.640> down<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:47.940> as<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.090> move

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
go up and down up and down so as I move

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.940 
go up and down up and down so as I move
up<00:02:48.569> and<00:02:49.019> down<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.290> sound<00:02:49.500> will<00:02:49.620> go<00:02:49.709> up<00:02:49.830> and

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
up and down the sound will go up and

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.289
