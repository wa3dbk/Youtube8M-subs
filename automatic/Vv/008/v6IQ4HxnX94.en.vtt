this one is called Mars and it's
actually<00:00:34.809> quite<00:00:35.110> a<00:00:35.199> unique<00:00:35.470> map<00:00:35.920> because<00:00:36.309> in

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
actually quite a unique map because in

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:38.460 
actually quite a unique map because in
order<00:00:37.239> to<00:00:37.330> complete<00:00:37.690> this<00:00:37.840> you<00:00:37.960> can<00:00:38.080> actually

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
order to complete this you can actually

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.500 
order to complete this you can actually
complete<00:00:38.739> this<00:00:39.010> this<00:00:39.610> map<00:00:39.850> it<00:00:40.030> actually<00:00:40.330> has

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
complete this this map it actually has

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.479 
complete this this map it actually has
an<00:00:40.659> ending<00:00:41.019> you<00:00:41.530> know<00:00:41.650> a<00:00:41.680> lot<00:00:41.890> of<00:00:41.920> the<00:00:42.100> zombies

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
an ending you know a lot of the zombies

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.850 
an ending you know a lot of the zombies
map<00:00:42.940> see<00:00:43.150> original<00:00:43.690> the<00:00:44.080> you<00:00:44.559> know<00:00:44.680> the

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
map see original the you know the

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.350 
map see original the you know the
official<00:00:45.100> ones<00:00:45.430> I<00:00:45.519> guess<00:00:45.640> you<00:00:45.729> could<00:00:45.879> say<00:00:46.030> from

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
official ones I guess you could say from

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.149 
official ones I guess you could say from
treyarch<00:00:46.809> all<00:00:47.260> of<00:00:47.500> them<00:00:47.620> don't<00:00:47.769> have<00:00:47.920> an

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:48.159 
treyarch all of them don't have an

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:49.590 
treyarch all of them don't have an
ending<00:00:48.309> well<00:00:48.640> some<00:00:48.940> people<00:00:49.150> speculate<00:00:49.570> that

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
ending well some people speculate that

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.509 
ending well some people speculate that
there<00:00:49.809> isn't<00:00:50.170> ending<00:00:50.350> but<00:00:50.949> that<00:00:51.100> people<00:00:51.339> don't

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
there isn't ending but that people don't

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.219 
there isn't ending but that people don't
know<00:00:51.670> what<00:00:51.790> the<00:00:51.909> ending<00:00:52.239> is<00:00:52.420> and<00:00:52.750> that<00:00:53.080> they

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:53.229 
know what the ending is and that they

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:54.479 
know what the ending is and that they
don't<00:00:53.379> know<00:00:53.470> how<00:00:53.589> to<00:00:53.650> do<00:00:53.860> it<00:00:54.010> you<00:00:54.159> know<00:00:54.280> there's

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
don't know how to do it you know there's

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.399 
don't know how to do it you know there's
tweets4<00:00:54.970> from<00:00:55.150> Jimmy<00:00:55.510> zalenski<00:00:55.809> you<00:00:56.290> know

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
tweets4 from Jimmy zalenski you know

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:58.859 
tweets4 from Jimmy zalenski you know
saying<00:00:56.650> that<00:00:56.890> that<00:00:57.729> dying<00:00:58.089> is<00:00:58.360> just<00:00:58.629> one<00:00:58.839> way

00:00:58.859 --> 00:00:58.869 
saying that that dying is just one way

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:01.500 
saying that that dying is just one way
of<00:00:59.379> completing<00:00:59.979> zombies<00:01:00.699> are<00:01:00.850> finishing<00:01:01.299> the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
of completing zombies are finishing the

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.119 
of completing zombies are finishing the
story<00:01:01.809> so<00:01:02.019> obviously<00:01:02.379> there<00:01:02.619> is<00:01:02.710> some<00:01:02.920> kind<00:01:03.040> of

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
story so obviously there is some kind of

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.670 
story so obviously there is some kind of
ending<00:01:03.549> and<00:01:03.760> we'll<00:01:04.600> eventually<00:01:04.839> see<00:01:05.080> it<00:01:05.379> you

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
ending and we'll eventually see it you

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.080 
ending and we'll eventually see it you
know<00:01:05.710> and<00:01:05.979> then<00:01:06.159> so<00:01:06.670> one<00:01:06.850> of<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:07.030> things

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
know and then so one of the things

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.030 
know and then so one of the things
that's<00:01:07.390> unique<00:01:07.510> about<00:01:07.810> these<00:01:08.049> custom<00:01:08.619> maps<00:01:08.860> is

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
that's unique about these custom maps is

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.039 
that's unique about these custom maps is
the<00:01:09.189> fact<00:01:09.460> that<00:01:09.549> you<00:01:09.729> can<00:01:09.939> actually<00:01:10.119> have<00:01:10.900> an

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
the fact that you can actually have an

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.740 
the fact that you can actually have an
ending<00:01:11.290> and<00:01:11.439> in<00:01:11.619> this<00:01:11.740> one<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:13.450> story

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
ending and in this one the story

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.690 
ending and in this one the story
basically<00:01:14.020> is<00:01:14.500> I'm<00:01:14.830> not<00:01:14.980> gonna<00:01:15.100> ruin<00:01:15.490> the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
the whole point of this one there's an

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.110 
the whole point of this one there's an
objective<00:01:24.130> thing<00:01:24.370> that<00:01:24.520> you<00:01:24.610> have<00:01:24.640> to<00:01:24.820> do<00:01:25.000> is

an objective you have to complete and

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.260 
an objective you have to complete and
it's<00:01:26.950> basically<00:01:27.100> after<00:01:27.400> is<00:01:27.550> little<00:01:27.940> fuel

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
it's basically after is little fuel

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.150 
it's basically after is little fuel
canisters<00:01:28.870> around<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.470> map<00:01:29.680> that<00:01:29.830> you<00:01:29.980> got<00:01:30.130> to

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
canisters around the map that you got to

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.130 
canisters around the map that you got to

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.870 
ship and then once your ship has enough
fuel<00:01:34.120> to<00:01:34.240> escape<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.740> mapper<00:01:36.370> though<00:01:36.610> the

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
fuel to escape the the mapper though the

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.670 
fuel to escape the the mapper though the
planet<00:01:37.360> technically<00:01:37.750> since<00:01:37.930> it's<00:01:38.170> on<00:01:38.350> Mars

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
planet technically since it's on Mars

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.190 
planet technically since it's on Mars
and<00:01:38.980> then<00:01:39.490> you're<00:01:39.640> able<00:01:39.909> to<00:01:40.060> basically<00:01:40.480> leave

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
and then you're able to basically leave

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.840 
and then you're able to basically leave
the<00:01:41.350> game<00:01:41.530> and<00:01:41.800> it's<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:42.070> ending<00:01:42.400> of<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.820> game

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
the game and it's the ending of the game

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.149 
the game and it's the ending of the game
you<00:01:43.180> survive<00:01:43.540> whatever<00:01:43.780> so<00:01:44.770> that's<00:01:44.980> basically

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
you survive whatever so that's basically

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.460 
you survive whatever so that's basically
it<00:01:45.460> is<00:01:45.700> something<00:01:46.300> that's<00:01:46.480> kind<00:01:46.840> of<00:01:46.900> unique<00:01:47.080> to

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
it is something that's kind of unique to

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.990 
it is something that's kind of unique to
some<00:01:47.620> of<00:01:47.740> these<00:01:47.830> zombie<00:01:48.220> maps<00:01:48.400> the<00:01:48.580> custom

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
some of these zombie maps the custom

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.670 
some of these zombie maps the custom
ones<00:01:49.180> it's<00:01:49.630> it's<00:01:49.960> not<00:01:50.140> in<00:01:50.290> every<00:01:50.440> single

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
ones it's it's not in every single

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.950 
ones it's it's not in every single
custom<00:01:51.190> map<00:01:51.370> obviously<00:01:51.909> some<00:01:52.659> of<00:01:52.750> them<00:01:52.840> don't

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
custom map obviously some of them don't

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.600 
custom map obviously some of them don't
have<00:01:53.200> them<00:01:53.350> some<00:01:53.560> of<00:01:53.680> them<00:01:53.770> do<00:01:53.979> and<00:01:54.010> those<00:01:54.430> that

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
have them some of them do and those that

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.580 
have them some of them do and those that
do<00:01:54.790> have<00:01:55.030> them<00:01:55.240> are<00:01:55.450> honestly<00:01:56.229> I<00:01:56.290> think<00:01:56.409> there

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
do have them are honestly I think there

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.380 
do have them are honestly I think there
are<00:01:56.650> a<00:01:56.680> lot<00:01:56.830> of<00:01:56.860> fun<00:01:57.130> a<00:01:57.159> lot<00:01:57.280> more<00:01:57.580> fun<00:01:57.790> because
