eyeball<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.799> each<00:01:59.070> time<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.640> ran<00:01:59.850> that

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
eyeball it each time and I ran that

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.880 
eyeball it each time and I ran that
through<00:02:00.240> but<00:02:00.630> first<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.960> cut<00:02:01.140> them<00:02:01.320> everything

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
through but first I cut them everything

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.450

ran<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.099> through<00:02:24.810> with<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:26.550> little<00:02:27.550> where<00:02:28.390> is

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
ran it through with the little where is

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:35.820 
ran it through with the little where is
it<00:02:29.459> it's<00:02:30.459> the<00:02:31.739> keyhole<00:02:34.290> magnetic<00:02:35.290> piece<00:02:35.530> I

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
it it's the keyhole magnetic piece I

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.830 
it it's the keyhole magnetic piece I
just<00:02:36.250> dropped<00:02:36.580> actually<00:02:37.269> I<00:02:37.330> just<00:02:37.360> drop<00:02:37.810> that
