00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:17.390
 well I am a graduate of kiel to join the bayern of the degree in languages 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.579
 modern literature 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:23.869
 later says the specialization of reading and writing and mastery in 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.130
 linguistics 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.380
 since that year without resolving that in the school of language science the 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.380
 audience the country 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.160
 from the inside to the university, it seemed important to me to work 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.740
 aspects of language 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.330
 in fact I started literature then I wanted to read also in the most foreigners and 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.040
 is the degree 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.570
 but I definitely do that in the linguistics department and well 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.680
 I got into the art world of literature poetry and I'm 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.100
 I was I think it's very intuitive because it is and my older brothers 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.310
 another eight brothers the fifth 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.420
 they had some relationship with my dad I also commented the university i the 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.780
 you bring them I started to know books to books that are already hunting and I read 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.060
 there 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.020
 there really is some question wrong very intuitive start 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.880
 I read already at school started as I would like to do it 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.100
 the issue of writing and I discovered that school magazine load this 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.200
 kind of things 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.970
 and man is because it was the ideal scenario not to do that kind of thing 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.850
 while the rest of the classic books but García Marquez does not 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.799
 but I remember a lot when I was doing the ldk 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.799
 departmental place a well-centenary house 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.120
 while celebrating crime and punishment that's why it was published that the one I do not 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.189
 I understood very well 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:53.880
 I was very young 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.049
 and then of course the audience came back on that reading and it's one of the 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.150
 authors two tries that we have is one of the works that has most called me the 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.700
 attention of both shipments 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.210
 in my world 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.210
 literary of both 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.619
 of bachelor in a thing they call at that time natural science indeed 

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:15.979
 I was the best of that year 84 promotion 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:18.159
 I always thought to study physics or 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:21.650
 12 statistical chemistry ine one thing is like that Colombian 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:27.249
 and in the end I thought I should study philosophy and letters of the university 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:28.290
 valley there was no 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.920
 despite the pressure of the non-denominational private university then in the end 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.890
 dioko we are with with letters like yamal department here at that time and 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.489
 finally between literature in that way 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.489
 well then I got into languages ​​I ended up doing the two races 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:52.309
 I 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:55.309
 basically it's about the department of linguistics 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:59.399
 but obvious formal active moscol of teaching and research 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:02.809
 usually combined 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:05.939
 an activity that we could call extension or extracurricular 

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:10.049
 tinelli for six years a literature workshop with language students 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.849
 from 2000 to 2006 I have participated in newspapers in book editions of 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.139
 students of colleagues colleagues and was very at the foot of the master of the 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.349
 possibility of encouraging reading and writing among young students 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:36.589
 legally I see myself more in the perspective of participating projects 

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:39.099
 research where you can 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.729
 let's say supporting other processes fundamentally linked to the 

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:45.729
 teacher training I do not think that's an interesting field 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.360
 it seems to me that the university also has 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.059
 that recognize that society needs to have 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:55.439
 more and better teachers and that is an area that I find interesting 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.879
 I dislike working on editorial issues, it seems to me that it is not a 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.979
 very nice field very interesting 

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:05.729
 and who in our midst need to professionalize more than 100 grams that 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:08.729
 ambit 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.680
 university channel presented the previous program
