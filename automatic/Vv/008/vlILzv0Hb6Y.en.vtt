00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
doing and then we'll try and throw a

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.100 
doing and then we'll try and throw a
little<00:00:37.760> spin<00:00:38.000> on<00:00:38.030> that<00:00:40.630> we're<00:00:41.630> trying<00:00:41.780> to

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
little spin on that we're trying to

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.370 
little spin on that we're trying to
replicate<00:00:42.970> almost<00:00:43.970> exactly<00:00:44.540> what<00:00:44.780> happens<00:00:45.170> in

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.380 
replicate almost exactly what happens in

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.530 
replicate almost exactly what happens in
the<00:00:45.500> film<00:00:45.770> so<00:00:46.280> we<00:00:46.309> try<00:00:46.670> and<00:00:46.730> to<00:00:46.940> put<00:00:47.120> lots<00:00:47.420> of

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
the film so we try and to put lots of

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.299 
the film so we try and to put lots of
little<00:00:47.750> things<00:00:47.840> in<00:00:48.230> the<00:00:48.320> background<00:00:48.770> it<00:00:49.100> was<00:00:49.280> a

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
little things in the background it was a

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.520 
little things in the background it was a
spot<00:00:49.700> so<00:00:50.090> I<00:00:50.120> think<00:00:50.510> people<00:00:51.050> should<00:00:51.110> have<00:00:51.200> fun

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
spot so I think people should have fun

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.350 
spot so I think people should have fun
sort<00:00:51.739> of<00:00:51.860> seeing<00:00:52.070> little<00:00:52.760> things<00:00:53.090> just

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
sort of seeing little things just

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.910 
sort of seeing little things just
creeping<00:00:53.719> in<00:00:53.840> there<00:00:54.020> that<00:00:54.200> that<00:00:54.559> maybe<00:00:54.770> they

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
creeping in there that that maybe they

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.590 
creeping in there that that maybe they
wouldn't<00:00:55.129> expect<00:00:55.520> to<00:00:55.700> see

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
wouldn't expect to see

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.279 
wouldn't expect to see
I<00:00:58.460> think<00:00:59.460> overall<00:00:59.910> we've<00:01:00.149> got<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.510> much<00:01:00.780> funnier

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
I think overall we've got a much funnier

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.740 
I think overall we've got a much funnier
game<00:01:01.530> which<00:01:01.890> are<00:01:02.129> still<00:01:02.339> authentic<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.239> true

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
game which are still authentic and true

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.899 
game which are still authentic and true
to<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> films<00:01:04.500> they've<00:01:05.159> got<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.610> little

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
to the films they've got that little

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.840 
to the films they've got that little
Lego<00:01:06.450> twist<00:01:06.979> some<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.100> these<00:01:08.190> cutscenes<00:01:08.610> are

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
Lego twist some of these cutscenes are

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.510 
Lego twist some of these cutscenes are
really<00:01:09.360> huge<00:01:09.799> compared<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:11.009> the<00:01:11.130> other<00:01:11.280> games

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
really huge compared to the other games

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.249 
really huge compared to the other games
because<00:01:11.850> we've<00:01:12.000> had<00:01:12.149> to<00:01:12.240> put<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.630> much<00:01:12.750> content

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
because we've had to put so much content

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.230 
because we've had to put so much content
in<00:01:13.470> there<00:01:13.680> with<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.220> bigger<00:01:14.399> characters<00:01:14.970> like

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
in there with the bigger characters like

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.560 
in there with the bigger characters like
the<00:01:15.360> troll<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:16.670> mean<00:01:17.670> we<00:01:17.789> just<00:01:17.940> haven't<00:01:18.330> really

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
the troll I mean we just haven't really

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.029
