00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.470
 welcome everyone to us sent the party 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:11.960
 mitchenko enchanted and he won against 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.960
 strong contender on through bite 2188 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:20.420
 in the royal gambit Sasha he loves 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.670
 King's Gambit and I am glad that this time we 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.550
 us people send parties for exactly 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.920
 debut that we studied is actually 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.830
 Of course it is pleasant to me with pain than 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.710
 when people play some of their schemes but 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.380
 I used to be here without complaints every 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.660
 play what they want about a week ago 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.100
 I played the game very much like Ethan 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.320
 slightly different starting arrangement 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.300
 shapes 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.149
 then i'm poor queen character in this game 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.100
 everything is much more fun and dramatic 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.020
 Well, let's go royal gambit 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.480
 7 immediately forced to say that this 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.699
 inaccuracy of at least business to me 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:06.150
 it turns out it will appear logical up to 6 not 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:09.090
 the elephant is 7 well, but the gift of course did not sit down 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.890
 may be the times of adolf anderson 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.979
 who loved so here it might be 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.310
 and you can seriously now have been 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.340
 illogical you 5 well and you too rejected 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.369
 I don't understand why there is a3 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.320
 maybe 9 this b4 maybe sit 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.259
 first is that the horse on 4 was not 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.490
 sent to lead can be useful move 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.920
 but still long 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.600
 I would go to intrigue before tried on 35 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:40.170
 further envy or add okay a 6515 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.770
 again the controversial move I would not 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.290
 went recoil items e5 may not be 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.200
 very good for white all these words 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.000
 4 clogged well maybe sometimes 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.540
 here is a move pipets opposition 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.340
 requires 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:02:01.340
 but I wouldn't they perricone now 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.340
 63 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:09.979
 64 elephant g4 that black needed 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.900
 urgently play the same elephant 7 2 0 employee 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.100
 for some reason did not dare here in this party 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:19.340
 type 2 0 oh went here at 3 0 and it looks like 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:24.440
 not suicide but close to that well 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.480
 at least blacks themselves twisted themselves and 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.290
 thanks actually rival that 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.910
 he hooked up 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:36.410
 sacrifice instantly without thinking was good 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.900
 comment not like the battle guys 676 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.850
 king e7 black clamped figures 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.770
 stupidly bella looking not even 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:50.330
 warm up good comment to me 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:52.850
 like a4 horses to them as a sentence for 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.550
 we will suddenly give a black queen firs 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.739
 plunged but the truth there is not 2 himself 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.690
 salvation and actually wash the air 4 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.239
 rook a and one foil 2 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.820
 actually the villains are stitched 2 but 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.910
 him the king is trapped with this need something 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.850
 do long choke i see my 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:14.120
 the elephant is very dangerous what it lacks 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:19.730
 support she comes from a horse 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.860
 provocateur tip 52 ! a and beautiful move 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.910
 look really can not be beat and 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.459
 screening 6 more black at a loss 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.650
 two minutes later they realized that the end of the beat 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.260
 you can not otherwise oil number on f6 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:37.420
 I don't think he misunderstood it 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:44.510
 immediately after two minutes I realized that it was not 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:46.610
 I hit I thought about Kay 3 Shah Lion King 2 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.790
 when it is necessary with whom matte design 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.030
 can not save to sense black understands 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.470
 and prepares the king's retreat 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.470
 Well, I would not say that the rescuer 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.540
 blasphemy all such there is a good figure 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.609
 and come in handy anyway 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.609
 any thing that could have been saved 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:11.209
 it seems that no longer save up colorful 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.019
 black position is replayed and and everything is very 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:20.840
 correctly completed 5 brilliant move and 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:24.860
 sacrifice our of the right king is not 7 not 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.350
 it is clear that our eight rook is like 818 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.300
 as if barely general all these figures are not 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.979
 it is clear that with the same 72 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:38.060
 wins than the face defeat itself 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:41.389
 saying but there will still be some details and 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.910
 so I hang two figures in front of my nose 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:47.060
 The most important thing is that the scoreboard 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.550
 less than a minute and a scientist more than five in 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.979
 such a position think about protecting death 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.500
 like my hope is the harmony of all 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:57.229
 figures and deciding so who are not even up 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:01.130
 I read the end but the choice was no longer so 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:08.150
 I thought I had 15 20 seconds left 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:12.110
 boom step and again and again the horse provokes 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:15.949
 well, in principle, it was probably possible 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:19.490
 drink then slumber g7 and no no there by 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:22.720
 bats defeat kanesh yes on the 2nd floor 8 to 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:27.349
 Sasha Firs will register 6 mat is inevitable 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:29.860
 scrapping builder 6 get on 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:33.500
 of course at meal time 7 and 2 king in 2 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:38.199
 horse handsome yes terribly Michelle and kill 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:41.430
 it can not be so amazing water a8 a4 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:43.530
 but apparently trying to distract the villain 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.960
 Do not rush in front of here stupidly pulls time 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.950
 We attack with Dusey offend close 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.200
 starting 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.920
 I do not even understand what resource 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.810
 before me opens root drinks t5 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:57.900
 there Sasha even painted a picture of what 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:01.020
 the queen threatens here as well as such 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.790
 the idea here is I have three minutes and 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.040
 seconds the day was banal matt throughout 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:13.620
 but black year we became time to find 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:16.800
 cheaper maneuver as much as a budget vizazh March 3 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:20.310
 I don't breathe a sigh of relief 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:25.200
 the face and make us of the arrival but 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:30.330
 turned black in vain did not give shah shah 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:34.140
 Kroyfa Shah Shah Shah Step and here is my time 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:37.440
 elapsed end black wrote yugid 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:42.750
 no, I will not be happy chess good 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:47.570
 and solving tactical problems in them all 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:52.290
 my tribute and my whole game is my union 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:54.540
 spanking and pawn from 2 to wins 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:58.200
 rival in time 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:02.880
 unexpected 6 steps at the end in my and 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:04.470
 Sasha does not have time to checkmate I do not know 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:09.150
 what is this tragedy 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:12.630
 or vice versa comedy or vice versa 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:15.960
 drama drama who won i think 

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:20.310
 it was Sasha who won because he created 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:22.080
 for yourself one more may be big 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:25.980
 maybe small let him for 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:30.080
 I appreciate myself but a masterpiece on it all thanks 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.080
 Sasha, thanks to those who watch ours
