not<00:01:34.729> that<00:01:34.909> I<00:01:34.940> can<00:01:35.210> see<00:01:35.450> how<00:01:35.600> this<00:01:35.810> is<00:01:35.990> an

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
not that I can see how this is an

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.730 
not that I can see how this is an
improvement<00:01:36.470> on<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:36.920> regular<00:01:37.729> wooden<00:01:37.940> pencil

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
improvement on the regular wooden pencil

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.070 
improvement on the regular wooden pencil
but<00:01:39.740> it<00:01:39.770> clicks<00:01:40.220> and<00:01:42.400> I<00:01:43.400> like<00:01:43.580> that<00:01:43.759> click<00:01:44.020> so<00:01:45.020> I

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
but it clicks and I like that click so I

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.240 
but it clicks and I like that click so I
thought<00:01:45.259> oh<00:01:45.409> maybe<00:01:45.619> I'll<00:01:45.830> buy<00:01:46.040> something

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
thought oh maybe I'll buy something

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.649 
thought oh maybe I'll buy something
around<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:46.640> same<00:01:46.790> price<00:01:46.940> point<00:01:47.030> as<00:01:47.450> this

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
around the same price point as this

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.190 
around the same price point as this

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
Staedtler 9 to 5 35 20 so I got this

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.060 
Staedtler 9 to 5 35 20 so I got this
fabric<00:01:51.649> Estelle<00:01:52.300> TK<00:01:53.300> 4600<00:01:54.080> it<00:01:54.710> was<00:01:54.920> slightly

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
fabric Estelle TK 4600 it was slightly

fabric Estelle TK 4600 it was slightly
cheaper<00:01:55.430> also<00:01:56.149> uses<00:01:56.600> 2<00:01:56.810> millimeter<00:01:57.229> LED<00:01:57.410> but

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
cheaper also uses 2 millimeter LED but

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.730 
cheaper also uses 2 millimeter LED but
it's<00:01:58.220> not<00:01:58.520> ribbed<00:01:58.789> against<00:01:59.390> created<00:01:59.899> whenever

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
it's not ribbed against created whenever

the<00:02:18.050> clicking<00:02:18.230> action<00:02:18.590> is<00:02:18.800> obviously<00:02:19.130> not

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
the clicking action is obviously not

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.680 
the clicking action is obviously not
amazing<00:02:20.090> I've<00:02:20.840> no<00:02:21.019> idea<00:02:21.050> why<00:02:21.290> I<00:02:21.320> bought<00:02:21.500> this

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
amazing I've no idea why I bought this

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.130 
amazing I've no idea why I bought this
actually<00:02:23.690> I<00:02:23.720> do

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
actually I do

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
because his this thing doesn't come with

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.220 
because his this thing doesn't come with
its<00:02:29.090> own<00:02:29.150> sharpener<00:02:29.660> because<00:02:29.870> you'll<00:02:30.200> be

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
its own sharpener because you'll be

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.229 
its own sharpener because you'll be
thinking<00:02:30.410> it's<00:02:30.709> a<00:02:30.769> 2<00:02:30.920> millimeter<00:02:31.100> then<00:02:32.090> how

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
thinking it's a 2 millimeter then how

this one my one will have to do is take
out<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.320> cap<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:43.430> then<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.000> back<00:02:44.209> ought<00:02:44.480> to

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
out the cap and then the back ought to

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.130 
out the cap and then the back ought to
do<00:02:44.720> just<00:02:46.180> shop<00:02:47.180> was<00:02:47.329> already<00:02:47.540> inbuilt<00:02:47.720> to<00:02:48.049> the

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
do just shop was already inbuilt to the

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.089 
do just shop was already inbuilt to the
back<00:02:48.320> of<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:49.000> cap

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
back of the cap

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.059 
back of the cap
you<00:02:51.519> can<00:02:51.670> see<00:02:52.499> it<00:02:53.499> has<00:02:53.680> been<00:02:53.890> sharpened<00:02:54.280> I

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
you can see it has been sharpened I

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.229 
you can see it has been sharpened I
suppose<00:02:57.069> in<00:02:57.249> the<00:02:57.310> long<00:02:57.489> run<00:02:57.670> it's<00:02:58.060> just

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
suppose in the long run it's just

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.640 
suppose in the long run it's just
technically<00:02:58.629> cheaper<00:02:59.139> than<00:02:59.290> getting<00:02:59.469> a

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
technically cheaper than getting a

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.819 
technically cheaper than getting a
pencil<00:03:00.040> I'm<00:03:00.340> more<00:03:00.639> efficient<00:03:01.650> though<00:03:02.650> not

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
pencil I'm more efficient though not

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:07.190 
pencil I'm more efficient though not
really<00:03:03.159> it's<00:03:03.819> just<00:03:03.909> this<00:03:04.870> is<00:03:05.049> just<00:03:05.079> a<00:03:05.560> way<00:03:05.769> of

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
really it's just this is just a way of

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.039 
really it's just this is just a way of
an<00:03:08.200> expensive<00:03:08.829> way<00:03:08.980> of<00:03:09.010> drawing<00:03:09.840> not<00:03:10.840> I've

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
an expensive way of drawing not I've

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.349 
an expensive way of drawing not I've
drawn<00:03:11.260> much<00:03:11.409> with<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:11.709> in<00:03:11.799> the<00:03:11.859> first<00:03:12.040> place

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
drawn much with it in the first place

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.399 
drawn much with it in the first place
yeah<00:03:13.359> why<00:03:13.510> we<00:03:13.629> reviewing<00:03:13.930> if<00:03:14.079> you<00:03:14.139> think<00:03:14.349> these

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:14.409 
yeah why we reviewing if you think these

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:16.140 
yeah why we reviewing if you think these
are<00:03:14.530> useless<00:03:14.799> but<00:03:15.400> I<00:03:15.549> can<00:03:15.730> say<00:03:15.879> that<00:03:16.060> the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
are useless but I can say that the

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.569 
are useless but I can say that the
clicking<00:03:16.510> action<00:03:16.750> on<00:03:16.840> this<00:03:16.959> is<00:03:17.079> amazing<00:03:17.579> this

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
clicking action on this is amazing this

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.339 
clicking action on this is amazing this
is<00:03:18.639> I'm<00:03:18.790> going<00:03:18.939> to<00:03:19.000> focus<00:03:19.120> on<00:03:19.359> the<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.510> picnic

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
video that compared this this is a weak

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.009 
video that compared this this is a weak

is this is a solid hulking piece of

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.439 
is this is a solid hulking piece of
machine<00:03:32.260> that<00:03:32.469> will<00:03:32.620> I<00:03:32.859> don't<00:03:33.699> know<00:03:33.790> you<00:03:34.209> spend

machine that will I don't know you spend
the<00:03:34.510> entire<00:03:34.569> day<00:03:34.750> clicking<00:03:35.199> and<00:03:35.319> not<00:03:35.469> actually

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
the entire day clicking and not actually

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.280 
the entire day clicking and not actually
drawing<00:03:36.099> anything<00:03:37.139> let's<00:03:38.139> draw<00:03:38.319> something

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
drawing anything let's draw something

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.539 
drawing anything let's draw something
why<00:03:41.290> is<00:03:41.349> this<00:03:41.469> little<00:03:41.859> voice<00:03:42.040> behind<00:03:42.430> me

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
why is this little voice behind me

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:43.830 
why is this little voice behind me
exactly<00:03:43.060> draw<00:03:43.269> something

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
exactly draw something

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.679 
exactly draw something
I<00:03:44.010> suppose<00:03:45.010> one<00:03:45.159> benefit<00:03:45.699> of<00:03:45.849> having<00:03:46.120> a<00:03:46.299> pencil

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:46.689 
I suppose one benefit of having a pencil

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:48.959 
I suppose one benefit of having a pencil
is<00:03:46.810> that<00:03:47.139> you<00:03:47.620> can<00:03:47.769> make<00:03:47.919> mistakes<00:03:48.340> when<00:03:48.849> in

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:48.969 
is that you can make mistakes when in

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:52.559 
is that you can make mistakes when in
fact<00:03:49.120> these<00:03:49.389> expensive<00:03:49.959> writing<00:03:50.290> tools<00:03:51.569> have

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
fact these expensive writing tools have

fact these expensive writing tools have
no<00:03:52.780> rubber<00:03:52.989> this<00:03:53.889> cheap<00:03:54.189> thing<00:03:54.840> happens

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
no rubber this cheap thing happens

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.599 
no rubber this cheap thing happens
rubber

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
rubber

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:02.429

I<00:04:03.030> got<00:04:04.030> rubber<00:04:04.269> bands<00:04:04.540> because<00:04:05.530> it<00:04:05.799> would<00:04:05.919> be

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:06.009 
I got rubber bands because it would be

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:10.259 
I got rubber bands because it would be
boring<00:04:06.579> if<00:04:06.669> I<00:04:06.849> just<00:04:07.229> don't<00:04:08.229> know<00:04:08.349> how<00:04:08.500> I<00:04:09.269> boring

boring if I just don't know how I boring
if<00:04:10.359> I<00:04:10.449> just<00:04:11.909> drew<00:04:12.909> something<00:04:13.209> with<00:04:13.329> them

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
if I just drew something with them

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.360 
if I just drew something with them
why<00:04:14.500> do<00:04:14.560> that

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.890 

okay<00:04:19.230> well<00:04:20.230> will<00:04:20.890> this<00:04:20.980> even<00:04:21.100> work

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
okay well will this even work

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:28.710 
okay well will this even work
