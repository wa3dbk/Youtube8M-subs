00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.260
 today is the first day of this year's fireworks sale how is going 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.410
 it so far 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.509
 the good still nice because of this 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:11.829
 the fact that we are satisfied with the first day so far 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:13.909
 what time did it still open the tent 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:15.010
 at 8 o'clock 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.630
 They searched to be happy that it was open 8 pm 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.950
 and for this purpose has man with legs outside or does it run so smoothly 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:21.560
 by 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.589
 sometimes the waste is starting up 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:27.579
 then why do you have last night to take a quiet breath it usually 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.800
 well and that by 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.560
 and the sales you notice that that already starts actively right now comes that 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.370
 out on the last day 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.530
 yes it is especially the small sp 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.710
 who already today aprons b the arrows gomes a candle that continues to go for 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.220
 the youth temporarily 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.370
 and one reason for people to actually come on that last day is because 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.660
 everyone still has to work for example 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.110
 you let people start the fireworks not before we have a house 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.110
 especially the larger pots 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.160
 and so so that usually come last days before it 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.110
 vs is going to start along 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.449
 and the last day late you are then open Wednesday said to six o'clock 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:05.990
 opened 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.649
 are now too far and the parquet they have ordered or are always there 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:12.869
 people who are six at the last minute well let me get some how 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.010
 have you adjusted your purchases accordingly? 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.049
 but still done a lot of existing ones in advance 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.600
 that starts at the beginning of this attention 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.080
 and those people can now just pick it up and the other 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.120
 they usually occur in the week I am dmt more 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.430
 He is also that having ordered formation is simply extra 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.010
 is it a bit of an estimate with previous years how that indeed sold one 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.140
 is becoming 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.490
 we buy and open 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.280
 what we know from last year 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.760
 he had the orders that were received 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.950
 there are things that are very popular this year compared to others 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.700
 years 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.569
 once a year a terrace at our new our new Belgian lines 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.950
 scrape a new one 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.910
 what is so special about this new Belgian line 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.819
 yes because the building you side score 5 of the gram and then 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.900
 is the herbarium there 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.230
 and people still go for the decorative fireworks or do you also see that 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.570
 agents stoppers are still very popular 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.470
 years with the older ones, but the decorative fireworks are a bit different with the youth 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.909
 more and more 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.649
 walk on the street with a tip and stuff 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:18.049
 and then you see now of a lot of activity I see that are very behind the counter 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:19.519
 quite a few people 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.260
 the court found you are roughly concerned about this in these days all around 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.159
 to get 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.050
 he said with about 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.520
 10 11 people constantly work to get it all done 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:35.479
 when he contrasts himself on the 31st 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:38.479
 what am I going to stand by myself, have a look now not to say 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.219
 happy new year seldom 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:46.319
 I see that securitas has already scored 7 what did you cook well I have for the 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.919
 van heuven the kids run late come out with a quad i have the 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.919
 fireworks storage self auction can stand for myself 

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:55.189
 TNT should have a nice time to buy 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:56.190
 ciolek 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.489
 jealousy work 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.489
 so further the gap becomes between noon 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:03.189
 what all people are 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.009
 both ornamental fireworks clubs did not do so is me 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:09.249
 patrick van aanholt chelsea because of course I see the from a corner of the eye 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:12.529
 price is ideal because you give it a delay to fireworks 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:14.999
 yes i think i'm already trying myself 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:19.119
 that ball rolled euro come true because I think it is already a little vain to have it that way 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:20.819
 we hit the sky 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.799
 I can't do anything in the summer either 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.269
 the cogem would also be open again the young dogs always 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.309

 this is her step brother and that is the friend of 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.860
 and and you celebrate together as a new staff to assume he is not standing 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.929
 sold 

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:52.719
 of course but yes that can pop that can go in the air after can be very nice 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:55.059
 see where the state is the time of everything 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:56.099
 we have 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.609
 view we have 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.919
 the reports from 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.039

 it remains fun well I have a game 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.729
 and then these things 

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:13.569
 that experience 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:14.879
 afterwards 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.499
 those are the things that become game's very much 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:20.779
 we have also had it at home earlier 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.139

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.270
