for<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.270> warp<00:00:51.510> which<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.840> what's<00:00:52.050> held<00:00:52.230> taunt

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
for the warp which is what's held taunt

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.310 
for the warp which is what's held taunt
will<00:00:52.829> hold<00:00:53.039> up<00:00:53.190> over<00:00:53.399> time<00:00:54.050> but<00:00:55.050> here's<00:00:55.260> a

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
will hold up over time but here's a

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.380 
will hold up over time but here's a
great<00:00:55.559> example<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:56.129> can<00:00:56.399> use<00:00:56.430> bulk<00:00:56.850> ease<00:00:57.090> for

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
great example you can use bulk ease for

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.020 
great example you can use bulk ease for
pillows<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.559> can<00:00:58.739> use<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> very<00:00:59.219> fine<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.940> a

pillows you can use a very fine and a
bulky<00:01:00.390> yarn<00:01:00.539> for<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> bath<00:01:02.370> sheet<00:01:02.699> for

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
bulky yarn for this is a bath sheet for

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.200 
bulky yarn for this is a bath sheet for
your<00:01:03.229> bath<00:01:04.229> iron<00:01:04.470> would<00:01:04.949> be<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.280> warp<00:01:05.549> fine

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
your bath iron would be the warp fine

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.580 
your bath iron would be the warp fine
yarn<00:01:06.450> would<00:01:06.510> be<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> warp<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.080> when<00:01:07.170> hold<00:01:07.409> up

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
yarn would be the warp and when hold up

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.770 
yarn would be the warp and when hold up
mm-hmm<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.520> can<00:01:08.670> also<00:01:08.850> meet<00:01:09.150> with<00:01:09.210> unusual

today on a very simple loom that's easy
to<00:01:44.579> use<00:01:44.780> I've<00:01:45.780> selected<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.470> fingering<00:01:46.860> weight

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
to use I've selected a fingering weight

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.690 
to use I've selected a fingering weight
wool<00:01:48.329> silk<00:01:48.600> blend<00:01:48.960> that's<00:01:49.439> hand<00:01:49.710> painted<00:01:50.130> the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.980 
wool silk blend that's hand painted the
silk<00:01:50.970> gives<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.329> little<00:01:51.540> bit<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.750> extra

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
silk gives it a little bit of extra

silk gives it a little bit of extra
strength<00:01:52.409> how<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.250> tell<00:01:53.520> if<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.850> warp<00:01:54.119> if<00:01:54.750> a

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
strength how you can tell if a warp if a

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.929 
strength how you can tell if a warp if a
yarn<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.680> gonna<00:01:55.829> be<00:01:55.950> good<00:01:56.100> for<00:01:56.280> warp<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.700> just

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
yarn is gonna be good for warp is just

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.789 
yarn is gonna be good for warp is just
give<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.240> little<00:01:57.360> strength<00:01:58.110> test<00:01:58.409> if<00:01:58.680> it

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
give it a little strength test if it

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.440 
give it a little strength test if it
doesn't<00:01:59.100> pull<00:01:59.250> apart<00:01:59.549> or<00:01:59.640> shred<00:01:59.939> you're

the edges and then we're going to beat

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.090

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
what's called the fill of the cloth then

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.400 
what's called the fill of the cloth then
when<00:03:13.770> we<00:03:13.890> lift<00:03:14.130> it<00:03:14.250> up<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:15.630> yarns<00:03:15.959> go<00:03:16.080> over

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
when we lift it up the yarns go over

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.170 
when we lift it up the yarns go over

again<00:03:24.739> pull<00:03:25.739> this<00:03:25.890> in<00:03:26.900> and<00:03:28.400> beat<00:03:29.400> it<00:03:29.519> in<00:03:29.610> place

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
again pull this in and beat it in place

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.900 
again pull this in and beat it in place
now<00:03:30.209> how<00:03:30.930> firmly<00:03:31.410> or<00:03:31.800> loosely<00:03:32.340> you<00:03:32.489> beat<00:03:32.700> the

now how firmly or loosely you beat the

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.210 
now how firmly or loosely you beat the
yarns<00:03:33.360> determines<00:03:33.989> a<00:03:34.140> lot<00:03:34.170> of<00:03:34.590> how<00:03:34.769> your<00:03:34.980> cloth

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
just pushing it in pulling it up let's

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.040 
just pushing it in pulling it up let's
see<00:03:44.850> that<00:03:45.030> one<00:03:45.180> more<00:03:45.360> time<00:03:47.510> as<00:03:48.510> you<00:03:48.600> can<00:03:48.660> see<00:03:48.900> if

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
see that one more time as you can see if

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.840 
see that one more time as you can see if
I<00:03:49.170> pulled<00:03:49.440> this<00:03:49.620> yarn<00:03:49.950> and<00:03:50.250> didn't<00:03:50.730> leave

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
I pulled this yarn and didn't leave

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.000 
I pulled this yarn and didn't leave
enough<00:03:51.180> space<00:03:51.209> I<00:03:51.870> would<00:03:52.200> get<00:03:52.320> a<00:03:52.350> pulling<00:03:52.769> in<00:03:52.890> at

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
enough space I would get a pulling in at

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.550 
enough space I would get a pulling in at
the<00:03:53.100> selvage<00:03:53.519> and<00:03:54.510> if<00:03:54.660> I<00:03:54.780> beat<00:03:55.200> it<00:03:55.380> too<00:03:55.590> hard

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
the selvage and if I beat it too hard

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.550 
the selvage and if I beat it too hard
then<00:03:58.560> I<00:03:58.590> would<00:03:58.860> get<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:59.010> packed<00:04:00.200> yarn<00:04:01.200> oh<00:04:01.320> I<00:04:01.350> can

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
then I would get a packed yarn oh I can

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.430 
then I would get a packed yarn oh I can
do<00:04:01.680> that<00:04:01.709> if<00:04:01.950> I<00:04:02.040> want<00:04:02.280> that<00:04:02.340> effect<00:04:03.170> but<00:04:04.170> I<00:04:04.230> just

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
do that if I want that effect but I just

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.940 
do that if I want that effect but I just
