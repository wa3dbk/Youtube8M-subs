something with it so that's something

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.560 
something with it so that's something
you<00:00:56.430> guys<00:00:56.550> could<00:00:56.789> do<00:00:56.879> too<00:00:57.059> but<00:00:57.239> I'm<00:00:57.329> here<00:00:57.480> to

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
you guys could do too but I'm here to

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.170 
you guys could do too but I'm here to
talk<00:00:57.719> about<00:00:57.870> what<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.789> know<00:00:59.879> just

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
talk about what it is and you know just

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.510 
talk about what it is and you know just
kind<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.870> what<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:01.859> right<00:01:02.070> here<00:01:02.370> is

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
kind of what is this right here is

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.119 
kind of what is this right here is
called<00:01:02.789> coloboma<00:01:03.510> something<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.320> literally

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
called coloboma something you literally

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.440 
called coloboma something you literally
probably<00:01:05.280> never<00:01:05.580> heard<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.030> your<00:01:06.119> life<00:01:06.180> and

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
probably never heard of in your life and

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.550 
probably never heard of in your life and
you're<00:01:06.570> not<00:01:06.600> going<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.170> because<00:01:07.409> it's

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
you're not going to because it's

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.469 
you're not going to because it's
something<00:01:07.860> that's<00:01:08.040> different<00:01:08.310> but<00:01:08.970> basically

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
something that's different but basically

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.660 
something that's different but basically
the<00:01:09.720> easiest<00:01:09.930> way<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.350> put<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.070> an

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
the easiest way to put it is is an

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.160 
the easiest way to put it is is an
estimate<00:01:12.150> obviously<00:01:12.570> makes<00:01:12.780> sense<00:01:12.990> your

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
estimate obviously makes sense your

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.770 
estimate obviously makes sense your
pupil<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:13.799> that's<00:01:13.950> why<00:01:14.070> people<00:01:14.460> hear<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:15.479> when

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
pupil so that's why people hear it when

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.230 
pupil so that's why people hear it when
it<00:01:15.810> grows<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.200> grows<00:01:16.680> round<00:01:17.090> obviously<00:01:18.090> like

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
it grows it grows round obviously like

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.120 
it grows it grows round obviously like
majority<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.810> eyes<00:01:18.930> like<00:01:19.200> my<00:01:19.350> left<00:01:19.680> eyes<00:01:19.890> my

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
majority the eyes like my left eyes my

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.039 
majority the eyes like my left eyes my
regular<00:01:20.700> normal<00:01:21.000> eye<00:01:21.119> which<00:01:21.659> actually<00:01:21.960> has

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
regular normal eye which actually has

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.109 
regular normal eye which actually has
worse<00:01:22.229> vision<00:01:22.590> which<00:01:22.710> makes<00:01:22.890> no<00:01:22.979> sense<00:01:23.070> but<00:01:23.939> um

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
worse vision which makes no sense but um

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.990 
worse vision which makes no sense but um
yeah<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.869> size<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:25.860> 20/20<00:01:26.430> vision<00:01:26.460> but

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
yeah the size is it's 20/20 vision but

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.359 
yeah the size is it's 20/20 vision but
what<00:01:27.540> happened<00:01:27.930> was<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.650> pupil<00:01:28.950> started

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
what happened was is the pupil started

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.569 
what happened was is the pupil started
to<00:01:29.460> bleed<00:01:29.759> into<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.270> retina<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.520> instead<00:01:32.520> of

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
to bleed into the retina so instead of

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.969 
to bleed into the retina so instead of
forming<00:01:32.880> like<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.150> circle<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.780> just<00:01:34.229> deformed

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
forming like a circle it just deformed

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.859 
forming like a circle it just deformed
and<00:01:35.220> went<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.549> other<00:01:35.579> way<00:01:35.820> I've<00:01:36.420> had<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.750> since

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
and went the other way I've had it since

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.270 
and went the other way I've had it since
birth<00:01:37.140> there<00:01:37.409> was<00:01:37.500> no<00:01:37.619> trauma<00:01:37.979> nothing

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
birth there was no trauma nothing

used to be called the kid with the eye

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.950 
used to be called the kid with the eye

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.020 
trauma maybe for punched or something
you<00:02:23.380> know<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:23.620> could<00:02:23.860> happen<00:02:24.070> very<00:02:24.430> very<00:02:24.550> rare

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
you know it could happen very very rare

you know it could happen very very rare
but<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:26.050> interesting<00:02:26.500> thing<00:02:26.650> with<00:02:26.770> this<00:02:26.950> is

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
but the interesting thing with this is

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.370 
but the interesting thing with this is
is<00:02:27.430> as<00:02:28.360> I<00:02:28.510> was<00:02:28.630> saying<00:02:28.810> with<00:02:28.930> that<00:02:29.080> with

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
is as I was saying with that with

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.350 
is as I was saying with that with
coloboma<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.340> usually<00:02:30.520> see<00:02:30.880> it<00:02:30.940> like<00:02:31.060> a<00:02:31.090> cat

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
coloboma you usually see it like a cat

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.510 
coloboma you usually see it like a cat
eye<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:31.780> will<00:02:31.900> go<00:02:32.020> up<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.320> down<00:02:32.440> but<00:02:33.100> as<00:02:33.280> you

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
eye so will go up and down but as you

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.640 
eye so will go up and down but as you
see<00:02:33.730> with<00:02:33.910> mine<00:02:34.120> mine<00:02:34.570> goes<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.140> bleeds<00:02:35.380> to

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
see with mine mine goes and bleeds to

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.970 
see with mine mine goes and bleeds to
the<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:36.820> left<00:02:37.090> side<00:02:37.300> of<00:02:37.540> my<00:02:37.570> right<00:02:38.020> eye<00:02:38.230> so

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
the the left side of my right eye so

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.890 
the the left side of my right eye so
that's<00:02:39.310> really<00:02:39.610> what<00:02:39.850> it<00:02:39.970> is<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.360> that's<00:02:40.600> how

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
that's really what it is and that's how

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.170 
that's really what it is and that's how
I<00:02:40.930> I<00:02:41.500> don't<00:02:41.650> know<00:02:41.770> I<00:02:41.830> took<00:02:42.220> it<00:02:42.310> upon<00:02:42.580> myself<00:02:42.610> to

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
I I don't know I took it upon myself to

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.210 
I I don't know I took it upon myself to
to<00:02:43.900> not<00:02:44.080> care<00:02:44.410> about<00:02:44.500> it<00:02:44.650> people<00:02:45.040> could<00:02:45.130> be

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
to not care about it people could be

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.640 
to not care about it people could be
very<00:02:45.400> self-conscious<00:02:46.030> about<00:02:46.090> it<00:02:46.300> I<00:02:46.570> mean<00:02:46.990> I've

very self-conscious about it I mean I've
had<00:02:47.830> people<00:02:48.040> who<00:02:48.370> are<00:02:48.880> afraid<00:02:49.210> to<00:02:49.240> look<00:02:49.450> me<00:02:49.600> in

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
had people who are afraid to look me in

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.550 
had people who are afraid to look me in
the<00:02:49.720> eye<00:02:49.780> because<00:02:50.050> they're<00:02:50.350> intimidated

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
the eye because they're intimidated

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.470 
the eye because they're intimidated
they're<00:02:50.890> like<00:02:51.010> what<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.490> hell<00:02:51.670> I<00:02:51.910> just<00:02:52.209> look

they're like what the hell I just look

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.690 
they're like what the hell I just look
at<00:02:52.570> them<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:52.810> go<00:02:52.959> well<00:02:53.320> grow<00:02:54.310> up<00:02:54.490> I<00:02:54.640> don't

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
at them and go well grow up I don't

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.040 
at them and go well grow up I don't
really<00:02:54.940> need<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:55.120> be<00:02:55.240> talking<00:02:55.570> to<00:02:55.630> you<00:02:55.720> anyway

know<00:03:48.519> I'll<00:03:48.700> explain<00:03:48.970> in<00:03:49.060> a<00:03:49.090> second<00:03:49.390> but<00:03:49.480> I<00:03:49.510> see

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
know I'll explain in a second but I see

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.840 
know I'll explain in a second but I see
brighter<00:03:50.260> out<00:03:50.530> of<00:03:50.709> this<00:03:50.890> eye<00:03:51.070> so<00:03:51.640> if<00:03:51.700> we're

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
brighter out of this eye so if we're

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.090 
brighter out of this eye so if we're
thinking<00:03:51.880> an<00:03:52.330> aperture<00:03:52.630> or<00:03:52.959> an<00:03:53.080> f-stop<00:03:53.380> you

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
thinking an aperture or an f-stop you

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.750 
thinking an aperture or an f-stop you
know<00:03:54.190> think<00:03:54.489> of<00:03:54.550> it<00:03:54.640> as<00:03:54.820> my<00:03:55.150> regular<00:03:55.390> I<00:03:55.630> being

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
an f4 but my right eye being an F 1.4 so

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.180 
an f4 but my right eye being an F 1.4 so
I<00:04:01.000> do<00:04:01.150> see<00:04:01.570> brighter<00:04:01.870> out<00:04:02.050> of<00:04:02.200> this<00:04:02.320> eye<00:04:02.470> so<00:04:03.070> if
