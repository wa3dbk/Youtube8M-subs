find<00:03:38.620> some<00:03:38.890> kind<00:03:39.040> of<00:03:39.160> alternative<00:03:40.290> so<00:03:41.290> maybe

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
find some kind of alternative so maybe

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.880 
find some kind of alternative so maybe
instead<00:03:42.820> of<00:03:43.440> instead<00:03:44.440> of<00:03:45.989> maybe<00:03:46.989> I<00:03:47.140> will<00:03:47.650> just

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
instead of instead of maybe I will just

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.490 
instead of instead of maybe I will just
do<00:03:48.130> something<00:03:48.640> that's<00:03:48.880> a<00:03:49.420> lot<00:03:49.630> easier<00:03:50.140> and

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
do something that's a lot easier and

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.280 
do something that's a lot easier and
like<00:03:51.489> I<00:03:51.670> can<00:03:51.940> just<00:03:52.150> do<00:03:52.390> without<00:03:52.660> thinking

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
like I can just do without thinking

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.550 
like I can just do without thinking
about<00:03:54.269> so<00:03:55.269> maybe<00:03:55.480> maybe<00:03:55.930> I'll<00:03:56.079> just<00:03:56.230> do<00:03:56.410> like

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
about so maybe maybe I'll just do like

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.800 
about so maybe maybe I'll just do like
the<00:03:56.829> annoying<00:03:57.160> orange<00:03:57.459> laughs<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:58.299> entire
