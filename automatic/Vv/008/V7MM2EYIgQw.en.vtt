00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
that have skin like me so this is my

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.330 
that have skin like me so this is my
comparison<00:06:03.000> of<00:06:03.210> the<00:06:03.390> Luna<00:06:03.750> versus<00:06:04.470> my<00:06:04.800> Mia<00:06:05.040> -

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
comparison of the Luna versus my Mia -

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.390 
comparison of the Luna versus my Mia -
and<00:06:05.670> everyone's<00:06:06.330> skin<00:06:06.690> is<00:06:06.810> different<00:06:07.020> so<00:06:07.740> what

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
and everyone's skin is different so what

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.910 
and everyone's skin is different so what
works<00:06:08.640> for<00:06:08.970> me<00:06:09.120> it<00:06:09.450> may<00:06:09.750> not<00:06:09.930> work<00:06:09.990> for<00:06:10.200> you<00:06:10.500> but

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:10.920 
works for me it may not work for you but

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.400 
works for me it may not work for you but
if<00:06:11.220> you<00:06:11.400> have<00:06:11.670> the<00:06:11.910> Clarisonic<00:06:12.720> and<00:06:12.930> you<00:06:13.050> find

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
if you have the Clarisonic and you find

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.500 
if you have the Clarisonic and you find
that<00:06:13.680> you<00:06:13.890> still<00:06:14.220> are<00:06:14.280> getting<00:06:14.550> breakouts<00:06:15.090> I

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.510 
that you still are getting breakouts I

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:16.820 
that you still are getting breakouts I
definitely<00:06:16.080> would<00:06:16.200> recommend<00:06:16.230> that<00:06:16.710> you

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
definitely would recommend that you

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.850 
definitely would recommend that you
check<00:06:17.130> out<00:06:17.340> the<00:06:17.520> Luna<00:06:17.880> because<00:06:18.290> my<00:06:19.290> breakouts

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
check out the Luna because my breakouts

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.820 
check out the Luna because my breakouts
have<00:06:20.430> been<00:06:20.760> non-existent<00:06:21.210> like<00:06:22.110> I<00:06:22.230> said<00:06:22.500> I<00:06:22.620> got

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
have been non-existent like I said I got

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.100 
have been non-existent like I said I got
a<00:06:22.890> pimple<00:06:23.370> one<00:06:23.970> time<00:06:24.300> and<00:06:24.510> that's<00:06:24.630> because<00:06:24.960> I

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
a pimple one time and that's because I

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.500 
a pimple one time and that's because I
slept<00:06:25.590> in<00:06:25.710> my<00:06:25.770> makeup<00:06:26.130> had<00:06:26.730> I<00:06:26.760> have<00:06:27.030> not<00:06:27.240> slept

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
slept in my makeup had I have not slept

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.960 
slept in my makeup had I have not slept
on<00:06:27.660> my<00:06:27.810> makeup<00:06:28.140> I<00:06:28.320> think<00:06:28.620> my<00:06:28.740> skin<00:06:29.100> would<00:06:29.340> be

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:29.970 
on my makeup I think my skin would be

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.120 
on my makeup I think my skin would be
smooth<00:06:30.360> like<00:06:30.630> my<00:06:30.780> skin<00:06:31.050> right<00:06:31.200> now<00:06:31.260> is<00:06:31.680> smooth

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
smooth like my skin right now is smooth

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.850 
smooth like my skin right now is smooth
when<00:06:32.730> you<00:06:32.760> look<00:06:33.090> at<00:06:33.330> my<00:06:33.540> makeup<00:06:33.930> tutorials<00:06:34.620> and

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 
when you look at my makeup tutorials and

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:35.450 
when you look at my makeup tutorials and
you<00:06:34.920> see<00:06:35.190> my

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
you see my

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.460 
you see my
get<00:06:35.699> out<00:06:35.789> the<00:06:35.910> beginning<00:06:36.180> of<00:06:36.360> the<00:06:36.479> video<00:06:36.630> I'm

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:37.470 
get out the beginning of the video I'm

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.040 
get out the beginning of the video I'm
not<00:06:37.800> having<00:06:38.280> any<00:06:38.490> more<00:06:38.759> active<00:06:39.270> breakouts<00:06:39.780> and

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
not having any more active breakouts and

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.400 
not having any more active breakouts and
that's<00:06:40.620> allowing<00:06:41.039> my<00:06:41.699> acne<00:06:42.150> starring<00:06:42.630> to<00:06:42.930> fade

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.410 
that's allowing my acne starring to fade

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.499 
that's allowing my acne starring to fade
out<00:06:43.740> because<00:06:44.280> your<00:06:44.550> acne<00:06:44.880> scarring<00:06:45.180> fades

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:45.509 
out because your acne scarring fades

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:47.360 
out because your acne scarring fades
over<00:06:45.840> time<00:06:45.870> but<00:06:46.650> if<00:06:46.740> you're<00:06:46.919> still<00:06:47.190> breaking

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370 
over time but if you're still breaking

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.850 
over time but if you're still breaking
out<00:06:47.789> then<00:06:48.360> the<00:06:48.479> acne<00:06:48.840> scarring<00:06:49.169> is<00:06:49.500> going<00:06:49.740> to

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 
out then the acne scarring is going to

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.600 
out then the acne scarring is going to
get<00:06:50.009> worse

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
get worse

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.309 
get worse
and<00:06:50.699> it's<00:06:50.880> gonna<00:06:51.060> stay<00:06:51.419> because<00:06:51.870> you're<00:06:52.050> still

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 
and it's gonna stay because you're still

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:53.990 
and it's gonna stay because you're still
getting<00:06:52.410> active<00:06:52.889> acne<00:06:53.099> on<00:06:53.340> the<00:06:53.370> skin<00:06:53.669> which<00:06:53.880> is

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000

getting active acne on the skin which is
