00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
my tank here that it takes a long time

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.059 
my tank here that it takes a long time
to<00:02:14.819> actually<00:02:15.150> narrow<00:02:15.750> down<00:02:16.080> your<00:02:16.140> aim<00:02:16.650> to

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
to actually narrow down your aim to

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
actually get an accurate shop so just

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.210 
actually get an accurate shop so just
waiting<00:02:21.209> in<00:02:21.360> one<00:02:21.569> spot<00:02:21.870> here<00:02:22.200> waiting<00:02:22.890> for<00:02:23.130> my

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
waiting in one spot here waiting for my

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.270 
waiting in one spot here waiting for my
cursor<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.299> close<00:02:24.930> down<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.320> bit<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.100> kid

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
cursor to close down a bit and this kid

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.870 
cursor to close down a bit and this kid
is<00:02:26.370> actually<00:02:26.670> behind<00:02:26.790> building<00:02:28.340> ik<00:02:29.340> be<00:02:29.610> there

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
is actually behind building ik be there

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.330 
is actually behind building ik be there
I'll<00:02:30.150> try<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.630> predict<00:02:31.200> where<00:02:31.440> he's<00:02:31.709> going<00:02:32.100> to

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
I'll try and predict where he's going to

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.130 
I'll try and predict where he's going to
be<00:02:33.170> tamed<00:02:34.170> there<00:02:35.510> so<00:02:36.510> he's<00:02:36.660> actually<00:02:36.840> pretty

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
be tamed there so he's actually pretty

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.810 
be tamed there so he's actually pretty
well<00:02:37.350> beyond<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.709> building<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.280> put<00:02:38.640> that

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
well beyond the building to put that

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.840 
well beyond the building to put that
might<00:02:39.239> land<00:02:40.230> on<00:02:40.500> them<00:02:40.709> now<00:02:41.010> landed<00:02:41.760> right

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
might land on them now landed right

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.509 
might land on them now landed right
