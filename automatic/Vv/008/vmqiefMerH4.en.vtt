00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.260
 a few months when I discovered them 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.899
 in the in one of the offices of the bank 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.760
 and because in fact they did not have it 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.769
 does not have an original label and its 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.769
 attribution was not certain cities 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.610
 1 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:25.060
 ghost rider does not often sign these 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:26.890
 instruments at the origin and we think 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.610
 that there is a bit of a mistake of luthiers 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.430
 from the beginning of the 19th century that confused the 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.690
 gadgetry instruments with this 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.570
 particular of carlo bergonzi who was 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.970
 a student of stradivarius and even in 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.220
 some cases of stradivarius and stroke 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.990
 the rare copies that was 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.420
 maybe sign or pretty typical one 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.909
 was like this one modified for their 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.039
 give an aspect of stradivarius 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.460
 so that in fact there are cazas 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.500
 by a pablo casals play on a to 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.080
 early in his career he thought he was playing 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.539
 on a cello of bach gonzi and 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.450
 it's only with the knowledge of 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.250
 experts who developed and the 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.380
 discovering instruments and 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.560
 but by chance not their label 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.120
 remove or that were signed that 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.350
 realized that it was not 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.239
 all of the instruments that belonged to 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.380
 the cremona school 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:24.730
 but many instruments the school of 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:27.519
 venice and that's something very 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.260
 finally running like all 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.470
 instruments finally for a year and a 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.930
 little novice look alike there has been 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.810
 obviously a lot of speculation and 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.989
 of two changes of attributions also 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.190
 to even get more profit you can 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.100
 imagine that this violence she was 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.790
 sold as stradivarius 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.790
 150 years ago 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.069
 m 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.240
 m 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.300
 m 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.300
 m 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.959
 2 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.150
 Oh 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.150
 good 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:30.520
 for the production of sound there are the 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.900
 strings the so-called assembly 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.880
 ie the horse and inside 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.450
 the piece of wood that joins the table and 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:43.980
 the bottom of the soul and there they are the 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.240
 elements that are constantly renewed 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:51.730
 and that they have tremendous importance on 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:53.650
 the sound and suddenly they could have 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.160
 an instrument that sounds squared which 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.900
 sounds worse or worse and his 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.620
 secret would be to try 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:07.780
 to go reveal its sound the authentic 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:11.400
 and and the infos the possibilities are 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.860
 endless acres of settings because 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.680
 all the instruments of the eighteenth in fact 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.109
 when we talk about cello 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.660
 the time of stradivarius 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:26.370
 in fact we talk about the bottom of the splints of 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:30.040
 the table and head but the handle 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:33.130
 as he is constantly in wood there have 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:36.070
 played and he tends to move him 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:40.290
 replace ray had to be replaced for 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:45.220
 history and less movement 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:48.910
 finally 1 mm more or less to these 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:51.010
 points there fal level and goes all 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:55.180
 change so the secrets are a little 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:58.360
 infinite finally in an instrument 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.910
 old for me it's immediately a 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:05.120
 huge forking rotation of the summer 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.870
 wealth it's true that the bass 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:12.460
 the core 2 duo balances are all from 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:18.710
 very round very deep and it's 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:23.350
 rarely did I play I wanted 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.350
 just like that rich sounds 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.680
 or 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.030
 or 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.450
 as I committed are rare is that 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.140
 with the globalization of music 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.600
 classical 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:40.540
 the market is finally growing 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.340
 big one stradivarius will cost 10 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:47.610
 millions of euros and a youngster in 9 10 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:51.100
 thousand euros so the factor for the same 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:53.220
 object to make music but not 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:59.310
 at all the same high level object 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:59.310
 historical and aesthetic or symbolic
