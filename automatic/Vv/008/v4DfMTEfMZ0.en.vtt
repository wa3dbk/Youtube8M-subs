00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
minecraft video for you guys so in this

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.930 
minecraft video for you guys so in this
video<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:12.150> have<00:00:12.480> my<00:00:12.980> minecraft<00:00:13.980> redstone

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
video I have my minecraft redstone

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.960 
video I have my minecraft redstone
tutorial<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.190> this<00:00:17.190> time<00:00:17.400> we're<00:00:17.609> going<00:00:17.760> into

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
tutorial and this time we're going into

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.029 
tutorial and this time we're going into
more<00:00:18.330> creations<00:00:18.869> with<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.529> more<00:00:19.859> advanced

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
more creations with the more advanced

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.370 
more creations with the more advanced
circuits<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:21.060> what<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.449> have<00:00:21.630> here<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.869> a

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
circuits so what I have here is a

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.050 
circuits so what I have here is a
combination<00:00:22.830> lock<00:00:23.130> piston<00:00:23.640> bridge<00:00:23.820> and

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
combination lock piston bridge and

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.970 
combination lock piston bridge and
basically<00:00:24.810> if<00:00:25.199> these<00:00:25.500> are<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.859> right

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
basically if these are in the right

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.040 
basically if these are in the right
position<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.970> can<00:00:27.119> press<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.510> button<00:00:27.750> and

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
position you can press this button and

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.259 
position you can press this button and
the<00:00:28.680> Pistons<00:00:28.830> will<00:00:29.130> extend<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:29.970> can<00:00:30.090> walk

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
the Pistons will extend so you can walk

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.970 
the Pistons will extend so you can walk
across<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.810> normally<00:00:31.529> on<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:31.769> side<00:00:31.890> he

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
across and normally on this side he

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.010 
across and normally on this side he
would<00:00:32.070> have<00:00:32.189> an<00:00:32.430> extend<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.149> retract<00:00:33.420> button

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
would have an extend and retract button

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.290 
would have an extend and retract button
as<00:00:34.140> well<00:00:34.170> but<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.800> decided<00:00:35.250> or<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.640> didn't<00:00:36.180> really

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
as well but I decided or I didn't really

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.700 
as well but I decided or I didn't really
decide<00:00:36.600> i<00:00:36.660> was<00:00:36.840> just<00:00:36.989> kind<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.170> too<00:00:37.260> lazy<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.620> do

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
decide i was just kind of too lazy to do

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.160 
decide i was just kind of too lazy to do
that<00:00:37.890> but<00:00:38.640> um<00:00:38.850> normally<00:00:39.809> that's<00:00:39.930> what<00:00:40.110> you

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
that but um normally that's what you

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.750 
that but um normally that's what you
would<00:00:40.290> have<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:41.489> can<00:00:41.670> make<00:00:41.820> this<00:00:43.340> 539<00:00:44.340> you

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
would have and you can make this 539 you

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.119 
would have and you can make this 539 you
can<00:00:44.910> go<00:00:45.450> up<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:46.050> probably<00:00:46.289> something<00:00:46.980> around

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
can go up to probably something around

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.279 
can go up to probably something around
like<00:00:47.309> 15<00:00:47.730> if<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:47.969> really<00:00:48.120> wanted<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.510> but

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
like 15 if you really wanted to but

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.160 
like 15 if you really wanted to but
that's<00:00:49.739> just<00:00:50.129> not<00:00:50.520> really<00:00:51.390> necessary<00:00:52.079> for

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
that's just not really necessary for

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.229 
that's just not really necessary for
what<00:00:52.649> I'm<00:00:52.770> explaining<00:00:53.460> today<00:00:53.760> my<00:00:53.969> keys<00:00:54.210> are

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
what I'm explaining today my keys are

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.439 
what I'm explaining today my keys are
sticking<00:00:54.719> oh<00:00:55.850> god<00:00:56.850> that's<00:00:57.120> getting<00:00:57.360> annoying

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
sticking oh god that's getting annoying

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.810 
sticking oh god that's getting annoying
with<00:00:57.870> sticky<00:00:58.559> keys<00:00:58.859> but<00:01:00.020> anyways<00:01:01.460> like<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.579> said

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
with sticky keys but anyways like I said

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.219 
with sticky keys but anyways like I said
as<00:01:03.030> long<00:01:03.059> as<00:01:03.359> those<00:01:03.510> are<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.809> right<00:01:03.899> spot

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
as long as those are in the right spot

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.350 
as long as those are in the right spot
of<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.409> work<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:04.920> if<00:01:05.159> i<00:01:05.280> reset<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.820> here<00:01:06.060> in

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
of the work so if i reset this here in

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.980 
of the work so if i reset this here in
those<00:01:06.710> retract<00:01:08.030> this<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.390> wrong<00:01:09.420> spot

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
those retract this is in the wrong spot

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.289 
those retract this is in the wrong spot
and<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.170> press<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.500> extent<00:01:10.830> button<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.340> they

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
and you press the extent button it they

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.570 
and you press the extent button it they
won't<00:01:12.479> work<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.140> basically<00:01:13.890> how<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.340> works

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
won't work so basically how this works

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.410 
won't work so basically how this works
is<00:01:15.890> it<00:01:16.890> has<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.460> thing<00:01:17.700> i'm<00:01:17.909> not<00:01:17.939> sure<00:01:18.299> what

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
is it has this thing i'm not sure what

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.120 
is it has this thing i'm not sure what
this<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.659> called<00:01:18.900> but<00:01:19.259> basically<00:01:19.619> these<00:01:19.860> wires

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
this is called but basically these wires

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.190 
this is called but basically these wires
under<00:01:20.490> cooked<00:01:20.670> up<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.939> this<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.299> as<00:01:21.810> long<00:01:22.020> as

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
under cooked up to this and as long as

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.240 
under cooked up to this and as long as
all<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.470> them<00:01:22.619> are<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.860> correct<00:01:23.009> position

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
all of them are in the correct position

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.020 
all of them are in the correct position
it'll<00:01:23.640> be<00:01:23.790> off<00:01:24.000> or<00:01:25.340> there<00:01:26.340> will<00:01:26.430> be<00:01:26.490> no<00:01:26.700> signal

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
it'll be off or there will be no signal

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.700 
it'll be off or there will be no signal
going<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:27.570> torch<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.409> can<00:01:28.590> turn

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
going to this torch so that it can turn

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.069 
going to this torch so that it can turn
on<00:01:29.030> geez<00:01:30.030> stop<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.960> oh<00:01:31.170> my<00:01:31.860> god<00:01:32.090> ok<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.600> it'll<00:01:33.960> go

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
on geez stop it oh my god ok so it'll go

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.230 
on geez stop it oh my god ok so it'll go
to<00:01:34.140> this<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.369> called<00:01:35.549> an<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.850> gate<00:01:36.000> we

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
to this this is called an and gate we

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.600 
to this this is called an and gate we
went<00:01:36.420> over<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.020> last<00:01:37.860> video<00:01:38.100> i<00:01:38.310> did<00:01:38.369> for

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
went over in the last video i did for

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.160 
went over in the last video i did for
the<00:01:38.670> redstone<00:01:38.970> tutorial<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.479> here<00:01:40.049> we<00:01:40.079> have

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
the redstone tutorial and here we have

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.719 
the redstone tutorial and here we have
an<00:01:40.350> RS<00:01:40.619> nor<00:01:40.740> latch<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> different<00:01:41.700> type

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
an RS nor latch this is a different type

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.969 
an RS nor latch this is a different type
of<00:01:41.880> Arsenal<00:01:42.390> latch<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.659> didn't<00:01:42.960> show<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.829> it

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
of Arsenal latch I didn't show but it

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.639 
of Arsenal latch I didn't show but it
works<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.490> much<00:01:44.549> better<00:01:44.670> for<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.530> what<00:01:46.530> we

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
works so much better for this what we

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.770 
works so much better for this what we
have<00:01:46.770> here<00:01:46.799> but<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.030> other<00:01:48.149> one<00:01:48.329> works<00:01:48.509> better

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
have here but the other one works better

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.210 
have here but the other one works better
for<00:01:48.990> some<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.350> things<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.770> just<00:01:49.799> depends

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
for some of the things it just depends

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.830 
for some of the things it just depends
on<00:01:50.280> what<00:01:50.369> you're<00:01:50.520> doing<00:01:50.820> with<00:01:51.390> what<00:01:51.420> will<00:01:51.689> work

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
on what you're doing with what will work

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.620 
on what you're doing with what will work
better<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.890> there's<00:01:53.670> an<00:01:53.820> RS<00:01:54.060> nor<00:01:54.180> latch<00:01:54.270> here

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
better so there's an RS nor latch here

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.609 
better so there's an RS nor latch here
and<00:01:55.219> when<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.820> press<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.600> extend<00:01:58.110> button<00:01:58.439> if

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
and when you press the extend button if

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.530 
and when you press the extend button if
these<00:01:58.920> are<00:01:59.040> all<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.399> right<00:01:59.520> spot<00:01:59.850> it'll

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
these are all in the right spot it'll

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.480 
these are all in the right spot it'll
the<00:02:00.840> wire<00:02:01.049> comes<00:02:01.320> under<00:02:01.799> here<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.460> will

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
the wire comes under here and it will

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.230 
the wire comes under here and it will
power<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:04.200> torch<00:02:04.530> enabling<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.460> torch<00:02:05.850> and

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
power this torch enabling this torch and

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.630 
power this torch enabling this torch and
it<00:02:07.079> sends<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.500> signal<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.190> RS<00:02:08.580> nor<00:02:08.819> latch

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
it sends the signal to the RS nor latch

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.740 
it sends the signal to the RS nor latch
and<00:02:09.810> what<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:10.960> does<00:02:11.020> is<00:02:11.560> when<00:02:11.860> it<00:02:12.010> turns<00:02:12.220> on

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
and what this does is when it turns on

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.699 
and what this does is when it turns on
my<00:02:13.750> space<00:02:14.620> key<00:02:14.890> is<00:02:15.010> sticking<00:02:15.340> now<00:02:15.490> what<00:02:15.700> is<00:02:15.790> up

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
my space key is sticking now what is up

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.980 
my space key is sticking now what is up
it'll<00:02:17.709> enable<00:02:18.040> this<00:02:18.340> torch<00:02:18.700> or<00:02:19.270> it'll<00:02:19.660> it'll

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
it'll enable this torch or it'll it'll

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.460 
it'll enable this torch or it'll it'll
enable<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.830> RS<00:02:21.640> nor<00:02:21.819> latch<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.990> will<00:02:23.170> send

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
enable the RS nor latch and it will send

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.690 
enable the RS nor latch and it will send
signal<00:02:23.950> down<00:02:24.220> here<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:25.150> those<00:02:25.540> Pistons<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.700> it

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
signal down here to those Pistons and it

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.210 
signal down here to those Pistons and it
also<00:02:27.850> goes<00:02:28.270> down<00:02:28.600> there<00:02:28.930> which<00:02:29.110> goes<00:02:29.320> under<00:02:29.800> to

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
also goes down there which goes under to

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.310 
also goes down there which goes under to
the<00:02:30.340> other<00:02:30.580> side<00:02:30.850> which<00:02:31.630> I'll<00:02:31.810> show<00:02:31.990> you<00:02:32.050> here

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
the other side which I'll show you here

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.990 
the other side which I'll show you here
and<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:34.480> other<00:02:34.660> button<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.680> retract<00:02:36.610> button

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
and the other button the retract button

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.640 
and the other button the retract button
just<00:02:37.480> goes<00:02:37.690> to<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.930> other<00:02:38.050> side<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.410> RS

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
just goes to the other side of the RS

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.460 
just goes to the other side of the RS
nor<00:02:38.800> latch<00:02:38.920> so<00:02:39.520> it<00:02:39.700> kind<00:02:40.660> of<00:02:40.690> resets<00:02:41.080> it<00:02:41.260> so

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
nor latch so it kind of resets it so

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.310 
nor latch so it kind of resets it so
that<00:02:41.620> it's<00:02:41.770> in<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.580> off<00:02:42.700> position<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.930> I'll

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
that it's in the off position so I'll

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.080 
that it's in the off position so I'll
show<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.739> this<00:02:44.860> here<00:02:45.100> if<00:02:45.340> I<00:02:45.580> have<00:02:45.760> this<00:02:45.880> in<00:02:46.000> the

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
show you this here if I have this in the

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.990 
show you this here if I have this in the
wrong<00:02:46.239> spot<00:02:46.570> as<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:47.769> can<00:02:47.860> see<00:02:48.010> it<00:02:48.160> sends

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
wrong spot as you can see it sends

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.110 
wrong spot as you can see it sends
signals<00:02:49.360> to<00:02:49.420> this<00:02:49.630> which<00:02:50.320> turns<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.790> makes<00:02:52.000> it

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
signals to this which turns it makes it

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.449 
signals to this which turns it makes it
turn<00:02:52.239> off<00:02:52.480> so<00:02:53.230> that<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:53.590> doesn't<00:02:53.800> give<00:02:54.100> signal

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
turn off so that it doesn't give signal

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.790 
turn off so that it doesn't give signal
to<00:02:54.610> this<00:02:54.820> ah<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.630> gate<00:02:55.989> which<00:02:56.260> doesn't<00:02:56.680> allow

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
to this ah and gate which doesn't allow

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.370 
to this ah and gate which doesn't allow
if<00:02:57.519> you<00:02:58.000> were<00:02:58.120> to<00:02:58.269> press<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.660> button<00:02:58.959> both<00:02:59.200> of

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
if you were to press the button both of

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.170 
if you were to press the button both of
them<00:02:59.500> wouldn't<00:02:59.709> be<00:02:59.830> off<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.430> this<00:03:00.700> wouldn't

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
them wouldn't be off and this wouldn't

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.870 
them wouldn't be off and this wouldn't
be<00:03:01.330> able<00:03:01.420> to<00:03:01.570> activate<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.380> RS<00:03:02.709> nor<00:03:02.860> latch<00:03:03.010> so

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
be able to activate the RS nor latch so

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.240 
be able to activate the RS nor latch so
that's<00:03:04.330> pretty<00:03:04.690> simple<00:03:04.959> in<00:03:05.320> itself<00:03:05.860> if<00:03:06.160> you

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
that's pretty simple in itself if you

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.770 
that's pretty simple in itself if you
don't<00:03:06.430> really<00:03:06.550> understand<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.330> next<00:03:07.600> thing

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
don't really understand the next thing

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.449 
don't really understand the next thing
I'm<00:03:08.440> going<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:08.680> try<00:03:08.769> to<00:03:08.800> build<00:03:08.980> it<00:03:09.130> really<00:03:09.310> fast

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
I'm going to try to build it really fast

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:10.979 
I'm going to try to build it really fast
here<00:03:09.700> I<00:03:09.940> don't<00:03:10.180> want<00:03:10.300> this<00:03:10.360> to<00:03:10.420> be<00:03:10.570> a<00:03:10.600> too<00:03:10.780> long

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
here I don't want this to be a too long

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.680 
here I don't want this to be a too long
video<00:03:11.290> but<00:03:11.500> this<00:03:12.280> should<00:03:12.640> clear<00:03:13.330> it<00:03:13.450> up<00:03:13.600> a

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
video but this should clear it up a

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.620 
video but this should clear it up a
little<00:03:13.810> bit<00:03:13.989> let<00:03:14.260> me<00:03:14.290> grab<00:03:15.070> an<00:03:15.690> iron<00:03:16.690> door<00:03:18.630> okay

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
little bit let me grab an iron door okay

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.199 
little bit let me grab an iron door okay
so<00:03:19.690> basically<00:03:19.930> what<00:03:20.320> i'm<00:03:20.380> going<00:03:20.470> to<00:03:20.530> do<00:03:20.680> now

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
so basically what i'm going to do now

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.970 
so basically what i'm going to do now
i'll<00:03:22.209> make<00:03:22.360> it<00:03:22.390> out<00:03:22.570> of<00:03:22.690> gold<00:03:22.930> because<00:03:23.920> it

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
i'll make it out of gold because it

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.360 
i'll make it out of gold because it
looks<00:03:24.220> cooler<00:03:25.769> okay<00:03:26.769> so<00:03:26.829> what<00:03:27.100> we're<00:03:27.190> going<00:03:27.280> to

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
looks cooler okay so what we're going to

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.569 
looks cooler okay so what we're going to
do<00:03:27.489> here<00:03:27.730> is<00:03:27.850> a<00:03:28.630> combination<00:03:29.200> door<00:03:29.980> lock<00:03:30.250> and

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
do here is a combination door lock and

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.300 
do here is a combination door lock and
it<00:03:31.239> will<00:03:31.360> kind<00:03:31.480> of<00:03:31.690> sum<00:03:32.500> up<00:03:32.680> basically<00:03:33.100> what

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
it will kind of sum up basically what

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.440 
it will kind of sum up basically what
I'm<00:03:33.400> trying<00:03:33.610> to<00:03:33.670> explain<00:03:33.820> to<00:03:34.090> you<00:03:34.299> and

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
I'm trying to explain to you and

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.810 
I'm trying to explain to you and
hopefully<00:03:34.660> make<00:03:35.049> it<00:03:35.320> seem<00:03:36.130> a<00:03:36.160> little<00:03:36.459> bit<00:03:36.549> easy

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
hopefully make it seem a little bit easy

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.280 
hopefully make it seem a little bit easy
to<00:03:37.120> you<00:03:37.209> guys<00:03:37.299> so<00:03:37.510> you<00:03:37.540> can<00:03:37.690> understand<00:03:38.110> it<00:03:38.230> a

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
to you guys so you can understand it a

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.130 
to you guys so you can understand it a
little<00:03:38.320> better<00:03:38.820> now<00:03:39.820> I<00:03:40.239> don't<00:03:40.570> know<00:03:40.660> why<00:03:40.810> I<00:03:40.840> put

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
little better now I don't know why I put

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.130 
little better now I don't know why I put
buttons<00:03:41.380> I'm<00:03:42.040> complete<00:03:42.940> moron<00:03:43.390> which<00:03:43.989> are

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
buttons I'm complete moron which are

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
and this is going to go to the RS nor

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.290 
and this is going to go to the RS nor
latch<00:04:29.550> which<00:04:30.550> I<00:04:30.760> will<00:04:30.910> make<00:04:31.030> it<00:04:31.060> right<00:04:31.240> here

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300

and basically this Arsenal latch is just
a<00:04:34.990> torch<00:04:35.260> torch<00:04:35.889> and<00:04:36.450> it<00:04:37.450> connects<00:04:37.720> like<00:04:37.900> this

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
a torch torch and it connects like this

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.890 
a torch torch and it connects like this
and<00:04:40.110> let's<00:04:41.110> see<00:04:41.350> you<00:04:41.889> should<00:04:42.690> nope<00:04:43.690> i'm

underground<00:05:48.039> and<00:05:48.520> the<00:05:49.150> door<00:05:49.390> wouldn't<00:05:49.870> have

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
underground and the door wouldn't have

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.500
