are<00:00:00.210> they<00:00:00.359> today<00:00:01.020> I'm<00:00:01.199> going<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.469> show<00:00:01.650> you<00:00:01.740> how

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
are they today I'm going to show you how

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.640 
are they today I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:01.949> make<00:00:02.190> this<00:00:02.700> Great<00:00:03.330> Plains<00:00:03.720> playing<00:00:04.230> flies

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
to make this Great Plains playing flies

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.670 
to make this Great Plains playing flies
and<00:00:05.130> flies<00:00:05.160> forever<00:00:05.940> or<00:00:06.180> almost<00:00:06.690> forever<00:00:06.870> so

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
and flies forever or almost forever so

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.919 
and flies forever or almost forever so
yeah<00:00:08.280> it's<00:00:08.460> quite<00:00:08.639> simple<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:08.970> make<00:00:09.150> so<00:00:09.510> all<00:00:09.719> we

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
yeah it's quite simple to make so all we

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.879 
yeah it's quite simple to make so all we
need<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.170> make<00:00:10.349> it<00:00:10.679> is<00:00:11.040> an<00:00:12.049> a4<00:00:13.049> sheet<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.679> paper

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
need to make it is an a4 sheet of paper

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.060 
need to make it is an a4 sheet of paper
and<00:00:14.250> we'll<00:00:15.120> also<00:00:15.420> cheat<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.049> use<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.560> staple<00:00:16.890> at

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
and we'll also cheat and use a staple at

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.290 
and we'll also cheat and use a staple at
the<00:00:17.220> end<00:00:17.480> so<00:00:18.480> what<00:00:18.600> we<00:00:18.690> want<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.930> do<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:20.300> that

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
the end so what we want to do is that

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.570 
the end so what we want to do is that
edge<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.990> long<00:00:22.109> edge<00:00:22.289> fold<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.830> over<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.430> it

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
edge the long edge fold it over so it

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.720 
edge the long edge fold it over so it
touches<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:25.130> edge<00:00:26.130> along<00:00:26.400> here<00:00:28.519> yep

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
touches the edge along here yep

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.280 
touches the edge along here yep
and<00:00:29.900> open<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.019> up<00:00:32.059> whoops

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
and open it up whoops

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.810 
and open it up whoops
up<00:00:34.290> there<00:00:34.469> we<00:00:34.559> go<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:34.950> will<00:00:35.130> edge<00:00:35.370> there

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
up there we go and that will edge there

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.450 
up there we go and that will edge there
we're<00:00:36.030> going<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.239> fold<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.660> over<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.219> joins

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
we're going to fold it over so it joins

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.590 
we're going to fold it over so it joins
up<00:00:38.730> on<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.510> fold<00:00:40.079> line<00:00:40.170> like<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:41.480> so<00:00:42.480> we're

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
up on this fold line like that so we're

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.299 
up on this fold line like that so we're
just<00:00:42.629> doing<00:00:43.020> at<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.559> stage<00:00:43.770> doing<00:00:44.160> a

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
just doing at this stage doing a

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.190 
just doing at this stage doing a
standard<00:00:44.789> sort<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.059> plane<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:46.020> might

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
standard sort of plane that you might

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.279 
standard sort of plane that you might
have<00:00:46.289> done<00:00:46.850> a<00:00:47.850> thousand<00:00:48.390> times<00:00:48.420> before<00:00:48.690> and

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
have done a thousand times before and

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.170 
have done a thousand times before and
then<00:00:50.100> what<00:00:50.219> we're<00:00:50.340> going<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.489> do<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.820> once<00:00:51.000> it's

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
then what we're going to do is once it's

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.299 
then what we're going to do is once it's
folded<00:00:51.629> over<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.530> side<00:00:52.590> we'll<00:00:53.039> flip<00:00:53.190> it

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
folded over on that side we'll flip it

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.299 
folded over on that side we'll flip it
over<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.699> then<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.660> point<00:00:54.899> will<00:00:55.890> come<00:00:56.129> back

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
over and then that point will come back

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.860 
over and then that point will come back
make<00:00:56.699> sure<00:00:56.879> it's<00:00:57.030> lining<00:00:57.239> up<00:00:57.480> with<00:00:57.690> your

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
make sure it's lining up with your

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.099 
make sure it's lining up with your
middle<00:00:58.199> fold<00:00:58.500> line<00:00:58.739> there<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.899> it's<00:01:00.899> right

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
middle fold line there and it's right

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.290 
middle fold line there and it's right
along<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.559> edge<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.010> other<00:01:02.219> piece<00:01:03.120> of

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
along the edge of that other piece of

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.320 
along the edge of that other piece of
paper<00:01:03.570> there<00:01:03.870> like<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.500> for<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.830> nice

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
paper there like that so for a nice

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.929 
paper there like that so for a nice
straight<00:01:06.330> edge<00:01:06.860> yep<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.100> fold<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.610> like<00:01:08.729> that

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
straight edge yep and fold it like that

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.429 
straight edge yep and fold it like that
and<00:01:09.380> then<00:01:10.380> we'll<00:01:10.560> get<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.920> corner<00:01:12.439> there

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
and then we'll get that corner there

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.890 
and then we'll get that corner there
bring<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.770> down<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.159> touch<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:15.299> point

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
bring it down and touch the that point

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.020 
bring it down and touch the that point
there<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.890> line<00:01:17.130> there<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.610> going<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.909> be

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
there so that line there is going to be

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.300 
there so that line there is going to be
lining<00:01:18.299> up<00:01:18.509> again<00:01:18.869> with<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.799> little<00:01:19.979> fold

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
lining up again with that little fold

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.560 
lining up again with that little fold
line<00:01:23.420> yep

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
line yep

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.249 
line yep
and<00:01:24.659> do<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.080> same<00:01:25.259> thing<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.710> other<00:01:25.740> side

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
and do the same thing on the other side

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.319 
and do the same thing on the other side
yep<00:01:28.579> so<00:01:29.579> now<00:01:31.700> that's<00:01:32.700> pretty<00:01:32.970> straightforward

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
yep so now that's pretty straightforward

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.810 
yep so now that's pretty straightforward
this<00:01:33.780> stage<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:34.229> now<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.470> tricky<00:01:34.890> bit<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.280> or

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
this stage but now the tricky bit is or

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.399 
this stage but now the tricky bit is or
the<00:01:36.060> one<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.420> bit<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.750> makes<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.140> plane

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
the one the bit that makes this plane

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.440 
the one the bit that makes this plane
unique<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.759> we're<00:01:39.000> going<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.240> rather

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
unique is that we're going to rather

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.179 
unique is that we're going to rather
than<00:01:39.600> have<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> parallel<00:01:40.350> line<00:01:40.650> going<00:01:40.950> along

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
than have a parallel line going along

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.590 
than have a parallel line going along
there<00:01:41.369> we're<00:01:41.549> going<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.759> make<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.060> wings<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
there we're going to make the wings the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.920 
there we're going to make the wings the
fold<00:01:42.840> line<00:01:43.049> small<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.100> front<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.930> two

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
fold line small to the front and two

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.450 
fold line small to the front and two
large<00:01:46.259> at<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.009> back<00:01:47.479> so<00:01:48.479> we'll<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:50.340> this

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
large at the back so we'll just and this

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.039 
large at the back so we'll just and this
has<00:01:50.579> got<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.850> be<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.570> base<00:01:51.780> where<00:01:52.020> you

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
has got to be the the base where you

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.620 
has got to be the the base where you
hold<00:01:52.259> on<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.850> we'll<00:01:53.850> fold<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.240> over<00:01:54.360> like

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
hold on to it so we'll fold it over like

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.980 
hold on to it so we'll fold it over like
that<00:01:54.960> yep<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.729> these<00:01:56.909> are<00:01:57.119> these<00:01:57.329> flaps<00:01:57.780> are

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
that yep so these are these flaps are

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.100 
that yep so these are these flaps are
here<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.640> then<00:01:59.869> we'll<00:02:00.869> fold<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:02.930> down<00:02:03.930> like

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
here and then we'll fold it down like

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.399 
here and then we'll fold it down like
that<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.290> it's<00:02:04.619> small<00:02:04.979> at<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.189> front<00:02:05.460> yep

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
that so it's small at the front yep

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.479 
that so it's small at the front yep
small<00:02:07.409> at<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.560> front<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.009> then<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.250> fold

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
small at the front and then the fold

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.609 
small at the front and then the fold
goes<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.030> large<00:02:09.330> section<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.410> back

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
goes to a large section of the back

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.320 
goes to a large section of the back
that's<00:02:10.860> probably<00:02:11.160> only<00:02:11.310> quarter<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.180> an<00:02:12.239> inch

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
that's probably only quarter of an inch

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.230 
that's probably only quarter of an inch
six<00:02:12.720> mils<00:02:12.989> per

six mils per

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.870 
six mils per

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
apps and that there at the packet

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.570 
apps and that there at the packet
probably<00:02:16.240> an<00:02:16.330> inch<00:02:16.480> and<00:02:16.630> a<00:02:16.660> half<00:02:17.340> probably<00:02:18.340> 30

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
probably an inch and a half probably 30

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.640 
probably an inch and a half probably 30
odd<00:02:18.820> mils<00:02:19.090> 35<00:02:19.690> mils<00:02:19.960> something<00:02:20.290> up<00:02:20.410> that<00:02:20.440> at

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
odd mils 35 mils something up that at

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.130 
odd mils 35 mils something up that at
the<00:02:20.710> back<00:02:20.860> 40<00:02:21.190> mils<00:02:21.370> yep<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.360> then<00:02:22.990> we'll

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
the back 40 mils yep and then we'll

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.170 
the back 40 mils yep and then we'll
match<00:02:23.320> that<00:02:23.710> wing<00:02:24.220> whatever<00:02:24.580> we<00:02:24.760> failed<00:02:25.030> it

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
match that wing whatever we failed it

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.760 
match that wing whatever we failed it
there<00:02:25.770> with<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:27.370> other<00:02:27.520> side<00:02:28.560> yep

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
there with the other side yep

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.010 
there with the other side yep
and<00:02:30.460> there<00:02:31.210> we<00:02:31.300> go<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:31.690> we'll<00:02:31.840> just<00:02:32.050> punch<00:02:32.320> a

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
and there we go and we'll just punch a

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.970 
and there we go and we'll just punch a
staple<00:02:35.020> in<00:02:35.050> there<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.380> hold<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:35.710> all<00:02:35.800> together

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
staple in there to hold it all together

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.580 
staple in there to hold it all together
just<00:02:36.370> in<00:02:36.640> that<00:02:36.850> all<00:02:37.810> those<00:02:37.990> pieces<00:02:38.290> come

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
just in that all those pieces come

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.100 
just in that all those pieces come
together<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:40.000> there<00:02:40.390> we<00:02:40.450> go<00:02:40.600> let's<00:02:40.990> go

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
together and there we go let's go

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.440 
together and there we go let's go
outside<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:41.800> we'll<00:02:42.490> give<00:02:42.640> this<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:43.060> test

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
outside and we'll give this a test

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.570 
outside and we'll give this a test
flight
