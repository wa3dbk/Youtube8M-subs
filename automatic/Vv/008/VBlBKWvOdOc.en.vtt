00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:07.460 
is we learned a little bit more maybe

is we learned a little bit more maybe
about<00:00:08.460> Skye's<00:00:08.910> origin<00:00:09.630> so<00:00:10.230> we<00:00:10.740> have<00:00:11.010> Coulson

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
about Skye's origin so we have Coulson

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.700 
about Skye's origin so we have Coulson
thinking<00:00:12.269> that<00:00:12.420> she<00:00:12.599> might<00:00:12.630> be<00:00:12.929> an<00:00:13.049> alien<00:00:13.530> and

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
thinking that she might be an alien and

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.440 
thinking that she might be an alien and
dropping<00:00:14.040> that<00:00:14.190> bomb<00:00:14.400> on<00:00:14.460> her<00:00:14.880> cuz<00:00:15.089> she<00:00:15.120> didn't

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
dropping that bomb on her cuz she didn't

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.040 
dropping that bomb on her cuz she didn't
react<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.800> gh<00:00:17.160> serum<00:00:17.609> we've<00:00:18.480> got<00:00:18.720> the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
react to the the gh serum we've got the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.470 
react to the the gh serum we've got the
possibility<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.340> lot<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.730> other<00:00:20.939> things<00:00:21.330> I

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
possibility of a lot of other things I

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.029 
possibility of a lot of other things I
know<00:00:21.539> we've<00:00:21.810> always<00:00:22.020> been<00:00:22.320> on<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.529> inhuman

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
know we've always been on the inhuman

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.349 
know we've always been on the inhuman
track<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.480> we've<00:00:25.140> learned<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.619> little<00:00:25.680> bit<00:00:25.800> more

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
track so we've learned a little bit more

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.599 
track so we've learned a little bit more

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
so Skye is a hacker yeah there's

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.359 
so Skye is a hacker yeah there's
something<00:01:35.460> going<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.360> she<00:01:36.900> kind<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.619> read<00:01:37.979> this

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
something going on she kind of read this

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.940 
something going on she kind of read this
thing<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.479> she<00:01:39.659> she<00:01:39.990> she<00:01:40.290> translated<00:01:40.770> as<00:01:40.920> a

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
thing that she she she translated as a

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.770 
thing that she she she translated as a
map<00:01:41.250> at<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.579> very<00:01:41.820> ending<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.390> she's<00:01:42.600> starting

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
map at the very ending so she's starting

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.289 
map at the very ending so she's starting
to<00:01:42.960> understand<00:01:43.619> what<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.610> language<00:01:44.880> that's

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
to understand what this language that's

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.170 
to understand what this language that's
scribbled<00:01:45.899> everywhere<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:47.130> think<00:01:48.060> that

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
scribbled everywhere is I think that

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.670 
scribbled everywhere is I think that
that's<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.479> hint<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.840> think<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.649> a

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
that's a hint I think that this is a

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.139 
that's a hint I think that this is a
hand<00:01:49.950> for<00:01:50.100> Inhumans<00:01:50.579> that's<00:01:50.790> what<00:01:51.000> they're

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
hand for Inhumans that's what they're

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.030 
hand for Inhumans that's what they're
dropping<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.720> that's<00:01:51.960> why<00:01:52.229> they're<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.710> gonna

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
dropping and that's why they're I gonna

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.870 
dropping and that's why they're I gonna
go<00:01:53.280> with<00:01:53.549> age<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.810> Ultron<00:01:55.229> trailer<00:01:55.259> next<00:01:56.040> next

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
go with age of Ultron trailer next next

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.149 
go with age of Ultron trailer next next
week<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.329> treat<00:01:58.229> Quicksilver<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.070> Scarlet

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
week and treat Quicksilver and Scarlet

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.270 
week and treat Quicksilver and Scarlet
Witch<00:01:59.670> as<00:01:59.909> Inhumans

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.910 

my<00:02:05.280> theory<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:06.020> because<00:02:07.020> they're<00:02:07.469> dropping

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
my theory is because they're dropping

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.979 
my theory is because they're dropping
this<00:02:08.009> idea<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.580> she<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.149> not<00:02:09.509> reacting<00:02:09.959> to

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
this idea that she is not reacting to

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.830 
this idea that she is not reacting to
the<00:02:10.200> alien<00:02:10.739> blood<00:02:11.459> because<00:02:12.270> she<00:02:12.420> might<00:02:12.599> be<00:02:12.720> an

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
the alien blood because she might be an

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.580 
the alien blood because she might be an
alien

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
alien

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.250

I'm<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.610> huge<00:02:14.910> fan<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.300> The<00:02:15.390> Runaways<00:02:15.569> series

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
Veronica Vaughn's runaway series and so

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.420 
Veronica Vaughn's runaway series and so
I'm<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:19.050> seems<00:02:19.319> like<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.830> that's<00:02:20.280> a

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
I'm it seems like that that's a

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.490 
I'm it seems like that that's a
brilliant<00:02:20.640> theory<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.330> little<00:02:22.200> bit<00:02:22.350> better

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
brilliant theory a little bit better

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.150 
brilliant theory a little bit better
than<00:02:22.770> mine

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
than mine

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.130 
than mine
but<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.580> think<00:02:24.030> they<00:02:24.330> might<00:02:24.510> be<00:02:24.690> pulling<00:02:24.990> a

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
but I think they might be pulling a

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.230 
but I think they might be pulling a
little<00:02:25.290> bit<00:02:25.500> from<00:02:25.709> that<00:02:25.740> Carolina<00:02:26.550> Dean<00:02:26.880> in

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
little bit from that Carolina Dean in

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.890 
little bit from that Carolina Dean in
that<00:02:27.630> series<00:02:27.990> is<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:28.800> daughter<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.900> alien

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
that series is a daughter of alien

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.840 
that series is a daughter of alien
supervillains<00:02:31.500> they're<00:02:31.770> movie<00:02:32.220> stars<00:02:32.250> in

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
supervillains they're movie stars in

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.430 
supervillains they're movie stars in
that<00:02:33.030> version<00:02:33.209> which<00:02:33.480> Kyle<00:02:33.720> MacLachlan<00:02:34.050> is

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
that version which Kyle MacLachlan is

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.750 
that version which Kyle MacLachlan is
not<00:02:35.190> in<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.209> show<00:02:36.420> but<00:02:36.959> I<00:02:37.590> feel<00:02:38.430> like<00:02:38.550> that

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
not in the show but I feel like that

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.970 
not in the show but I feel like that
could<00:02:38.940> be<00:02:39.569> kind<00:02:39.959> of<00:02:40.080> twisting<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.650> moving

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
could be kind of twisting and moving

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.770 
could be kind of twisting and moving
that<00:02:41.130> together<00:02:41.310> because<00:02:41.819> Carolina<00:02:42.270> Dean<00:02:42.540> was

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
that together because Carolina Dean was

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.420 
that together because Carolina Dean was
an<00:02:42.959> alien<00:02:43.440> who<00:02:43.590> didn't<00:02:43.890> know<00:02:44.010> she<00:02:44.069> was<00:02:44.340> an

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
an alien who didn't know she was an

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.720 
an alien who didn't know she was an
alien<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:45.840> I<00:02:46.350> think<00:02:46.650> that<00:02:46.800> it's<00:02:47.040> possible

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
alien and I think that it's possible

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.970 
alien and I think that it's possible
that<00:02:47.790> they<00:02:48.480> might<00:02:48.690> be<00:02:48.840> mixing<00:02:49.320> Inhumans<00:02:49.830> and

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
that they might be mixing Inhumans and

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.520 
that they might be mixing Inhumans and
taking<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.340> little<00:02:50.489> bit<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.730> Carolina's

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
taking a little bit of Carolina's

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.500 
taking a little bit of Carolina's
backstory<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.709> partly<00:02:53.250> yeah<00:02:53.430> yeah<00:02:54.300> a<00:02:54.330> little

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
backstory and partly yeah yeah a little

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.900 
backstory and partly yeah yeah a little
bit<00:02:54.570> of<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.720> best-of<00:02:55.140> let's<00:02:55.470> go<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:56.610> would<00:02:56.760> love

the runaways to be so happy if they did

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.050 
the runaways to be so happy if they did
that<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:03.660> makes<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:04.110> lot<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.290> sense<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:05.060> in

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
that and it makes a lot of sense and in

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.680 
that and it makes a lot of sense and in
humans<00:03:06.480> things<00:03:08.000> like<00:03:09.000> five<00:03:09.239> minutes<00:03:09.480> before

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
humans things like five minutes before

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.390

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
to happen but I'm leaning towards the
