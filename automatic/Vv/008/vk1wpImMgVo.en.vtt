killed<00:02:19.370> by<00:02:19.490> Baker<00:02:19.730> our<00:02:20.090> build<00:02:20.330> master<00:02:20.720> well

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
killed by Baker our build master well

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.960 
killed by Baker our build master well
you<00:02:21.740> got<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:21.980> kill<00:02:22.130> me<00:02:22.250> Baker<00:02:22.460> I<00:02:22.610> thought<00:02:22.880> it

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
you got to kill me Baker I thought it

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:37.620 
you got to kill me Baker I thought it
was<00:02:23.060> your<00:02:23.210> friend

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.370 

this<00:02:38.260> is<00:02:38.410> ryan<00:02:38.680> Elam<00:02:39.040> at<00:02:39.250> 1am<00:02:40.170> yeah<00:02:41.170> it's<00:02:41.320> the

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
this is ryan Elam at 1am yeah it's the

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.710 
this is ryan Elam at 1am yeah it's the
difference<00:02:44.670> he's<00:02:45.670> just<00:02:45.940> staring<00:02:46.240> at<00:02:46.570> the

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
difference he's just staring at the

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.000 
difference he's just staring at the
crown<00:02:48.360> it's<00:02:49.360> all<00:02:49.690> about<00:02:49.960> the<00:02:50.140> crown<00:02:50.350> so<00:02:50.860> we've

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
crown it's all about the crown so we've

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.060 
crown it's all about the crown so we've
taken<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:52.060> data<00:02:52.240> on<00:02:52.480> live<00:02:53.050> and<00:02:53.380> test<00:02:53.860> and

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
taken the data on live and test and

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.860 
taken the data on live and test and
compared<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:54.640> two<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:55.060> test<00:02:55.420> environment

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
compared the two the test environment

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.720 
compared the two the test environment
has<00:02:55.990> all<00:02:56.140> di<00:02:56.380> performance<00:02:56.920> changes<00:02:57.070> basically

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
has all di performance changes basically

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.760 
has all di performance changes basically
what<00:02:57.820> we've<00:02:57.970> done<00:02:58.090> is<00:02:58.270> we've<00:02:58.420> taken<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.990> CPUs

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
what we've done is we've taken the CPUs

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.550 
what we've done is we've taken the CPUs
and<00:02:59.800> the<00:03:00.040> GPUs<00:03:00.430> for<00:03:00.670> each<00:03:00.760> player<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:01.990> broken

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
and the GPUs for each player and broken

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.050 
and the GPUs for each player and broken
them<00:03:02.650> down<00:03:02.680> into<00:03:02.830> a<00:03:03.190> low<00:03:03.520> medium<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:03.970> high

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
them down into a low medium and high

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.330 
them down into a low medium and high
categories<00:03:04.720> and<00:03:04.900> then<00:03:05.530> compared<00:03:05.980> them<00:03:06.130> across

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
categories and then compared them across

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.190 
categories and then compared them across
different<00:03:06.760> battle<00:03:07.030> sizes<00:03:07.450> so<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:07.690> battle<00:03:07.990> size

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
different battle sizes so a battle size

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.890 
different battle sizes so a battle size
of<00:03:08.380> a<00:03:08.470> nun<00:03:08.800> small<00:03:09.640> medium<00:03:09.850> large<00:03:10.090> huge<00:03:10.690> and

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
of a nun small medium large huge and

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.990 
of a nun small medium large huge and
then<00:03:10.990> even<00:03:11.110> Max<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:11.770> then<00:03:12.400> seeing<00:03:12.670> how<00:03:12.850> they

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
then even Max and then seeing how they

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.820 
then even Max and then seeing how they
compare<00:03:13.240> between<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:14.080> live<00:03:14.260> environment<00:03:14.530> in

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
compare between the live environment in

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.190 
compare between the live environment in
the<00:03:14.920> test<00:03:15.160> environment<00:03:15.670> as<00:03:16.240> you<00:03:16.330> can<00:03:16.450> see<00:03:16.660> for

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
the test environment as you can see for

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.200 
the test environment as you can see for
the<00:03:17.290> most<00:03:17.500> part<00:03:17.710> we've<00:03:17.950> got<00:03:18.210> increases

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
the most part we've got increases

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.610 
the most part we've got increases
anywhere<00:03:19.600> from<00:03:19.690> about<00:03:19.840> twenty<00:03:20.200> percent<00:03:20.230> all

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
anywhere from about twenty percent all

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.170 
anywhere from about twenty percent all
the<00:03:20.710> way<00:03:20.800> up<00:03:20.890> to<00:03:20.920> fifty<00:03:21.310> percent<00:03:21.670> across<00:03:21.940> the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
the way up to fifty percent across the

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.800 
the way up to fifty percent across the
board<00:03:22.450> which<00:03:22.750> is<00:03:22.930> a<00:03:22.960> tremendous<00:03:23.860> work<00:03:24.040> by<00:03:24.310> the

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
board which is a tremendous work by the

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.840 
board which is a tremendous work by the
everyone<00:03:25.810> really<00:03:26.050> on<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.260> team<00:03:26.850> then

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
everyone really on the team then

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.670 
everyone really on the team then
planetside<00:03:28.390> 2<00:03:28.600> faster<00:03:29.170> yeah<00:03:30.100> yeah<00:03:30.580> my<00:03:31.320> cpu<00:03:32.320> I'm

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
planetside 2 faster yeah yeah my cpu I'm

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
planetside 2 faster yeah yeah my cpu I'm
CPU<00:03:33.160> but<00:03:33.310> on<00:03:33.400> it<00:03:33.550> home<00:03:33.700> so<00:03:33.970> what<00:03:34.450> what<00:03:35.170> or<00:03:35.700> how'd

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
CPU but on it home so what what or how'd

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.750 
CPU but on it home so what what or how'd
this<00:03:36.820> happen<00:03:36.880> I<00:03:37.330> have<00:03:37.990> my<00:03:38.800> settings<00:03:39.160> max<00:03:39.430> oh

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
this happen I have my settings max oh

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.610 
this happen I have my settings max oh
right<00:03:40.750> there<00:03:42.840> so<00:03:43.840> for<00:03:44.050> the<00:03:44.110> most<00:03:44.260> recent

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
right there so for the most recent

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.830 
right there so for the most recent
updates<00:03:45.340> we've<00:03:45.640> been<00:03:45.790> focusing<00:03:46.690> on

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
updates we've been focusing on

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.350 
updates we've been focusing on
performance<00:03:47.560> in<00:03:47.770> plain<00:03:48.220> sight<00:03:48.490> to<00:03:48.700> you<00:03:48.820> and<00:03:49.060> a

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
performance in plain sight to you and a

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.870 
performance in plain sight to you and a
large<00:03:49.620> part<00:03:50.620> of<00:03:50.710> that<00:03:50.890> for<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:51.400> lab<00:03:51.580> has<00:03:51.850> been

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
large part of that for the lab has been

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.180 
large part of that for the lab has been
lower<00:03:52.840> end<00:03:53.370> PC<00:03:54.370> configurations<00:03:55.590> like<00:03:56.590> Windows

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
lot of the updates we're doing are

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.690 
lot of the updates we're doing are
having<00:04:05.140> a<00:04:05.230> positive<00:04:05.410> impact<00:04:05.710> on<00:04:06.250> those

having a positive impact on those

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.330 
having a positive impact on those
configurations<00:04:07.090> and<00:04:07.900> not<00:04:08.770> creating<00:04:09.010> any<00:04:09.250> new

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
an am station yeah I expected a BioLab

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.660 
an am station yeah I expected a BioLab
costume<00:04:37.880> I<00:04:39.260> if<00:04:40.260> it<00:04:40.470> was<00:04:40.590> my<00:04:40.800> way<00:04:40.980> I<00:04:41.010> could<00:04:41.490> take
