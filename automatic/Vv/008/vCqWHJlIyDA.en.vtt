00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:14.099
 hello everybody, welcome to another video from 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.439
 geo tv channel 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.090
 I'm Marcelo in this video I'm going 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.570
 show how we create a disc 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.970
 virtual one true that on windows 8 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.309
 the process is very simple or format 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.000
 this drive assigns a drive to it 

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:29.399
 also 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.300
 and then show you the whole process for the 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:37.469
 removal of that disk ok let's start 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:43.170
 here the video will stay here in the 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:47.120
 search it it computer button 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.120
 right on top of manage 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:58.390
 here within manage we will click on 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:01:04.140
 disk management in the 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:06.280
 action on i will get more actions create vhd 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.220
 that one asks me to choose the place 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:13.479
 where I'm going to save the file vhd go 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:17.460
 click here search on c2 points 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.460
 I will create here a folder called disk 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:28.140
 Underneath I'm going to name it unity 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:31.450
 click save here I choose the type 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.149
 file if you will be seeing hoover 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.020
 hdx the advantage of phd x is that i have 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:41.830
 a higher capacity support here is 16 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:46.770
 terabytes and also fail-safe 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:50.380
 fixed - size energy or expanded 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.110
 dynamically there you have two 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:58.810
 situations where the fixed size I win 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:00.070
 in performance and in the part here and 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.649
 expanding 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.170
 dynamically it increases 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.210
 according to its use but the 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.030
 asked about performance because of this 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.480
 the fixed size it will already create with the 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:17.320
 ability that you determine that I 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.820
 I'm going to put a 100 megabyte disk here 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.660
 you can change here to gigas 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.660
 terabytes 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:33.630
 created the disc here below disco 3com 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:37.080
 initialize the disc here I choose the 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:40.280
 type of partition that I want mrpp vai 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:46.380
 put mbr by partition size ne 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:50.040
 ok the disk boot ok now i 'm going 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.890
 create a new volume of those who come up with 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.760
 I will attribute this capacity to the 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:00.060
 unit is for him the file system 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:07.080
 that I will define is the ntfs I will leave 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:09.599
 all this as you can conclude that it 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.340
 shows the message to format a 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.340
 fast aac format even 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:20.810
 ok already played with the hand as the unit is 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:30.000
 that ready installed I can already copy 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:32.459
 files right now for us to remove the 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.030
 People remove right click here I 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:41.790
 I can come in this option to detach soon 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.390
 I listened to the disc but did not remove the 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:49.620
 vhd file if I go there on the spot - and 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:52.230
 two points disk in hd just removed it 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.260
 here on the part of management and 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.150
 drive the partition and good staff 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.220
