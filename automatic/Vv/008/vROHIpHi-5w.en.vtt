00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:14.079
 silvia captured always paints 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.839
 silvia spoke 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:23.949
 especially of siena 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.029
 he prefers them to be works 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.279
 to tell us about her rather than the biographies of the titles 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.940
 but 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.970
 deteriorate listen instead 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.970
 and you are now looking for it 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.540
 the perfumes of the 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.490
 music is the existence in the abstract canvases of an artist by technique 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.930
 surprising reckless 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.930
 who experiences without fear walking 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.590
 on the very thin thread 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.050
 where does Sicily take us? 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.060
 leads us through your daydreams 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.940
 with the intent of being discovered a path state of fragments of 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.940
 frames of a narrative in progress 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.150
 his paintings are clippings of a much larger image 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.260
 impossible to contain 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.830
 one must dare to have a space that is too large for the later 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.740
 which requires the desire and tension of a conservative to be fulfilled 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.089
 and it exists 

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:14.089
 and its entirety 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:25.499
 mobile 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:27.320
 from the infinite distance 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.980
 and people at destination impossible blades of light cut time it 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.980
 divide the space of representation 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.050
 the wounds in the plot of the story 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.359
 they will always carry the tracks 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.609
 the silvia closed structures 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:47.730
 that cures and respects them to make us remember forever 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.089
 with you 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:10.279
 everything that carries color with its absence 

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:14.589
 Burgundy is slow and unstoppable emerges from the depths of TV 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:20.640
 with the quiet strength and inexorable roots that lift the road surface 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.350
 now I keep in the ground 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.350
 salaries 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.889
 and so the water becomes plastic 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.299
 and twists 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.389
 the flames devour the crystal and stop surprised to observe us 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.849
 the threatening clouds invade the entire space of the representation and yes 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.849
 they turn into asphalt 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.009
 what a new road means is added to the others 

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:55.089
 a new video a choice between the countless possible alternatives 

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:57.230
 a different future for the story 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.999
 for the narration in progress 

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:02.409
 in this labyrinth of possibilities 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.770
 silvia invites us to explore 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:05.859
 to lose ourselves 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.180
 to take no evolution 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.939
 no signal 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:13.239
 forces us to imagine the rest of the story 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.389
 what it's up to us to count 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.409
 and that in the contour of the thymine 

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:19.209
 with all good will 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.209
 read mail 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:25.369
 lol
