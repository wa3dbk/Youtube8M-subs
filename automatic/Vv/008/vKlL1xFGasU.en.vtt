00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 and well that all these long this 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.929
 I hope you're doing well 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.690
 found today for a new 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.189
 video on battlefield hardline ago 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.110
 a few days I had the opportunity to 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.030
 put your hands on this all 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.320
 latest version of battle federline which 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.839
 is very very close to what you 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.699
 will be able to test during the beta that 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.050
 will be in a few days so what is it 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.689
 that there is new in this beta and 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.130
 well listen in addition to relaxing that 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.900
 was the map you could test in June 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.599
 you will have the opportunity to put your 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.130
 hands on the map of this bowl which is the 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.420
 same as you have just before it's a 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.099
 map that you will be able to test in 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.350
 the new fashion kingdom new fashion to 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.079
 other best which is a mode you 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.280
 you have to capture the vehicles 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.000
 and drive around the map for 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.100
 achieve points 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.329
 the vehicles will eventually be 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.860
 kinds of flacq that you will have to 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.950
 keep under control to knock down 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.050
 the opposing tickets and finally the second 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.149
 woman who are now here a few 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.770
 days in the beta it's bendjo but a 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.140
 map that you will be able to play by having 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.610
 so what is it if you 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.180
 remember well in the beta that you have 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.870
 had in June actually it was a fashion a 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.430
 little bit derived from the bf3 df4 rush as 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.619
 is that there will be no rush actually on 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.880
 battlefield airlines but what has one is 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.110
 very very close so I did not 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.760
 not convinced during the first 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.930
 beta but with the new balances 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.070
 age that have been made at the level of 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.830
 goals we really have something 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.570
 which is very very clean and I have been 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.280
 very satisfied elsewhere 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.010
 I think I'm going very very tall 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.159
 part left over during the first 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.810
 days of the beta and then we had 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.460
 also an opportunity to test the mode 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.900
 conquest so the conquest mode that remains 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.330
 still 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.710
 the bf amd all the same then if you 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.880
 are big fans of the conquest mode 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.280
 you have no problem with you 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.759
 visceral has done everything possible to 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.530
 that this mode respects the old ones 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.509
 versions of a fashion conquest one has 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.390
 behind very beautiful mat on this 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.820
 bartender including 2 balls which was the map that 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.840
 I was in conquest so why 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.490
 I say trÃ¨bes is here because 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.580
 I was not necessarily very satisfied 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.280
 of battlefield 4 maps design i have 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.890
 could test more than just the maps you 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.880
 see in this video then 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.100
 unfortunately for the moment I have 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.270
 no right to communicate anything 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.619
 either in relation to these new maps 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.149
 but you can really do 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.920
 trust on this point there is 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.200
 a lot of work on maps and 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.769
 I have a moment say that I have not been 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.330
 satisfied with the design of the maps is then 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.920
 for information and maybe it's 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.070
 which makes the waves as good 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.330
 sure the author phildar bein me I was a 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.239
 former call of duty 4 player during 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.820
 very very long time and the lead level 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.790
 designer including the one who is in charge of the 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.800
 design maps on Gouv en l'air is a 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.470
 former level designer of 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.300
 of activity I believe finally at last 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.770
 work on on call of duty 4 and on 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.150
 maps mainly that were of 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.070
 very good hands not to remove that 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.650
 a present from the team with today 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.700
 no longer really the case 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.930
 So as always that it all 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.880
 so you will be able to test 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.760
 his two brands that are really top 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.950
 design level but there is really 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.260
 a lot to come then with regards to 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.550
 regards the weapons on this bf ardennes 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.330
 you do not have to see a lot in 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.850
 this video because I have 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.800
 essentially played the 16 m to 3 yes 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.260
 lines and at 3 that we had on bf3 that is 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.570
 really but really the same as the one 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.310
 on bf3 it's a real pleasure to play 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.930
 with I hope you will have the opportunity 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.940
 to unlock it during the beta 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.200
 because for information we had 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.670
 access to all weapons and all 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.010
 sites to the stream that you see on 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.980
 this body which reserved for the 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.990
 developers from visceral home you will have 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.910
 not the opportunity to unlock it but there 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.670
 has lots of others that are very expensive 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.590
 therefore will have to use the system of 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.880
 entire provinces instead of point you 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.980
 have money the money you 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.230
 can use to unlock weapons 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.690
 gadgets equipment and skins 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.459
 and speaking of gadgets then the 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.640
 last point on which I had 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.180
 really want to 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.860
 to debate with you to talk about it 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.920
 during my last trip to san 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.330
 francisco finally the precedent in october 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.370
 we had the opportunity to give our opinion 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.080
 compared to what we thought of the 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.630
 last beta of pass also the one 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.640
 before 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.060
 are you on video for example gets hurt and 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.230
 other people and I had given a 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.970
 return by fear within the bodies 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.680
 in one of the videos that were broadcast 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:12.240
 quite recently by come talk about the 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.200
 cinema we did not see exactly what 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.709
 that I said but in fact I had 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.150
 proposed a real change from 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.670
 to snipers and annuities the sniper 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.800
 really more effective and more 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.380
 useful in something other than fighting 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.110
 infantry for example and for this 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.520
 do I proposed more or less if 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.660
 you want me I have not played at the 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.350
 water company but I had proposed the 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.390
 return of the lamal magnum so the beautiful 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.910
 magnum who for information now 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:44.940
 in the beta version with rihanna allows 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:48.330
 to shoot shots killed in a bullet at 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.540
 less than 5 years you think that we are well 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.130
 okay but it's also very very 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.480
 effective against vehicles a small 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.770
 little too much right now it 's going to be 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.930
 changed to maybe during the beta 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.790
 maybe during the health of May 2 you 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.010
 will see that then I do not know if we see 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.840
 in this video give us the ball 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.980
 magnum in action against a vehicle but 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.060
 against a helicopter it can 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.950
 currently 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.710
 you are a helicopter for three bullets 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.420
 which at least it's a bit early for 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.310
 currently but it's going to be it's going to be 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.390
 rectified do not worry then the 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.820
 ball now she's available on 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.040
 two snipers only it's the r700 and 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.780
 the wm who are two weeks very 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.540
 powerful dozen 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.850
 super class to be able to see him a little 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.100
 little later and then to come back on 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.870
 this magnum ball then when you 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.060
 use the magnum ball you have to 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.850
 obviously an equipment slot and the 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.160
 care equipment include two of 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.450
 order two gadgets that are pretty 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.919
 important anyway on the departure one 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.150
 did not want to use the breech and you 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:43.290
 can not use the laser so yes 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.750
 a change on that side because 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.490
 that before the breech and the laser was 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.889
 not me on the net this lot but to 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.510
 present the breech and whose laser 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:55.500
 sanction of his own lot as well as the 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:58.440
 magnum m you will have the choice between these 3 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.940
 may be able to take of course so 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.330
 that's all to say that I've been 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.970
 really satisfied that my opinion was 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.410
 as well taken into account in the end me 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.930
 it made me really happy I gave 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.910
 this opinion by being to say enough 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.729
 persuaded that it would be a change that 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.080
 would be quite welcome on on hardline 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:17.460
 I think a lot of people are going 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.500
 to see it oddly in a first 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.240
 time because it's true that valve that 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.910
 one shot 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:26.160
 it hurts but if you remember 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.410
 of course f3 is normally open 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.419
 4 but it's not really it's not 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:33.660
 really that actually we were supposed 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:35.640
 one shot at less than 25 m 3 or 15 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.530
 or 25 matches not sure but that's it 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:41.400
 it's just the reign of one shot that has 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:44.370
 been increased and anyway there is 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.900
 had an equipment that was created on the side 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.510
 of the engineer to counter this duval 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.820
 it's in English these salt arm holdings 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.630
 it's a lawyer kind of kevlar if you 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.450
 want it to allow us to this 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:58.080
 curious to two or even three balls of 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:59.280
 two bullets magnum and I think that's 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.539
 a change that is really welcome 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.370
 because it will allow variety 

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:03.870
 at the class level given that at 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.090
 present I think maybe that's the 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:08.490
 medics will tell the inspector in 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.360
 face and for once I choose to 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.009
 take 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.490
 the engineer is to pave the way towards 

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:15.599
 the goal with the Norman dyotte you 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.979
 will also see that there are others 

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:18.990
 changes there is a change at 

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:20.610
 level of the medic the care fund 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.439
 come back much more slowly 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.879
 so be careful now where 

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:25.259
 you ask your health care fund for 

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:26.069
 not be broken because if the 

00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:26.490
 case it's good you're going to have to 

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:27.719
 expect 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.039
 I do not know exactly how many 

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:30.479
 time these tests took a long time 

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:32.340
 I think it's going to be at least ten 

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:35.729
 even fifteen seconds before the 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:37.439

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.909

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:42.960

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.279
