00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.030

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.010
 conducted in the comic that was about 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.460

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.720
 creative guardian 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.640
 with status 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.210
 i 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.370
 apolo very from here 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.090
 is 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.090
 to me 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.030
 and that is strong 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.220
 then annotated 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.159
 two weeks ago 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.670
 the only word we have sat 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.560
 because they are imputed 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.560
 why 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.640
 and I want 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.640
 and more important 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.930
 batman 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.640
 what did I say but go 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.720
 look 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.970
 mateo sanz has arrived 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.450
 ah 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.299
 and good the truth 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.740
 at the end will smith I think it's put 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.050
 I already knew that they are a group of 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.000
 villains coming together to do missions 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.889
 impossible but not bad it seems that the 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.370
 government is going to hire them or something to 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:38.110
 be visions but they are not really 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.759
 well-known villains but 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.270
 originally it was not four suicide 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:44.470
 I think not but appear as wine 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.669
 they are a group and they are going to do good things 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.830
 as it says with to save the world I think 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:53.199
 that there will be equality I think that 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.400
 hardy kuyt as is joe's girlfriend and in 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:56.320
 some time of the first one is going to 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.990
 release surely we are prisoners 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.449
 carles more pendeja and good this is me 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.840
 the truth that the 50 minutes 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:11.259
 seconds that came out impresses me a lot 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:13.230
 the relationship a lot of fear and as we have 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:16.290
 included tattoos these what 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:20.700
 he says ha ha ha ha ha haha xd xd areas 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:23.280
 the look that looks imposing like that 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.100
 bad makes them powerful and we hope 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.960
 see us next 20 missing as a year more 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.920

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.920

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:47.730
 that was all guys if you liked it from the 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.620
 like subscribe has been seen with mind and 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:56.060

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:56.060

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:08.480
