00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:03.870
 Fermin speaks to them as they are 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.810
 well this is my new account in October 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.280
 I'm going to talk a little 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.880
 of how to order a room is a task that one should not forget since 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.579
 It is in which we live every day 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:17.999
 if I shared it with siblings 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:21.739
 first of all it would be selecting all the elements that are not of 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:25.429
 utility some grouping them in one place put them in a bag 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:31.129
 more is thrown away this task is the first and the most important so 

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:35.570
 once all the non-useful elements are removed we could start to sweep the 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.809
 fourth to remove dirt from the floor following the activity that order the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.339
 fourth we could understand a cigarette to calm the environment 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.079
 to appease them about five minutes 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.170
 we must continue with the proposed work 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.000
 Once the room is clean you have to start ordering each element in 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.910
 its place 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.850
 when it has been used it must go back to its place since that element was 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.910
 destined to that place since you have given it to him 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:01.870
 the beds 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.180
 is another one of the cases 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.940
 of which I am going to touch is a law which is obligatory the irreversible 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.100
 whoever does not comply with this law will be punished for cleaning him 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.240
 dog waste 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.509
 for a whole week 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.509
 with custody guarded 24 hours 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.399
 that's why 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.840
 people always choose to make the bed every day of the year 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.820
 and be in order 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.719
 of the aesthetics of the room is a very debated topic but I think 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.280
 that each one has a different personality 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.500
 then there is no rule for the aesthetics of the room each one chooses what 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.630
 what do you like for example 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.580
 poster of your favorite bands 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.950
 up drawings on the wall 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.130
 some keep old toys just for decoration 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.460
 because they think they remember old times but well everyone chooses their 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.159
 own style is free but that yes 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.749
 it has to represent something 

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:54.999
 and it has to have some message because if it does not represent any style of 

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:56.670
 any personality 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.050
 the next item will be wardrobe clothes 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.399
 they have is well stacked and well folded 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.960
 since if this does not happen 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.160
 There will be no order and do not forget the underwear that also 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.700
 must be well stacked I think that if we consider all the factors 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.920
 mentioned we could say that we will officially have the room in its 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.069
 side but this task is fed every day keeping the clothes in their 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.580
 place 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.569
 and well populated 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.719
 not leave elements of uselessness inside your room having a garbage can in 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:30.099
 Do not let your friends ask for the ash on the floor for which you are going to 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.880
 have to clean it since you have committed to officially maintain a 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.269
 clean room you must sweep at least once a day to find out every week 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.879
 and vacuum every day 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.000
 I think these ideas are basic for ordering your room and for you to have 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:47.950
 count until then greets them fermin 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.690
 and hopefully it will be useful 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.230
 since for me it is a daily routine
