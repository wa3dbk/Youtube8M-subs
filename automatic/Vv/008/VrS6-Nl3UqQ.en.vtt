00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
small screen created a real feeling of

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.820 
small screen created a real feeling of
tension<00:03:12.910> and<00:03:13.300> that's<00:03:13.480> at<00:03:13.660> that<00:03:13.900> time<00:03:14.140> we<00:03:14.620> in

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
tension and that's at that time we in

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.340 
tension and that's at that time we in
the<00:03:14.950> team<00:03:15.130> thought<00:03:15.519> that<00:03:16.090> we<00:03:16.269> really<00:03:17.110> touched

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
the team thought that we really touched

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.800 
the team thought that we really touched
something<00:03:17.680> that<00:03:17.980> would<00:03:18.190> bring<00:03:18.700> really<00:03:19.450> a<00:03:19.480> good

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
something that would bring really a good

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.780 
something that would bring really a good
feeling<00:03:20.380> of<00:03:20.500> tension<00:03:20.680> that<00:03:21.040> I<00:03:21.100> think<00:03:21.640> that's

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
feeling of tension that I think that's

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.490 
feeling of tension that I think that's
fair<00:03:22.630> enough<00:03:22.660> if<00:03:22.989> I<00:03:23.110> remember<00:03:23.140> correctly

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
fair enough if I remember correctly

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.770 
fair enough if I remember correctly
that's<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.220> first<00:03:24.430> time<00:03:24.489> we<00:03:24.700> say<00:03:24.880> okay<00:03:25.450> we<00:03:25.600> get

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
that's the first time we say okay we get

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.420 
that's the first time we say okay we get
it<00:03:25.840> we<00:03:25.989> understand<00:03:26.830> what's<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.190> way<00:03:27.280> you're

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
it we understand what's the way you're

00:03:27.430 --> 00:04:04.110
