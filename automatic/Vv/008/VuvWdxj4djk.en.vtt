00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.490
 yes windows i love you 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.460
 with youtube friends as they are 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:18.920
 welcome to a new video of 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.900
 minecraft and guys and in this case it 's 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.670
 to announce that I'm already jealous of version 0 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.590
 point 10.11 yes I know it guys is very 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.660
 repetitive and can even become 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.390
 annoying that there is a video of the same 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.160
 but hey, it's no more boys and good 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.579
 I suppose you will ask why 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.829
 a version 0.10 point 1 and the reason is 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.020
 that in many cases minecraft and not 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.660
 it worked correctly and even 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.399
 it did not open, this is why they 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.320
 They decided to make a new version and 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.780
 it really does not contain much remarkable 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.969
 in fact tomás posted this on twitter 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.039
 ok a new version can not be 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.879
 complete without some people from the 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.110
 special start the game calm 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.829
 but hey guys it also has a little 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.170
 of reason the next three that public 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.000
 anyway if you have mods installed 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.979
 the new versions sure to be 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.049
 grow up make sure you use motorcycles 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.619
 explicitly supported to do 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:17.299
 10.0 points and good guys like what 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.649
 they just heard some people 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.840
 they had trouble opening their 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.119
 minecraft and this was the reason why 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.030
 They decided to make a new version without 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.470
 But as I said, it does not contain 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.200
 absolutely nothing except this 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.390
 bug fixes clear and in fact only 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.460
 it was for ios devices because in 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.440
 android I think there was no problem like 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.179
 I know because tomás was published 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.100
 survey in which they asked several 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:41.869
 things in relation to apple products 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.850
 but good guys I think that would be 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.409
 all the video remember that they can pass 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.450
 to the description you can download the 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.299
 new version for both platforms in 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.069
 this case for android and ios only 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.190
 remember to select the corresponding 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:56.959
 to your device and also resort that 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.399
 those links are only for people 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:00.530
 that can not buy minecraft and 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.539
 original because they have no way of how 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.429
 but good guys already as a conclusion 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.319
 I think the developers should already 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:08.030
 highlight beta versions for it are 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.100
 well and prevent this from happening again 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.570
 but good guys really 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.850
 and I apologize for the video 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.410
 too short however as they 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.510
 I said this version does not contain 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.490
 absolutely nothing new except 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.320
 of the repair of this bug of all 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.820
 ways if you liked the video because 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.830
 leave me a thumb up here 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.840

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.580
