00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.849
 air conditioning using a special 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.030
 fluids it absorbs and then releases 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.030
 heat 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.050
 air conditioning it uses property 1 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.950
 collect liquids to cool 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.330
 the air around us moving from liquid 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.890
 state in gaseous 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.430
 this liquid absorbs huge 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:35.680
 the amount of heat and then returning 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:37.030
 liquefy it gives it to the 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.850
 to lower the temperature 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.620
 air conditioning in the room absorbing heat 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.330
 inside it makes it stand out thanks to 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:51.159
 the transition of this fluid from one 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:53.589
 states to another in this heavy 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:55.809
 the box still needs air conditioning for 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:01:00.670
 in order to absorb heat and cool 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:04.690
 air conditioner partly located 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.650
 inside a partial outside of the building with both 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.830
 metal coil passes through the sides 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:16.299
 they filled with the magic ingredient 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.250
 refrigerant refrigerant is a 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.750
 a mixture of hydrogen fluoride carbon and 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.430
 chemicals that are easy 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.380
 goes from liquid to 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.369
 while absorbing gaseous 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.380
 The amount of heat 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.380
 how let's open and find out 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.920
 fan located on that end 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.640
 unit which is in the room 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.440
 draws in air from the room coolant 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.700
 inside the coil absorbs air 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:54.410
 warm and the air returns to 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.410
 the room is already much colder 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.600
 the system is just warm air 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.800
 absorbed is cooled upon contact with 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.130
 cold serpentine 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.100
 and go back to the room but where it goes 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.910
 heat and how the refrigerant remains 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:15.270
 the coldest even on the hottest days all 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.980
 matter in the phase transition at the entrance to 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.050
 coil evaporator which cools 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.890
 incoming air 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.970
 the refrigerant is liquid 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.530
 at two degrees Celsius being and 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.280
 colder than the air from the room he 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.570
 absorbs its heat 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.610
 the ability to move easily and liquid 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.560
 states in gaseous soon 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.650
 allows it to absorb much more 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.990
 heat when absorbing heat from the air 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.330
 refrigerant temperature increases by 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.820
 a few degrees is enough 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.860
 so that the liquid becomes a process gas 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.069
 evaporation it absorbs much more 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.700
 heat 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.439
 now you need to get rid of this heat 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.450
 welcome compressor it is black 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:57.480
 a cylinder that starts making noise when you 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.340
 turn on the conditioner 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.439
 This is the motor that pumps the refrigerant. 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.909
 by coil 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:05.109
 turning the compressor at a speed of 3 s 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.209
 half thousand revolutions per minute 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:09.730
 refrigerant moves in rings 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:13.560
 coil compressor compresses gas 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.560
 thereby increasing its temperature 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.680
 the distance between tiny and molecules 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.900
 have hydrogen carbon fluoride 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.079
 decreases and they warm up in 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.250
 view process 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.930
 refrigerant comes out of the compressor under 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.120
 high pressure is very hot at 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.120
 temperature of 65 degrees Celsius 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.180
 he hits a serpentine capacitor which 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.240
 surrounded by warm air from the street 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.420
 warm but not as hot as 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.430
 called refrigerant while warm 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.980
 transferred from hot to less hot 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.550
 hotter refrigerant unit and transmits the excess 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.550
 warm air 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.659
 moving through the size of q capacitor 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.150
 the refrigerant is cooled so that 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:05.959
 began the process of condensation and he again 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.959
 became liquid 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:15.010
 the condensation process it continues 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:16.180
 lose heat finally refrigerant again 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.209
 goes from one aggregate 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:24.370
 states to another this time in order 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:26.169
 to generate heat when approaching 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.360
 liquids to the expansion valve 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.729
 pressure decreases with increasing 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.979
 intermolecular trench space 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.110
 decreases and the refrigerant returns its 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.090
 refrigeration properties now with 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.490
 temperature of two degrees Celsius ready 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.570
 re-start the process of being late in 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.470
 the hottest day of the year 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:47.650
 conditioner will help cool absorb 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:51.090
 heat in the house emit it on the street and all 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.090
 due to phase transition
