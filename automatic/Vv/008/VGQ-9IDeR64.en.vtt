00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.570
 the people i have to give you something now 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.850
 I'm just talking with my car 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.850
 driven home okay more succeed 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.099
 probably my neighbor is more accurate 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.260
 Sincerely, time must be in a certain 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.570
 street I can not directly left 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.590
 drive because of the two-meter one- way street 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.539
 in between you are natural 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.310
 do not take in the direction so drive 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.140
 I usually right but this time 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.550
 page was closed because someone one 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.949
 I have to either build an accident 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.520
 turn around or take these two meters 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.800
 my make-up one- way street 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.390
 to get into this fucking street so 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.890
 perhaps quite chilling Rhine, it is 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.079
 only half a meter and I'm there 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.570
 on one come quite a lot of cars 45 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.940
 one behind the other and in the very back 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.190
 bus the one-way street in which I stood 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.600
 was wide enough for two tracks anyway 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.390
 They drive in the cars 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.949
 I'll tell you what's up you can 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.539
 but not in the one-way street know 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.280
 you did something there was such a man 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.050
 in the car that got really excited 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.239
 I shut down the window I write 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.750
 comes and then set again and 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.010
 without fun people you really cowardly 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.420
 simply sped up the winding around 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.670
 and vodka and as if that was not enough 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.010
 There is still a pedestrian there 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.229
 something about 50 to 60 years old 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.790
 In between, pedestrian people do nothing 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.009
 has to do with the on the way 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.439
 just passing people is watching me right 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.640
 reproachfully and says hey you have 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.060
 but not here in the one-way street 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.950
 what should that people do in the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.180
 moment I was already shit anyway 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.579
 on it and then come in such a 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.299
 Triviality people mix in foreign 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.759
 live in 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.619
 without reason though they just do not care 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.270
 to do other things but without fun people me 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.759
 I opened my door and said you 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.740
 different and if you have something to say for 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.119
 Then commentary commemorates the man 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.140
 was intimidated, I've seen it 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.060
 and he still wanted to be cool and do so 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.409
 So the man keeps going now you hear 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.380
 how he talks to himself and not 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.869
 insulted and I 'm not going out no 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.969
 and just say and say again 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.850
 Just keep it running and stuff 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.409
 it is always people open it 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.939
 and think you are in safety only 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.500
 when they are in the car themselves 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.960
 and another person in the car and 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.819
 As soon as you say something back you 're so cowardly 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.679
 because we just have nothing to do and 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.370

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.810
