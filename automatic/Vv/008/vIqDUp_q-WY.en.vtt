00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
Kona we didn't put it in and so they

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.590 
Kona we didn't put it in and so they
become<00:01:16.660> they<00:01:17.259> become<00:01:17.380> better<00:01:17.740> and<00:01:18.009> better<00:01:18.220> and

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
become they become better and better and

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.200 
become they become better and better and
they<00:01:19.600> were<00:01:20.229> they<00:01:20.530> were<00:01:20.590> better<00:01:21.210> confident

they were they were better confident

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.240 
they were they were better confident
about<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:22.630> game<00:01:22.810> and<00:01:22.840> they<00:01:23.440> scored<00:01:23.770> one<00:01:24.220> goal

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
about the game and they scored one goal

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.940 
about the game and they scored one goal
so<00:01:25.090> it<00:01:25.210> was<00:01:25.390> really<00:01:25.570> hard<00:01:25.990> to<00:01:26.080> fight<00:01:26.380> them<00:01:26.560> to
