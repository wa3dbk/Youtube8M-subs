super rigid torsionally it just doesn't
move<00:02:10.580> anywhere<00:02:10.879> at<00:02:11.120> all<00:02:11.239> so<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.569> bike<00:02:11.930> is

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
move anywhere at all so the bike is

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.589 
move anywhere at all so the bike is
really<00:02:13.250> really<00:02:13.430> precise<00:02:13.970> of<00:02:14.239> course<00:02:14.420> there's

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
really really precise of course there's

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:15.760 
really really precise of course there's
a<00:02:14.689> 20<00:02:14.989> mil<00:02:15.170> through<00:02:15.409> acts

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
a 20 mil through acts

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.700 
a 20 mil through acts
with<00:02:15.950> all<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.250> tout<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.730> 36<00:02:17.720> Forks<00:02:18.080> there's

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
with all the tout the 36 Forks there's

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.070 
with all the tout the 36 Forks there's
also<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:19.100> 12<00:02:19.460> millimeter<00:02:19.760> maxell<00:02:20.570> on<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.870> back

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
also a 12 millimeter maxell on the back

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.610 
also a 12 millimeter maxell on the back
so<00:02:21.500> this<00:02:22.250> thing<00:02:22.520> all<00:02:23.480> of<00:02:23.750> that<00:02:23.900> combined<00:02:24.410> with

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
so this thing all of that combined with

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.610 
so this thing all of that combined with
the<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:26.060> bearing<00:02:26.750> links<00:02:27.020> are<00:02:27.140> dual<00:02:27.320> row

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
the the bearing links are dual row

angular contact bearings super super

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.170 
angular contact bearings super super
stiff<00:02:30.140> so<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:30.920> whole<00:02:31.100> thing<00:02:31.370> it's<00:02:31.610> all<00:02:31.760> carbon

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
stiff so the whole thing it's all carbon

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.870 
stiff so the whole thing it's all carbon
