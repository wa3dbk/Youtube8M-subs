00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
the target separation chirp gives you

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.350 
the target separation chirp gives you
will<00:01:28.920> show<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.160> how<00:01:29.370> that<00:01:29.400> really<00:01:29.850> relates<00:01:30.180> to

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
will show you how that really relates to

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.750 
will show you how that really relates to
finding<00:01:30.750> fish<00:01:30.960> right<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.440> bottom<00:01:31.760> alright

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
finding fish right on the bottom alright

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.310 
finding fish right on the bottom alright
we<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.180> went<00:01:33.330> over<00:01:33.390> our<00:01:33.630> first<00:01:33.870> target<00:01:34.290> and

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
we just went over our first target and

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.930 
we just went over our first target and
this<00:01:34.500> was<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.830> one<00:01:34.980> that<00:01:35.100> was<00:01:35.250> closest<00:01:35.730> to<00:01:35.790> the

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
this was the one that was closest to the

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.630 
this was the one that was closest to the
bottom<00:01:36.740> so<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:37.830> just<00:01:37.920> want<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.160> over<00:01:38.310> target

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
bottom so we just want to over target

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.220 
bottom so we just want to over target
number<00:01:38.850> two<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.540> was<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.840> one<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.080> was

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
number two and this was the one that was

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.899 
number two and this was the one that was
suspended<00:01:40.710> about<00:01:40.860> six<00:01:41.130> inches<00:01:41.430> off

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
suspended about six inches off

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.060 
suspended about six inches off
and<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.390> can<00:01:42.509> see<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.990> brick<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.799> bottom

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
and you can see the brick on the bottom

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.090 
and you can see the brick on the bottom
and<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.490> tennis<00:01:44.789> balls<00:01:45.469> this<00:01:46.469> is<00:01:46.530> our<00:01:46.740> final

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
and the tennis balls this is our final

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.370 
and the tennis balls this is our final
tennis<00:01:47.369> ball<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.700> has<00:01:47.960> final<00:01:48.960> brick<00:01:49.170> with

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
tennis ball that has final brick with

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.350 
tennis ball that has final brick with
the<00:01:49.500> tennis<00:01:49.799> ball<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.159> foot<00:01:50.399> off<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:51.060> bottom

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
the tennis ball of foot off the bottom

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.899 
the tennis ball of foot off the bottom
so<00:01:51.720> really<00:01:52.079> nice<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.439> easy<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.649> see<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.759> we've

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
so really nice and easy to see so we've

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.850 
so really nice and easy to see so we've
shown<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.270> what<00:01:54.479> fake<00:01:55.140> targets<00:01:55.560> look<00:01:55.679> like

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
shown you what fake targets look like

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.289 
shown you what fake targets look like
the<00:01:56.009> tennis<00:01:56.310> balls<00:01:56.549> but<00:01:56.820> now<00:01:56.969> we're<00:01:57.179> actually

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
the tennis balls but now we're actually

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.760 
the tennis balls but now we're actually
going<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.659> show<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.899> what<00:01:58.170> real<00:01:58.320> fish<00:02:00.649> see<00:02:01.649> in

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
going to show you what real fish see in

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.380 
going to show you what real fish see in
the<00:02:01.890> split<00:02:02.189> zoom<00:02:02.399> how<00:02:02.640> much<00:02:02.939> bigger<00:02:03.210> and

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
the split zoom how much bigger and

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.050 
the split zoom how much bigger and
easier<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.840> see<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.289> fish<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:05.250> here's

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
easier it is to see that fish and here's

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.240 
easier it is to see that fish and here's
this<00:02:06.539> would<00:02:06.720> be<00:02:06.840> bait<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.829> can<00:02:07.979> tell<00:02:08.130> the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
this would be bait you can tell the

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.100 
this would be bait you can tell the
color<00:02:08.459> intensity<00:02:08.940> here<00:02:09.239> this<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.720> nice<00:02:09.929> big

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
color intensity here this is a nice big

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.080 
color intensity here this is a nice big
predator<00:02:10.530> fish<00:02:10.739> but<00:02:11.250> these<00:02:11.400> little<00:02:11.700> marks<00:02:11.940> are

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
predator fish but these little marks are

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.000 
predator fish but these little marks are
going<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.269> be<00:02:12.360> more<00:02:12.569> bait<00:02:12.810> like<00:02:13.080> except<00:02:13.830> for

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
going to be more bait like except for

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.710 
going to be more bait like except for
this<00:02:14.160> you<00:02:14.549> get<00:02:14.670> nice<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:14.970> little<00:02:15.120> bit<00:02:15.299> of<00:02:15.390> red<00:02:15.540> in

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
this you get nice a little bit of red in

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.110 
this you get nice a little bit of red in
there<00:02:15.870> that's<00:02:16.440> definitely<00:02:17.010> more<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.580> sand

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
there that's definitely more of a sand

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.660 
there that's definitely more of a sand
bass<00:02:18.330> looking<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.930> defeat<00:02:19.500> on<00:02:19.650> these<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.890> bait

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
bass looking the defeat on these a bait

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.080 
bass looking the defeat on these a bait
fish<00:02:21.170> so<00:02:22.170> we<00:02:22.290> just<00:02:22.470> idle<00:02:22.799> over<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.190> little<00:02:23.519> old

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
fish so we just idle over a little old

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.580 
fish so we just idle over a little old
river<00:02:24.360> channel<00:02:24.450> here<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.019> can<00:02:25.170> see<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.410> nice

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
river channel here you can see the nice

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.100 
river channel here you can see the nice
River<00:02:26.459> channel<00:02:26.849> you<00:02:26.940> can<00:02:27.060> see<00:02:27.239> how<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.420> bottom

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
River channel you can see how the bottom

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.900 
River channel you can see how the bottom
hardness<00:02:28.440> gets<00:02:28.650> nice<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:28.890> hard<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.730> then

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
hardness gets nice and hard and then

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.449 
hardness gets nice and hard and then
goes<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.180> soft<00:02:30.870> but<00:02:31.410> all<00:02:31.590> these<00:02:31.860> fish<00:02:32.130> that<00:02:32.160> are

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
goes to soft but all these fish that are
