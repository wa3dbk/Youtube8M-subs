like all army installations to be net
zero<00:01:32.210> in<00:01:32.570> energy<00:01:33.560> water<00:01:34.370> and<00:01:34.640> waste<00:01:35.320> by<00:01:36.320> about

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
zero in energy water and waste by about

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.830 
zero in energy water and waste by about
the<00:01:36.710> middle<00:01:37.070> of<00:01:37.190> the<00:01:37.280> century<00:01:37.580> so<00:01:37.970> our<00:01:38.210> goal<00:01:38.450> is

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
the middle of the century so our goal is

the middle of the century so our goal is
by<00:01:39.670> 2022<00:01:41.620> theoretically<00:01:42.620> put<00:01:43.040> no<00:01:43.520> waste<00:01:43.790> into

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210

by 2022 theoretically put no waste into
our<00:01:44.360> landfill<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:45.170> we've<00:01:45.320> actually<00:01:45.530> seen<00:01:45.950> a

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
our landfill so we've actually seen a

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.160 
our landfill so we've actually seen a
twenty<00:01:46.340> percent<00:01:46.670> reduction<00:01:46.910> in<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:48.080> amount

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
twenty percent reduction in the amount

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.810 
twenty percent reduction in the amount

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
of waste that's gone into our landfill

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.670 
of waste that's gone into our landfill
since<00:01:50.090> we<00:01:50.210> came<00:01:50.390> became<00:01:50.840> a<00:01:50.869> net<00:01:51.140> zero<00:01:51.170> waste

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
since we came became a net zero waste

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.570 
since we came became a net zero waste
pilot<00:01:52.250> that's<00:01:53.060> pretty<00:01:53.330> significant<00:01:54.369> if<00:01:55.369> they
