00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
longest time and we finally get some

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.590 
longest time and we finally get some
press<00:00:49.950> renders<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.489> device<00:00:50.789> looks<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.480> lot

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
press renders of the device looks a lot

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.660 
press renders of the device looks a lot
like<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.930> HTC<00:00:52.320> One<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.829> get<00:00:52.949> boom<00:00:53.190> sound<00:00:53.430> and

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
like the HTC One you get boom sound and

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.979 
like the HTC One you get boom sound and
everything<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.149> design<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.719> chassis

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
everything the design and the chassis

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.049 
everything the design and the chassis
look<00:00:55.289> really<00:00:55.590> good<00:00:55.770> even<00:00:56.160> though<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.730> does

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
look really good even though it does

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.389 
look really good even though it does
seem<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.360> little<00:00:57.629> affordable<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:59.129> side

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
seem a little affordable on that side

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.250 
seem a little affordable on that side
but<00:00:59.670> aside<00:01:00.059> from<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.300> we<00:01:00.510> do<00:01:00.660> get<00:01:00.809> some<00:01:00.989> beats

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
but aside from that we do get some beats

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.709 
but aside from that we do get some beats
audio<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.280> logo<00:01:02.520> at<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:02.940> bottom<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.539> it

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
audio in the logo at the bottom so it

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.990 
audio in the logo at the bottom so it
could<00:01:04.049> be<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.400> you<00:01:05.400> know<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.640> rumors<00:01:05.880> from

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.880 
could be that you know the rumors from
yesterday<00:01:06.450> were<00:01:06.570> probably<00:01:06.810> just<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.260> and

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
yesterday were probably just that and

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.710 
yesterday were probably just that and
speaking<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.520> rumors<00:01:08.880> we<00:01:09.060> finally<00:01:09.450> get<00:01:09.540> some

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
speaking of rumors we finally get some

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.289 
speaking of rumors we finally get some
photographs<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> iphone<00:01:10.799> 5c<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.549> black<00:01:11.909> or

photographs of the iphone 5c in black or
well<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.290> they<00:01:13.439> say<00:01:13.770> i<00:01:13.799> mean<00:01:14.189> if<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.400> look<00:01:14.640> at

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
well so they say i mean if you look at

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.210 
well so they say i mean if you look at
the<00:01:14.939> photo<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.600> look<00:01:15.869> closely<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.070> look

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
the photo and look closely and you look

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.770 
the photo and look closely and you look
at<00:01:17.340> all<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.549> edges<00:01:17.880> where<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> camera<00:01:18.600> goes

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
at all the edges where the camera goes

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.960 
at all the edges where the camera goes
and<00:01:18.990> everything<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.920> leak<00:01:20.189> looks<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.729> lot

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
and everything this leak looks a lot

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.240 
and everything this leak looks a lot
like<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.390> iphone<00:01:21.689> 5<00:01:22.470> with<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.710> case<00:01:23.009> that

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
like the iphone 5 with a case that

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.550 
like the iphone 5 with a case that
schnucks<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.909> well<00:01:24.180> on<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.479> device<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.170> this

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
schnucks so well on the device that this

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.920 
schnucks so well on the device that this
is<00:01:25.830> just<00:01:26.159> an<00:01:26.280> iphone<00:01:26.400> 5<00:01:26.820> with<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.030> case<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
is just an iphone 5 with a case the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.300 
is just an iphone 5 with a case the
colossi<00:01:28.409> design<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.890> back<00:01:29.100> and

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
colossi design in the back and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.069 
colossi design in the back and
everything<00:01:29.670> does<00:01:29.909> not<00:01:30.119> resemble<00:01:30.509> any<00:01:30.750> past

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
everything does not resemble any past

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.170 
everything does not resemble any past
product<00:01:31.470> obviously<00:01:31.860> not<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> iphone<00:01:32.490> 3gs<00:01:33.000> in

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
product obviously not the iphone 3gs in

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.780 
product obviously not the iphone 3gs in
any<00:01:33.299> case<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.380> does<00:01:34.560> seem<00:01:34.799> as<00:01:35.009> if<00:01:35.220> Apple<00:01:35.670> is
