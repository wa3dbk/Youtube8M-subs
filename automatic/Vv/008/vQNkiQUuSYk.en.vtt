00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 hello everyone good today 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.790
 I bring the first step of what is the 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.890
 new interest of the new dlc of 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.389
 zombies good to start let's have 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.790
 that we go this way that are 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.849
 watching in the gameplay if we are going to get 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.440
 to this place called armor and let's go 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.990
 to open the door of good I had it 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.449
 open and we are going to follow everything all all 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.550
 all the way follow the same path that 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.470
 I here this window are going to have to 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.869
 break it and all that and well and good 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.760
 will know we are going to get to this area that the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.250
 I really do not know how it's called we're going to 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.050
 find this this machine that we are 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.360
 watching below is a machine 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.059
 as luck because if you are one 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.000
 granada and this one gives you points or something like that 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.489
 but this one of this machine is important 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.980
 for what is the dlc so well then 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.870
 follow step by step or this is what I eat 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.079
 I tell you is the first step found 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.940
 of the dlc and well then since we are here 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.100
 you'll have to kill have seen is 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.559
 well I also recommend you buy 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.020
 of these teleporter grenades like this 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.940
 those that are there are right opposite 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.030
 from the machine until I told them 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.270
 there they are right opposite are these 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.619
 grenades that implemented in the tlc that 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.270
 teleports to any place and therefore 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.000
 good since the purchases are going to go 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.460
 directly to this area that you're 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.710
 seeing on screen like that to that door that 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.710
 it's closed I do not know ellipse flame you're going to 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.270
 need 1750 to unlock it you're going to 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.460
 follow all the way and you're going to get 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.649
 to this place where are these 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.799
 sharks this we are going to get to this 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.930
 area here I recommend that you already have 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.970
 well here you still will not have the exo 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.009
 because right there we go we go for the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.500
 exo in this area here and there where 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.990
 are watching is where is the former man 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.940
 they do not kill zombies because to open for 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.159
 open that door they will need 2000 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.600
 coins and let's open that door that 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.159
 It is there that can withstand are killing me 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.929
 zombies and the truth is that boring to 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.610
 do step by step but well then 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.860
 that we open this you will see that the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.009
 sex costumes are there going to require that 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.440
 active energy is as active 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.210
 you go up for your ex or all that do not look for 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.610
 example there they are killing me their is for 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.410
 your ex or so I recommend that the ex only 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.390
 you get it as fast as possible because 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.300
 here the zombies are already at the top 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.160
 let's say from the first round you come out 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.050
 many and then the map is very narrow 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.150
 good you are going to open this you are going to activate 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.300
 this cart that will come out here in the 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.610
 East door this is the one step very 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.980
 essential good everything is essential do not be 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.990
 already activates it if you kill all 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.120
 zombies that are climbing in the glass 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.340
 you are going to let me take a walk 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.160
 around and you're going to have to wait 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.770
 that he returns to his same place of destination 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.350
 that is in this in this on this occasion to 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.470
 that little door as the door opens 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.790
 you're going to throw a grenade out of that 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.980
 teleportation that you bought and it's going 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.900
 teleport to this mini area that 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.910
 is active here the energy if you want 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.489
 because I do not really know where from 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.640
 is this and we will quickly return to 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:02.430
 the to the dream area I do not know what it's called 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.500
 where there is that rare machine that 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.570
 machine that gives you points as you can see 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.910
 and in exchange those three red lights are very 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.010
 essentials I still do not discover for 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.959
 what are I researching in forums and 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.770
 well up to here the first step of 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.950

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.690
