tutorial on the intricacies of marine
moving<00:00:11.379> speed<00:00:11.740> and<00:00:12.070> how<00:00:12.849> it's<00:00:13.090> calculated<00:00:13.980> so

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
moving speed and how it's calculated so

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.620 
moving speed and how it's calculated so
let's<00:00:15.130> start<00:00:15.309> with<00:00:15.400> the<00:00:15.519> basics<00:00:15.940> light

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
let's start with the basics light

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.499

machine gun pistol acts when you're
walking<00:00:19.660> forward<00:00:20.260> with<00:00:20.439> a<00:00:20.470> light<00:00:20.680> machine<00:00:21.070> gun

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279 
walking forward with a light machine gun

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.820 
walking forward with a light machine gun
you<00:00:22.060> look<00:00:22.240> at<00:00:22.359> the<00:00:22.449> bottom<00:00:22.930> left<00:00:23.109> on<00:00:23.380> my<00:00:23.500> screen

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830 
you look at the bottom left on my screen

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.210 
you look at the bottom left on my screen
you<00:00:23.980> see<00:00:24.039> a<00:00:24.160> red<00:00:24.400> bar<00:00:24.670> says<00:00:25.029> current<00:00:25.330> speed

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
you see a red bar says current speed

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.679 
you see a red bar says current speed
5.06<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:28.449> means<00:00:28.779> my<00:00:29.109> speed<00:00:29.560> is<00:00:29.939> 5.6<00:00:30.939> when

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
5.06 that means my speed is 5.6 when

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.650 
5.06 that means my speed is 5.6 when
you're<00:00:31.840> sprinting<00:00:33.180> you're<00:00:34.180> going<00:00:34.390> to<00:00:34.480> go<00:00:34.570> up

you're sprinting you're going to go up

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.229 
you're sprinting you're going to go up
to<00:00:34.809> six<00:00:35.140> point<00:00:35.530> zero<00:00:35.830> seven<00:00:36.370> so<00:00:36.729> sprinting

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
to six point zero seven so sprinting

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.649 
to six point zero seven so sprinting
generally<00:00:37.930> adds<00:00:38.140> one<00:00:38.799> full<00:00:39.190> unit<00:00:39.610> of<00:00:39.790> speed<00:00:40.120> in

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:40.659 
generally adds one full unit of speed in

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:43.920 
generally adds one full unit of speed in

slower than the shotgun and the

nine<00:02:56.300> or<00:02:56.660> so<00:02:57.160> it's<00:02:58.160> just<00:02:58.400> nice<00:03:00.490> another<00:03:01.490> thing

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
nine or so it's just nice another thing

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.940 
nine or so it's just nice another thing

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
to note is that you're a Sprint is kind

of stored into this little bar at my

left which is invisible normal games a

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.970 
left which is invisible normal games a
lot<00:03:08.330> of<00:03:08.780> people<00:03:08.989> don't<00:03:09.200> really<00:03:09.290> understand<00:03:09.830> is

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
lot of people don't really understand is

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.240 
lot of people don't really understand is
that<00:03:10.010> you<00:03:10.310> have<00:03:10.489> a<00:03:10.520> reserve<00:03:11.239> of<00:03:11.300> sprint<00:03:11.959> and<00:03:12.250> at

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
that you have a reserve of sprint and at

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.890 
that you have a reserve of sprint and at
the<00:03:13.370> start<00:03:13.670> of<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.820> game<00:03:14.000> I<00:03:14.060> mean<00:03:14.390> you<00:03:14.510> can<00:03:14.720> go

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
the start of the game I mean you can go

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.680 
the start of the game I mean you can go
through<00:03:15.200> all<00:03:15.350> of<00:03:15.380> it<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:16.060> pretty<00:03:17.060> much<00:03:17.120> sprint

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
through all of it and pretty much sprint

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.300 
through all of it and pretty much sprint
like<00:03:17.780> halfway<00:03:18.230> across<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:18.770> map<00:03:19.840> but<00:03:21.310> once

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
like halfway across the map but once

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.560 
like halfway across the map but once
that<00:03:22.520> depletes<00:03:24.910> it<00:03:25.910> takes<00:03:26.150> a<00:03:26.239> while<00:03:26.360> to

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
that depletes it takes a while to

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.490 
that depletes it takes a while to
recharge<00:03:26.720> now<00:03:27.320> like<00:03:27.680> you<00:03:28.610> can<00:03:28.970> sprint<00:03:29.600> before

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
recharge now like you can sprint before

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.760 
recharge now like you can sprint before
it's<00:03:30.739> full<00:03:31.160> but<00:03:31.430> it's<00:03:32.330> just<00:03:32.540> gonna<00:03:32.780> complete

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
it's full but it's just gonna complete

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.520 
it's full but it's just gonna complete
faster<00:03:34.310> so<00:03:34.580> the<00:03:34.700> longer<00:03:34.940> you<00:03:35.300> rest<00:03:35.630> the<00:03:36.140> longer

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
faster so the longer you rest the longer

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.229 
faster so the longer you rest the longer
you<00:03:36.560> can<00:03:36.830> sprint<00:03:37.780> afterwards<00:03:39.640> and<00:03:40.640> that's

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
you can sprint afterwards and that's

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.990 
you can sprint afterwards and that's
pretty<00:03:41.480> much<00:03:41.600> it<00:03:41.750> so<00:03:42.350> i'll<00:03:43.310> probably<00:03:43.550> make<00:03:43.820> an

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
pretty much it so i'll probably make an

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.780 
pretty much it so i'll probably make an
alien<00:03:44.540> one<00:03:44.690> of<00:03:44.780> these<00:03:44.959> later<00:03:45.350> but<00:03:46.220> i<00:03:46.250> feel<00:03:46.610> like

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
alien one of these later but i feel like

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.130 
alien one of these later but i feel like
it

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
it

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.440 
it
and<00:03:49.030> pretty<00:03:50.030> much<00:03:50.120> all<00:03:50.720> there<00:03:50.990> is<00:03:51.170> to<00:03:51.410> it
