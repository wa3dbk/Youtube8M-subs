00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.530
 my job means everything i am to me 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.900
 i am passionate about dog physiotherapy 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.610
 I grew up with dogs then 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.320
 the first state examination for 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.880
 physiotherapist made later then 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.530
 the extension to dogs physio and 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.850
 dogs are just my life that makes 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.770
 just totally fun with the too 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.510
 work 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.940
 Today Miriam Knauer works with Knut 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.589
 fuchs, more precisely, with his sport 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.420
 and that's why the bath has 

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:36.789
 Württemberger also summarily her 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.719
 practice laid outside on 100 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:39.719
 place in sulingen 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.760
 which is a sport performed in the ipo 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.519
 and with that we will be a bit 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.379
 the construction then will train there and 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.850
 after that it is cool down the very important 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.840
 listen and come back down with it 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.340
 the pollutants better 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.720
 be removed and that he 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.680
 again, that little bit of muscle 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.150
 can relax 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.130
 I do it with the dog 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.630
 presentation so to prevent it 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.670
 just not so fast anyway 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.430
 always what is he broke just so 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.540
 you reduce the risk of injury back 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.220
 for my dog ​​is the hurricane 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.290
 I bred that myself 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.210
 Belgian Shepherd is now in the 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.790
 april five years 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.530
 I am now leading the second worry now 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.530
 in eight weeks with him for the second time 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.250
 on the world championship and 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.720
 I have decided to race 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.950
 because the very athletic are very active 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.950
 very lively round 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.400
 So should the cabaret 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.610
 training is now the specific one 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.810
 warm up for the abo animal work and 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.670
 Although he wants to retrieve it later 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.320
 over the one meter hurdles and over the 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.490
 Doing work and just about there 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.070
 the right muscles for it 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.690
 warm up left here first 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.310
 bit lower but that he still does 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.170
 ever come in springer 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.790
 that is very important that specific 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.130
 depending on what trained and warmed up 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.690
 becomes 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.220
 next to the cavalry work stand for 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.150
 Hurricane on ten players on the 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.470
 training plan 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.630
 These exercises will be the 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.440
 neck muscles on and promote their 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.900
 circulation 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.850
 but that's not all 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.530
 the necessary fitness stands with his 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.180
 reign daily cycling 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.830
 swim and go for a walk on the 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.780
 program before the training for this 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.240
 But the day really starts 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.240
 orkans muscles have been massaged before 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.500
 fast massage grips around the muscles 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.690
 better to circulate something 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.140
 stimulate up to the muscle tension too 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.140
 increase 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.060
 and is of course an optimal one 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.190
 Preparation was my competition to go 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.780
 their athletes will be on and before 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.240
 massaging muscles and that's up to him 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.340
 a lot has to be down too 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.480
 move four walls of the will becomes strong 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.470
 burdened twisting also 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.720
 sometimes a bit unnatural 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.060
 So maybe continue in a normal 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.640
 nature's movement he would not do 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.890
 and yes it needs a care like 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.070
 every athlete also and therefore do 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.120
 I live the best possible 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.430
 to give along and the best possible on the 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:26.150
 competition prepare trainings moderately 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:29.260
 of course, but also physically 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.260
 pleases the muslims pleasant 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.150
 OK 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.489
 now the submission training begins 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.549
 and hurricane can finally show what's in it 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.549
 plugged 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.459
 the 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.730
 Last year I was with him already 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.220
 first time at the world championship though 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.140
 He was the first one where the dog was 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.700
 leads and up to the lady right with me 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.030
 recorded together on the competition 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.740
 are 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.170
 there took times a season and therefore 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:22.480
 i think that this year now 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.480
 really professional 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.710
 after a hard workout 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.300
 really deserve a break 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.070
 and as with other professional 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.840
 athletes start now for the 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:51.480
 Belgian Shepherd finally the 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:52.920
 relaxing the cool down heat 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.340
 directly to the muscles now 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:05:01.010
 relaxes the cool down takes around 20 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.010
 minutes the hurricane visibly enjoys 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.199
 that's just massage sticks that 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.030
 just relieves a bit of my 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:17.000
 own fingers when he is strong for 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.540
 exciting as here right now at 140 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.010
 work 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.960
 they have a lot to do with this 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.970
 muscles work and tends to 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.780
 that 's always a bit of an increase 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:29.150
 I also have to be very nervous 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.580
 Watch Dog smoke in the video Yes 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.250
 how is he behaving from behavior? 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.380
 quiet then i can do it pretty fast 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.060
 put him aside and pay attention 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.139
 he wants to face bristled more 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.360
 I have to slow down a bit 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:43.100
 Just take a little bit of time often 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.360
 Then lie down by yourself 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.250
 I have to pay attention, of course 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.419
 if anything is up to date was one 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.470
 injury something he has pain 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:52.760
 displayed is a dog handler something 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.260
 so these are things that are noticed 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.260
 must always be clarified beforehand 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.150
 To celebrate the end is with you in my Knaur 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.300
 after the cross, a joint is more accurate 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.430
 said take the elisa cry directed that 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:19.720
 It's pretty much the sport friends 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:20.440
 blocked there I always go around it 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.360
 to relax 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.650
 this then drops the jump and 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.420
 everything easier 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:30.610
 To finish off a stroke and 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.300
 then it managed all blockades 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.850
 solved 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.650
 now lets loose home and forget 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.300
 Of course, do not join in quickly 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.810
 his dog physiotherapist too 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.810
 thoughts 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:50.770
 as a replacement ready until the next ob 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.200
 a pleasant and exhausting workout 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.890
 Arbeitstag is coming to an end and not 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.890
 only for hurricane
