00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
about is the addition of wicket ood

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.680 
about is the addition of wicket ood
directly<00:05:23.070> on<00:05:23.160> the<00:05:23.220> u.s.<00:05:23.400> of<00:05:23.580> them<00:05:23.700> so<00:05:24.390> now

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
directly on the u.s. of them so now

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:25.880 
directly on the u.s. of them so now
you've<00:05:24.810> got<00:05:24.900> a<00:05:24.930> really<00:05:25.200> high<00:05:25.410> performing

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.500 
you've got a really high performing
browser<00:05:26.100> we<00:05:26.370> can<00:05:26.520> overlay<00:05:27.030> this<00:05:27.210> with<00:05:27.419> the

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
browser we can overlay this with the

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.510 
browser we can overlay this with the
wicket<00:05:27.780> ood<00:05:27.900> capabilities<00:05:28.530> and<00:05:28.919> as<00:05:29.370> I<00:05:29.460> said

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
wicket ood capabilities and as I said

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.400 
wicket ood capabilities and as I said
before<00:05:29.669> we're<00:05:30.180> trying<00:05:30.390> to<00:05:30.480> make<00:05:30.600> apps<00:05:30.840> social

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
before we're trying to make apps social

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.320 
before we're trying to make apps social
so<00:05:32.100> we've<00:05:32.220> made<00:05:32.250> a<00:05:32.400> much<00:05:32.669> deeper<00:05:32.910> integration

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
so we've made a much deeper integration

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.510 
so we've made a much deeper integration
of<00:05:33.660> BBM<00:05:34.050> into<00:05:34.320> wicca<00:05:34.500> tude<00:05:34.770> so<00:05:35.280> you<00:05:35.370> can

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
of BBM into wicca tude so you can

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.280 
of BBM into wicca tude so you can
