00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.710
 friends farmer me farmer hello 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.359
 welcome to the farm welcome to 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.670
 octave and today I present to you 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.429
 a complete watercooling kit 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.219
 last max which is called the lc 120 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.399
 then it is presented here in t version 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.840
 ace 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.610
 that is to say, it will have pretty 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.890
 fan shining brightly 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.079
 it also exists in TV version with 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.510
 opal fans no longer work but 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.520
 all black so what interests us 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.170
 it's a small precision interior by 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.120
 against it is the first of a long 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.250
 jonas series had a few so I'm going 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.620
 try to present them to you 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.170
 maybe a little bit endless series 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.230
 but that's how we do not manage 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.539
 arrivals then in any case forgiveness 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.390
 you see I'm sick in everything 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.200
 case inside the box 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.659
 we have a classic editing guide 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.479
 it will look good how come 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:17.670
 sells a small box inside 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.619
 which we will find the claws 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.210
 mounting which have greatly simplified 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.610
 the Aztec range 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.509
 it was a bit complicated at first but 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.520
 uh I dropped something the 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.090
 blake waves according to different 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.979
 socket 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.090
 so what I dropped a priori 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:39.540
 I tell you these are skates in 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.939
 moss certainly for them 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.939
 fans so nothing and a 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.390
 second there in order to handle the 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:51.119
 vibrations the fans in question 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.820
 so enermax opal translucent rather 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.470
 nice it changes us traditional 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.049
 fan all black and sometimes the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.290
 rough finish a frame then 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:06.210
 lacquered with a soft frame interior 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:08.819
 badges and enermax and at the back small 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.739
 internal small technical interest 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.510
 I do not know if you 'll see it 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.879
 but in any case we can 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.799
 physically limited the speed of 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.019
 rotation of the fans ie 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.819
 that on the day not limit to screw without 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.879
 end not at 800 precisely but at 1500 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:27.239
 maximum starting from 800 on the purple 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:29.790
 800 to 1800 maximum and on the red 800 to 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.920
 2200 maximum it is rather a 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.620
 good idea for silence so tempted that 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.260
 so this is a second since we 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:43.379
 are on a kit that offers two 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.970
 fans here a 3-1 molex to 3 pin 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:50.519
 to power the fans 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:52.500
 precisely I know is the spirit and 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.440
 it was pretty much all sorry 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.819
 find that there is no paste 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.700
 thermal what was a little lack 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:03.209
 a case we can go to the kit to 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.799
 properly speaking I'm going to push the 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.099
 box who are not keeping them very far 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:10.290
 since the technical information that 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.599
 are what I will give you after so 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.780
 under a protective cabochon we 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:18.870
 have the copper maze with the small and 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.989
 pathÃ© of the thermal that's why 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:26.010
 that there is no pasta sipa then 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:28.410
 so a black plastic cabochon but jen 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.760
 ermax in white as you see I 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.340
 am a little bit in trouble with the 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.230
 pipes that you have guessed rigid 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.470
 so I push back I push back what I 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.750
 search by words we are a little bit 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.459
 on the ancient Aztec knowing that 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.199
 enermax announces we have 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.639
 reworked the mas with several of 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:50.160
 students thinner so as to have a 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:52.769
 better dissipation surface of 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.680
 dissipation distribution forgiveness of the 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:58.049
 heat then little thing that 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.690
 I enjoy moderately at enermax on 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.579
 is powered by a 3 pin that a priori 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.549
 we are there I am a little annoyed with everything 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:10.049
 it comes to feed fans in 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:12.540
 pwm not even one until then we 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:16.019
 have 1 3 batteries without removing the m 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.090
 we are little or 100w so here well 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.729
 sure set it goes back a bit long at 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.550
 camera set with origins pipes 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:26.099
 gainer of a resort is due 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.409
 layers of black plastic we arrive on 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:31.560
 a radiator of 120 all that is more 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:34.319
 classic not very broad finally by 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.550
 report in comparison with a 920 in 920 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:37.409
 is significantly wider for two 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.349
 fans so here we are on some 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:42.289
 pretty late thing may be expected to be 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:44.729
 mounted with two fans 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:46.560
 I think I did the trick that then I 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.379
 you learn from those she 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.360
 his 120 I close the box for the 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:52.620
 return 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.240
 so we have some 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:59.310
 fans is playing the ten that go from 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:04.469
 800 to 1500 1800 or 2200 rpm that 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:08.360
 the air flow is 33.3 up to 92.9 in 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:10.169
 function of the rotational speed that 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.349
 life expectancy by name of 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.479
 fans and 200 thousand hours not 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:17.370
 a lot more than just 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:21.199
 is compatible all the socks of 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:25.050
 775 until 2011 and from m2 to fm1 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:27.270
 that the pump has a bearing 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.430
 ceramic ball that is planned 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.289
 for 50000 hours and I think I did 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.389
 this time the complete turn of all 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:35.009
 the technical information and I you 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.639
 invite to come read the written test on 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.319
 Cowcotland 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:40.400
 see you soon and I wish you a 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:40.400
 good day and goodbye
