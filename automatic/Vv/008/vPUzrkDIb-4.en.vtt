00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
avalanche crash and it would crash down

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.929 
avalanche crash and it would crash down
we'd<00:01:40.470> go<00:01:40.619> outside<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.070> we'd<00:01:41.159> be<00:01:41.310> like<00:01:41.490> oh<00:01:41.670> my

today<00:02:07.490> energy<00:02:08.000> efficiency<00:02:08.630> programs<00:02:09.229> are

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
today energy efficiency programs are

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.440 
today energy efficiency programs are
very<00:02:09.590> important<00:02:10.220> with<00:02:10.399> a<00:02:10.429> hot<00:02:10.700> edge<00:02:10.880> system

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
very important with a hot edge system

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.630 
very important with a hot edge system
it's<00:02:11.630> not<00:02:11.930> only<00:02:12.290> saves<00:02:12.680> money<00:02:12.980> but<00:02:13.250> it<00:02:13.400> saves
