00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.880
 water is very important for us is 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.440
 very important and vital 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.080
 we are doing with the very phase 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.179
 The lack of water in S찾o Paulo is difficult. 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.770
 people we did not need to be 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.609
 going through this because there is a lot of water 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.770

 We discuss but this is a young genius 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.610
 It is a Brazilian example, here he is the son 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.710
 his proc처pio that they did them 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.490

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.289
 any moment whatsoever which is not the 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.700
 result of what would be done in the 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.530
 The river itself was once made in the river. 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.640
 including pine river and the other on 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.710

 This before the pollution falls into the cool river 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.079
 already clean water falls on the river ahead of now 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.430
 Maybe now you start doing this. 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.840
 work we did not leave more 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.180

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.100
 government two games that evolved in 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.989
 The truth is already beginning to fall into the water. 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.120

 is being brought to the surface to 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.260
 clean water is underneath to appear to come out 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:18.100
