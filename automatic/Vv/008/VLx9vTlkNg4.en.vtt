00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:12.039
 but now only 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.440
 arozarena 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.720
 of two types 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.180
 the fluorine colors 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.760
 and the matter colors 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.550
 are produced by light 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.430
 she's alone 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.930
 hobart and ficia 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.460
 light colors 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.590
 in him as primary alderete red and blue 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.469
 these primary colors 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:15.200
 results in white color 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.799
 and it is that he will love also 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.690
 tiquina mixture 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.200
 this system is also called the rgb system 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.350
 of their names in English 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.789
 and we find it in common type devices 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:30.190
 as televisions laptops 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.560
 monitors video players video projectors 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.810
 videogames 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.810
 must of laptops 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.070
 among others 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.830
 the color contrast itself is the simplest of the seven contrasts 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:04.810
 of colors 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.999
 does not require great effort to the vision 

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:11.079
 because to represent it you can use any pure and luminous color 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.609
 the yellow the red and the blue 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:19.259
 are the strongest expressions of the color contrast itself for 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:23.889
 represent that contrast we need at least three colors clearly 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:25.109
 differentiated 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:28.570
 the strength of the expression of the color contrast in itself 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.070
 decreases as the colors used move away from the three 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.349
 primary colors 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.169
 A) Yes 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:38.619
 the character of the oranges or the green of the planet 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:41.939
 it is less marked than the yellow of red and blue 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:46.849
 the effect of tertiary colors this would give less striking 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:58.059
 the group and the black are the strongest means of expression 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:03.829
 they are opposites and among their successes does not extend in all shades of gray and 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.829
 of the rest of the colors 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.079
 is related to the temperature sensation that the dram causes in the 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:25.969
 brain 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:30.309
 the colors can be classified as warm or cold according to their location 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:32.519
 in the chromatic circle 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.640
 To achieve this contrast at least three colors are used 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:39.790
 consecutive oo in combination with assumptions 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.919
 the orange red is the hottest color while the greenish blue is 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.919
 the coldest color 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.049
 is the most used contrast effect 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.729
 two complementary colors are those that offer together better possibilities of 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:02.819
 contrast 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.269
 they oppose each other and demanded their reciprocal presence 

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:11.369
 provide the most vivid contrasts alex appointment according to the other 

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:15.009
 they seem to move when they occupy surfaces of equal proportions 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.990
 phenomenon by which the eye for a given color simultaneously demands the 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.159
 complementary color and if you do not find it produces it 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:35.159
 it is a colored impression that there is no reality 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:40.710
 each color tries to push to or the other so its complementary and both lose 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.789
 its character and true and breath new effects 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.259
 is based on the degree of purity concentration 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.130
 is the position in which a bright and saturated color and another one paid and without 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.689
 radiance 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:00.689
 you can disturb a color 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:02.210
 in four ways 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.610
 the first one with white color 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.090
 the second in the world and black 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.259
 third 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:12.399
 adding gray and the fourth combining it with a complement 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.009
 relationship of that size on the surface colony 

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:30.909
 is a relationship based on the maximum equilibrium egg 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:34.669
 in such a way that no color in a preponderance over a 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.059
 two factors determine the strength of expression of a color 

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:40.319
 your city payroll 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:42.210
 and the size of the stain 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.499
 it is a contrast of proportions
