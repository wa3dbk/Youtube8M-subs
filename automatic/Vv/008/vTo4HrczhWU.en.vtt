Torres so this is the locations of the
command<00:00:25.170> centers<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.680> command<00:00:25.920> posts<00:00:26.220> i've

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
command centers and command posts i've

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.620 
command centers and command posts i've
highlighted<00:00:26.490> them<00:00:26.970> in<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.180> annotations

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
highlighted them in the annotations

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.480 
highlighted them in the annotations
there<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.320> you're<00:00:28.410> going<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.590> need<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.980> buy<00:00:29.220> all

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
there so you're going to need to buy all

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.999 
there so you're going to need to buy all
four<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.480> command<00:00:30.750> posts<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.349> all<00:00:31.800> four

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
four of the command posts and all four

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.799 
four of the command posts and all four
of<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.160> command<00:00:32.399> centers<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:33.450> that's<00:00:33.630> why<00:00:33.780> we

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
of the command centers so that's why we

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.720 
of the command centers so that's why we
needed<00:00:34.110> quite<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> bit<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.590> money<00:00:34.620> that's<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
needed quite a bit of money that's the

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.979 
needed quite a bit of money that's the
first<00:00:35.940> step<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.540> don't<00:00:36.719> have<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.870> do<00:00:36.960> that

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
first step so you don't have to do that

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.510 
first step so you don't have to do that
in<00:00:37.200> any<00:00:37.290> particular<00:00:37.500> order<00:00:37.770> but<00:00:38.160> obviously

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
in any particular order but obviously

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.459 
in any particular order but obviously
the<00:00:38.670> command<00:00:38.969> posts<00:00:39.390> increase<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.230> price

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
the command posts increase in price

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.260 
the command posts increase in price
every<00:00:40.860> single<00:00:41.100> time<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.250> buy<00:00:41.489> one<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:42.180> you

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
every single time you buy one so you

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.130 
every single time you buy one so you
might<00:00:42.390> need<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.570> pull<00:00:42.750> your<00:00:42.840> money<00:00:42.989> together

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140

just going to give someone else some of
my<00:01:14.909> money<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.570> can<00:01:15.780> pull<00:01:16.590> our<00:01:16.650> money

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:17.929 
my money so that we can pull our money
together<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.100> buy<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.340> as<00:01:17.580> quickly<00:01:17.820> as

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
possible yet right so i think that's the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.649 
possible yet right so i think that's the
last<00:01:22.470> command<00:01:22.830> post<00:01:23.040> bot<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.549> what<00:01:24.509> i'm<00:01:24.570> going

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
last command post bot and what i'm going

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.880 
last command post bot and what i'm going
to<00:01:24.720> do<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:24.900> just<00:01:25.140> go<00:01:25.380> up<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.650> top<00:01:25.830> here

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
to do is just go up to the top here

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.920 
to do is just go up to the top here
where<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.909> command<00:01:27.180> center<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.810> then

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
where the command center is and then

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.660 
where the command center is and then
that<00:01:28.170> should<00:01:28.350> be<00:01:28.500> all<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.070> requirements

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
that should be all of the requirements

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.700 
that should be all of the requirements
for<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.150> first<00:01:30.390> stage<00:01:30.600> complete<00:01:31.049> that's

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
for the first stage complete that's

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.560 
for the first stage complete that's
again<00:01:32.189> that's<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.640> for<00:01:32.820> command<00:01:33.119> post<00:01:33.299> and

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
again that's the for command post and

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.590 
again that's the for command post and
the<00:01:33.720> for<00:01:33.869> command<00:01:34.170> centers<00:01:35.000> so<00:01:36.000> now<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.210> can

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
the for command centers so now you can

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.450 
the for command centers so now you can
see<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:37.020> what<00:01:37.380> was<00:01:37.740> here<00:01:37.920> before<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
see that what was here before the

pause the video here if you want I've
annotated<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.710> potential<00:01:50.340> locations<00:01:50.820> of

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
annotated the potential locations of

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.999 
annotated the potential locations of
each<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.450> six<00:01:51.720> items<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.470> map<00:01:52.619> but

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
each of the six items on the map but

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.410 
each of the six items on the map but
what<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.250> have<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.490> remember<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:54.000> they<00:01:54.299> only

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
what you have to remember is they only

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.149 
what you have to remember is they only
appear<00:01:54.720> at<00:01:54.810> them<00:01:54.930> up<00:01:55.049> one<00:01:55.380> at<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.560> time<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.009> they

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
appear at them up one at a time and they

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.920 
appear at them up one at a time and they
don't<00:01:56.280> appear<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:56.850> any<00:01:56.939> specific<00:01:57.180> order<00:01:57.750> so

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
don't appear in any specific order so

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.450 
don't appear in any specific order so
they<00:01:58.049> might<00:01:58.140> not<00:01:58.290> be<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.829> same<00:01:59.009> order<00:01:59.310> as

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
they might not be in the same order as

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.399 
they might not be in the same order as
they<00:01:59.880> are<00:01:59.939> on<00:02:00.030> my<00:02:00.060> video<00:02:00.390> here<00:02:00.630> for<00:02:01.110> me<00:02:01.229> the

first one happened to be this one on the
shipwreck<00:02:03.119> in<00:02:03.479> this<00:02:03.689> porthole<00:02:04.020> but<00:02:04.619> view<00:02:04.799> it

shipwreck in this porthole but view it
could<00:02:05.070> be<00:02:05.159> any<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.520> six<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.000> they<00:02:06.630> only

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
could be any of the six and they only

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.880 
could be any of the six and they only
appear<00:02:06.990> one<00:02:07.140> at<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.290> time<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.680> want<00:02:07.799> to

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
appear one at a time so I want to

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.859 
appear one at a time so I want to
destroy<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.310> one<00:02:08.520> like<00:02:09.060> now<00:02:09.420> it's<00:02:09.690> been

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
destroy this one like now it's been

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.059 
destroy this one like now it's been
destroyed<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.349> have<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.619> use<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.739> sniper

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
destroyed and you have to use a sniper

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.860 
destroyed and you have to use a sniper
by<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.370> way<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:12.120> I've<00:02:12.330> destroyed<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.720> with<00:02:12.810> a

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
by the way so I've destroyed it with a

by the way so I've destroyed it with a
sniper

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
sniper

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.350 
sniper
there<00:02:13.920> will<00:02:14.040> be<00:02:14.160> another<00:02:14.310> one<00:02:14.460> on<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.580> map<00:02:14.790> so

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
there will be another one on the map so

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.910 
there will be another one on the map so
after<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.600> lot<00:02:15.660> of<00:02:15.750> searching<00:02:15.960> I<00:02:16.380> found<00:02:16.440> that

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
after a lot of searching I found that

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.850 
after a lot of searching I found that
it's<00:02:17.070> this<00:02:17.220> one<00:02:17.430> here<00:02:17.930> it's<00:02:18.930> this<00:02:19.140> kind<00:02:19.710> of

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
it's this one here it's this kind of

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.920 
it's this one here it's this kind of
pink<00:02:20.400> flower<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:21.000> it's<00:02:21.090> over<00:02:21.240> by<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.450> statute

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
pink flower and it's over by the statute

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.080 
pink flower and it's over by the statute
spawn<00:02:22.230> but<00:02:22.740> again<00:02:23.040> they<00:02:23.760> don't<00:02:23.940> necessarily

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
spawn but again they don't necessarily

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.690 
spawn but again they don't necessarily
follow<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.660> same<00:02:24.810> order<00:02:25.080> for<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.430> so<00:02:26.430> if<00:02:26.640> you

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
follow the same order for you so if you

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.100 
follow the same order for you so if you
just<00:02:26.820> look<00:02:27.060> at<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.240> locations<00:02:27.720> if<00:02:27.870> way<00:02:27.990> each

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
just look at the locations if way each

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.200 
just look at the locations if way each
one<00:02:28.290> of<00:02:28.320> these<00:02:28.470> things<00:02:28.710> is<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.970> then<00:02:30.090> you'll

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
one of these things is and then you'll

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.580 
one of these things is and then you'll
have<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.480> do<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.600> bit<00:02:30.750> of<00:02:30.780> exploring<00:02:31.140> yourself

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
have to do a bit of exploring yourself

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.740 
have to do a bit of exploring yourself
so<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.730> next<00:02:32.850> one<00:02:32.940> for<00:02:33.180> me<00:02:33.270> was<00:02:33.420> just<00:02:33.570> unveiled

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
so the next one for me was just unveiled

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.870 
so the next one for me was just unveiled
plaque<00:02:35.660> kind<00:02:36.660> of<00:02:36.780> by<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.230> foot<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:37.800> kind<00:02:38.790> of

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
plaque kind of by the foot is kind of

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.830 
plaque kind of by the foot is kind of
you<00:02:39.030> can<00:02:39.150> see<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.360> from<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.540> same<00:02:39.720> location

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
you can see it from the same location

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.240 
you can see it from the same location
you<00:02:40.230> could<00:02:40.350> see<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.650> one<00:02:40.860> on<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.040> shipwreck

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
you could see that one on the shipwreck

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.310 
you could see that one on the shipwreck

I<00:02:48.420> think<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:48.930> some<00:02:49.470> war<00:02:49.770> medals<00:02:50.090> so<00:02:51.090> again<00:02:51.300> hit

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
I think and some war medals so again hit

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.170 
I think and some war medals so again hit
out<00:02:51.930> with<00:02:52.020> a<00:02:52.080> snapshot<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.610> one<00:02:53.760> disappears

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
out with a snapshot and I one disappears

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.180 
out with a snapshot and I one disappears
the<00:02:54.930> next<00:02:55.170> one<00:02:55.290> for<00:02:55.320> me<00:02:55.560> was<00:02:55.770> overhearing

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
the next one for me was overhearing

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.190 
the next one for me was overhearing
clock<00:02:56.550> tower<00:02:56.790> by<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.090> command<00:02:57.540> post<00:02:57.750> it's

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
clock tower by the command post it's

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.990 
clock tower by the command post it's
come<00:02:58.530> Carmine's<00:02:59.160> helmet<00:02:59.460> it's<00:02:59.580> being<00:02:59.760> caught

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
come Carmine's helmet it's being caught

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.950 
come Carmine's helmet it's being caught
in<00:03:00.180> those<00:03:00.360> cogs<00:03:00.780> there<00:03:01.700> so<00:03:02.700> shoot<00:03:03.600> that<00:03:03.780> all<00:03:03.900> me

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
in those cogs there so shoot that all me

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.150 
in those cogs there so shoot that all me
the<00:03:04.050> snapshot<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:04.530> I<00:03:04.590> think<00:03:04.770> I've<00:03:04.860> only<00:03:05.010> got

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
the snapshot and I think I've only got

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.610 
the snapshot and I think I've only got
one<00:03:05.190> left<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:05.880> for<00:03:06.870> me<00:03:06.960> the<00:03:07.080> last<00:03:07.170> one<00:03:07.380> is<00:03:07.500> the

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
one left and for me the last one is the

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.440 
one left and for me the last one is the
book<00:03:07.800> which<00:03:08.010> appears<00:03:08.370> in<00:03:08.700> this<00:03:09.150> middle

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
book which appears in this middle

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.750 
book which appears in this middle
section<00:03:09.570> by<00:03:10.020> grenades<00:03:10.350> on<00:03:10.710> this<00:03:10.920> statue<00:03:11.280> and

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
section by grenades on this statue and

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.850 
section by grenades on this statue and
so<00:03:12.720> I've<00:03:12.840> shot<00:03:13.080> that<00:03:13.230> with<00:03:13.350> a<00:03:13.380> snipe<00:03:13.620> and

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
so I've shot that with a snipe and

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.340 
so I've shot that with a snipe and
that's<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.060> six<00:03:15.270> items<00:03:15.450> shot<00:03:15.840> so<00:03:16.080> now<00:03:16.200> what

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
that's the six items shot so now what

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.320 
that's the six items shot so now what
I'm<00:03:16.410> highlighting<00:03:16.710> at<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.460> locations<00:03:18.000> of<00:03:18.180> the

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
I'm highlighting at the locations of the

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.790 
I'm highlighting at the locations of the
Leviathan<00:03:18.780> tentacles<00:03:19.260> which<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:19.650> have<00:03:19.770> to

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
Leviathan tentacles which you have to

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.880 
Leviathan tentacles which you have to
shoot<00:03:20.239> and<00:03:21.239> there<00:03:21.989> is<00:03:22.110> some<00:03:22.350> kind<00:03:22.560> of<00:03:22.650> time

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
shoot and there is some kind of time

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.229 
shoot and there is some kind of time
limit<00:03:23.160> I'm<00:03:23.250> not<00:03:23.400> sure<00:03:23.520> whether<00:03:23.700> it's<00:03:23.880> when<00:03:24.150> the

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
limit I'm not sure whether it's when the

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.570 
limit I'm not sure whether it's when the
wave<00:03:24.420> ends<00:03:24.750> but<00:03:25.260> once<00:03:25.709> for<00:03:25.890> me<00:03:25.920> we<00:03:26.370> didn't

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
wave ends but once for me we didn't

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.880 
wave ends but once for me we didn't
shoot<00:03:26.700> in<00:03:26.970> time<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.450> they<00:03:28.170> stopped<00:03:28.560> appearing

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
shoot in time and they stopped appearing

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.250 
shoot in time and they stopped appearing
so<00:03:29.700> you<00:03:30.120> do<00:03:30.239> after<00:03:30.510> shoot<00:03:30.660> Legion<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.050> makes

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
so you do after shoot Legion it makes

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.290 
so you do after shoot Legion it makes
makes<00:03:31.860> a<00:03:31.950> lot<00:03:32.070> of<00:03:32.100> sense<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.430> start<00:03:32.670> over<00:03:32.910> on

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
makes a lot of sense to start over on

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.540 
makes a lot of sense to start over on
the<00:03:33.720> on<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.290> garden<00:03:34.620> spawn<00:03:34.920> side<00:03:35.160> because<00:03:35.459> you

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
the on the garden spawn side because you

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.580 
the on the garden spawn side because you
can<00:03:35.670> see<00:03:35.820> two<00:03:36.030> of<00:03:36.060> them<00:03:36.300> one<00:03:36.989> out<00:03:37.140> but<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.440> back

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
can see two of them one out but the back

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.870 
can see two of them one out but the back
there<00:03:37.800> and<00:03:37.980> then<00:03:38.100> one<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.550> left<00:03:38.670> of<00:03:38.820> that

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
there and then one to the left of that

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.910 
there and then one to the left of that
one<00:03:39.150> they<00:03:39.720> appear<00:03:40.020> just<00:03:40.200> over<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.530> top<00:03:40.590> of<00:03:40.739> the

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
one they appear just over the top of the

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.470 
one they appear just over the top of the
waterfalls<00:03:41.340> they<00:03:41.550> kind<00:03:41.730> of<00:03:41.760> poke<00:03:42.030> out<00:03:42.239> and

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
waterfalls they kind of poke out and

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.199 
waterfalls they kind of poke out and
walk<00:03:42.989> around<00:03:43.020> and<00:03:43.530> it<00:03:44.130> I<00:03:44.400> did<00:03:44.670> try<00:03:44.820> sniping

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
walk around and it I did try sniping

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.699 
walk around and it I did try sniping
them<00:03:45.330> but<00:03:45.630> it's<00:03:45.810> much<00:03:46.110> easier<00:03:46.140> to<00:03:46.440> just

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
them but it's much easier to just

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:47.930 
them but it's much easier to just
especially<00:03:46.980> if<00:03:47.190> you've<00:03:47.280> got<00:03:47.430> active<00:03:47.640> reload

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
especially if you've got active reload

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.449 
especially if you've got active reload
and<00:03:48.260> just<00:03:49.260> launched<00:03:49.650> them<00:03:49.860> down<00:03:50.010> or<00:03:50.220> with<00:03:50.400> your

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
and just launched them down or with your

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.680 
and just launched them down or with your
hammer<00:03:50.610> burst<00:03:50.850> or<00:03:51.000> whatever<00:03:51.180> rifle<00:03:51.480> you<00:03:51.570> have

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
hammer burst or whatever rifle you have

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.350 
hammer burst or whatever rifle you have
so<00:03:52.470> I've<00:03:52.650> got<00:03:52.830> those<00:03:53.010> two<00:03:53.250> over<00:03:53.850> in<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.090> garden

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
so I've got those two over in the garden

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.729 
so I've got those two over in the garden
spawn<00:03:54.600> and<00:03:54.780> now<00:03:54.870> what<00:03:55.320> you<00:03:55.380> have<00:03:55.470> to<00:03:55.560> do<00:03:55.650> is

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
spawn and now what you have to do is

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.680 
spawn and now what you have to do is
sprint<00:03:56.040> over<00:03:56.190> to<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.400> statue<00:03:56.640> spawn<00:03:57.090> I'm

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
sprint over to the statue spawn I'm

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.479 
sprint over to the statue spawn I'm
being<00:03:57.900> as<00:03:57.989> quick<00:03:58.170> second<00:03:58.470> just<00:03:58.800> because<00:03:59.100> of

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
being as quick second just because of

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.449 
being as quick second just because of
the<00:03:59.550> time<00:03:59.790> that<00:03:59.970> I<00:04:00.000> failed<00:04:01.010> but<00:04:02.010> I<00:04:02.070> don't<00:04:02.310> think

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
the time that I failed but I don't think

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.460 
the time that I failed but I don't think
you<00:04:02.880> have<00:04:03.030> to<00:04:03.150> be<00:04:03.180> this<00:04:03.360> quick<00:04:03.540> maybe<00:04:04.200> it's<00:04:04.380> the

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
you have to be this quick maybe it's the

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.630 
you have to be this quick maybe it's the
end<00:04:04.590> of<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.770> wave<00:04:04.890> i'm<00:04:05.040> not<00:04:05.160> sure<00:04:05.310> i<00:04:05.340> didn't

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
end of the wave i'm not sure i didn't

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.260 
end of the wave i'm not sure i didn't
try<00:04:05.760> out<00:04:05.940> but<00:04:07.400> yeah<00:04:08.400> so<00:04:08.580> it's<00:04:08.730> up<00:04:08.910> here<00:04:09.120> and

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
try out but yeah so it's up here and

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.729 
try out but yeah so it's up here and
again<00:04:09.450> it's<00:04:09.660> above<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.930> waterfall<00:04:10.200> same<00:04:10.590> as

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
again it's above the waterfall same as

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.410 
again it's above the waterfall same as
the<00:04:10.800> other<00:04:10.950> two<00:04:11.100> you<00:04:11.610> can<00:04:11.760> just<00:04:11.970> see<00:04:12.120> it<00:04:12.150> moving

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
the other two you can just see it moving

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.229 
the other two you can just see it moving
around<00:04:12.630> there<00:04:12.900> so<00:04:13.800> it<00:04:14.550> becomes<00:04:14.790> I<00:04:14.970> think<00:04:15.180> you

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
around there so it becomes I think you

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.909 
around there so it becomes I think you
have<00:04:15.330> to<00:04:15.360> target<00:04:15.570> that<00:04:15.840> little<00:04:16.109> that<00:04:16.859> little

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
have to target that little that little

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.770 
have to target that little that little
kind<00:04:17.280> of<00:04:17.370> bubble<00:04:17.820> of<00:04:17.910> emulsion<00:04:18.359> on<00:04:18.510> its

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
kind of bubble of emulsion on its

and you will know when you felt them

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.490 
and you will know when you felt them
because<00:04:21.519> it<00:04:21.670> pops<00:04:21.910> and<00:04:22.240> also<00:04:22.510> it<00:04:22.840> causes<00:04:23.320> an

for this clock tower command post and
you'll<00:04:32.350> see<00:04:32.500> there's<00:04:32.680> a<00:04:32.740> little<00:04:32.770> circle<00:04:33.580> of

you'll see there's a little circle of
emulsion<00:04:34.030> that's<00:04:34.180> appeared<00:04:34.600> there<00:04:35.140> over<00:04:35.380> that

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
emulsion that's appeared there over that

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.970 
emulsion that's appeared there over that
over<00:04:35.710> that<00:04:36.280> precipice<00:04:37.180> and<00:04:37.510> you<00:04:38.470> either<00:04:38.620> want

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
over that precipice and you either want

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.400 
over that precipice and you either want
to<00:04:39.120> get<00:04:40.120> someone<00:04:40.390> to<00:04:40.510> stand<00:04:41.020> on<00:04:41.140> it<00:04:41.230> and<00:04:41.320> then

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
to get someone to stand on it and then

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.240 
to get someone to stand on it and then
run<00:04:41.590> away<00:04:41.800> or<00:04:41.830> as<00:04:42.400> in<00:04:42.790> this<00:04:42.820> case<00:04:43.950> which<00:04:44.950> I<00:04:45.070> much

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
run away or as in this case which I much

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.760 
run away or as in this case which I much
prefer<00:04:45.550> is<00:04:45.790> to<00:04:46.060> sacrifice<00:04:46.330> one<00:04:47.140> or<00:04:47.290> two<00:04:47.500> people

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
prefer is to sacrifice one or two people

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.400 
prefer is to sacrifice one or two people
to<00:04:48.160> keep<00:04:48.310> the<00:04:48.400> Leviathan<00:04:48.790> happy<00:04:49.060> but<00:04:49.750> that's

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
to keep the Leviathan happy but that's

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.800 
to keep the Leviathan happy but that's
totally<00:04:50.560> unnecessary<00:04:50.830> and<00:04:51.390> now<00:04:52.390> the<00:04:52.450> Cleves

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
totally unnecessary and now the Cleves

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.200 
totally unnecessary and now the Cleves
appeared<00:04:53.169> costs<00:04:53.919> 900<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.790> same<00:04:54.940> as<00:04:55.060> other

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
appeared costs 900 the same as other

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.330 
appeared costs 900 the same as other
cleavers<00:04:55.540> and<00:04:55.750> that's<00:04:56.710> it<00:04:58.980> so<00:04:59.980> you<00:05:00.040> can<00:05:00.190> see

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
cleavers and that's it so you can see

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.680 
cleavers and that's it so you can see
the<00:05:00.430> kind<00:05:00.610> of<00:05:00.700> water<00:05:00.910> effect<00:05:01.270> going<00:05:01.419> out<00:05:01.540> on<00:05:01.630> my

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
the kind of water effect going out on my

body as with your the other elemental

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.570 
body as with your the other elemental
cleavers<00:05:03.730> it<00:05:04.000> has<00:05:04.180> an<00:05:04.330> effect<00:05:04.450> that<00:05:05.580> exudes

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
cleavers it has an effect that exudes

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.010 
cleavers it has an effect that exudes
from<00:05:06.940> your<00:05:07.180> character<00:05:07.510> when<00:05:07.660> they're<00:05:07.780> holding

cleaver it lasts for quite a while not

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.770 
cleaver it lasts for quite a while not
quite<00:05:21.040> sure<00:05:21.070> how<00:05:21.190> that<00:05:21.430> works<00:05:21.520> but<00:05:21.760> you<00:05:22.630> can

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
quite sure how that works but you can

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.090 
quite sure how that works but you can
definitely<00:05:22.930> down<00:05:23.230> in<00:05:23.410> some<00:05:23.620> people<00:05:23.890> at<00:05:23.979> long

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
definitely down in some people at long

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.969 
definitely down in some people at long
range<00:05:24.370> and<00:05:24.669> it's<00:05:24.820> pretty<00:05:25.060> powerful<00:05:25.979> although

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
range and it's pretty powerful although

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.770 
range and it's pretty powerful although
I<00:05:27.280> wouldn't<00:05:27.460> recommend<00:05:27.580> doing<00:05:28.150> what<00:05:28.510> I<00:05:28.540> did

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
I wouldn't recommend doing what I did

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.450 
I wouldn't recommend doing what I did
here<00:05:28.960> trying<00:05:29.290> to<00:05:29.350> be<00:05:29.470> really<00:05:29.950> cool<00:05:30.100> and

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
here trying to be really cool and

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.940 
here trying to be really cool and
fighting<00:05:31.210> a<00:05:31.240> berserker<00:05:31.630> because<00:05:31.930> it<00:05:32.620> wasn't

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
fighting a berserker because it wasn't

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.409 
fighting a berserker because it wasn't
very<00:05:33.040> effective<00:05:33.340> and<00:05:33.700> it<00:05:33.790> made<00:05:34.000> me<00:05:34.030> drop<00:05:34.270> the

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
very effective and it made me drop the

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.080 
very effective and it made me drop the
cleaver<00:05:34.630> and<00:05:34.979> lose<00:05:35.979> the<00:05:36.130> cleaver<00:05:36.370> so<00:05:36.729> I

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
cleaver and lose the cleaver so I

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.210 
cleaver and lose the cleaver so I
definitely<00:05:37.450> wouldn't<00:05:37.720> attack<00:05:38.440> of<00:05:38.590> episode

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
definitely wouldn't attack of episode

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.680 
definitely wouldn't attack of episode
with<00:05:39.460> it<00:05:39.600> but<00:05:40.600> it's<00:05:40.750> pretty<00:05:40.870> good<00:05:41.080> otherwise

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
with it but it's pretty good otherwise

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.000 
with it but it's pretty good otherwise
