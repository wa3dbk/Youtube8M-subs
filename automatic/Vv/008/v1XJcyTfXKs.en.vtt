00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
inch piece all the pieces are like this

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.870 
inch piece all the pieces are like this
together<00:01:26.380> and<00:01:26.740> what<00:01:26.829> you<00:01:26.860> do<00:01:27.189> is<00:01:27.490> each

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
together and what you do is each

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.359 
together and what you do is each
extension<00:01:28.600> is<00:01:28.930> on<00:01:29.049> top<00:01:29.289> of<00:01:29.439> each<00:01:29.560> other<00:01:29.680> so<00:01:30.009> you

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
extension is on top of each other so you

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.550 
extension is on top of each other so you
actually<00:01:30.490> just<00:01:30.820> peel<00:01:31.240> it<00:01:31.270> off<00:01:31.479> and<00:01:31.840> then<00:01:31.869> what

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
actually just peel it off and then what

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.440 
actually just peel it off and then what
you'll<00:01:32.710> do<00:01:32.860> is<00:01:32.979> you'll<00:01:33.130> end<00:01:33.159> up<00:01:33.369> with<00:01:33.490> two<00:01:33.549> so

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
you'll do is you'll end up with two so

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.080 
you'll do is you'll end up with two so
how<00:01:34.899> easy<00:01:34.930> this<00:01:35.500> is<00:01:35.770> is<00:01:36.100> you<00:01:36.369> literally<00:01:36.729> just

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
how easy this is is you literally just

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.590 
how easy this is is you literally just
take<00:01:37.210> a<00:01:37.630> nice<00:01:37.930> clean<00:01:38.680> section<00:01:39.280> they<00:01:39.759> all<00:01:40.000> have

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
take a nice clean section they all have

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.679 
take a nice clean section they all have
to<00:01:40.840> be<00:01:41.009> horizontal<00:01:42.009> not<00:01:42.759> curved<00:01:43.149> not<00:01:43.420> anything

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
to be horizontal not curved not anything

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:45.630 
to be horizontal not curved not anything
because<00:01:44.049> all<00:01:44.200> you'll<00:01:44.350> get<00:01:44.560> is<00:01:44.799> when<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.460> hair

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
because all you'll get is when the hair

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.120 
because all you'll get is when the hair
gets<00:01:45.820> wet<00:01:45.969> if<00:01:46.479> it's<00:01:46.689> bent<00:01:46.990> on<00:01:47.170> its<00:01:47.320> side<00:01:47.619> what

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
gets wet if it's bent on its side what

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.889 
gets wet if it's bent on its side what
will<00:01:48.219> happen<00:01:48.549> is<00:01:48.700> all<00:01:48.909> the<00:01:49.270> weight<00:01:49.539> will<00:01:49.810> be

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
will happen is all the weight will be

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.289 
will happen is all the weight will be
pulled<00:01:50.200> on<00:01:50.439> the<00:01:50.710> one<00:01:50.979> side<00:01:51.310> so<00:01:51.729> the<00:01:52.060> hair

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
pulled on the one side so the hair

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:53.910 
pulled on the one side so the hair
that's<00:01:52.509> caught<00:01:52.780> up<00:01:53.020> here<00:01:53.380> will<00:01:53.799> actually

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
that's caught up here will actually

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.190 
that's caught up here will actually
start<00:01:54.399> to<00:01:54.490> flop

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
start to flop

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.499 
start to flop
so<00:01:55.740> what<00:01:55.979> you'll<00:01:56.130> want<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.460> do<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:57.090> take<00:01:57.479> a

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
so what you'll want to do is take a

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.190 
so what you'll want to do is take a
piece<00:01:57.900> about<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.009> same<00:01:59.310> size<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.360> about<00:02:00.990> the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.940 
the edges leaving about a millimeter -
it's<00:02:23.580> like<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.760> tiny<00:02:24.060> centimeter<00:02:24.720> of<00:02:24.989> space<00:02:25.200> for

it's like a tiny centimeter of space for
the<00:02:26.040> other<00:02:26.280> hair<00:02:26.760> extensions<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.930> stick<00:02:28.230> to

and your next piece you want to find the

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.830 
and your next piece you want to find the
edge<00:03:39.500> which<00:03:39.890> is<00:03:39.920> right<00:03:40.250> here<00:03:40.550> and<00:03:41.510> you'll<00:03:41.690> want

edge which is right here and you'll want
to<00:03:41.959> start<00:03:42.350> your<00:03:42.709> section<00:03:43.720> overlapping

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
to start your section overlapping

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.350

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
lightly so as long as they're

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.449 
lightly so as long as they're
overlapping<00:03:47.900> you<00:03:48.709> can<00:03:48.860> actually<00:03:49.040> get<00:03:49.400> away

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
overlapping you can actually get away

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.180 
overlapping you can actually get away
with<00:03:49.819> using<00:03:49.970> less<00:03:50.180> hair<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:51.200> it's<00:03:51.590> way<00:03:51.920> more

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
with using less hair and it's way more

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.780 
with using less hair and it's way more
effective<00:03:52.459> than<00:03:53.209> you<00:03:53.360> would<00:03:53.660> with<00:03:54.140> any<00:03:54.380> other

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
effective than you would with any other
