else<00:07:43.669> where<00:07:44.590> tie<00:07:45.590> them<00:07:45.710> up<00:07:45.800> in<00:07:45.979> front<00:07:46.130> of<00:07:46.250> the

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:46.310 
else where tie them up in front of the

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.430 
else where tie them up in front of the
cuartel<00:07:46.669> for<00:07:46.880> everyone<00:07:47.300> to<00:07:47.479> see<00:07:47.660> graviton

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:48.440 
cuartel for everyone to see graviton

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.020 
cuartel for everyone to see graviton
I'll<00:07:48.740> show<00:07:48.949> them<00:07:49.130> who<00:07:49.220> is<00:07:49.340> coming<00:07:49.669> Dunphy

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:50.030 
I'll show them who is coming Dunphy

00:07:50.030 --> 00:08:01.260 
I'll show them who is coming Dunphy
around<00:07:50.330> him<00:07:50.509> going<00:07:51.470> see<00:07:52.370> him<00:07:52.550> about<00:07:52.669> it

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:01.270
