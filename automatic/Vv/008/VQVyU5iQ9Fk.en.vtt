00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.220 
I would assume with a woman like this a
lot<00:04:24.060> of<00:04:24.180> guys<00:04:24.360> would<00:04:24.630> either<00:04:24.720> fall<00:04:25.020> into

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
lot of guys would either fall into

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.770 
lot of guys would either fall into
posturing<00:04:25.830> or<00:04:25.980> collapsing<00:04:26.640> but<00:04:27.090> very<00:04:27.390> few

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
posturing or collapsing but very few

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.470 
posturing or collapsing but very few
