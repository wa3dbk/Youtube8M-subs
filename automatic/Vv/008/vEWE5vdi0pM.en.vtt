00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.940 
camp spot the reason why I like to camp
here<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.450> because<00:01:51.720> well<00:01:52.140> obviously<00:01:52.470> it's<00:01:52.860> a

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
here is because well obviously it's a

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.789 
here is because well obviously it's a
great<00:01:53.159> spot<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.899> protect<00:01:54.899> me<00:01:55.020> from<00:01:55.200> both<00:01:55.560> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
great spot to protect me from both the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.100 
great spot to protect me from both the
wind<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.250> rain<00:01:56.490> but<00:01:57.180> other<00:01:57.329> than<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.540> it's<00:01:57.930> a

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
wind and rain but other than that it's a

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.560 
wind and rain but other than that it's a
great<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:59.340> has<00:01:59.430> great<00:01:59.759> line<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.090> sight<00:02:00.270> on<00:02:00.420> both

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
great it has great line of sight on both

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.179 
great it has great line of sight on both
the<00:02:00.750> left<00:02:00.930> side<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.469> in<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.680> road<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.130> a

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
the left side and in the road and a

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.560 
the left side and in the road and a
little<00:02:02.340> bit<00:02:02.430> on<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.610> right<00:02:02.729> side<00:02:02.969> it's

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
little bit on the right side it's

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.590 
little bit on the right side it's
basically<00:02:03.990> like<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.290> very<00:02:04.820> friendly<00:02:05.820> octopus

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
basically like a very friendly octopus

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.580 
basically like a very friendly octopus
you<00:02:06.750> know<00:02:06.840> it's<00:02:06.960> just<00:02:07.020> gotta<00:02:07.229> tannin

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
you know it's just gotta tannin

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.680 
you know it's just gotta tannin
everything<00:02:08.009> oh<00:02:08.220> what<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.179> great<00:02:09.390> metaphor

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
everything oh what a great metaphor

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.600 
everything oh what a great metaphor
material<00:02:10.349> what<00:02:10.500> agreement<00:02:10.739> afore<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.430> should

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
material what agreement afore you should

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.559 
material what agreement afore you should
should<00:02:12.330> probably<00:02:12.629> stop<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:13.260> should

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
should probably stop you should

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.780 
should probably stop you should
you<00:02:13.719> should<00:02:13.870> probably<00:02:13.989> stop<00:02:14.489> anyways<00:02:15.489> the

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
you should probably stop anyways the

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.729 
you should probably stop anyways the
another<00:02:16.060> reason<00:02:16.359> why<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.510> like<00:02:17.019> this<00:02:17.200> spot<00:02:17.469> is

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
another reason why I like this spot is

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.860 
another reason why I like this spot is
because<00:02:18.129> right<00:02:18.549> there<00:02:18.790> you<00:02:19.090> can<00:02:19.299> jump<00:02:19.540> up<00:02:19.659> on

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
because right there you can jump up on

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.050 
because right there you can jump up on
to<00:02:20.079> that<00:02:20.290> day<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.650> little<00:02:21.219> plateau<00:02:21.609> it's<00:02:21.939> more

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
to that day a little plateau it's more

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.209 
to that day a little plateau it's more
like<00:02:22.239> rock<00:02:22.569> but<00:02:22.840> anyways<00:02:23.170> you<00:02:23.590> can<00:02:23.739> jump<00:02:23.950> on<00:02:24.010> up

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:24.219 
like rock but anyways you can jump on up

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.640 
like rock but anyways you can jump on up
there<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.579> get<00:02:24.819> a<00:02:24.849> couple<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.180> kills<00:02:25.389> uh<00:02:25.650> that

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
there and get a couple of kills uh that

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.759 
there and get a couple of kills uh that
little<00:02:26.920> maneuver<00:02:27.040> has<00:02:27.400> definitely<00:02:27.760> saved<00:02:28.150> me

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
little maneuver has definitely saved me

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.929 
little maneuver has definitely saved me
numerous<00:02:29.769> times<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.340> got<00:02:30.609> Mikhail's

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:30.939 
numerous times and got Mikhail's

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:33.839 
numerous times and got Mikhail's
numerous<00:02:31.329> times<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:32.769> reason<00:02:33.129> or<00:02:33.400> not<00:02:33.760> the

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
numerous times the reason or not the

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.879 
numerous times the reason or not the
reason<00:02:34.000> how<00:02:34.780> we<00:02:34.840> perform<00:02:35.230> this<00:02:35.620> little

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:35.889 
reason how we perform this little

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.509 
reason how we perform this little
maneuver<00:02:36.189> is<00:02:36.370> it's<00:02:37.180> actually<00:02:37.269> a<00:02:37.480> little<00:02:37.659> hard

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
maneuver is it's actually a little hard

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.949 
maneuver is it's actually a little hard
it<00:02:39.519> took<00:02:39.909> me<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.120> while<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.299> figure<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.689> out<00:02:40.750> I

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
it took me a while to figure it out I

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.449 
it took me a while to figure it out I
did<00:02:41.169> them<00:02:41.290> accident<00:02:41.829> notes<00:02:41.980> like<00:02:42.129> oh<00:02:42.219> that's

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
did them accident notes like oh that's

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.179 
did them accident notes like oh that's
easy<00:02:42.579> it's<00:02:42.909> not<00:02:43.260> but<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.379> way<00:02:44.469> you<00:02:44.530> do<00:02:44.769> it<00:02:44.799> is

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:45.189 
easy it's not but the way you do it is

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:47.759 
easy it's not but the way you do it is
you<00:02:45.540> basically<00:02:46.540> have<00:02:46.900> to<00:02:46.989> cozy<00:02:47.379> and<00:02:47.469> up<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.739> the

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
you basically have to cozy and up to the

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.809 
you basically have to cozy and up to the
rock<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.609> hug<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.299> then<00:02:50.159> sprint<00:02:51.159> and<00:02:51.459> jump

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
rock and hug it and then sprint and jump

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.110 
rock and hug it and then sprint and jump
right<00:02:52.000> before<00:02:52.359> you<00:02:52.510> get<00:02:52.659> to<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.439> ledge

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
right before you get to the the ledge

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.759 
right before you get to the the ledge
like<00:02:55.120> I<00:02:55.269> said<00:02:55.329> it's<00:02:55.780> pretty<00:02:55.989> it's<00:02:56.319> pretty<00:02:56.469> hard

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
like I said it's pretty it's pretty hard

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.589 
like I said it's pretty it's pretty hard
I<00:02:57.040> just<00:02:57.430> failed<00:02:57.609> like<00:02:57.819> three<00:02:58.030> times<00:02:58.269> in<00:02:58.449> front

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
I just failed like three times in front

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
still trying to get used to it and that

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.659 
still trying to get used to it and that
guy<00:03:01.840> was<00:03:01.989> just<00:03:02.169> absolutely<00:03:02.650> terrible<00:03:02.980> but

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:03.669 
guy was just absolutely terrible but

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.420 
guy was just absolutely terrible but
anyways<00:03:03.939> I<00:03:04.269> would<00:03:04.870> recommend<00:03:05.169> learning<00:03:06.069> how

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
anyways I would recommend learning how

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.309 
anyways I would recommend learning how
to<00:03:06.489> do<00:03:06.790> that<00:03:06.939> maneuver<00:03:07.209> because<00:03:07.569> I<00:03:07.810> feel<00:03:08.230> like

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
to do that maneuver because I feel like

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.099 
to do that maneuver because I feel like
a<00:03:08.379> big<00:03:08.620> part<00:03:08.889> of<00:03:09.389> battlefield<00:03:10.389> bad<00:03:10.510> company<00:03:10.689> 2

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
a big part of battlefield bad company 2

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.199 
a big part of battlefield bad company 2
is<00:03:11.379> being<00:03:11.889> able<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.430> move<00:03:12.819> around<00:03:12.939> the<00:03:13.150> map

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
is being able to move around the map

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.479

footsteps<00:03:27.549> are<00:03:27.699> super<00:03:27.939> loud<00:03:28.090> but<00:03:28.750> you<00:03:28.780> can

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:29.229 
footsteps are super loud but you can

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:31.890 
footsteps are super loud but you can
still<00:03:29.650> use<00:03:29.709> sound<00:03:30.310> to<00:03:30.430> your<00:03:30.549> advantage<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:31.209> if

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
still use sound to your advantage and if

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.809 
still use sound to your advantage and if
you<00:03:32.079> listen<00:03:32.319> carefully<00:03:32.470> if<00:03:32.949> I<00:03:33.159> have<00:03:33.280> a<00:03:33.340> music

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
you listen carefully if I have a music

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.189 
you listen carefully if I have a music
lab<00:03:33.970> or<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.359> sound<00:03:34.569> loud<00:03:34.780> enough<00:03:34.989> for<00:03:35.019> you

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:35.199 
lab or the sound loud enough for you

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:38.099 
lab or the sound loud enough for you
guys<00:03:35.349> you<00:03:36.250> could<00:03:36.400> hear<00:03:36.579> this<00:03:36.729> guy<00:03:36.970> just<00:03:37.810> pump

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
guys you could hear this guy just pump

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.159 
guys you could hear this guy just pump
it<00:03:38.199> away<00:03:38.439> with<00:03:39.069> a<00:03:39.099> giant<00:03:39.810> mg<00:03:40.810> I<00:03:40.840> think<00:03:41.049> it's

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
it away with a giant mg I think it's

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.979 
it away with a giant mg I think it's
called<00:03:41.319> or<00:03:41.530> I<00:03:42.009> think<00:03:42.639> it's<00:03:42.759> empty<00:03:42.879> but<00:03:43.720> anyways

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
called or I think it's empty but anyways

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.990 
called or I think it's empty but anyways
so<00:03:44.829> I<00:03:44.889> was<00:03:45.009> able<00:03:45.069> to<00:03:45.220> easily<00:03:45.400> take<00:03:45.729> him<00:03:45.879> out

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
so I was able to easily take him out

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.789 
so I was able to easily take him out
because<00:03:46.239> I<00:03:46.659> knew<00:03:46.810> he<00:03:46.959> was<00:03:47.049> there<00:03:47.259> because<00:03:47.500> the

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
because I knew he was there because the

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.580 
because I knew he was there because the
sound<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:49.090> so<00:03:49.449> yeah<00:03:49.569> just<00:03:49.840> basically<00:03:50.139> use<00:03:50.409> the

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
sound and so yeah just basically use the

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.369 
sound and so yeah just basically use the
tools<00:03:50.829> that<00:03:51.009> are<00:03:51.099> at<00:03:51.849> your<00:03:52.060> disposal<00:03:52.449> and<00:03:53.049> use

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
tools that are at your disposal and use

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.009 
tools that are at your disposal and use
it<00:03:53.500> effectively<00:03:53.729> all<00:03:54.729> right<00:03:55.419> to<00:03:55.629> finish<00:03:55.870> off

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
it effectively all right to finish off

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.599 
it effectively all right to finish off
this<00:03:56.169> video<00:03:56.469> I<00:03:56.680> will<00:03:56.739> be<00:03:56.949> defending<00:03:57.430> the

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.509 
this video I will be defending the

me<00:04:05.259> I<00:04:05.409> realize<00:04:05.919> this<00:04:06.189> weapon<00:04:06.549> is<00:04:06.669> pretty

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
me I realize this weapon is pretty

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.140 
me I realize this weapon is pretty
overpowered<00:04:07.569> and<00:04:08.109> cheesy<00:04:08.530> and<00:04:08.979> all<00:04:09.370> that<00:04:09.609> jazz

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
overpowered and cheesy and all that jazz

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.420 
overpowered and cheesy and all that jazz
but<00:04:10.539> I'm<00:04:10.810> basically<00:04:11.199> just<00:04:11.319> using<00:04:11.739> it<00:04:11.829> for<00:04:12.069> the

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
but I'm basically just using it for the

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.029 
but I'm basically just using it for the
extra<00:04:13.030> extra<00:04:13.750> juice<00:04:13.959> it's<00:04:14.169> get<00:04:14.349> behind<00:04:14.709> it<00:04:14.859> I

extra extra juice it's get behind it I

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:17.969 
extra extra juice it's get behind it I
know<00:04:15.459> this<00:04:15.669> is<00:04:15.759> hypocritical<00:04:16.090> and<00:04:16.979> my

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
know this is hypocritical and my

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.909 
know this is hypocritical and my
apologies<00:04:18.570> so<00:04:19.570> my<00:04:20.169> perks<00:04:20.440> that<00:04:20.680> i<00:04:20.769> am<00:04:20.889> using

apologies so my perks that i am using
are<00:04:21.430> the<00:04:21.880> two<00:04:22.060> that<00:04:22.240> increase<00:04:22.659> the

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
are the two that increase the

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.350 
are the two that increase the
effectiveness<00:04:23.289> of<00:04:23.409> my<00:04:23.830> med<00:04:24.039> packs<00:04:24.360> basically

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
effectiveness of my med packs basically

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.520 
effectiveness of my med packs basically
i'm<00:04:25.630> using<00:04:26.139> the

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
i'm using the

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.950 
i'm using the
to<00:04:26.740> perk<00:04:27.100> so<00:04:27.340> I<00:04:27.370> that<00:04:27.700> I<00:04:27.730> can<00:04:28.030> defend<00:04:28.810> this

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
to perk so I that I can defend this

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.379 
to perk so I that I can defend this
position<00:04:29.139> for<00:04:29.560> a<00:04:29.590> long<00:04:29.770> period<00:04:29.950> of<00:04:30.100> time<00:04:30.389> and

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
position for a long period of time and

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.110 
position for a long period of time and
basically<00:04:31.780> to<00:04:31.960> regen<00:04:32.320> any<00:04:32.650> attack<00:04:33.160> that<00:04:33.190> comes

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
basically to regen any attack that comes

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.230 
basically to regen any attack that comes
my<00:04:34.300> way<00:04:34.740> so<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:36.100> reason<00:04:36.220> why<00:04:36.490> this<00:04:36.550> place<00:04:37.210> is

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
my way so the reason why this place is

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.710 
my way so the reason why this place is
fairly<00:04:37.990> effective<00:04:38.620> at<00:04:38.910> defending<00:04:39.910> this<00:04:40.389> point

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
fairly effective at defending this point

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.600 
fairly effective at defending this point
is<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.080> fact<00:04:41.320> that<00:04:41.440> the<00:04:41.680> enemy<00:04:41.830> kind<00:04:42.430> of

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
is the fact that the enemy kind of

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.240 
is the fact that the enemy kind of
thinks<00:04:42.880> that<00:04:43.000> this<00:04:43.090> is<00:04:43.500> out<00:04:44.500> in<00:04:44.650> the<00:04:44.710> open<00:04:44.770> and

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
thinks that this is out in the open and

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.560 
thinks that this is out in the open and
they<00:04:45.400> don't<00:04:45.520> really<00:04:45.730> expect<00:04:45.940> anyone<00:04:46.300> to<00:04:46.360> be

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
they don't really expect anyone to be

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.440 
they don't really expect anyone to be
here<00:04:46.810> but<00:04:47.590> on<00:04:47.740> all<00:04:47.860> and<00:04:48.100> all<00:04:48.340> actuality<00:04:48.820> it<00:04:49.330> is

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
here but on all and all actuality it is

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.810 
here but on all and all actuality it is
a<00:04:49.480> very<00:04:49.750> well<00:04:49.990> defended<00:04:50.580> defensive<00:04:51.580> point

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
a very well defended defensive point

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.190 
a very well defended defensive point
because<00:04:52.150> of<00:04:52.270> these<00:04:52.360> barriers<00:04:52.720> in<00:04:52.870> front<00:04:52.900> of<00:04:53.139> me

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
because of these barriers in front of me

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.290 
because of these barriers in front of me
and<00:04:53.350> you<00:04:53.950> get<00:04:54.100> great<00:04:54.340> line<00:04:54.610> of<00:04:54.730> sight<00:04:54.910> on<00:04:55.120> both

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
and you get great line of sight on both

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.290 
and you get great line of sight on both
the<00:04:55.540> road<00:04:55.810> and<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.320> rock<00:04:56.530> area<00:04:56.950> and<00:04:57.300> anyone

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
the road and the rock area and anyone

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.730 
the road and the rock area and anyone
that<00:04:58.360> basically<00:04:58.720> goes<00:04:58.960> for<00:04:59.230> the<00:04:59.350> point<00:04:59.590> is

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
that basically goes for the point is

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.810 
that basically goes for the point is
going<00:04:59.860> to<00:04:59.950> get<00:05:00.040> mowed<00:05:00.250> down<00:05:01.230> like<00:05:02.230> right<00:05:02.440> there

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
going to get mowed down like right there

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.220 
going to get mowed down like right there
but<00:05:03.820> like<00:05:03.940> all<00:05:04.090> good<00:05:04.270> points<00:05:04.750> they<00:05:04.900> do<00:05:04.960> have

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
but like all good points they do have

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.840 
but like all good points they do have
their<00:05:05.260> weaknesses<00:05:05.500> and<00:05:06.130> the<00:05:06.310> weakness<00:05:06.640> for
