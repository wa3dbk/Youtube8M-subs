here<00:00:51.629> we<00:00:51.690> go<00:00:54.050> pretty<00:00:55.050> sure<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.320> could<00:00:55.500> be

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
here we go pretty sure this could be

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.010 
here we go pretty sure this could be
done<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:56.129> other<00:00:56.730> maps<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.510> don't<00:00:57.629> need<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.899> use

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
done on other maps you don't need to use

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.709 
done on other maps you don't need to use
a<00:00:58.050> grid<00:00:58.320> for<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.739> but<00:00:59.300> first<00:01:00.300> thing<00:01:00.449> i<00:01:00.539> do<00:01:00.600> is

a grid for this but first thing i do is

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.340 
a grid for this but first thing i do is
i<00:01:00.989> spawn<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> grid<00:01:02.510> because<00:01:03.510> i<00:01:04.019> don't<00:01:04.260> know<00:01:04.290> i

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
i spawn a grid because i don't know i

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.859 
i spawn a grid because i don't know i
like<00:01:04.589> grids<00:01:04.949> i<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.760> great<00:01:06.270> fetish<00:01:06.659> or

something after that you're just going
to<00:01:09.150> want<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.330> spawn<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.869> teleporter<00:01:10.670> make<00:01:11.670> sure

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
to want to spawn a teleporter make sure

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.910 
to want to spawn a teleporter make sure
land<00:01:12.270> vehicles<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.049> heavy<00:01:13.260> vehicles<00:01:13.770> are

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
land vehicles and heavy vehicles are

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.960 
land vehicles and heavy vehicles are
true<00:01:14.280> fuck<00:01:15.000> flying<00:01:15.420> vehicles<00:01:16.790> we're<00:01:17.790> going<00:01:17.880> to

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
true fuck flying vehicles we're going to

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.749 
true fuck flying vehicles we're going to
fly<00:01:18.270> way<00:01:18.780> better<00:01:19.140> than<00:01:19.320> they<00:01:19.500> ever<00:01:19.619> could<00:01:19.770> make

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
fly way better than they ever could make

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.190 
fly way better than they ever could make
sure<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.000> teleporter<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.810> reachable

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
sure the teleporter is in a reachable

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.170 
sure the teleporter is in a reachable
spot<00:01:22.770> like<00:01:23.130> because<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.610> could<00:01:23.759> fly<00:01:24.030> around

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
spot like because you could fly around

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.590 
spot like because you could fly around
it<00:01:24.509> because<00:01:24.630> where<00:01:25.229> else<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.860> clemson

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
it because where else you a clemson

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.520 
it because where else you a clemson
excessively<00:01:27.600> annoying<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:29.299> then<00:01:30.530> this

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
excessively annoying and then this

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.560 
excessively annoying and then this
occasionally<00:01:32.130> works<00:01:33.020> or<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.350> uh<00:01:35.240> if<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.390> can

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
occasionally works or you uh if you can

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.210 
occasionally works or you uh if you can
breach<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.810> barrier<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.619> guess<00:01:37.829> like<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.159> just

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
breach the barrier I guess like I just

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.090 
breach the barrier I guess like I just
did<00:01:38.720> by<00:01:39.720> putting<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.110> up<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.439> high<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.890> can

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
did by putting this up so high you can

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.550 
did by putting this up so high you can
raise<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.549> teleporters<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:43.020> really<00:01:43.530> I

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
raise the teleporters to really I

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.060 
raise the teleporters to really I
heights<00:01:44.750> except<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:45.840> totally<00:01:46.320> forgot<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.890> make

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
heights except I totally forgot to make

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.929 
heights except I totally forgot to make
it<00:01:47.220> fucking<00:01:48.799> just<00:01:49.799> don't<00:01:49.950> forget<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.759> put

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.249 
it fucking just don't forget this to put
land<00:01:51.180> vehicles<00:01:51.540> have<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.750> giggles<00:01:52.049> fuck

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
land vehicles have you giggles fuck

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.249 
land vehicles have you giggles fuck
flying<00:01:52.530> vehicles<00:01:52.890> like<00:01:53.009> always<00:01:54.110> this<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.229> a

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
flying vehicles like always this is a

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.969 
flying vehicles like always this is a
problem<00:01:55.710> like<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:56.579> works<00:01:56.820> at<00:01:57.149> some<00:01:57.479> points<00:01:57.979> or

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
problem like it works at some points or

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.120 
problem like it works at some points or
you<00:01:59.100> can<00:01:59.250> raise<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.850> high

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
you can raise it this high

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.800 
you can raise it this high
it's<00:02:02.130> just<00:02:02.370> sometimes<00:02:02.580> it's<00:02:02.940> very<00:02:03.000> finicky<00:02:03.540> so

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
it's just sometimes it's very finicky so

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.210 
it's just sometimes it's very finicky so
what<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.050> can<00:02:04.230> also<00:02:04.320> do<00:02:04.620> is<00:02:04.740> spawn<00:02:04.980> a<00:02:05.010> high

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
what you can also do is spawn a high

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.390 
what you can also do is spawn a high
teleporter<00:02:05.910> and<00:02:06.230> then<00:02:07.230> a<00:02:07.260> like<00:02:07.830> teleporters

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:08.400 
teleporter and then a like teleporters

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.510 
teleporter and then a like teleporters
regular<00:02:08.760> regularly<00:02:09.180> high<00:02:09.390> on<00:02:10.130> acid<00:02:11.130> or

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
regular regularly high on acid or

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.930 
regular regularly high on acid or
something<00:02:12.590> but<00:02:13.590> like<00:02:13.740> right<00:02:14.100> here<00:02:14.250> just<00:02:14.550> put<00:02:14.910> a

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
something but like right here just put a

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.330 
something but like right here just put a
teleporter<00:02:15.450> right<00:02:15.660> there<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:16.680> go<00:02:16.830> through<00:02:17.160> it

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
teleporter right there you go through it

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.680 
teleporter right there you go through it
go<00:02:17.820> through<00:02:17.970> another<00:02:18.090> one<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.420> get<00:02:18.510> through

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
go through another one to get through

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.390 
go through another one to get through
that<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.110> then<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:19.530> breach<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:19.770> barrier<00:02:19.950> for

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
that and then you breach the barrier for

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.620 
that and then you breach the barrier for
just<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:20.610> little<00:02:20.760> bit<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.150> allows<00:02:21.360> you<00:02:21.540> to

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
just a little bit and it allows you to

barrier and throw teleporters out there
where<00:02:26.070> they<00:02:26.160> stay<00:02:27.050> then<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.260> just<00:02:28.380> go<00:02:28.470> back<00:02:28.680> to

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
where they stay then you just go back to

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.640 
where they stay then you just go back to
your<00:02:29.040> grid<00:02:29.690> which<00:02:30.690> becomes<00:02:31.050> really<00:02:31.320> really
