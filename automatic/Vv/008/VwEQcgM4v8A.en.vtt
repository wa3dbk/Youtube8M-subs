that's the heart of all this is the land
in<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> soil<00:01:32.190> and<00:01:32.400> that's<00:01:32.970> what<00:01:33.120> we<00:01:33.210> need<00:01:33.360> to

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
in the soil and that's what we need to

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.510 
in the soil and that's what we need to
protect<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.960> steward<00:01:34.320> every<00:01:34.770> single<00:01:35.220> one<00:01:35.490> of

continue to grow we have to realize that
we<00:01:49.720> need<00:01:49.869> to<00:01:49.899> protect<00:01:50.140> those<00:01:50.409> farm<00:01:50.799> lands<00:01:51.250> if

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
we need to protect those farm lands if

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.050 
we need to protect those farm lands if
we<00:01:52.420> want<00:01:52.689> to<00:01:52.840> continue<00:01:53.229> to<00:01:53.829> enjoy<00:01:54.189> the<00:01:54.670> food<00:01:54.909> on

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
we want to continue to enjoy the food on

mission while changing significantly

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.610 
mission while changing significantly
over<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:08.979> years<00:02:09.310> our<00:02:09.599> early<00:02:10.599> days<00:02:10.629> in<00:02:11.110> 1980

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
over the years our early days in 1980

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.710 
over the years our early days in 1980
were<00:02:12.160> really<00:02:12.549> about<00:02:12.730> taking<00:02:12.970> this<00:02:13.239> idea<00:02:13.599> of

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
were really about taking this idea of

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.920 
were really about taking this idea of
conservation<00:02:14.379> easements<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.780> expanding<00:02:16.780> it

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
conservation easements and expanding it

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.130 
conservation easements and expanding it
and<00:02:17.250> developing<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:18.430> more<00:02:18.790> in<00:02:19.030> into<00:02:19.780> purchase

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
and developing it more in into purchase

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.140 
and developing it more in into purchase
of<00:02:20.290> development<00:02:20.739> rights<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.129> we've<00:02:22.000> been

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
of development rights and we've been

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.300 
of development rights and we've been
successful<00:02:22.330> at<00:02:22.870> that<00:02:23.019> but<00:02:23.349> now<00:02:23.799> I<00:02:23.860> think<00:02:24.099> the

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
successful at that but now I think the

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.900 
successful at that but now I think the
organization<00:02:25.030> is<00:02:25.239> a<00:02:25.709> respected<00:02:26.709> voice<00:02:26.950> in<00:02:27.310> the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
organization is a respected voice in the

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.839 
organization is a respected voice in the
development<00:02:28.540> of<00:02:28.690> public<00:02:29.530> policies<00:02:30.129> that

the<00:02:33.760> country<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:34.239> I<00:02:35.230> think<00:02:35.799> that's<00:02:36.190> been<00:02:36.489> a

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
the country and I think that's been a

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.550 
the country and I think that's been a
very<00:02:37.260> healthy<00:02:38.519> growth<00:02:39.519> for<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:39.849> organization
