00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
adrenaline you can change seconds as you

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.730 
adrenaline you can change seconds as you
can<00:01:45.000> see<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.509> actually<00:01:45.720> changing<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.560> it

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
can see this is actually changing so it

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.719 
can see this is actually changing so it
does<00:01:47.430> actually<00:01:47.610> work<00:01:49.009> to<00:01:50.009> compute<00:01:50.369> how<00:01:50.549> it

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
does actually work to compute how it

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.990 
does actually work to compute how it
positions<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.020> stuff<00:01:52.340> so<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.520> click<00:01:53.670> OK

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
positions and stuff so you can click OK

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.140 
positions and stuff so you can click OK
and<00:01:54.149> then

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
and then

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.000 
and then
here<00:01:56.110> you<00:01:56.260> can<00:01:56.380> also<00:01:56.530> start<00:01:57.310> screen<00:01:57.730> saver<00:01:58.000> hi

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
here you can also start screen saver hi

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.980 
here you can also start screen saver hi
do<00:02:00.010> all<00:02:00.160> this<00:02:00.340> all<00:02:00.670> kinds<00:02:01.390> of<00:02:01.480> stuff<00:02:01.720> of<00:02:01.870> this

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
do all this all kinds of stuff of this

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.310 
do all this all kinds of stuff of this
so<00:02:02.410> this<00:02:02.980> is<00:02:03.100> called<00:02:03.370> la<00:02:03.550> PLT<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.480> it's<00:02:04.990> Knable

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
so this is called la PLT and it's Knable

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.280 
so this is called la PLT and it's Knable
slide<00:02:05.680> show<00:02:06.030> wallpaper<00:02:07.030> if<00:02:07.210> I<00:02:07.330> come<00:02:07.540> to<00:02:07.570> XP<00:02:08.170> and
