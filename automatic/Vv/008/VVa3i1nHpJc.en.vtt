00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:25.249
 the east block 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.700
 and 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.700
 the authorities overkill are full of the morning 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.400
 story is just as mindless as the zombies in the game two tough agents 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.220
 years ago the home club wondered what caesar but the terrible zombie are 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.240
 in between them 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.740
 thanks to their vigorous training that she has quickly muscled and well planned 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.839
 they are made up 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.780
 prepared everything 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.300
 they pick up the morning 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.530
 especially the nuisance is the jury's time and an empty amnesty flanders 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.990
 also supports 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.440
 4 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.880
 a completely ridiculous point of departure, and that works to the advantage 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.000
 from overkill 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.090
 the film is a persiflage on it brings house film genre which includes acting performance 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.410
 and plot are under supervision and humor the graphic study of course 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.100
 not the strongest console on the market but that made the overkill completely 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.920
 not off 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.880
 it all seems to belong 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.940
 just like the line through the screen and it 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.940
 austria a crazy movie 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.659
 the biologists in the cut-scenes give the game that little bit extra 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.610
 voice actors do not sound like a meter, which also seems to be the intention 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.940
 some conversations seem straight from a rejected script from corentin 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.889
 tarantino 

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.889
 a bit against it 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:45.429
 the atmosphere in overkill is therefore unexpectedly well set but in terms of game 

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:49.439
 play offers the game exactly what you expect from a rail shooter 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:52.969
 the council seat there automatically where you shoot all zombies on your way short 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:57.879
 you have to test someone where you just like at dosko denied previous car 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.879
 like our prayers and you shoot with the know-it-all 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.149
 the appearance of the levels can be played 

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:07.519
 that's how you get to the fair and to the hospital, but ultimately it makes 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.539
 nothing out for the game 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:13.059
 The variation in the game should of course not buy the ship to make the 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.779
 option is 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:15.259
 so you can regularly 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:17.749
 order if you keep shooting outside making it easier for you 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:19.099
 hitting enemies 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.269
 so you can rotate the camera a bit by moving to the edges of the screen 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.129
 point with the beer boat and that is unique in the genre but in practice you will 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.209
 almost never use 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.920
 furthermore you can buy different areas and this gun also became fast 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.629
 make it more effective by earning money for it 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:35.810
 get the scores 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.220
 And that is only possible if you always have the comfort when building up 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.090
 hit to shoot and then also not to be hit, you also get extra 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.129
 points when innocent people became of a violent death 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:51.959
 The problem with rails shooters knew that they are such short duration you can always 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.029
 try to improve your high score again 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:57.119
 but the whole German daimler expects this to be more value for money 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.569
 sega has tried to put more in a game than the two hours you spent 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.419
 need to finish the seven levels so there will be a shower with the scud 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:07.229
 free after playing the game 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:10.489
 this is a higher level of difficulty, because there are also a few cents 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.379
 that were not present in a normal game 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.040
 there are also some mini-games that you can play with up to three other people 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.329
 but they only provide short training 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.650
 that makes the multiplayer more fun 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.370
 you can of course play the game that you know with two people and if you want 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.559
 is there an option to 

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:31.080
 we will place ourselves to make it all more challenging 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.080
 4 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:47.749
 If you manage Kevin's short life span then the only problem is this 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:50.749
 cars became that you are not really on the screen 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.220
 with the online council so you do that with overkill and other shooters 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.469
 on the board on the stentor boat 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:00.719
 and that does not always work accurately and that is of course a major disadvantage 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:03.139
 for the first time you can go online 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:06.850
 these are precisely those who can forgive the short life of the game 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:12.250
 nevertheless the humor of the game is a big plus 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.820
 one that ensures that we have a big smile on our face 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.800
 number of afternoons of confectionery 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.800
 we will also draw the game more often when your friends pass by 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.529
 come 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:25.469
 Despite the problems that a scarf entails on the Wii, you make sure 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:29.809
 that this is a portion neede and the very entertaining experience is a thick soap 

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:32.809
 is therefore also appropriate here 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.309
 plasterk saw the motion not true 

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:44.479
 curious no shit soap 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:45.210
 the 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.310
 people but doubts but my new year but also be 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.520
 temporary nature of the beast
