00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.410 
but because of production time and not
wanting<00:00:22.220> to<00:00:22.250> spend<00:00:22.699> most<00:00:23.090> of<00:00:23.240> my<00:00:23.330> time

more<00:00:26.029> knives<00:00:26.300> I<00:00:27.230> do<00:00:27.859> everything<00:00:28.279> on<00:00:28.369> a<00:00:28.400> grinder

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
more knives I do everything on a grinder

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.499 
more knives I do everything on a grinder
and<00:00:29.089> it's<00:00:29.539> just<00:00:29.900> as<00:00:30.050> effective<00:00:31.270> most<00:00:32.270> people

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
and it's just as effective most people

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.410 
and it's just as effective most people
you'll<00:00:32.660> see<00:00:32.870> will<00:00:33.080> sharpen<00:00:33.320> an<00:00:33.590> edge<00:00:33.800> down

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
you'll see will sharpen an edge down

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.190 
you'll see will sharpen an edge down
actually<00:00:35.420> I<00:00:35.480> think<00:00:35.540> that's<00:00:35.780> the<00:00:35.960> case<00:00:36.170> for

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
actually I think that's the case for

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.850 
actually I think that's the case for
most<00:00:36.620> people<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:37.540> I<00:00:38.540> do<00:00:38.840> mine<00:00:39.260> the<00:00:39.530> other<00:00:39.650> way

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
most people and I do mine the other way

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.440 
most people and I do mine the other way
I<00:00:40.180> sharpen<00:00:41.180> it<00:00:41.300> with<00:00:41.450> the<00:00:41.660> edge<00:00:41.990> up<00:00:43.390> just<00:00:44.390> a

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
I sharpen it with the edge up just a

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.970 
I sharpen it with the edge up just a
personal<00:00:44.750> preference<00:00:45.050> and<00:00:45.470> how<00:00:45.620> I<00:00:45.650> taught

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
personal preference and how I taught

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.990 
personal preference and how I taught
myself<00:00:46.720> I'm<00:00:47.720> I<00:00:48.670> don't<00:00:49.670> know<00:00:49.730> I<00:00:49.910> just

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
myself I'm I don't know I just

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.210 
myself I'm I don't know I just
self-taught<00:00:50.930> and<00:00:51.440> this<00:00:51.860> is<00:00:51.980> what<00:00:52.100> I'm

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
self-taught and this is what I'm

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.920 
self-taught and this is what I'm
comfortable<00:00:52.460> with<00:00:52.760> now<00:00:53.210> and<00:00:53.450> it<00:00:53.510> works<00:00:53.690> just

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
comfortable with now and it works just

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.720 
comfortable with now and it works just
fine<00:00:54.050> for<00:00:54.350> me<00:00:54.470> I<00:00:54.620> used<00:00:55.220> a<00:00:55.400> used<00:00:55.930> 220<00:00:56.930> grit<00:00:57.080> belt

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
fine for me I used a used 220 grit belt

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.780 
fine for me I used a used 220 grit belt
there's<00:00:58.730> not<00:00:58.910> much<00:00:59.120> grit<00:00:59.420> left<00:00:59.690> I<00:01:00.610> just<00:01:01.610> don't

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
there's not much grit left I just don't

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.940 
there's not much grit left I just don't
like<00:01:01.910> using<00:01:02.210> a<00:01:02.420> new<00:01:02.570> belt<00:01:02.810> because<00:01:03.170> it<00:01:03.320> creates

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
like using a new belt because it creates

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.170 
like using a new belt because it creates
a<00:01:04.250> very<00:01:04.939> jagged<00:01:05.269> burr<00:01:05.659> and<00:01:06.610> I'm<00:01:07.610> not<00:01:07.850> really<00:01:08.090> in

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
a very jagged burr and I'm not really in

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.730 
a very jagged burr and I'm not really in
favor<00:01:08.240> that<00:01:08.600> you<00:01:08.840> could<00:01:09.140> probably<00:01:09.320> use<00:01:09.530> it

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
favor that you could probably use it

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.100 
favor that you could probably use it
much<00:01:09.890> higher<00:01:10.100> grit<00:01:10.400> belt<00:01:10.580> like<00:01:10.850> a<00:01:10.880> 400<00:01:11.600> or<00:01:11.690> 600

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
much higher grit belt like a 400 or 600

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.340 
much higher grit belt like a 400 or 600
and<00:01:13.070> probably<00:01:13.700> have<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:13.940> same<00:01:13.970> effect<00:01:14.510> but

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
and probably have the same effect but

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.260 
and probably have the same effect but
this<00:01:15.560> is<00:01:15.710> just<00:01:15.890> what<00:01:16.040> I<00:01:16.070> use<00:01:16.310> so<00:01:16.970> I<00:01:17.030> don't<00:01:17.180> have

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
this is just what I use so I don't have

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.120 
this is just what I use so I don't have

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.620 
at this angle I'm going to tip it in
just<00:03:42.650> a<00:03:42.770> little<00:03:42.800> bit<00:03:43.040> more<00:03:43.340> when<00:03:44.090> I<00:03:44.120> dust<00:03:44.420> off

okay now the burr is gone and I'm going
to<00:04:09.480> turn<00:04:10.480> it<00:04:10.630> down<00:04:10.660> to<00:04:11.080> about<00:04:11.200> 20<00:04:11.890> which<00:04:12.760> is<00:04:12.910> a

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
to turn it down to about 20 which is a

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.199 
to turn it down to about 20 which is a
lot<00:04:13.180> slower<00:04:13.480> and<00:04:14.400> just<00:04:15.400> lightly<00:04:15.670> dust<00:04:15.880> the

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
lot slower and just lightly dust the

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.750 

test<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.680> edge<00:04:25.800> and<00:04:26.040> feel<00:04:26.280> it

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.320 

and<00:04:36.520> then<00:04:37.020> see<00:04:38.020> how<00:04:38.110> sharp<00:04:38.440> it<00:04:38.590> is<00:04:39.270> don't<00:04:40.270> I

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
and then see how sharp it is don't I

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.159 
and then see how sharp it is don't I
have<00:04:40.510> much<00:04:40.720> hair<00:04:40.930> left<00:04:40.960> from<00:04:41.380> this<00:04:41.560> arm

you can see
it

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
it

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.070 
it
removes<00:04:51.140> hair<00:04:51.410> perfectly<00:04:52.270> and<00:04:53.270> that's<00:04:53.870> how<00:04:54.050> I

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
removes hair perfectly and that's how I

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.700 
removes hair perfectly and that's how I
sharpen<00:04:54.440> a<00:04:54.500> knife<00:04:54.530> thanks<00:04:55.280> for<00:04:55.400> watching
