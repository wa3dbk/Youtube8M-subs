 hello guys and girls welcome to 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:11.170
 channel today's video is a mix the 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.589
 mix that you use in the video 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:19.110
 spring and these were the materials 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:21.170
 that I used were a leaders 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:26.490
 yellow color in various shades 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:28.970
 also to that of yellow angel with that of 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.300
 golden holographic siren and a leader 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.040
 silver or achieve succumb the end 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.730
 so what I did was mix all 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.510
 these leaders 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.019
 come on 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.690
 of the silver leader I did not put as much as 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.429
 you others because if I put you on 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.940
 more then I could change a bit the 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:53.129
 tonality of yellow could get a 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.920
 little dark I wanted him strong 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.979
 the yellow then it was like that and then I 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.829
 I realized that I wanted another little bit more 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:02.649
 d 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.800

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.470

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.000
