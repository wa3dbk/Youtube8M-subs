00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.169
 again a royal friend gamer bringing him 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.389
 it's a new video today we're going to 

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:10.969
 bring a video of the series that you do not do 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.099
 in gears of war 3 this is going to be the 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.990
 chapter number 2 since I made one when 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.760
 start the channel and now I come to resume 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.590
 this series because I have internet already 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.240
 I have gears of war 3 the ones that are me 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.610
 they will continue on facebook they will know that I did not have 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.230
 faith did not have internet sorry good 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.850
 so I want to restart it because 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.400
 It is very important to me what you 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.280
 do in gears of war 3 or whatever 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.530
 do and what not to do because because what 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.600
 what they do gives them social death gives them 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.430
 that you kill the enemy but what 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.620
 do not do what I come to tell you 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.600
 it helps not to die so much when you 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.760
 they are playing they already know that they do not 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.460
 whenever they have that wants to stay with 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.560
 greater this that you have killed 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.210
 that and minors this have killed them 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.530
 true band then why do you 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.120
 I bring the video of today I hope 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.190
 you like let's start with the topic 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.250
 good to send what I have to say what 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.770
 that do not ask for software 3 tries 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.239
 about not standing still you were 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.699
 real, what's wrong with staying 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.900
 stopped good on the maps where there 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.960
 sniper 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.000
 you stand half a second and you 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.560
 fly in the head as we see in the 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.540
 videos below that I'll be 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.400
 going on I'm not very good with the 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.890
 sniper but as the person who is 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.560
 playing on the other side is stopped 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.000
 a very easy target for me that is I do not 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.500
 them the sniper but in case you stay 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.870
 stopped I easily get back to the 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.390
 head ok if we are going to go pull out a trick 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.030
 of a hat that are three shots of three 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.280
 headshots three facts in a row or 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.110
 be I took it out in my life taken that 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.119
 because I'm not good with the sniper 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.160
 but as the person did not move he gives me 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.590
 the all the advantage that louis I 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.180
 I fired the sniper and killed him and 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.070
 we see the video here I also commit 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.810
 same mistake I wanted to give him with the sniper 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.460
 and I stayed still without moving and 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.410
 they quickly lowered me is what they 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.910
 I come to say I also committed my role 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.080
 I will also try to improve myself 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.610
 game 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.979
 ok band I hope and I understand what they 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.960
 I want to transmit on maps where no 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.760
 there sniper is that you can 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.940
 stand without any problem 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.820
 because nobody's going to blow your head ok 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.290
 well by far these are going to be that 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.850
 I pull them fences 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.560
 but good band I hope and they have me 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.830
 captured the idea that you can not 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.080
 stay 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.270
 standing in places where there is a sniper 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.610
 ok the slider may be from the 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.530
 other side of the map and you can fly the 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.780
 head even if you're on the other side if 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.600
 you do not move ok then my advice is 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.130
 that are not to do not do not know 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.020
 stand still please do not stay 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.330
 standing in when you are 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.210
 playing on a map that has a sniper 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.000
 what I advise you to do for that 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.460
 is that they are in constant movement or 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.350
 that when I saw sniper this always 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.410
 you have to be in motion you never 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.060
 you are standing ok but also 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.860
 conquer that movement you can fly 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.870
 the head or that you can come across a 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.400
 reilly that is very good the slider and you 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.110
 it hurts the head in that flight though 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.209
 Skip three laps we have 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.400
 from one place to another makes you blind was and you 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.810
 makes pieces hahaha good not a rail and 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.480
 they know I 'm not very good but if 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.100
 someone who is pro with the sniper but 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.660
 to make life more difficult for 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.760
 you do not stand with the 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.560
 sniper ok band I hope you liked it 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.140

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.850
 this video improve their gameplay in 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.660
 the course for three and go a lot 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.580
 best 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.500
 I will also try to apply these 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.460
 advice that I give to myself and the 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.560
 transmit to you 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.240

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.010
 I leave twitter facebook and freedom 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.030
