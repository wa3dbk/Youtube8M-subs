00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
different national events you come out

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.029 
different national events you come out
with<00:01:06.430> dynamics<00:01:07.240> and<00:01:07.479> the<00:01:07.540> vehicles<00:01:08.229> because

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
with dynamics and the vehicles because

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:12.749 
with dynamics and the vehicles because
it<00:01:09.909> first<00:01:10.179> of<00:01:10.329> all<00:01:10.420> it's<00:01:10.539> a<00:01:10.600> free<00:01:11.399> dyno<00:01:12.399> run

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
it first of all it's a free dyno run

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.450 
it first of all it's a free dyno run
which<00:01:13.060> is<00:01:13.179> a<00:01:13.210> $75<00:01:14.079> value<00:01:14.560> you<00:01:14.829> get<00:01:14.979> to<00:01:15.100> put<00:01:15.310> down

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
which is a $75 value you get to put down

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.849 
which is a $75 value you get to put down
two<00:01:15.700> different<00:01:15.820> holes<00:01:16.329> on<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:16.810> dyno<00:01:17.020> but<00:01:17.679> more

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:17.859 
two different holes on the dyno but more

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:20.069 
two different holes on the dyno but more
importantly<00:01:18.340> if<00:01:18.609> you<00:01:18.729> do<00:01:18.880> Dino<00:01:19.390> with<00:01:19.659> dynamics

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
importantly if you do Dino with dynamics

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:23.010 
importantly if you do Dino with dynamics
on<00:01:20.289> your<00:01:20.439> vehicle<00:01:20.829> then<00:01:21.460> you<00:01:21.850> entered<00:01:22.659> into

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
on your vehicle then you entered into

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.230 
on your vehicle then you entered into
the<00:01:23.109> national<00:01:23.560> ranking<00:01:24.009> for<00:01:24.670> that<00:01:25.030> final

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
the national ranking for that final

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.899 
the national ranking for that final
shootout<00:01:25.990> competition<00:01:26.950> out<00:01:27.159> at<00:01:27.399> SEMA<00:01:27.759> this

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
shootout competition out at SEMA this

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.809

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
benefit come out with the dynamics

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.190 
benefit come out with the dynamics
mufflers<00:01:33.460> already<00:01:33.850> on<00:01:33.999> their<00:01:34.179> cars<00:01:34.420> and<00:01:34.749> come

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
mufflers already on their cars and come

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.109 
mufflers already on their cars and come
out<00:01:35.350> Dino<00:01:35.590> have<00:01:35.950> a<00:01:35.979> great<00:01:36.249> time<00:01:36.490> find<00:01:36.880> out<00:01:36.999> how

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119
