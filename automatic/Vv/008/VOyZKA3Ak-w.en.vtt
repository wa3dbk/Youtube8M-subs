hey<00:00:00.120> I'm<00:00:00.240> mark<00:00:00.570> and<00:00:00.810> today<00:00:01.110> science<00:00:01.560> project

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
hey I'm mark and today science project

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.880 
hey I'm mark and today science project
is<00:00:02.520> hot<00:00:03.419> ice<00:00:03.689> we're<00:00:04.140> going<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:04.350> be<00:00:04.500> using

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
is hot ice we're going to be using

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.459 
is hot ice we're going to be using
sodium<00:00:05.370> acetate<00:00:06.799> it<00:00:07.799> is<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.760> kind<00:00:09.750> of<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.900> crystal

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
sodium acetate it is a kind of a crystal

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.200 
sodium acetate it is a kind of a crystal
and<00:00:10.620> looking<00:00:10.980> material<00:00:11.130> kind<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:11.940> looks<00:00:12.120> like

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
and looking material kind of looks like

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.460 
and looking material kind of looks like
shaved<00:00:12.960> ice<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:14.420> distilled<00:00:15.420> water<00:00:15.719> we're

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
shaved ice and distilled water we're

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.970 
shaved ice and distilled water we're
going<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.770> be<00:00:17.150> dissolving<00:00:18.150> as<00:00:18.359> much<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:19.619> the

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
going to be dissolving as much of the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.599 
going to be dissolving as much of the
acetate<00:00:20.580> into<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.330> water<00:00:21.600> as<00:00:21.869> we<00:00:22.109> can<00:00:22.160> and<00:00:23.160> I

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
acetate into the water as we can and I

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.070 
acetate into the water as we can and I
will<00:00:23.670> heat<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.180> up<00:00:24.269> on<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.480> little<00:00:24.779> burner<00:00:24.990> and

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
will heat it up on a little burner and

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.589 
will heat it up on a little burner and
then<00:00:28.080> after<00:00:28.439> we'll<00:00:29.369> shut<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.789> down<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.300> let<00:00:30.480> it

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
then after we'll shut it down and let it

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.420 
then after we'll shut it down and let it
cool<00:00:30.750> off<00:00:30.960> for<00:00:30.990> about<00:00:31.410> five<00:00:31.679> minutes<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.160> pour

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
cool off for about five minutes and pour

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.479 
cool off for about five minutes and pour
it<00:00:32.520> into<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.910> nice<00:00:33.899> tray<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:35.190> want<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.399> make

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
it into a nice tray you want to make

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.190 
it into a nice tray you want to make
sure<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.000> clean<00:00:36.270> all<00:00:36.480> your<00:00:36.660> tools<00:00:36.930> and

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
sure that you clean all your tools and

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.190 
sure that you clean all your tools and
your<00:00:37.260> ice<00:00:37.440> tray<00:00:37.770> with<00:00:38.070> distilled<00:00:38.520> water

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
your ice tray with distilled water

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.209 
your ice tray with distilled water
before<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.290> start<00:00:40.620> don't<00:00:40.829> want<00:00:40.980> any

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
before you start don't want any

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.910 
before you start don't want any
contaminants<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.210> then<00:00:43.079> we'll<00:00:43.320> stick<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
contaminants in it then we'll stick the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.010 
contaminants in it then we'll stick the
ice<00:00:44.309> tray<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> refrigerator<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.809> just

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
ice tray in the refrigerator and just

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.779 
ice tray in the refrigerator and just
let<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.379> get<00:00:46.890> cool<00:00:48.980> this<00:00:49.980> trick<00:00:50.399> will<00:00:51.110> let<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
let it get cool this trick will let the

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.939 
let it get cool this trick will let the
liquid<00:00:53.789> water<00:00:54.270> looks<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:55.110> clear<00:00:55.920> water

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
liquid water looks just like clear water

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.459 
liquid water looks just like clear water
and<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.600> will<00:00:57.750> stay<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> liquid<00:00:58.980> even<00:00:59.280> below<00:00:59.609> the

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
and it will stay a liquid even below the

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.490 
and it will stay a liquid even below the
melting<00:01:01.469> point<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:02.100> acetate<00:01:03.320> until<00:01:04.320> it's

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
melting point of acetate until it's

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.289 
melting point of acetate until it's
triggered<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.400> trigger<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:05.970> simply

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
triggered and to trigger it you simply

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.330 
triggered and to trigger it you simply
take<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> little<00:01:06.840> bit<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.500> acetate<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.189> your

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
take a little bit of the acetate on your

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.149 
take a little bit of the acetate on your
finger<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:09.840> touch<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.530> ice<00:01:10.799> tray

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
finger and you can touch the ice tray

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.600 
finger and you can touch the ice tray
with<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:12.450> second<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.020> touch<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:14.280> makes

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
with it the second you touch it it makes

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.609 
with it the second you touch it it makes
it<00:01:14.820> crystallize<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.930> looks<00:01:16.140> like<00:01:16.229> it's

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
it crystallize and it looks like it's

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.190 
it crystallize and it looks like it's
turns<00:01:17.580> into<00:01:17.790> ice<00:01:18.000> even<00:01:18.600> though<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:18.900> actually

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
turns into ice even though it's actually

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.130 
turns into ice even though it's actually
letting<00:01:19.409> off<00:01:19.560> heat<00:01:20.000> but<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.570> would<00:01:21.780> appear

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
letting off heat but it would appear

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.600 
letting off heat but it would appear
that<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.439> looks<00:01:22.619> like<00:01:22.799> ice<00:01:23.040> it's<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.430> neat

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
that it looks like ice it's a neat

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.370 
that it looks like ice it's a neat
little<00:01:23.640> trick<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.360> tell<00:01:24.780> your<00:01:24.930> friends

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
little trick you can tell your friends

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.320 
little trick you can tell your friends
that<00:01:25.409> your<00:01:25.950> winter<00:01:26.250> miser<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.939> everything

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
that your winter miser and everything

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.499 
that your winter miser and everything
you<00:01:27.479> touch<00:01:27.720> turns<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.710> ice<00:01:29.090> so<00:01:30.090> let's<00:01:30.270> get<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
you touch turns to ice so let's get the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.010 
you touch turns to ice so let's get the
burner<00:01:30.720> started<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.799> water<00:01:32.130> warmed<00:01:32.490> up

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
burner started and the water warmed up

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.880 
burner started and the water warmed up
all<00:01:34.020> right<00:01:34.140> I'm<00:01:34.229> gonna<00:01:34.320> take<00:01:34.470> some<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
all right I'm gonna take some of the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.080 
all right I'm gonna take some of the
sodium<00:01:35.220> acetate<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:37.340> put<00:01:38.340> about<00:01:38.579> 40

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
sodium acetate and put about 40

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.390 
sodium acetate and put about 40
tablespoons<00:01:39.780> into<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> cup<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.250> distilled

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
tablespoons into a cup of distilled

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.170 
tablespoons into a cup of distilled
water<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:43.070> then<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.399> got<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.850> under<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> little

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
water and then I got it under a little

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.510 
water and then I got it under a little
bit<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.600> heat<00:01:45.869> not<00:01:46.380> boiling<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.189> got<00:01:47.369> it

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
bit of heat not boiling that just got it

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.859 
bit of heat not boiling that just got it
pretty<00:01:47.850> hot<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:49.070> slowly<00:01:50.070> add<00:01:50.869> some

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
pretty hot and slowly add some

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.810 
pretty hot and slowly add some
tablespoons<00:01:52.530> until<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.310> completely

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
tablespoons until it completely

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.569 
tablespoons until it completely
dissolves<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:56.700> when<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:56.969> get<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.479> where<00:01:58.579> it's

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
dissolves and when you get to where it's

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.249 
dissolves and when you get to where it's
not<00:01:59.790> quite<00:02:00.119> dissolving<00:02:00.810> all<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.049> way<00:02:01.140> it's

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
not quite dissolving all the way it's

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.100 
not quite dissolving all the way it's
kind<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.590> getting<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.310> little<00:02:02.549> bit<00:02:02.909> thick<00:02:03.270> not

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
kind of getting a little bit thick not

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.929 
kind of getting a little bit thick not
like<00:02:04.320> syrup<00:02:04.649> but<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.159> can<00:02:05.310> tell<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.610> Snickers

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
like syrup but you can tell the Snickers

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:06.580 
like syrup but you can tell the Snickers
in<00:02:06.060> water

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
in water

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.070 
in water
then<00:02:07.310> you<00:02:07.490> know<00:02:07.670> you're<00:02:08.000> right<00:02:08.660> at<00:02:08.810> where<00:02:08.959> you

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
then you know you're right at where you

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.040 
then you know you're right at where you
need<00:02:09.289> to<00:02:09.379> be<00:02:09.410> in<00:02:09.800> it<00:02:10.390> it's<00:02:11.390> not<00:02:11.599> quite<00:02:12.019> all

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
need to be in it it's not quite all

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.050 
need to be in it it's not quite all
dissolved<00:02:12.980> on<00:02:13.099> the<00:02:13.220> bottom<00:02:13.610> then<00:02:13.760> you<00:02:13.879> can

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
dissolved on the bottom then you can

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.940 
dissolved on the bottom then you can
have<00:02:14.239> a<00:02:14.269> few<00:02:14.629> drops<00:02:14.840> of<00:02:15.140> distilled<00:02:15.349> water<00:02:15.620> to

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
have a few drops of distilled water to

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.970 
have a few drops of distilled water to
get<00:02:16.040> it<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:16.310> dissolve<00:02:17.379> well<00:02:18.379> this<00:02:18.530> is<00:02:18.709> about

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
get it to dissolve well this is about

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.100 
get it to dissolve well this is about
ready<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:20.319> a<00:02:21.319> couple<00:02:21.590> more<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:23.480> we'll<00:02:23.840> pour

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
ready and a couple more and we'll pour

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.759 
ready and a couple more and we'll pour
it<00:02:24.260> into<00:02:24.440> our<00:02:24.940> ice<00:02:25.940> tray<00:02:26.390> into<00:02:26.720> another<00:02:27.470> cup

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
it into our ice tray into another cup

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.630 
it into our ice tray into another cup
and<00:02:28.629> then<00:02:29.629> frigerator<00:02:30.170> all<00:02:30.950> right<00:02:31.160> I<00:02:31.190> poured

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
and then frigerator all right I poured

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.619 
and then frigerator all right I poured
it<00:02:31.790> into<00:02:32.239> the<00:02:32.599> ice<00:02:32.959> tray<00:02:33.459> and<00:02:34.459> I<00:02:34.610> let<00:02:34.879> it<00:02:35.030> cool

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
it into the ice tray and I let it cool

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.170 
it into the ice tray and I let it cool
for<00:02:35.930> a<00:02:35.989> few<00:02:36.200> hours<00:02:36.230> in<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.709> refrigerator<00:02:37.180> and

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
for a few hours in the refrigerator and

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.640 
for a few hours in the refrigerator and
there<00:02:38.330> was<00:02:38.450> some<00:02:38.660> leftover<00:02:39.290> I<00:02:39.319> poured<00:02:39.620> some

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
there was some leftover I poured some

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.259 
there was some leftover I poured some
into<00:02:39.829> another<00:02:40.280> cup<00:02:40.610> which<00:02:40.819> we're<00:02:41.000> going<00:02:41.120> to<00:02:41.180> do

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
into another cup which we're going to do

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.059 
into another cup which we're going to do
another<00:02:41.540> experiment<00:02:41.900> with<00:02:42.349> here<00:02:42.530> in<00:02:42.590> a<00:02:42.620> second

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
another experiment with here in a second

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.250 
another experiment with here in a second
and<00:02:43.280> there<00:02:44.000> was<00:02:44.120> still<00:02:44.269> some<00:02:44.510> left<00:02:44.690> in<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:44.930> pot

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
and there was still some left in the pot

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.970 
and there was still some left in the pot
you<00:02:45.290> can<00:02:45.680> see<00:02:46.329> that<00:02:47.329> it<00:02:47.709> crystallized<00:02:48.709> in

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
you can see that it crystallized in

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.160 
you can see that it crystallized in
there<00:02:49.190> if<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:50.030> let<00:02:50.180> it<00:02:50.209> just<00:02:50.540> cool<00:02:50.720> down<00:02:50.750> all

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
there if you let it just cool down all

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.080 
there if you let it just cool down all
the<00:02:51.230> way<00:02:51.349> on<00:02:51.530> its<00:02:51.680> own<00:02:51.860> it<00:02:52.129> will<00:02:52.280> you're<00:02:52.790> going

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
the way on its own it will you're going

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.789 
the way on its own it will you're going
crystallized<00:02:53.660> but<00:02:53.959> if<00:02:54.110> you<00:02:54.290> stick<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.650> in<00:02:54.739> the

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
crystallized but if you stick it in the

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.330 
crystallized but if you stick it in the
refrigerator<00:02:55.120> we're<00:02:56.120> on<00:02:56.239> ice<00:02:57.129> while<00:02:58.129> it's

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
refrigerator we're on ice while it's

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.369 
refrigerator we're on ice while it's
still<00:02:58.549> warm<00:02:58.849> it's<00:02:59.329> kind<00:02:59.810> of<00:02:59.900> a<00:03:00.019> phenomenon

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
still warm it's kind of a phenomenon

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.589 
still warm it's kind of a phenomenon
thing<00:03:00.860> it<00:03:01.040> will<00:03:01.220> stay<00:03:01.549> a<00:03:01.579> liquid<00:03:02.090> even<00:03:02.329> below

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
thing it will stay a liquid even below

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.110 
thing it will stay a liquid even below
its<00:03:02.780> melting<00:03:02.840> point<00:03:03.410> so<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:04.250> trigger<00:03:04.670> this<00:03:04.879> I

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
its melting point so to trigger this I

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.289 
its melting point so to trigger this I
want<00:03:05.299> to<00:03:05.360> put<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.540> little<00:03:05.720> bit<00:03:06.700> of<00:03:07.700> that<00:03:07.940> on<00:03:08.120> my

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
want to put a little bit of that on my

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.280 
want to put a little bit of that on my
finger<00:03:09.730> and<00:03:10.730> these<00:03:10.970> crystals<00:03:11.510> will<00:03:11.690> activate

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
finger and these crystals will activate

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.129 
finger and these crystals will activate
the<00:03:12.500> whole<00:03:12.680> thing<00:03:13.299> let<00:03:14.299> me<00:03:14.329> get<00:03:14.569> right<00:03:14.780> I'm

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:15.139 
the whole thing let me get right I'm

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:22.000 
the whole thing let me get right I'm
gonna<00:03:17.859> wanna<00:03:18.859> touch<00:03:19.190> it<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:20.799> see<00:03:21.799> what

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
gonna wanna touch it and see what

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:33.210 
gonna wanna touch it and see what
happens

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.490 

actually<00:03:34.120> letting<00:03:34.450> off<00:03:34.600> heat<00:03:34.930> but<00:03:35.170> it<00:03:35.290> looks

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
actually letting off heat but it looks

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.370 
actually letting off heat but it looks
like<00:03:35.940> it<00:03:36.940> looks<00:03:37.120> like<00:03:37.330> I<00:03:37.480> touched<00:03:37.810> it<00:03:38.020> and<00:03:38.140> made

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
like it looks like I touched it and made

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:56.630 
like it looks like I touched it and made
it<00:03:38.410> freeze

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.460 

it's<00:03:57.640> actually<00:03:57.970> caught<00:03:58.180> quite<00:03:58.600> warm<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:01.470> kind

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
it's actually caught quite warm and kind

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.860 
it's actually caught quite warm and kind
of<00:04:02.530> spongy<00:04:03.070> feeling<00:04:03.310> not<00:04:03.850> not<00:04:04.270> as<00:04:04.420> quite<00:04:04.840> as

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
of spongy feeling not not as quite as

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.540 
of spongy feeling not not as quite as
hard<00:04:05.200> as<00:04:05.350> ice<00:04:07.080> trick<00:04:08.080> trick<00:04:08.800> you<00:04:08.950> can<00:04:09.100> do<00:04:09.280> I'm

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
hard as ice trick trick you can do I'm

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.320 
hard as ice trick trick you can do I'm
gonna<00:04:09.700> take<00:04:11.400> some<00:04:12.400> of<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.580> shavings<00:04:13.060> that<00:04:13.120> are

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
gonna take some of the shavings that are

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:21.180 
gonna take some of the shavings that are
left<00:04:13.570> over<00:04:13.780> in<00:04:13.990> the<00:04:14.110> pot<00:04:19.769> put<00:04:20.769> some<00:04:20.980> on<00:04:21.100> a<00:04:21.130> plate

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
left over in the pot put some on a plate

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:32.640 
left over in the pot put some on a plate
I<00:04:25.320> had<00:04:26.320> a<00:04:26.350> little<00:04:26.560> leftover<00:04:31.200> and<00:04:32.200> I'm<00:04:32.320> going<00:04:32.620> to

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
I had a little leftover and I'm going to

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.480 
I had a little leftover and I'm going to
slowly<00:04:33.190> dribble<00:04:33.910> it<00:04:34.800> under<00:04:35.800> those<00:04:35.920> crystals

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
slowly dribble it under those crystals

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.340 
slowly dribble it under those crystals
and<00:04:36.610> then<00:04:36.730> make<00:04:36.910> this<00:04:37.150> liquid<00:04:37.630> crystallized

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
and then make this liquid crystallized

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.210 
and then make this liquid crystallized
and<00:04:38.770> we<00:04:39.130> can<00:04:39.340> make<00:04:39.520> like<00:04:39.730> a<00:04:39.760> stalactite<00:04:41.220> kind

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
and we can make like a stalactite kind

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.860 
and we can make like a stalactite kind
of<00:04:42.280> like<00:04:42.370> an<00:04:42.520> ice<00:04:42.730> sculpture<00:04:43.240> and<00:04:43.570> it<00:04:43.720> will

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
of like an ice sculpture and it will

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.180 
of like an ice sculpture and it will
stay<00:04:44.910> it<00:04:45.910> will<00:04:46.090> stay<00:04:46.420> like<00:04:47.110> it's<00:04:47.380> frozen<00:04:47.740> until

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
stay it will stay like it's frozen until

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.520 
stay it will stay like it's frozen until
you<00:04:48.670> eat<00:04:48.970> it<00:04:49.090> back<00:04:49.270> up<00:04:49.540> you<00:04:50.200> can<00:04:50.380> do<00:04:50.500> this

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
you eat it back up you can do this

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.490 
you eat it back up you can do this
experiment<00:04:51.280> over<00:04:51.400> and<00:04:51.580> over<00:04:51.700> and<00:04:51.940> over<00:04:52.120> again

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
experiment over and over and over again

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.530 
experiment over and over and over again
it<00:04:54.960> just<00:04:55.960> heat<00:04:56.110> it<00:04:56.140> back<00:04:56.260> up<00:04:57.060> pour<00:04:58.060> your<00:04:58.210> liquid

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
it just heat it back up pour your liquid

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:07.440 
it just heat it back up pour your liquid
into<00:04:58.750> a<00:04:58.780> clean<00:04:59.470> container<00:05:01.620> and<00:05:06.150> don't<00:05:07.150> touch

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
into a clean container and don't touch
