little<00:00:42.570> bit<00:00:42.809> quickly<00:00:43.079> always<00:00:43.590> going<00:00:43.770> out

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
little bit quickly always going out

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.340 
little bit quickly always going out
their<00:00:44.370> periods<00:00:44.789> where<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.350> opposition's

the goalkicking and other conditions of
thought<00:03:14.720> with<00:03:14.900> an<00:03:15.019> example<00:03:15.709> yeah<00:03:16.459> we<00:03:16.610> let

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
thought with an example yeah we let

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.110 
thought with an example yeah we let
ourselves<00:03:16.879> down<00:03:17.209> last<00:03:17.599> waiting<00:03:17.959> okay<00:03:19.120> all

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
ourselves down last waiting okay all

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.580 
ourselves down last waiting okay all
that<00:03:20.209> second<00:03:20.569> a<00:03:20.659> performance<00:03:21.230> that's<00:03:21.409> where

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
that second a performance that's where

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.130 
that second a performance that's where
he<00:03:21.650> lies<00:03:21.799> down<00:03:21.829> and<00:03:22.510> points<00:03:23.510> difference<00:03:23.900> we're

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
he lies down and points difference we're

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.600 
he lies down and points difference we're
not<00:03:24.260> going<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.530> be<00:03:24.650> able<00:03:24.680> to<00:03:24.950> get<00:03:25.129> others<00:03:25.370> field

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
not going to be able to get others field

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.170 
not going to be able to get others field
so<00:03:26.260> it's<00:03:27.260> disappointing<00:03:27.709> book<00:03:28.099> I<00:03:28.489> think<00:03:29.000> it's

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
so it's disappointing book I think it's

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.569 
so it's disappointing book I think it's
all<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.810> hotels<00:03:30.200> out<00:03:30.410> lassies<00:03:30.920> and<00:03:31.160> we<00:03:31.310> still

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
in a good spot if we could be gone into

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.580 
in a good spot if we could be gone into
next<00:03:34.549> week<00:03:34.760> he<00:03:34.940> give<00:03:35.180> us<00:03:35.299> I<00:03:35.510> see<00:03:36.049> has<00:03:36.230> even

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
next week he give us I see has even

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.740 
next week he give us I see has even
equal<00:03:37.040> path<00:03:37.280> to<00:03:37.489> be<00:03:37.609> honest<00:03:37.819> so<00:03:38.030> yeah<00:03:38.299> you<00:03:38.629> know

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
equal path to be honest so yeah you know

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.459 
equal path to be honest so yeah you know
I<00:03:38.780> think<00:03:39.170> it'd<00:03:39.500> be<00:03:39.530> a<00:03:39.950> great<00:03:40.160> effort
