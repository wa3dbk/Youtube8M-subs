profiles on that computer on DB 0 1 some

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.750 
profiles on that computer on DB 0 1 some
properties<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.290> interests<00:00:43.740> are<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.920> last<00:00:44.370> use

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
properties of interests are the last use

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.430 
properties of interests are the last use
time<00:00:45.060> with<00:00:45.300> chosing<00:00:45.630> when<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.930> profile<00:00:46.320> was

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
time with chosing when that profile was

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.240 
time with chosing when that profile was
last<00:00:46.680> used<00:00:47.030> the<00:00:48.410> local<00:00:49.410> path<00:00:49.620> which<00:00:49.920> helps<00:00:50.160> me

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
last used the local path which helps me

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.250 
last used the local path which helps me
identify<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.790> user<00:00:51.180> name<00:00:51.480> actually<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.020> CID

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
identify the user name actually the CID

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.860 
identify the user name actually the CID
will<00:00:52.440> be<00:00:52.470> the<00:00:52.650> best<00:00:52.800> way<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.340> do<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.390> then

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
will be the best way to do that and then

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.710 
will be the best way to do that and then
also<00:00:55.400> special<00:00:56.400> which<00:00:56.700> indicates<00:00:57.180> whether<00:00:57.390> it

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
also special which indicates whether it

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.610 
also special which indicates whether it
is<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:59.030> one<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.240> new<00:01:00.390> service<00:01:00.990> related

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
is a one of the new service related

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.920 
is a one of the new service related
profiles<00:01:02.580> which<00:01:02.850> we<00:01:03.030> typically<00:01:03.390> don't<00:01:03.630> want

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
profiles which we typically don't want

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.749 
profiles which we typically don't want
to<00:01:04.260> muck<00:01:05.189> around<00:01:05.339> with<00:01:07.310> so<00:01:08.310> let's<00:01:08.490> run<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
to muck around with so let's run the

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.969 
to muck around with so let's run the
command<00:01:08.969> again<00:01:12.079> this<00:01:13.079> time<00:01:13.320> let's<00:01:13.500> filter<00:01:13.740> out

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
command again this time let's filter out

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.169 
command again this time let's filter out
those<00:01:14.130> special<00:01:15.229> profiles<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:17.189> all<00:01:17.280> ones<00:01:17.880> that

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:18.179 
those special profiles so all ones that

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:21.050 
those special profiles so all ones that
are<00:01:18.329> not<00:01:18.710> special<00:01:19.710> or<00:01:19.920> do<00:01:20.579> this<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:20.850> to

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
are not special or do this on to

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.270 
are not special or do this on to
computers<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.570> time<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.079> when<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.799> select<00:01:23.189> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
computers this time and when it select a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.429 
computers this time and when it select a
few<00:01:23.399> properties<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:23.909> are<00:01:24.359> really<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.350> ones

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
few properties that are really the ones

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.580 
few properties that are really the ones
were<00:01:25.679> interested<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:27.049> now<00:01:28.049> there<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.320> no

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
were interested in now there is no

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.440 
were interested in now there is no
property<00:01:29.130> for<00:01:29.460> computer<00:01:29.850> name<00:01:29.999> so<00:01:30.149> I<00:01:30.210> have<00:01:30.329> to

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
property for computer name so I have to

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.109 
property for computer name so I have to
grab<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.810> system<00:01:31.049> property<00:01:32.119> double

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
grab the system property double

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.809 
grab the system property double
underscore<00:01:33.390> server<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.549> there<00:01:35.549> as<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.700> result

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819

not<00:01:36.179> formatted<00:01:36.719> the<00:01:36.990> best<00:01:37.170> way<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.619> let's<00:01:38.130> fix

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
not formatted the best way so let's fix

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.859 
not formatted the best way so let's fix
that<00:01:39.289> then<00:01:40.289> get<00:01:40.590> W<00:01:40.890> my<00:01:41.009> object<00:01:41.460> for<00:01:41.819> the<00:01:41.999> win32

that then get W my object for the win32

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.749 
that then get W my object for the win32

it<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.460> little<00:02:11.610> bit<00:02:11.730> easier<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.210> read<00:02:12.360> on<00:02:12.390> the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
it a little bit easier to read on the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.400 
it a little bit easier to read on the
screen<00:02:12.950> good<00:02:13.950> there<00:02:14.580> are<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:15.120> profiles<00:02:15.630> that

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
screen good there are the profiles that

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.730 
screen good there are the profiles that
on<00:02:17.040> these<00:02:17.430> servers<00:02:17.880> that<00:02:18.270> I<00:02:18.330> queried<00:02:18.840> you

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
on these servers that I queried you

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.970 
on these servers that I queried you
could<00:02:19.890> easily<00:02:20.010> scale<00:02:20.550> this<00:02:20.700> out<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.270> query

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
could easily scale this out to query

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.770 
could easily scale this out to query
multiple<00:02:22.980> servers<00:02:23.400> or<00:02:23.700> desktops<00:02:24.240> or<00:02:24.420> whatever

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
multiple servers or desktops or whatever

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.580 
multiple servers or desktops or whatever
you<00:02:24.990> would<00:02:25.170> like<00:02:25.520> to<00:02:26.520> do<00:02:26.840> now<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.870> made<00:02:28.110> things<00:02:28.320> a

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
you would like to do now I made things a

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.900 
you would like to do now I made things a
little<00:02:28.680> bit<00:02:28.860> easier<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:29.310> now<00:02:29.490> have<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.670> rely<00:02:29.730> on

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
little bit easier so now have to rely on

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.450 
little bit easier so now have to rely on
that<00:02:30.750> type<00:02:31.050> of<00:02:31.080> command<00:02:32.010> all<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.190> time<00:02:32.430> I

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
that type of command all the time I

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.980 
that type of command all the time I
wrote<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.730> module<00:02:33.180> called<00:02:33.390> manage<00:02:33.810> user

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
wrote a module called manage user

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.810 
wrote a module called manage user

and<00:03:02.730> what<00:03:03.330> you<00:03:03.420> get<00:03:03.570> back<00:03:03.750> is<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:04.020> custom<00:03:04.530> object

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620

and what you get back is a custom object
that<00:03:05.610> does<00:03:05.970> a<00:03:06.000> lot<00:03:06.210> of<00:03:06.270> those<00:03:06.450> things<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:06.720> were

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
that does a lot of those things I were

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.340 
that does a lot of those things I were
manually<00:03:08.100> typing<00:03:08.490> in<00:03:08.640> such<00:03:08.820> as<00:03:09.350> converting

the last use time to a user-friendly

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.140 
the last use time to a user-friendly
format<00:03:13.980> getting<00:03:14.520> the<00:03:14.610> computer<00:03:14.850> name<00:03:15.120> and

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
format getting the computer name and

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.990 
format getting the computer name and
also<00:03:15.810> resolving<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.470> CID<00:03:16.740> to<00:03:17.070> an<00:03:17.310> account<00:03:17.640> so

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
also resolving the CID to an account so

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.420 
also resolving the CID to an account so
I<00:03:18.030> don't<00:03:18.270> have<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.630> rely<00:03:19.170> on<00:03:19.350> just<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.920> CID<00:03:20.160> and

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
I don't have to rely on just the CID and

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.000 
I don't have to rely on just the CID and
the<00:03:20.550> path<00:03:20.760> in<00:03:21.000> trying<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.600> identify<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:22.380> user

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
the path in trying to identify a user

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
the path in trying to identify a user
that<00:03:23.400> goes<00:03:23.580> with<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:24.260> profile<00:03:25.640> so<00:03:26.640> I<00:03:26.670> can<00:03:26.880> use

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
that goes with the profile so I can use

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.790 
that goes with the profile so I can use
it<00:03:27.060> like<00:03:27.300> this<00:03:27.450> let's<00:03:27.720> run<00:03:27.930> get<00:03:28.140> user<00:03:28.320> profile

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
it like this let's run get user profile

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.650 
it like this let's run get user profile
this<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:29.400> going<00:03:29.520> to<00:03:29.580> default<00:03:29.910> to<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.240> local

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
this is going to default to the local

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.400 
this is going to default to the local
computer<00:03:31.340> I'll<00:03:32.340> pipe<00:03:32.490> it<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:32.760> more<00:03:33.320> all<00:03:34.320> right

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
computer I'll pipe it to more all right

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.870 
computer I'll pipe it to more all right
so<00:03:34.590> those<00:03:34.740> are<00:03:34.890> all<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.070> profiles<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:35.820> you

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
so those are all the profiles and you

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.970 
so those are all the profiles and you
can<00:03:36.030> see<00:03:36.240> the<00:03:36.450> computer<00:03:36.720> name<00:03:37.020> and<00:03:37.260> the

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
can see the computer name and the

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.480 
can see the computer name and the
account<00:03:38.730> name<00:03:38.970> I<00:03:40.040> took<00:03:41.040> things<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.310> step

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
account name I took things a step

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.610 
account name I took things a step
further<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:42.450> can<00:03:42.630> also<00:03:42.780> get<00:03:43.050> these<00:03:43.230> sides

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
further and you can also get these sides

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.080 
further and you can also get these sides
of<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:43.980> property<00:03:44.310> because<00:03:44.520> I<00:03:44.580> have<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.790> local

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
of the property because I have the local

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.120 
of the property because I have the local
path<00:03:45.330> I<00:03:45.630> can<00:03:45.990> do<00:03:46.110> a<00:03:46.140> directory<00:03:46.560> listing<00:03:46.680> of

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
path I can do a directory listing of

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.210 
path I can do a directory listing of
that<00:03:47.340> path<00:03:47.580> and<00:03:47.820> measure<00:03:48.090> how<00:03:48.390> big<00:03:48.810> that<00:03:49.530> file

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
that path and measure how big that file

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.550 
that path and measure how big that file
folder<00:03:50.459> is<00:03:50.760> if<00:03:51.000> you<00:03:51.510> do<00:03:51.720> this<00:03:51.870> for<00:03:52.050> a<00:03:52.110> remote

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
folder is if you do this for a remote

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.590 
folder is if you do this for a remote
computer<00:03:52.830> this<00:03:53.160> will<00:03:53.400> require<00:03:53.730> PowerShell

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
computer this will require PowerShell

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.670 
computer this will require PowerShell
remoting

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
remoting

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.240 
remoting
and<00:03:57.110> so<00:03:58.110> now<00:03:58.290> let's<00:03:58.530> select<00:03:58.770> the<00:03:58.950> computer

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
and so now let's select the computer

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.680 
and so now let's select the computer
name<00:03:59.520> again<00:03:59.820> this<00:03:59.940> is<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.150> local<00:04:00.450> computer

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
name again this is the local computer

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.870 
name again this is the local computer
but<00:04:00.959> you<00:04:00.990> could<00:04:01.260> scale<00:04:01.590> this<00:04:01.740> out<00:04:01.920> get<00:04:02.760> the

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
but you could scale this out get the

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.930 
but you could scale this out get the
account<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.360> last<00:04:03.570> use<00:04:04.200> time<00:04:04.740> and<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.610> local

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
account the last use time and the local

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.910 
account the last use time and the local
size<00:04:06.090> and<00:04:06.510> again<00:04:06.660> I'll<00:04:06.810> format<00:04:07.230> this<00:04:07.350> as<00:04:07.410> a

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
size and again I'll format this as a

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.690 
size and again I'll format this as a
list<00:04:09.230> all<00:04:10.230> right<00:04:10.350> there<00:04:10.590> we<00:04:10.680> go<00:04:10.830> so<00:04:11.220> now<00:04:11.370> I<00:04:11.400> can

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
list all right there we go so now I can

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.000 
list all right there we go so now I can
see<00:04:11.880> on<00:04:12.090> one<00:04:12.390> computer<00:04:12.720> again<00:04:13.140> easy<00:04:13.470> to<00:04:13.740> scale

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
see on one computer again easy to scale

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.970 
see on one computer again easy to scale
out<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.970> as<00:04:15.060> many<00:04:15.090> as<00:04:15.450> you<00:04:15.630> need<00:04:15.660> all<00:04:16.440> the

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
out to as many as you need all the

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.460 
out to as many as you need all the
profiles<00:04:17.400> that<00:04:17.549> are<00:04:17.609> on<00:04:17.790> my<00:04:17.820> computer<00:04:18.380> now<00:04:19.380> the

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
profiles that are on my computer now the

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.020 
profiles that are on my computer now the
last<00:04:19.650> thing<00:04:19.799> we<00:04:19.980> need<00:04:20.010> to<00:04:20.250> do<00:04:20.370> is<00:04:20.549> I<00:04:20.700> may<00:04:20.880> need

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
last thing we need to do is I may need

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.270 
last thing we need to do is I may need
to<00:04:21.209> periodically<00:04:21.540> delete<00:04:22.170> profiles<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:23.010> might

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
to periodically delete profiles I might

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.420 
to periodically delete profiles I might
want<00:04:23.460> to<00:04:23.520> do<00:04:23.670> it<00:04:23.760> by<00:04:23.880> date<00:04:24.150> or<00:04:24.180> by<00:04:24.419> user<00:04:25.310> so<00:04:26.310> the

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
want to do it by date or by user so the

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.770 
want to do it by date or by user so the
situation<00:04:26.880> I<00:04:26.970> have<00:04:27.150> is<00:04:27.270> let's<00:04:27.419> say<00:04:27.570> that

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
situation I have is let's say that

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.340 
situation I have is let's say that
ROYGBIV<00:04:28.590> is<00:04:29.280> no<00:04:29.490> longer<00:04:29.729> that<00:04:29.880> company

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
ROYGBIV is no longer that company

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.410 
ROYGBIV is no longer that company
I want<00:04:30.620> to<00:04:30.800> delete<00:04:31.130> his<00:04:31.640> profile<00:04:32.120> and<00:04:32.330> this

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
I want to delete his profile and this

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.390 
I want to delete his profile and this
machine<00:04:32.750> or<00:04:32.930> perhaps<00:04:33.050> other<00:04:33.710> machines<00:04:34.280> that

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
machine or perhaps other machines that

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.720 
machine or perhaps other machines that
he<00:04:34.910> is<00:04:35.270> he's<00:04:35.990> logged<00:04:36.260> on<00:04:36.440> to<00:04:36.680> so<00:04:37.370> I<00:04:37.430> can<00:04:37.580> run<00:04:37.700> a

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
he is he's logged on to so I can run a

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.130 
he is he's logged on to so I can run a
command<00:04:38.000> like<00:04:38.210> this<00:04:38.330> I'm<00:04:38.510> going<00:04:38.600> to<00:04:38.690> use<00:04:38.900> my

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
command like this I'm going to use my

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.680 
command like this I'm going to use my
remove<00:04:39.620> User<00:04:39.950> Profile<00:04:40.550> function<00:04:41.360> that's<00:04:41.570> in

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
remove User Profile function that's in

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.560 
remove User Profile function that's in
the<00:04:41.780> module<00:04:42.640> so<00:04:43.640> we'll<00:04:43.790> do<00:04:43.910> get<00:04:44.120> user<00:04:44.330> profile

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
the module so we'll do get user profile

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.060 
the module so we'll do get user profile
where<00:04:47.570> the<00:04:47.810> account<00:04:48.110> matches<00:04:48.590> Roy's<00:04:49.310> name<00:04:49.700> and

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
where the account matches Roy's name and

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.790 
where the account matches Roy's name and
we're<00:04:52.070> pipe<00:04:52.250> that<00:04:52.460> to<00:04:52.640> remove<00:04:52.940> User<00:04:53.270> Profile

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
we're pipe that to remove User Profile

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.590 
we're pipe that to remove User Profile
now<00:04:54.800> the<00:04:54.860> function<00:04:55.220> supports<00:04:55.760> -<00:04:55.940> what<00:04:56.210> if<00:04:56.390> so

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
now the function supports - what if so

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.140 
now the function supports - what if so
if<00:04:56.660> you<00:04:56.750> want<00:04:56.960> to<00:04:57.020> verify<00:04:57.350> that<00:04:57.980> this<00:04:58.880> is<00:04:58.940> a

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
if you want to verify that this is a

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.770 
if you want to verify that this is a
fact<00:04:59.840> what<00:05:00.020> you<00:05:00.110> want<00:05:00.320> to<00:05:00.440> do<00:05:00.620> I<00:05:01.180> can<00:05:02.180> run<00:05:02.570> run

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
fact what you want to do I can run run

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.780 
fact what you want to do I can run run
if<00:05:02.900> and<00:05:03.080> I<00:05:03.110> can<00:05:03.260> see<00:05:03.410> if<00:05:03.500> I<00:05:03.590> had<00:05:03.770> run<00:05:04.670> that

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
if and I can see if I had run that

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.670 
if and I can see if I had run that
command<00:05:04.880> without<00:05:05.360> -<00:05:05.690> what<00:05:05.960> if<00:05:06.140> it<00:05:06.380> would<00:05:06.530> have

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
command without - what if it would have

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.680 
command without - what if it would have
deleted<00:05:06.950> Roy's<00:05:07.370> profile<00:05:08.180> in<00:05:08.330> this<00:05:08.480> machine

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
deleted Roy's profile in this machine

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.720 
deleted Roy's profile in this machine
I'm<00:05:09.050> gonna<00:05:09.260> leave<00:05:09.500> it<00:05:09.620> as<00:05:09.710> it<00:05:09.890> is<00:05:10.010> just<00:05:10.430> for<00:05:10.670> the

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
I'm gonna leave it as it is just for the

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.700 
I'm gonna leave it as it is just for the
sake<00:05:10.940> of<00:05:10.970> my<00:05:11.290> demonstration<00:05:12.290> I<00:05:12.350> think<00:05:12.560> youyou

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
sake of my demonstration I think youyou

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.690 
sake of my demonstration I think youyou
get<00:05:13.070> the<00:05:13.220> idea<00:05:13.520> so<00:05:14.590> we<00:05:15.590> can<00:05:15.770> use<00:05:15.920> WI<00:05:16.400> and

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
get the idea so we can use WI and

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.520 
get the idea so we can use WI and
PowerShell<00:05:17.450> to<00:05:17.480> really<00:05:17.900> get<00:05:18.050> a<00:05:18.080> good<00:05:18.320> handle
