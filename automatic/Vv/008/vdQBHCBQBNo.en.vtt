00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.340 
but what I did is i'm gonna gussy it up
a<00:00:38.010> little<00:00:38.129> bit<00:00:38.309> with<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.520> Plasti<00:00:39.030> Dip

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
a little bit with this Plasti Dip

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.389 
a little bit with this Plasti Dip
so<00:00:40.350> i'll<00:00:40.440> go<00:00:40.530> ahead<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.770> get<00:00:40.920> some<00:00:41.070> video<00:00:41.340> of

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
so i'll go ahead and get some video of

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.470 
so i'll go ahead and get some video of
that<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:42.710> we'll<00:00:43.710> go<00:00:43.829> from<00:00:43.950> there<00:00:44.270> all<00:00:45.270> right

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
that and we'll go from there all right

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.299 
that and we'll go from there all right
so<00:00:45.690> they<00:00:45.899> say<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.170> use<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.410> hanger<00:00:46.860> but<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.100> went

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
so they say to use a hanger but I went

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.610 
so they say to use a hanger but I went
ahead<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.550> used<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.910> rope<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.510> attached<00:00:49.350> up

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
ahead and used a rope I attached up

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.939 
ahead and used a rope I attached up
there<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.719> just<00:00:51.719> wrap<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.079> around<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.620> threads

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
there I just wrap it around the threads

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.920 
there I just wrap it around the threads
and<00:00:53.309> then<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.850> used<00:00:54.059> duct<00:00:54.360> tape<00:00:54.420> just<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.899> hold

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
and then I used duct tape just to hold

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.069 
and then I used duct tape just to hold
it<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:56.000> did<00:00:57.000> have<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.180> put<00:00:57.329> painters<00:00:57.690> tape<00:00:57.870> on

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
it on I did have to put painters tape on

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.599 
it on I did have to put painters tape on
the<00:00:58.170> end<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.350> had<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.500> take<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.770> cap<00:00:58.980> off<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.489> it

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
the end I had to take the cap off so it

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.209 
the end I had to take the cap off so it
actually<00:00:59.910> fit<00:01:00.149> in<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.359> bottle<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.219> I've

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
actually fit in the bottle and I've

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.340 
actually fit in the bottle and I've
never<00:01:02.399> used<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:02.789> Plasti<00:01:03.300> Dip<00:01:03.329> but<00:01:04.229> it's

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
never used this Plasti Dip but it's

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.469 
never used this Plasti Dip but it's
probably<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.680> drip<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.460> put<00:01:05.790> some<00:01:05.820> newspaper

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
probably a drip so I put some newspaper

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.140 
probably a drip so I put some newspaper
underneath<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.700> now<00:01:08.700> we're<00:01:08.850> going<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.000> go

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
underneath and now we're going to go

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.770 
underneath and now we're going to go
ahead<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.570> dip<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.350> per<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.780> manufacturer's

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
ahead and dip it per the manufacturer's

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.020 
ahead and dip it per the manufacturer's
instructions
