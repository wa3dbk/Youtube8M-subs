00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 greetings people here is block man the day 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.040
 today I come with a video of theories the 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.889
 today I bring some theories about 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.530
 steve universe in which I will talk about 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.460
 of some characters and a possible the already 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.340
 we will not start with this mysterious lion 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.949
 character is very useful having powers 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.630
 to travel of dimension in such dimension 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.150
 as it shows in the two episodes 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.359
 where he debuts as a main character 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.489
 He also has a sword which he gives it to 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.280
 steven so he can fight a 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.040
 robot you know very little about this 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.920
 character for his few appearances and his 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.140
 mystery haunts many theories one is 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.750
 which is also an old gene 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.640
 guardian of the city of sand 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.829
 transformed into a lion others say that 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.320
 the good can be a gene only that its 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.480
 gem is not yet revealed and that its 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.460
 lion's appearance is only one 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.280
 cover and come he could be a 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.070
 humanoid or a mythological creature like 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.930
 a mantis now a chimera another theory 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.240
 he says he is one of the many 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.810
 creations that roussel quartz left in 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.509
 100 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.369
 of dimensions and that his goal would be 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.979
 train this beni to guide him through 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.110
 different dimensions to be able to 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.299
 give him objects and educate him as a 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.759
 warrior being this the coach and 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.979
 developer of the skills of this 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.649
 well for the future it is believed that he is 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.110
 a rose quartz creation because of its 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.179
 color that waited for the series is another 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.240
 that almost everything that is pink 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:35.490
 belongs to or was created by rosa such as 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.399
 the musician who becomes a flower 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.650
 company with dinner the cannon of rose and 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:44.420
 possibly the lion 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.240
 second theory the rancor of the people 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.000
 it is believed that after the disappearance of rose 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.549
 because steven was born the gems 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.100
 they generated a big grudge against the father 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.830
 of steven blaming him for his leader and 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.960
 friend vanished since they almost 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.420
 never talk to him when steven what 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.880
 mentions pearl and amethyst show 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.759
 certain anger and distrust as in the 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.800
 episode of the laser in which amethyst 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.290
 says that he is useless and that 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.050
 lost and unsure that it is true the only 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.540
 that does not seem to hold much grudge is 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.120
 garner since she to be the most mature 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.280
 of the group prefer simply ignoring 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.150
 and treat him as a simple human neither 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.610
 friend neither to riad or just as a human 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.680
 third onion theory the villain 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.840
 principal 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.659
 this theory would start a drama and 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.970
 most disturbing aerial cream plot like 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:40.790
 we went on his appearance in the chapter 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.700
 the cool guys of steve universe is 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.459
 a pale young man almost albino with hair 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.920
 white onion very much like 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.019
 people after his appearance he noticed 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.840
 that he could be the older brother of 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.239
 onion more however I read a theory 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.579
 that I thought was more than disturbing 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.250
 but very fascinating apparently 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.739
 onion could well be two things a he 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.290
 it could be a kind of previous gem 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.480
 and ko too he could be an enemy and 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.700
 is that as we have seen most of 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.340
 the situations that involve the gene 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.590
 they are only in the search for objects 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.409
 that alter a dimension or cause 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.930
 disasters more we have never seen that 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:23.389
 they look specifically against a being or 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.670
 creature that really is more than a 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:29.000
 passenger villain as we have seen 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.350
 Onion is smart cheater and very 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.750
 astute being 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.300
 a very persistent trader like in the 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.280
 chapter that bears his name onion in 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.560
 which is shown as a boy 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.510
 cheat when leaving a machine 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.690
 dispenser with a bag of potatoes 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.120
 fried which implies that he stole it 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.000
 also as shown in the chapter 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.550
 too many birthdays when steven says 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.770
 look at the onion so innocent you see that 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.440
 he steals some tickets from the machine what 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.470
 which makes a cheat tickets thief 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.110
 who then exchanges for a motor scooter 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.450
 tiny theory that onion is actually 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.940
 a villain genius with the ability to 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.860
 change shape and as such onion 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.440
 it does not exist but at some point 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.960
 during the childhood of sour cream the 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.480
 he seemed and took that form to be 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.120
 go through young sour cream then 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:23.060
 Onion is actually the infant form 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.430
 of cream there would be in as much as the father 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.740
 of sour cream almost does not spend time with 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.170
 he does not know what sour cream grew 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.900
 then he believes that sour cream is in 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:35.390
 actually onion since onion open it 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.860
 to visit the port always makes people believe 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.069
 his father who actually 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.379
 has not grown some fans believe that 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:44.689
 onion could actually be the 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:47.120
 main villain of the series and that 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:49.069
 could be the counterpart of steven and 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.650
 that he could even lead a team 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:53.900
 of james similar to the friends of 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.050
 steven since as seen in the 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.969
 chapter friends bubbles when steven 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.590
 asks him to break with the harpoon the 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:03.020
 bubble in which the icon and it 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.930
 they find him trapped not only does he 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.469
 delighted but also shows a 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.150
 smile somewhat sadistic while 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:13.729
 exclusively points to the head of 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.800
 steven and is that it is also believed that what 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.349
 that he and many future villains 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.840
 will look for is the quartz gem of esteban 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:23.990
 since it is believed that it has a power 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.689
 gigantic which only a gene with 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.539
 a lot of experience and many years could 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:31.520
 to use a speculation is that if this 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:33.710
 theory is true in the chapters 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.080
 final onion revealed that he in 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.800
 reality is an enemy of gems and 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.319
 that he wants to take over the world 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.139
 but probably if onion was the 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:46.360
 main villain his powers would be the 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.759
 shape change the ability to 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.460
 invisibility as we saw in the chapter 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:53.800
 with his name when he manages to steal the 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.259
 steven doll without anyone giving 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.659
 counts just like when he steals from others 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:59.229
 objects without anyone realize 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:01.240
 it 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:04.030
 also it also shows to be very 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.069
 skillful with magical objects like 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.440
 when he created a wave of hundreds of 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:10.690
 dolls and when he attacked the gems without 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.659
 remorse using the chlorinator 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:16.150
 pearl to launch the cars no matter 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:18.669
 that they begged him to stop in 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:21.310
 conclusion this is perhaps one of the most 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:23.560
 enigmatic and strange characters of 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:27.039
 this series and maybe a lot of that 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.260
 speak in the future fourth theory the 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:32.230
 resurrection of rose 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.930
 as you know when giving birth to steven rose 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:37.870
 I sacrifice his physical form to attract him 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.970
 to this world more however it is possible 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:42.360
 that she due to the physical wear that 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:45.010
 was to give birth to a human simply 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.920
 disappeared as a pearl in the chapter 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:49.690
 steven the swordsman in which after being 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.150
 hurt by her clone she simply 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:55.270
 he was in an apparent state of death 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:57.310
 while regenerating his physical form at 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.040
 which argues that the gems are 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:03.070
 able to regenerate to recover from 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:05.440
 damage then it is possible that rose can 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:08.350
 regenerate and return to your physical form 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:11.110
 but this may be in the last 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:13.420
 episodes is also possible that she 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.670
 intervene in water situation in which 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:17.890
 is well require your help or need 

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:20.440
 some advice as in the chapter 

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:22.540
 Rose room when she is done 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.700
 present as the pink whale that 

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:27.670
 Ask this see what was what he 

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:30.310
 I really wanted the only thing you know 

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:32.980
 is that she really loved her husband 

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:35.260
 and steven is also believed that with help 

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.510
 of some magical object is possible 

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.640
 life another was the reality those 

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:43.180
 objects that are created in your room 

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:45.610
 as weapons toys and more things if this 

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.950
 out so it's possible that some villain 

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:50.200
 want to enter that room so 

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:52.390
 bring objects or powers to reality 

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:54.760
 that allow him to acquire very 

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:57.160
 superior to the people is also believed 

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.800
 that in some episode it is possible that 

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:02.560
 onion to other people enter this 

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:05.620
 if that is the case onion would try to 

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:08.050
 steal something from that place with this 

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:10.630
 I conclude my pair of theories I hope 

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:12.850
 Like you have to get a thousand likes and more 

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:15.610
 subscriptions share the video 

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:18.300
 spread it and have a good day until 

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.300
 then fans
