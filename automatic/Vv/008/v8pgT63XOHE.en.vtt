00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
on this but I'm okay with it

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.000 
on this but I'm okay with it
because<00:03:10.010> in<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:10.730> movie<00:03:11.060> he<00:03:11.510> has<00:03:12.260> suit<00:03:12.560> bunches

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
because in the movie he has suit bunches

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
think and on the head articulation is

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.610 
think and on the head articulation is
very<00:03:19.610> limited<00:03:20.420> because<00:03:20.600> due<00:03:21.170> to<00:03:21.320> the<00:03:21.410> fact

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
very limited because due to the fact

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.190 
very limited because due to the fact
that<00:03:21.709> this<00:03:22.580> whole<00:03:22.880> thing<00:03:23.239> the<00:03:23.570> head<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:23.959> neck

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
that this whole thing the head and neck

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.800 
that this whole thing the head and neck
it's<00:03:24.440> one<00:03:24.739> piece<00:03:25.010> well<00:03:25.579> they<00:03:25.880> wrapped<00:03:26.180> wrapped

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
it's one piece well they wrapped wrapped

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.400 
it's one piece well they wrapped wrapped
it<00:03:27.049> in<00:03:27.410> one<00:03:27.650> piece<00:03:27.829> of<00:03:28.820> fabric<00:03:29.150> so<00:03:29.720> yeah<00:03:30.200> I

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
it in one piece of fabric so yeah I

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.860

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
but I think it's very good though that

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.879 
but I think it's very good though that
scope<00:04:20.540> is<00:04:20.690> very<00:04:21.490> impressive<00:04:23.740> definitely<00:04:24.740> not

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
scope is very impressive definitely not

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:35.800 
scope is very impressive definitely not
perfect<00:04:25.190> but<00:04:25.639> I'm<00:04:26.630> not<00:04:26.870> complaining<00:04:34.449> and<00:04:35.449> here

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
perfect but I'm not complaining and here

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.260 
perfect but I'm not complaining and here
we<00:04:35.930> have<00:04:36.110> Superman<00:04:36.560> standing<00:04:37.010> next<00:04:37.160> to<00:04:37.310> Spider

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
we have Superman standing next to Spider

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.700 
we have Superman standing next to Spider
Man<00:04:38.540> as<00:04:39.320> you<00:04:39.530> can<00:04:39.650> see<00:04:39.860> way<00:04:40.610> short<00:04:41.680> compared<00:04:42.680> to

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
Man as you can see way short compared to

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.830 
Man as you can see way short compared to
Superman<00:04:43.130> well<00:04:43.490> granted<00:04:43.940> Superman<00:04:44.449> is<00:04:44.630> a

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
Superman well granted Superman is a

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.760 
Superman well granted Superman is a
taller<00:04:45.229> figure<00:04:45.889> too<00:04:46.130> then<00:04:46.699> you<00:04:46.729> every<00:04:47.150> trigger

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
taller figure too then you every trigger

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.370 
taller figure too then you every trigger
so<00:04:48.770> I<00:04:48.800> think<00:04:49.789> Andrew<00:04:50.720> Garfield

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
so I think Andrew Garfield

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.560 
so I think Andrew Garfield
Spider<00:04:51.770> Man<00:04:51.860> it's<00:04:52.220> actually<00:04:52.699> a<00:04:52.729> good<00:04:53.090> size

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
Spider Man it's actually a good size

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.070 
Spider Man it's actually a good size
good<00:04:53.960> height<00:04:54.590> since<00:04:55.270> he<00:04:56.270> is<00:04:56.389> supposed<00:04:56.810> to<00:04:56.960> be

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
good height since he is supposed to be

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.580 
good height since he is supposed to be
in<00:04:57.310> high<00:04:58.310> school<00:04:58.370> so<00:04:59.120> probably<00:04:59.840> around<00:04:59.960> 17<00:05:00.560> or

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
in high school so probably around 17 or

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.820 
in high school so probably around 17 or
so<00:05:00.860> so<00:05:01.699> yeah<00:05:02.979> as<00:05:03.979> far<00:05:04.220> as<00:05:04.280> a<00:05:05.110> high<00:05:06.110> comparison<00:05:06.740> I

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
so so yeah as far as a high comparison I

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.040 
so so yeah as far as a high comparison I
think<00:05:06.860> he<00:05:07.280> is<00:05:07.430> fine<00:05:09.729> alright<00:05:10.729> and<00:05:11.030> this<00:05:11.660> is<00:05:11.900> a
