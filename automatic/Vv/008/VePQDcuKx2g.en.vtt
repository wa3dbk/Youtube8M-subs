00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
is pictures of his I think he's got

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.690 
is pictures of his I think he's got
about<00:02:38.110> five<00:02:38.410> trees<00:02:38.740> up<00:02:38.950> in<00:02:39.070> his<00:02:39.160> ass<00:02:39.250> already

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
about five trees up in his ass already

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.510 
about five trees up in his ass already
in<00:02:39.850> every<00:02:40.030> room<00:02:40.330> our<00:02:41.050> C's<00:02:41.320> got<00:02:41.560> kids<00:02:41.860> so<00:02:42.220> I

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
in every room our C's got kids so I

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.790 
in every room our C's got kids so I
think<00:02:43.120> he<00:02:43.450> chose<00:02:43.720> like<00:02:44.050> you<00:02:44.290> know<00:02:44.410> again<00:02:44.650> the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
think he chose like you know again the

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.260 
think he chose like you know again the
presents<00:02:45.220> for<00:02:45.370> them<00:02:45.490> and<00:02:45.670> stuff<00:02:45.820> of<00:02:45.940> that<00:02:46.060> and

presents for them and stuff of that and

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.240 
presents for them and stuff of that and
I<00:02:46.630> think<00:02:47.140> that's<00:02:47.410> actually<00:02:47.800> why<00:02:47.950> he's<00:02:48.100> got

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.210 
I think that's actually why he's got
injured<00:02:48.670> so<00:02:48.700> he<00:02:48.910> can<00:02:49.090> spend<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.540> bedtime<00:02:50.220> holy
