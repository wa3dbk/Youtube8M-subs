up<00:00:24.420> under<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.810> bonnet<00:00:24.990> because<00:00:25.140> remember<00:00:25.529> the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
up under the bonnet because remember the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.099 
up under the bonnet because remember the
blah<00:00:25.920> felt<00:00:26.250> on<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:26.609> new<00:00:26.820> model<00:00:27.119> car<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.689> down

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.779 
blah felt on this new model car is down
underneath<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.769> because<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.160> air<00:00:29.340> intakes

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
underneath it because the air intakes

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.640 
underneath it because the air intakes
for<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.150> turbo<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.960> underneath<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.529> engine
