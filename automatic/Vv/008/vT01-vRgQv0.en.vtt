00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
our tour all general lives also that was

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.620 
our tour all general lives also that was
the<00:01:17.420> kind<00:01:17.600> of<00:01:18.040> starting<00:01:19.040> point<00:01:19.310> from<00:01:19.520> that<00:01:19.790> it

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
the kind of starting point from that it

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.930 
the kind of starting point from that it
is<00:01:20.900> the<00:01:21.230> the<00:01:22.040> playfulness<00:01:23.000> loko<00:01:23.960> with<00:01:24.230> life

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
is the the playfulness loko with life

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.830 
is the the playfulness loko with life
and<00:01:26.780> even<00:01:27.140> serious<00:01:27.560> things<00:01:27.980> in<00:01:28.250> life<00:01:28.550> that<00:01:28.940> I<00:01:29.360> I

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
and even serious things in life that I I

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.770 
and even serious things in life that I I
connect<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:32.110> so<00:01:33.670> maybe<00:01:34.670> maybe<00:01:35.120> that's<00:01:35.450> the

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
connect to so maybe maybe that's the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:45.570 
connect to so maybe maybe that's the
reason

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.480 

I<00:01:45.640> I<00:01:46.450> just<00:01:46.870> always<00:01:47.860> would<00:01:48.220> like<00:01:48.460> to<00:01:50.310> wear<00:01:51.310> if
