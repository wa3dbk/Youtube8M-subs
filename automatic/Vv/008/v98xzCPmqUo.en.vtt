00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.539
 one thousand five hundred reais, version 4 for 2 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.689
 quattro traction for two contracts with 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.680
 cvt transmission already jumps to 94 thousand 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.699
 five hundred reais 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.789
 this model that we are showing 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.429
 good is specifically a wd with traction 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.870
 integral netwave aa w of full wheel drive 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.329
 cvt transmission already jumps to 107 thousand 108 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.640
 thousand reais does not have a version above this 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.670
 although it is also the wd with traction 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.399
 integral and cvt transmission with more touch 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.640
 solar and xenon headlights and hop on 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.579
 115 thousand five hundred reais 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.190
 all sx models adopt 2.0 engine 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.710
 16v with 160 horses 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:02.550
 in the case of cvt versions with transmission 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.750
 is it cvt it automatic in terms of 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.799
 performance 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:11.010
 it accelerates from 0 to 100 in 9.6 seconds to 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.670
 aa manual version with traction 4 2 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.439
 cvt version already jumps to 10 and 16 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.759
 seconds 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.049
 the cvt version with the wd already goes to 11,9 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.780
 seconds then this is where we are 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.700
 showing zero commitment thus in 11.9 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.720
 seconds and maximum speed of 190 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.990
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.770
 its consumption is not the strong 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:41.040
 consumption of versions 4 for two of 8.7 km 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:43.420
 per liter in the city and 9.8 in the 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.869
 version 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.460
 four by four with their worst yet 8.3 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.270
 kilometers per liter of gasoline in 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.689
 city â€‹â€‹and 9.5 kilometers per liter in 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:00.200
 road all this version is 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:02.990
 specifically it comes with airbags of 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.270
 driver and passengers but arbex 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.880
 sides of the curtain and to the knees of the 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.110
 driver then I would have more or less 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.360
 six to ten 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.440
 this version then the basic versions 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.380
 It's just that two old men have six 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.700
 young air bags with lining of 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:29.180
 leather seats and this model also 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:31.220
 which is fans cvt transmission and traction 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.099
 all of them already come with a 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.010
 stability control and I watched it 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.260
 that makes the car stand still 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.750
 you take your foot off the brake to make it easier 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.989
 the maneuvers to get out of the 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.810
 to disk on all four wheels system 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:51.230
 multimedia with integrated GPS and in case 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.950
 wdl has a paddle-shift for 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:58.160
 sequential gear changes 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.650
 then it is a car around 4.3 meters 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.530
 in length is a car more or less 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.030
 the size of hr see then it is a 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.060
 competitor does not want to see 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:12.049
 only it is much more expensive, right? 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.870
 the entry version around 88 thousand and 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.859
 five hundred reais and bought hiv 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.680
 complete 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:22.609
 then maybe mitsubishi has to give 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.380
 a change in price is due to the new 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:29.239
 reality of the market is that it arrived yesterday 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:32.680
 more sophisticated models are not new 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:36.019
 latest a competitive price right 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.739
 88,500 that the price of the access version 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:42.829
 and buy a top of the line hiv 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.200
 that comes with such transmission cvt this 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:47.780
 hence it would be a manual transmission 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.490
 you pick up a beer etc will pay 94 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.530
 thousand and five hundred reais much more expensive 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:04:00.520
 than the hiv then finally a mitsubishi 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.520
 asx x this is it mitsubishis 2016
