00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 That's good, I do not want to be in the 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.550
 mouth and miss and today 16 on the game dof 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.349
 medic a game of the new distributor 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.330
 called game america 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.030
 this is the game launches this 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.480
 distributor and I 'll talk some here 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.949
 aspects that pleased me and others that 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.850
 I did not like them 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.070
 so let's see the video on the screen. 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.980
 selection and character of the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.560
 I did not like it so much when 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.840
 you will choose the skin colors of the 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.960
 your character even has a variety 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:42.739
 big color but hair and beard 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.090
 this type of customization is very weak 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.899
 for man I did not see woman right 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:53.100
 But for someone who hears only four hairs and 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.660
 there is such a weak thing and could 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.180
 be better in this part, huh? 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:02.309
 but let's go there in classes there I found 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.880
 also scarce in the absence of class 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.299
 because it only has three classes in the game is 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.439
 basically mage the archer and paladin 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:18.570
 anyway 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:19.439
 the mille 116 where only basic class is r 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.990
 pg 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.840
 hence the paladin and try that the short 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.920
 distance swift actions with sword 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.790
 etc 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.810
 tamer right that the federal mainha the 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.340
 Mage 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.229
 he is good at fighting off a 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.439
 high so a greater distance 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.439
 and there is a hunter that distances him to 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.970
 his hand is much bigger 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.670
 compared to others 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.630
 Then when you start to play you already 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.360
 you see that the graphics are 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.040
 well cool graphics 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.090
 but I did not like the other either. 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.939
 aspect was the following few games of 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:08.250
 rpg that I usually play has 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:11.849
 three bases or some tension the bar of 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.270
 hp even emits but has three bars 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:18.910
 for example has 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:21.640
 the resistance you run and you get 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.320
 wears like this is an energy in the 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.450
 truth of your character 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.410
 When you perform actions it goes 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.980
 decreasing 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:33.250
 only there for at least a year paladin 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.410
 You only have HP and mana, right? 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.220
 only mana is the same for you 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:42.400
 Release skill and endurance too. 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.680
 you spend a lot of this human 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.120
 if I do not know if you call it that 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:53.920
 game but you spend so much good to run 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:59.170
 there you have to slow down not to 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:01.300
 spend so much human and I also found half 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.490
 slow to start combat combat 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.330
 I think it's cool, baby. 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:09.610
 beginning and only that I realized at least in the 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.350
 start of the game when you kill animal 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.050
 do not gain experience you only win 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.640
 experience doing quest even you do 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.550
 the right experience will be bad 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.820
 can kill animals that have been in a 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:25.170
 occupy virtually nothing but end 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.170
 Do not worry at all. 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.980
 about the monsters I thought it was cool 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.230
 huh 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.209
 The texture of the game is cool so has 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.459
 Shadow graph is well beautiful 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:40.450
 It's just that it did not innovate. 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:43.900
 RPG much better but I decided to give 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.520
 opportunity to test this, just do not 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.170
 sought will not have at least this 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.820
 normal part of rpgs pv quest that your 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.980
 Pan 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.320
 There is a lot of game, it's always like that. 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:01.000
 with day care sometimes stays longer 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:02.980
 easy boring saga but so too 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.709
 had a little pv pity that I 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.320
 I recorded but it took me a year or two 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.660
 I'm not mistaken and I tried to kill the 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.250
 dude there and only dies 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.840
 if the guy takes it higher than I do not even go 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:20.169
 now it's going to fall down and I just 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.970
 I ran to the expensive pb system it seems 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.980
 what they wanted to do will be a kind of 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:28.820
 arenas do not shut up and do not have a 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:31.310
 The goal is for me to choose, I was alone. 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.970
 I want to, I think I had to kill. 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:41.450
 more who killed more win there and so 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:43.970
 I died and neither is it and that's the game until 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.160
 cool, little, and such 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:50.360
 do not take too low I think it's a 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:54.380
 I do not care but my opinion is like this 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:57.200
 that with as much dm rpg as so much 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.210
 for you to play sometimes neither compensates 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.760
 starting this game is not a good game, right? 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.300
 if you wanted to get ahead of you 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.040
 start playing now 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:11.210
 sometimes more ahead it's cool 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:15.040
 for the time being this would be fine if the dm rpgs 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:17.870
 in the beginning it was everything else etc 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:23.240
 but I played a high amount of 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:25.100
 mr pg &amp; e the same way it tires right 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:30.020
 I think they want innovation in 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:32.570
 part of the pvp in this type of arena and tals 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.870
 I do not know if it will work very well but 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:38.440
 hang on to your company 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:41.900
 distributor has success and with the game
