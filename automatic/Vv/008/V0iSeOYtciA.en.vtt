00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 I trust this one that goes around for the 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.790
 heights 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.790
 charly to the bullfighter 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:18.500
 and at least to the roofs 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.500
 phone bouncer 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:41.250
 this move could have happened 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:41.250
 but no 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.739
 the sin the evil they have gotten now 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.870
 and here 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:04.489
 and had died dead and be down there 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.690
 to see being down there here we are in 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.720
 good area 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.380
 I, like you, go there to see where 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.380
 you are sales 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.890
 I've seen myself move on to one more 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:03.840
 but if I was there because otherwise I would not 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.840
 let go up barrel 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.240
 Playing 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.090
 there 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.030
 is the green is the green that can be the 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.030
 green 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.930
 down down 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.450
 that goes up that goes up the typical 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.670
 because it offers us a free form 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.270
 I think the roof like that is 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.270
 being 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.720
 important to throw a shot 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:17.400
 do not let yourselves be influenced by the 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:17.400
 words is up to the ever dead 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:26.350
 mother of mine movie 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:28.650
 willy see this as the ducklings I'm 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.650
 pipe 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.360
 and good bye
