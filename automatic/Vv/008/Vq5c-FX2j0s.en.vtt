I don't have ye which is his spell

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:48.280 
I don't have ye which is his spell
stone-faced<00:01:42.370> not<00:01:43.370> all<00:01:43.550> of<00:01:43.700> it<00:01:43.820> anyway<00:01:47.020> but<00:01:48.020> as

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
stone-faced not all of it anyway but as

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.680 
stone-faced not all of it anyway but as
you<00:01:48.500> can<00:01:48.590> see<00:01:48.800> I've<00:01:49.040> already<00:01:49.460> taken<00:01:49.970> a<00:01:50.480> bit<00:01:50.660> of

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
you can see I've already taken a bit of

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.930 
you can see I've already taken a bit of
spell<00:01:51.170> stone<00:01:51.500> from<00:01:51.740> him<00:01:51.890> about<00:01:52.160> fifty<00:01:52.550> percent

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
spell stone from him about fifty percent

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.900 
spell stone from him about fifty percent
oh<00:01:53.330> he<00:01:54.290> has<00:01:54.410> a<00:01:54.440> last<00:01:54.770> one<00:01:55.040> down<00:01:55.250> there<00:01:55.550> all

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
oh he has a last one down there all

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.680 
oh he has a last one down there all
right<00:01:56.560> so<00:01:57.560> I<00:01:57.590> guess<00:01:57.770> we<00:01:58.460> are<00:01:58.700> not<00:01:58.970> going<00:01:59.360> to<00:01:59.540> get

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
right so I guess we are not going to get

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.130 
right so I guess we are not going to get
those<00:01:59.900> pots<00:02:00.200> there<00:02:01.300> but<00:02:02.300> we<00:02:02.450> do<00:02:02.630> have<00:02:02.780> fifty

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
those pots there but we do have fifty

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.370 
those pots there but we do have fifty
percent<00:02:03.470> and<00:02:03.710> we<00:02:04.010> do<00:02:04.250> have<00:02:05.140> 600,000<00:02:06.140> spell

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
percent and we do have 600,000 spell

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.530 
percent and we do have 600,000 spell
stones<00:02:06.710> already<00:02:07.160> so<00:02:07.700> I'm<00:02:07.850> quite<00:02:08.030> happy<00:02:08.300> about

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
stones already so I'm quite happy about

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.270 
stones already so I'm quite happy about
that<00:02:08.960> although<00:02:09.320> the<00:02:09.350> battle<00:02:09.860> didn't<00:02:10.100> really

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
that although the battle didn't really

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.020 
that although the battle didn't really
go<00:02:10.460> the<00:02:10.640> way<00:02:10.760> I<00:02:10.790> wanted<00:02:11.360> it<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:12.050> go<00:02:12.230> because<00:02:13.130> we

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
go the way I wanted it to go because we

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:22.039 
go the way I wanted it to go because we
were<00:02:14.150> just<00:02:14.360> tacking<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:14.870> wrong<00:02:15.110> things

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:24.999
