a<00:00:08.160> friend<00:00:09.160> brought<00:00:09.310> in<00:00:09.520> a<00:00:10.080> oddly<00:00:11.080> enough

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.200 
a friend brought in a oddly enough

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.980 
a friend brought in a oddly enough
another<00:00:11.650> Altima<00:00:12.160> and<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:14.830> see<00:00:15.040> down<00:00:15.250> here<00:00:15.990> got

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
another Altima and you see down here got

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.470 
another Altima and you see down here got
broke<00:00:17.260> instead<00:00:17.730> so<00:00:18.730> we're<00:00:18.850> going<00:00:18.970> to<00:00:19.060> attempt

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
broke instead so we're going to attempt

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.909 
broke instead so we're going to attempt
to<00:00:20.550> extract<00:00:21.550> it<00:00:21.730> and<00:00:21.880> I'm<00:00:22.840> going<00:00:23.110> to<00:00:23.380> try<00:00:23.860> this

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:23.919 
to extract it and I'm going to try this

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.280 
to extract it and I'm going to try this
method<00:00:24.279> we're<00:00:24.669> going<00:00:24.700> to<00:00:24.849> build<00:00:25.060> it<00:00:25.210> up<00:00:25.329> the

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.290 
method we're going to build it up the

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.310 
method we're going to build it up the
stud<00:00:26.560> with<00:00:27.040> a<00:00:27.070> MIG<00:00:27.310> welder<00:00:27.779> see<00:00:28.779> if<00:00:28.840> we<00:00:28.930> can<00:00:29.110> put

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
stud with a MIG welder see if we can put

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.140 
stud with a MIG welder see if we can put
a<00:00:29.349> little<00:00:29.950> nub<00:00:30.160> on<00:00:30.310> there<00:00:30.579> as<00:00:30.820> something

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
a little nub on there as something

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.770 
a little nub on there as something
that'll<00:00:32.130> stick<00:00:33.130> good<00:00:33.430> to<00:00:33.730> the<00:00:33.970> broken<00:00:34.540> stud

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
that'll stick good to the broken stud

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.729 
that'll stick good to the broken stud
let<00:00:35.170> it<00:00:35.320> dry<00:00:35.760> cool<00:00:36.760> and<00:00:37.060> then<00:00:37.480> see<00:00:37.750> we<00:00:37.870> can<00:00:38.050> grab

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
let it dry cool and then see we can grab

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.380 
let it dry cool and then see we can grab
the<00:00:39.190> head<00:00:39.430> and<00:00:39.930> turn<00:00:40.930> it<00:00:41.109> and<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:42.309> maybe<00:00:42.789> we<00:00:43.180> can

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
the head and turn it and it maybe we can

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:52.979 
the head and turn it and it maybe we can
weld<00:00:43.660> a<00:00:44.670> nut<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:48.219> the<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:50.620> the<00:00:51.660> well<00:00:52.660> that's

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
weld a nut to the to the well that's

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.720 
weld a nut to the to the well that's
going<00:00:53.170> to<00:00:53.230> be<00:00:53.350> used<00:00:53.530> as<00:00:53.710> buildup<00:00:54.160> I<00:00:54.309> can't<00:00:54.609> do

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
going to be used as buildup I can't do

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.130 
going to be used as buildup I can't do
it<00:00:54.850> now<00:00:55.000> because<00:00:55.179> we're<00:00:55.420> too<00:00:55.570> close<00:00:55.809> to<00:00:55.989> the

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
it now because we're too close to the

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.020 
it now because we're too close to the
aluminum<00:00:56.559> but<00:00:56.739> let's<00:00:56.890> see<00:00:57.010> what<00:00:57.129> happens<00:01:00.030> okay

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
aluminum but let's see what happens okay

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.880 
aluminum but let's see what happens okay
take<00:01:01.449> a<00:01:01.480> look<00:01:01.719> at<00:01:01.809> what<00:01:01.899> I<00:01:01.929> did<00:01:02.019> there<00:01:02.530> was<00:01:02.559> just

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
take a look at what I did there was just

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.510 
take a look at what I did there was just
a<00:01:03.100> one<00:01:03.850> thread<00:01:04.180> coming<00:01:04.510> out<00:01:04.720> of<00:01:04.870> the<00:01:04.989> block<00:01:05.520> the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
a one thread coming out of the block the

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.020 
a one thread coming out of the block the
aluminum<00:01:06.940> head<00:01:07.150> and<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:08.650> was<00:01:09.430> able<00:01:09.610> to<00:01:09.760> well

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
aluminum head and I was able to well

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.570 
aluminum head and I was able to well
just<00:01:10.540> the<00:01:10.659> tip<00:01:10.870> of<00:01:10.900> a<00:01:11.080> nail<00:01:11.290> it<00:01:12.220> was<00:01:12.340> just

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
just the tip of a nail it was just

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.690

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
of gas on my MIG welder which is why

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.230 
of gas on my MIG welder which is why
it's<00:01:37.330> such<00:01:37.510> an<00:01:37.660> ugly<00:01:37.980> tack<00:01:38.980> but<00:01:39.580> it<00:01:39.790> was<00:01:39.910> hot

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
can't get a grip of the nail right look

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.580 
can't get a grip of the nail right look
at<00:02:06.730> that

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
at that

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.110 
at that
it's<00:02:09.590> almost<00:02:09.740> out<00:02:10.100> just<00:02:10.400> a<00:02:10.460> couple<00:02:10.640> more<00:02:10.850> turns

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
it's almost out just a couple more turns

he had said that it was less than half
an<00:02:12.890> inch<00:02:13.010> that<00:02:13.280> was<00:02:13.430> in<00:02:14.230> but<00:02:15.230> there<00:02:15.710> we<00:02:15.920> go<00:02:16.070> now

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
an inch that was in but there we go now

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.670 
an inch that was in but there we go now
it's<00:02:16.610> coming<00:02:16.820> out<00:02:17.030> fast<00:02:17.330> look<00:02:17.540> at<00:02:17.600> that<00:02:17.810> but

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
it's coming out fast look at that but

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.800 
it's coming out fast look at that but

this is just a little trick look how
clean<00:02:21.080> those<00:02:21.200> threads<00:02:21.500> are<00:02:22.150> let<00:02:23.150> me<00:02:23.210> pull<00:02:23.420> this

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
clean those threads are let me pull this

melt<00:02:38.900> into<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.380> aluminum<00:02:39.620> because<00:02:39.980> you<00:02:40.160> still

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
melt into the aluminum because you still

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.360 
melt into the aluminum because you still
