00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.170
 this almost 400 euros expensive model way with model railroad mixed feelings 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.689
 the excellent driving characteristics Owen slow driving then enough for the 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:11.630
 us-mother 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.350
 the machines room lighting 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.420
 the PKG of the lodge houses of metal and especially the engines spe grandstand roof 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.570
 Pantographs inspire all the more annoying it is the note 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.500
 Modeling the update apparently only operated with half heart 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.300
 Has 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.480
 For 31 years already to 66 to 9 to 97 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.980
 Märklin had this model in different versions in the 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.330
 Assortment as the 03 and that Bauer he 103 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.460
 all models had a plastic case and a frame 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.630
 metal 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.730
 and they had two annoying shortcomings 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.450
 The case was marked by two clearly visible ugly screws on the day 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.860
 Frame recorded 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.810
 and the locomotives had the wrong direction 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.740
 a few explanations 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.780
 but before 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.780
 we show them the functioning roof pantographs 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.080
 unlike dragging torments and steam locomotives, the locomotives is the one 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.090
 Driving direction basically does not matter 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.220
 but still to distinguish at the front and rear of these machines if they 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.739
 marked accordingly 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.689
 so-called Altbauer locomotives had a v respectively 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.359
 a hair painted 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:22.340
 an example they later see an EP 94 marking modern 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:23.559
 Laux 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:27.959
 by the numbers one and two with the 1 4 in front and the second behind 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:29.870
 Merck lay Rok 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.090
 and bears the bill only true in model of the hundredth three true unexplained 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.559
 and therefore wrong » 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:40.439
 as now after several years break things again the machine in the trade 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:41.359
 brought 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.639
 they had boldly announced it as a new development 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:48.009
 newly developed externally, however, only the case 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:51.459
 The frame is just as detailed as it was almost 40 years ago 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.260
 and also the housing screws are still in their exposed place in the 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.979
 top, roof 

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:59.569
 in the facelift here clearly the merchants and I have the 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.309
 Technician set the tone 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:05.329
 because the latter have repeatedly proven that he can do that in advance
