just<00:02:16.170> like<00:02:16.319> bash<00:02:16.620> against<00:02:17.100> a<00:02:17.190> wall<00:02:17.430> which<00:02:18.300> is

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
just like bash against a wall which is

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.330 
just like bash against a wall which is
interesting<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.510> different<00:02:21.950> well<00:02:22.950> and

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
interesting and different well and

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.590 
interesting and different well and
there's<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:25.310> translucency<00:02:26.310> thing<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:27.390> see

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
there's a translucency thing you see

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.330 
there's a translucency thing you see
that<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:28.020> don't<00:02:28.260> know<00:02:28.350> how<00:02:28.560> well<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.980> cameras

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
that I don't know how well the cameras

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.150 
that I don't know how well the cameras
picking<00:02:29.550> it<00:02:29.730> up<00:02:29.820> I<00:02:30.000> will<00:02:30.630> sound<00:02:31.160> completely

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
picking it up I will sound completely

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.590 
picking it up I will sound completely
different<00:02:32.670> from<00:02:32.820> what<00:02:33.000> you're<00:02:33.120> used<00:02:33.180> to

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
different from what you're used to

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.750 
different from what you're used to
obviously<00:02:34.410> because<00:02:34.650> I'm<00:02:35.130> on<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.370> different

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
obviously because I'm on a different

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.420 
obviously because I'm on a different
camera<00:02:35.970> which<00:02:36.870> is<00:02:37.020> entirely<00:02:37.350> necessary<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:38.250> be

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
camera which is entirely necessary to be

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.240 
camera which is entirely necessary to be

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.410 
translucency you can see the play
through<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.070> clouds<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.670> I'm<00:02:50.970> pretty<00:02:51.180> damn

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
through the clouds and I'm pretty damn

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.270 
through the clouds and I'm pretty damn
sure<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.810> can't<00:02:52.140> do<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.650> on<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.980> Atari

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
sure you can't do that on the Atari

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.320 
sure you can't do that on the Atari
that's<00:02:53.970> impressive<00:02:54.300> I<00:02:55.550> mean<00:02:56.550> in<00:02:56.700> terms<00:02:56.880> of<00:02:57.090> a

that's impressive I mean in terms of a
one-player<00:02:58.050> game<00:02:58.160> this<00:02:59.160> game<00:02:59.519> what<00:03:00.470> you<00:03:01.470> know

you need a friend to play it but um for

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.970 
you need a friend to play it but um for
a<00:03:09.360> system<00:03:09.780> that<00:03:09.989> was<00:03:10.489> affected<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:11.910> 1292<00:03:12.980> was

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
a system that was affected to 1292 was

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.800 
a system that was affected to 1292 was
out<00:03:14.280> before<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:15.239> Atari<00:03:15.600> 2600<00:03:17.150> this<00:03:18.150> is<00:03:18.299> the<00:03:18.420> 13

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
out before the Atari 2600 this is the 13

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.390 
out before the Atari 2600 this is the 13
90<00:03:19.049> to<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.470> only<00:03:19.650> difference<00:03:19.980> being<00:03:20.190> the

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
90 to the only difference being the

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.870 
90 to the only difference being the
power<00:03:20.610> supply<00:03:20.880> is<00:03:21.120> on<00:03:21.540> board<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:22.850> love<00:03:23.850> that

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
power supply is on board I love that

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.069 
power supply is on board I love that
sprite<00:03:24.390> scaling<00:03:24.600> thing<00:03:25.970> that's<00:03:26.970> that's<00:03:27.750> quite

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
sprite scaling thing that's that's quite

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:33.979 
sprite scaling thing that's that's quite
impressive<00:03:31.070> subtle<00:03:32.070> not<00:03:32.640> but<00:03:33.360> impressive

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
impressive subtle not but impressive

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.330 
impressive subtle not but impressive
let's<00:03:34.350> see<00:03:34.470> what<00:03:34.590> else<00:03:34.650> can<00:03:34.920> we<00:03:35.070> get<00:03:35.280> because<00:03:35.820> I

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
let's see what else can we get because I

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.630 
let's see what else can we get because I
there<00:03:38.340> any<00:03:38.459> difference<00:03:38.940> here<00:03:40.250> can<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.340> make<00:03:41.610> it

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
there any difference here can I make it

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.400 
there any difference here can I make it
start

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.880 

oh<00:03:44.550> yeah<00:03:45.550> he<00:03:46.000> is<00:03:46.330> like<00:03:46.780> your<00:03:47.110> Atari<00:03:47.470> stuff

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
oh yeah he is like your Atari stuff

00:03:47.890 --> 00:04:05.870 
oh yeah he is like your Atari stuff
double<00:03:48.750> double<00:03:49.750> planes<00:03:54.840> what<00:03:55.840> else

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.270 

so<00:04:06.510> how<00:04:06.660> does<00:04:06.720> this<00:04:07.050> differ<00:04:07.110> just<00:04:07.830> a<00:04:07.950> different

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
so how does this differ just a different

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:17.150 
so how does this differ just a different
cloud<00:04:08.640> layout<00:04:09.090> I<00:04:10.010> guess<00:04:16.100> these<00:04:17.100> are

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
cloud layout I guess these are

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.479 
cloud layout I guess these are
completely<00:04:18.000> freaky<00:04:18.890> joystick<00:04:19.890> it's<00:04:20.190> gonna<00:04:20.340> be

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
completely freaky joystick it's gonna be

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.060 
completely freaky joystick it's gonna be
said<00:04:20.730> they're<00:04:21.720> kind<00:04:21.870> of<00:04:21.900> like<00:04:21.989> an<00:04:22.110> Atari<00:04:22.410> 5200

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
said they're kind of like an Atari 5200

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.490 
said they're kind of like an Atari 5200
state<00:04:23.820> but<00:04:24.060> with<00:04:24.180> massive<00:04:24.840> buttons<00:04:25.260> and<00:04:25.470> the

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
state but with massive buttons and the

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.870 
state but with massive buttons and the
flimsy<00:04:26.130> stick<00:04:26.550> well<00:04:27.480> what<00:04:28.320> else<00:04:28.440> we<00:04:28.650> got<00:04:28.880> for

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
flimsy stick well what else we got for

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:38.690 
flimsy stick well what else we got for
them<00:04:30.180> jets<00:04:35.900> and<00:04:36.900> I<00:04:36.960> might<00:04:37.140> get<00:04:37.290> start<00:04:37.700> some

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
them jets and I might get start some

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.730 
them jets and I might get start some
reason<00:04:38.970> I<00:04:39.060> have<00:04:39.210> problem<00:04:39.600> I<00:04:39.930> do<00:04:40.110> our<00:04:40.410> trouble

making this stuff on many levels I have
no<00:04:44.100> idea<00:04:44.280> why<00:04:47.480> hold<00:04:48.480> the<00:04:48.660> button<00:04:48.930> down<00:04:48.960> no<00:04:51.590> and

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
no idea why hold the button down no and

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.830 
no idea why hold the button down no and
here<00:04:52.680> we<00:04:52.710> are<00:04:52.890> back<00:04:53.010> at<00:04:53.070> the<00:04:53.250> tanks<00:04:53.690> which<00:04:54.690> I

here we are back at the tanks which I
couldn't<00:04:55.170> make<00:04:55.290> start<00:04:55.680> for<00:04:56.070> some<00:04:56.250> reason<00:04:56.640> that

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
couldn't make start for some reason that
