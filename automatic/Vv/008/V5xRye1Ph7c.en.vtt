push<00:04:05.260> on<00:04:05.739> pushing<00:04:06.190> but<00:04:06.730> I<00:04:06.970> always<00:04:07.239> find<00:04:07.540> a<00:04:07.900> good

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
push on pushing but I always find a good

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.590 
push on pushing but I always find a good
reason<00:04:08.680> to<00:04:08.860> keep<00:04:08.980> on<00:04:09.220> looking<00:04:10.090> forward<00:04:10.450> and

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
reason to keep on looking forward and

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.810 
reason to keep on looking forward and
being<00:04:10.780> positive<00:04:11.260> and<00:04:11.290> for<00:04:11.620> reason<00:04:12.130> I<00:04:12.310> think

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
being positive and for reason I think

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.030 
being positive and for reason I think
it's<00:04:12.970> a<00:04:13.150> key<00:04:13.930> next<00:04:14.200> six<00:04:14.440> months<00:04:14.620> for<00:04:14.890> me<00:04:15.010> to

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
it's a key next six months for me to

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.860 
it's a key next six months for me to
make<00:04:15.310> sure<00:04:15.489> that<00:04:15.640> I<00:04:15.730> get<00:04:15.790> back<00:04:16.030> on<00:04:16.209> track<00:04:16.359> okay

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
make sure that I get back on track okay

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.420 
make sure that I get back on track okay
so<00:04:16.930> timing<00:04:17.260> is<00:04:17.500> everything<00:04:17.680> or<00:04:18.040> like<00:04:18.250> a<00:04:18.310> little

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
so timing is everything or like a little

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.670 
so timing is everything or like a little
bit<00:04:18.609> odd<00:04:18.790> number<00:04:19.450> of<00:04:19.479> seventeen<00:04:19.720> Grand<00:04:20.500> Slam

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
mean so there's definitely a possibility

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.100 
mean so there's definitely a possibility
for<00:04:34.949> that<00:04:35.219> rat<00:04:35.520> has<00:04:35.699> put<00:04:35.939> himself<00:04:36.330> in<00:04:37.050> that
