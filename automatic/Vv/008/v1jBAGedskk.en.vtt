00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.939 
moment usually because i was playing a
lot<00:04:38.960> of<00:04:39.080> Search<00:04:39.260> and<00:04:39.410> Destroy<00:04:39.440> so<00:04:40.449> it<00:04:41.449> was<00:04:41.949> to

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
lot of Search and Destroy so it was to

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.850 
lot of Search and Destroy so it was to
get<00:04:43.130> killed<00:04:43.370> by<00:04:43.520> a<00:04:43.550> tomahawk<00:04:44.120> is<00:04:44.530> is<00:04:45.530> pretty

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
get killed by a tomahawk is is pretty

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.770 
get killed by a tomahawk is is pretty
frustrating<00:04:46.720> um<00:04:48.220> so<00:04:49.220> that's<00:04:49.789> what<00:04:50.030> that's<00:04:50.539> my

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
idea of fun is making other people's

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.670 
idea of fun is making other people's
experiences<00:04:54.190> really<00:04:55.190> crappy<00:04:55.550> but<00:04:55.880> um<00:04:56.380> no<00:04:57.380> it's
