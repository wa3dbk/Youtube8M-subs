00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.560
Hi I'm Kelsey Mays for cars dot com were in Southern California with

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.460
2008 Smart Fortwo

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.389
now smart has sold the two seat forTwo in europe
in overseas since the late 90's

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.840
this is the second generation and it set
to arrive at US dealerships beginning in

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:14.940
January

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.539
just how small is the 42 well from
bumper to bumper it's actually a few

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.380
feet shorter

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.119
the next small scar on the market which
is the Mini Cooper by styles include a

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.369
coupe and convertible

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.460
we've got a convertible here's all-star
was shown you how the top works

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.619
there's a fabric top of the key 5 you
can actually press the submit button

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:31.480
here

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.230
and the topic come back that opens up
into different stages

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.450
the first age sense the top back to

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.420
the rear deck right here when you
actually have to get into the car

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.039
but the key and the press this'll
buttoned

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:53.100
and drop the top dress the way the paper
for open-air experience you're gonna

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.640
want to remove this guy right here

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.350
that's pretty easy all you have to do is
I'm click

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.660
this thing here the prenup and it's
actually pretty lightweight

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.140
they hatch opens there's a compartment
here

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.420
that you just pop it and and there you
go

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.250
now we got it open let's show you what's
inside that's what makes a big deal

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.720
about how big the interior is for its
size in fact I'm about six feet tall

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.119
this is right have

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.310
the sea to drive it I can adjust the
seat back a little bit even

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.509
and I'm even more comfortable there
steering wheels and not adjustable

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.049
smart says it's sort of a
one-size-fits-all steering wheel

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.070
personally I'd like a little bit lower

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.229
there's a very official census pace here
on you don't notice how small the cars

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.770
except for the fact that the side
windows in the rear windows are right up

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:40.479
against you

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.180
and there's actually nothing here's your
knees how to spell out in this area

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.790
and the funny a leg room if you need
more stores the passenger seat does fold

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.380
flat that's not the easiest thing to get
down

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.799
that there you go and you can
accommodate some longer items here

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.829
the forties got a pretty small engine so
doesn't have a lot to pick up at the

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.299
start but if you really step on it
there's a

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.560
more pick up later on transmission looks
like an automatic but it's actually

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.710
automated manual shifting gears on the

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.539
like a manual transmission would on for
the smooth transitions you're gonna want

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.670
to keep it in manual mode and take your
foot off the gas just slightly

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.220
and each shift using the paddle shifters
or the gearshift that may be a little

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.640
bit more activity than

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.160
an automatic driver may want but over
time it can become second nature

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.160
the brake pedal pretty hard so it can be
difficult makes this stuff sometimes

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.280
if you get the 42 up to seventy eighty
miles an hour well

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.360
won't be wanting to go 80 for very long
that smokers great likes to talk about

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.520
safety they talk about the other side
air bags electronic stability system in

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.600
this card how well its gonna European
crash test

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.780
the fact is it's a very very small car
no US agencies crash tested it yet that

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.890
smile just 3340 city/highway

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.050
unfortunately smart recommends premium
feel it's kinda put a damper on the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.590
mileage

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.280
I'm this is gonna be a pretty hot car
and so if you want one

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.540

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.060
