00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
the camera focus a little bit so as you

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.729 
the camera focus a little bit so as you
can<00:00:33.489> see<00:00:33.699> that<00:00:33.910> looks<00:00:34.300> pretty<00:00:34.540> bad<00:00:34.839> is<00:00:35.080> it's

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
can see that looks pretty bad is it's

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.900 
can see that looks pretty bad is it's
like<00:00:36.040> a<00:00:36.070> slight<00:00:36.550> dent<00:00:36.850> almost<00:00:37.739> luckily<00:00:38.910> when

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.150 
like a slight dent almost luckily when
you<00:00:40.089> dint<00:00:40.570> this<00:00:40.780> phone<00:00:41.050> I<00:00:41.379> guess<00:00:41.949> this

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
you dint this phone I guess this

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.799 
you dint this phone I guess this
polycarbonate<00:00:42.519> shell<00:00:43.030> you<00:00:43.540> know<00:00:43.629> pretty

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
polycarbonate shell you know pretty

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.439 
polycarbonate shell you know pretty
thick<00:00:44.140> so<00:00:44.440> you<00:00:44.680> can't<00:00:45.579> see<00:00:45.790> it<00:00:45.910> too<00:00:46.059> much<00:00:46.239> like

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
thick so you can't see it too much like

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.869 
thick so you can't see it too much like
at<00:00:46.600> a<00:00:46.629> glance<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:48.070> don't<00:00:48.250> see<00:00:48.400> unless<00:00:48.699> you're

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
at a glance you don't see unless you're

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.729 
at a glance you don't see unless you're
looking<00:00:49.180> for<00:00:49.390> it<00:00:49.510> to<00:00:49.960> hear<00:00:50.140> some<00:00:50.320> more<00:00:50.410> damage

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
looking for it to hear some more damage

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.790 
looking for it to hear some more damage
up<00:00:50.890> here<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.750> like<00:00:52.960> I<00:00:53.079> said<00:00:53.140> it<00:00:53.379> fell<00:00:53.559> on<00:00:53.590> the

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
up here so like I said it fell on the

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.430 
up here so like I said it fell on the
pavement<00:00:53.980> it<00:00:54.430> was<00:00:54.699> old<00:00:55.059> pavement<00:00:55.440> really

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
pavement it was old pavement really

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.849 
pavement it was old pavement really
jagged<00:00:56.710> I<00:00:57.480> pretty<00:00:58.480> much<00:00:58.629> just<00:00:59.079> falling<00:00:59.739> apart

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
jagged I pretty much just falling apart

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.509 
jagged I pretty much just falling apart
it<00:01:00.160> wasn't<00:01:00.399> a<00:01:00.430> flat<00:01:00.640> surface<00:01:00.879> so<00:01:02.309> that's<00:01:03.309> the

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
it wasn't a flat surface so that's the

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.100 
it wasn't a flat surface so that's the
only<00:01:03.550> damage<00:01:03.969> it<00:01:04.300> bounced<00:01:04.479> around<00:01:04.690> a<00:01:04.930> couple

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
only damage it bounced around a couple

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.460 
only damage it bounced around a couple
times<00:01:05.259> I<00:01:05.770> thought<00:01:06.100> it<00:01:06.250> was<00:01:06.340> going<00:01:06.430> to<00:01:06.490> be<00:01:06.580> worse

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
times I thought it was going to be worse

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.889 
times I thought it was going to be worse
but<00:01:08.470> as<00:01:08.680> you<00:01:08.800> can<00:01:08.920> see<00:01:09.160> it's<00:01:09.429> it<00:01:09.729> looks<00:01:10.539> pretty

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
but as you can see it's it looks pretty

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:12.810 
but as you can see it's it looks pretty
bad<00:01:11.140> like<00:01:11.710> I<00:01:11.830> said<00:01:12.039> when<00:01:12.220> I<00:01:12.250> handsome<00:01:12.640> on<00:01:12.729> the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
bad like I said when I handsome on the

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.919 
bad like I said when I handsome on the
phone<00:01:13.030> and<00:01:13.210> tell<00:01:13.300> them<00:01:13.450> to<00:01:13.570> look<00:01:13.690> for<00:01:13.869> the

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
damage just the way it depends on the

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.440 
damage just the way it depends on the
lighting<00:01:17.710> basically<00:01:18.220> it<00:01:18.429> if<00:01:18.729> you're<00:01:19.000> in<00:01:19.179> low

lighting you're not going to see unless

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.779 
lighting you're not going to see unless
you<00:01:20.920> really<00:01:21.070> look<00:01:21.340> but<00:01:21.520> if<00:01:21.610> you're<00:01:21.729> in

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789
