00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.299
 Though I speak with the tongues of men 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.550
 and the angels if I had no love I'd swim 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.740
 it would still be that I have the gift of 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.920
 prophesy and know all the sciences 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.560
 of this world and has the faith to 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.510
 carry the hills without love I swim 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.760
 I would be at the triple border 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.310
 brazil argentina and paraguay 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:32.640
 I wanted to talk about love, the love that 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:36.870
 so strong that the very 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.920
 God defines himself as love because God is 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.010
 love 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.920
 What there is to be love with water has to do with 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.550
 love with the fire because love is a 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.160
 flame that burns in our hearts love 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.289
 makes us act in such a beautiful way 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.640
 point of doing everything for you. 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.219
 feeling that is within your 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.160
 And this love begins with a 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.989
 Spark begins with a seed of God 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.760
 in our hearts and here we go 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.760
 know a little about this god 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.870
 different from love the passion she starts 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.130
 strong is already beginning the stage of much power 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.820
 too much gas 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.910
 But suddenly that passion ends. 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.710
 but love is not love growing love 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.010
 Growing, growing Growing from here. 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.650
 few can take this love and 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.320
 even though a mother who loves her children 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.390
 if perhaps go through a depression and 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.060
 She can abandon her children. 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.240
 said that he will never abandon 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.430
 I will never abandon that son 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.700
 newborn then god it compares 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.400
 your love as the love of a mother then 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.620
 God he has in his arms in front 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.440
 This great love says who can 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.530
 to separate ourselves from this great love of 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:06.110
 apostle Paul, since neither death nor 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:09.560
 life neither height nor depth nor the 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:13.550
 wealth or the things of the present or the 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.900
 things can separate us from this 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.020
 big Love 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:22.220
 will the danger to hunger 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.410
 the nudity the pursuit god is in all 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.540
 the places then nothing can separate us 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.730
 this great love of god 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.780
 the journey of life and in the 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.790
 love, everything came to approve of this love 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.880
 It's okay to stop this love. 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.280
 we have to move on 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.410
 this way toward the proof of our 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.460
 God's love says that we will 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:49.780
 likely that our faith will strengthen 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.780
 our love will prevail 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:05.590
 and when the water want to fight against 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.440
 flame of love for more than the 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.350
 love is weak, already fading 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.630
 the bible says that not many waters 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.500
 can erase this love let alone us 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.460

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.460
