field<00:00:44.070> choke<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.789> going<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.030> increase

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
field choke this is going to increase

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.330 
field choke this is going to increase
your<00:00:45.360> damage<00:00:45.690> by<00:00:46.020> 5%<00:00:46.320> it's<00:00:46.860> going<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.070> increase

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
your damage by 5% it's going to increase

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.000 
your damage by 5% it's going to increase
your<00:00:47.370> range<00:00:47.760> by<00:00:48.030> 12<00:00:48.510> points<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.680> can<00:00:49.710> just

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
your range by 12 points and you can just

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.650 
your range by 12 points and you can just
imagine<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.430> little<00:00:50.789> range<00:00:51.030> slider<00:00:51.390> there

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
imagine that little range slider there

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.990 
imagine that little range slider there
being<00:00:51.899> from<00:00:52.140> 0<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.530> 100<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.730> looks<00:00:53.940> like

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
being from 0 to 100 so it looks like

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.270 
being from 0 to 100 so it looks like
it's<00:00:54.239> increasing<00:00:54.750> your<00:00:54.870> range<00:00:55.020> significantly

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
it's increasing your range significantly

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.920 
it's increasing your range significantly
it's<00:00:56.280> gonna<00:00:56.460> reduce<00:00:56.730> your<00:00:57.210> stability<00:00:57.420> by<00:00:57.899> a

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
it's gonna reduce your stability by a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.380 
it's gonna reduce your stability by a
factor<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.320> 15<00:00:58.890> points<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.730> next<00:01:00.000> one<00:01:00.149> down<00:01:00.329> is

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
factor of 15 points the next one down is

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.750 
factor of 15 points the next one down is
linear<00:01:01.050> compensator<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.250> also<00:01:02.460> gonna

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
linear compensator this is also gonna

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.820 
linear compensator this is also gonna
increase<00:01:03.059> your<00:01:03.270> damage<00:01:03.420> by<00:01:03.750> 5%<00:01:04.049> it's<00:01:04.680> only

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
increase your damage by 5% it's only

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.410 
increase your damage by 5% it's only
going<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.100> increase<00:01:05.159> your<00:01:05.580> range<00:01:05.729> by<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> factor

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
going to increase your range by a factor

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.210 
going to increase your range by a factor
of<00:01:06.540> five<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:07.229> only<00:01:07.470> gonna<00:01:07.650> reduce<00:01:08.040> your

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
of five and it's only gonna reduce your

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.789 
of five and it's only gonna reduce your
stability<00:01:08.790> by<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> factor<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.750> 10<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.619> little

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
stability by a factor of 10 so a little

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.560 
stability by a factor of 10 so a little
bit<00:01:10.950> less<00:01:11.159> range<00:01:11.520> than<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.880> field<00:01:12.090> choke<00:01:12.390> and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
bit less range than the field choke and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.390 
bit less range than the field choke and
a<00:01:12.750> little<00:01:13.020> bit<00:01:13.140> better<00:01:13.350> stability<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.280> I

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
a little bit better stability and I

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.800 
a little bit better stability and I
shouldn't<00:01:14.640> really<00:01:14.880> use<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.240> term<00:01:15.450> factor

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
shouldn't really use the term factor

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.749 
shouldn't really use the term factor
when<00:01:16.170> talking<00:01:16.409> about<00:01:16.650> these<00:01:16.979> points<00:01:17.280> because

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
when talking about these points because

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.830 
when talking about these points because
we<00:01:17.880> don't<00:01:18.060> actually<00:01:18.210> know<00:01:18.600> if<00:01:18.630> they're

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
we don't actually know if they're

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.230 
we don't actually know if they're
multiplying<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:20.159> effectiveness<00:01:21.030> or

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
multiplying the effectiveness or

ineffectiveness of a weapon by certain

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.620 
ineffectiveness of a weapon by certain
percentage<00:01:23.700> we<00:01:23.850> just<00:01:24.090> know<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.420> they're

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
percentage we just know that they're

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.660 
percentage we just know that they're
numbers<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.409> mean<00:01:25.650> something<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.189> destiny

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
numbers that mean something in destiny

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.460 
numbers that mean something in destiny
hopefully<00:01:27.210> someday<00:01:27.420> soon<00:01:27.840> we'll<00:01:28.020> figure<00:01:28.320> out

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
hopefully someday soon we'll figure out

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.649 
hopefully someday soon we'll figure out
what<00:01:28.740> 10<00:01:29.040> points<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.490> range<00:01:29.729> actually<00:01:30.329> means

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
what 10 points of range actually means

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.929 
what 10 points of range actually means
for<00:01:31.259> certain<00:01:31.650> weapons<00:01:31.979> class<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.759> last

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
for certain weapons class and the last

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.760 
for certain weapons class and the last
barrel<00:01:33.240> modifier<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.960> smart<00:01:34.290> drift<00:01:34.619> control

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
barrel modifier is smart drift control

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.310 
barrel modifier is smart drift control
which<00:01:35.220> increases<00:01:35.759> your<00:01:35.790> stability<00:01:36.119> by<00:01:36.689> 20

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
which increases your stability by 20

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.679 
which increases your stability by 20
points<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.130> reduces<00:01:38.579> your<00:01:38.640> range<00:01:38.970> by<00:01:39.150> 15

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
points and it reduces your range by 15

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.819 
points and it reduces your range by 15
points<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.170> if<00:01:40.259> you're<00:01:40.380> having<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.619> hard<00:01:40.770> time

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
points so if you're having a hard time

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.649 
points so if you're having a hard time
controlling<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.729> recoil<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.360> weapon

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
controlling the recoil on this weapon

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.810 
controlling the recoil on this weapon
then<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.229> can<00:01:43.380> try<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.829> one<00:01:44.070> personally<00:01:44.790> I

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
then you can try that one personally I

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.819 
then you can try that one personally I
really<00:01:45.180> like<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.630> field<00:01:45.869> choke<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.320> like<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
really like the field choke I like the

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.190 
really like the field choke I like the
increased<00:01:47.430> damage<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.479> increased<00:01:48.899> range

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
increased damage and the increased range

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.960 
increased damage and the increased range
and<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.500> have<00:01:49.740> no<00:01:50.070> problem<00:01:50.430> controlling<00:01:50.729> the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
and I have no problem controlling the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.090 
and I have no problem controlling the
stability<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.810> weapon<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.649> next<00:01:52.950> non

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
stability of this weapon the next non

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.280 
stability of this weapon the next non
optional<00:01:53.670> upgrade<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.180> called<00:01:54.450> focus<00:01:54.990> fire

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
optional upgrade is called focus fire

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.899 
optional upgrade is called focus fire
this<00:01:55.560> reduces<00:01:56.189> your<00:01:56.369> rate<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.579> fire<00:01:56.880> and

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
this reduces your rate of fire and

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.999 
this reduces your rate of fire and
increases<00:01:57.719> your<00:01:57.869> damage<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.560> tested<00:01:58.799> it

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
increases your damage and I tested it

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.249 
increases your damage and I tested it
out<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.399> game<00:01:59.640> it<00:02:00.030> increases<00:02:00.540> your<00:02:00.570> damage<00:02:00.719> per

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
out in game it increases your damage per

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.800 
out in game it increases your damage per
shot<00:02:01.290> by<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.710> factor<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.280> 40%<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.570> if<00:02:03.659> you're

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
shot by a factor of 40% so if you're

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.539 
shot by a factor of 40% so if you're
using<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.200> field<00:02:04.469> choke<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.950> then<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.159> unlock

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
using a field choke and then you unlock

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.660 
using a field choke and then you unlock
focus<00:02:06.090> fire<00:02:06.329> you're<00:02:06.600> automatically<00:02:07.229> doing

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
focus fire you're automatically doing

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.790 
focus fire you're automatically doing
45%<00:02:08.670> more<00:02:08.729> damage<00:02:09.420> per<00:02:09.450> shot<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.349> these<00:02:10.560> shots

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
45% more damage per shot and these shots

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.770 
45% more damage per shot and these shots
are<00:02:11.009> gonna<00:02:11.190> be<00:02:11.400> great<00:02:11.790> for<00:02:12.000> dropping<00:02:12.420> targets

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
are gonna be great for dropping targets

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.980 
are gonna be great for dropping targets

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
targets and you'll notice that in PvE a

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.190 
targets and you'll notice that in PvE a
lot<00:02:23.850> you'll<00:02:24.060> shoot<00:02:24.270> something<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.840> out<00:02:24.960> kind

lot you'll shoot something and out kind
of<00:02:25.290> flinch<00:02:26.060> basically<00:02:27.060> that's<00:02:27.300> going<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.540> like

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
of flinch basically that's going to like

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.600 
of flinch basically that's going to like
delay<00:02:28.050> them<00:02:28.230> from<00:02:28.440> doing<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.740> melee<00:02:29.070> attack<00:02:29.100> or

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
delay them from doing a melee attack or

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.160 
delay them from doing a melee attack or
hitting<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:30.000> with<00:02:30.120> one<00:02:30.330> of<00:02:30.360> their<00:02:30.540> guns<00:02:30.750> this

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
hitting you with one of their guns this

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.900 
hitting you with one of their guns this
can<00:02:31.410> certainly<00:02:31.800> be<00:02:31.980> an<00:02:32.070> effective<00:02:32.460> option<00:02:32.850> for

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
can certainly be an effective option for

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.210 
can certainly be an effective option for
PvE<00:02:33.450> however<00:02:34.140> when<00:02:34.320> you<00:02:34.410> equip<00:02:34.740> it<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:34.980> looks

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
PvE however when you equip it it looks

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.490 
PvE however when you equip it it looks
like<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.520> increases<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.180> impact<00:02:36.990> of<00:02:37.140> your<00:02:37.290> gun

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
like it increases the impact of your gun

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.690 
like it increases the impact of your gun
which<00:02:37.740> you<00:02:37.920> think<00:02:38.100> might<00:02:38.340> increase<00:02:38.640> the

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
which you think might increase the

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.850 
which you think might increase the
overall<00:02:39.060> damage<00:02:39.780> output<00:02:39.960> this<00:02:40.470> will<00:02:40.680> not

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
overall damage output this will not

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.800 
overall damage output this will not
actually<00:02:41.430> increase<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.030> damage<00:02:42.330> output<00:02:42.510> of

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
actually increase the damage output of

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.720 
actually increase the damage output of
this<00:02:42.990> weapon<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.590> next<00:02:43.860> step<00:02:44.040> modifier<00:02:44.520> is

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
this weapon the next step modifier is

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.180 
this weapon the next step modifier is
hammer-forged<00:02:45.600> which<00:02:46.050> increases<00:02:46.800> your<00:02:46.980> range

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
hammer-forged which increases your range

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.300 
hammer-forged which increases your range
by<00:02:47.550> 40<00:02:48.120> points<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.720> it<00:02:49.110> reduces<00:02:49.650> your<00:02:49.710> reload

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
by 40 points and it reduces your reload

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.700 
by 40 points and it reduces your reload
by<00:02:50.580> 10<00:02:50.970> points<00:02:51.300> now<00:02:51.720> again<00:02:52.230> we<00:02:52.410> don't<00:02:52.530> know

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
by 10 points now again we don't know

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.440 
by 10 points now again we don't know
exactly<00:02:52.830> how<00:02:53.310> much<00:02:53.730> these<00:02:54.030> points<00:02:54.360> are

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
exactly how much these points are

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.510 
exactly how much these points are
actually<00:02:54.570> worth<00:02:54.990> in-game<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:55.920> my<00:02:56.100> theory<00:02:56.340> is

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
actually worth in-game and my theory is

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.520 
actually worth in-game and my theory is
that<00:02:56.550> range<00:02:57.030> is<00:02:57.300> basically<00:02:57.750> affecting<00:02:58.320> the

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
that range is basically affecting the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.320 
that range is basically affecting the
damage<00:02:58.950> drop-off<00:02:59.490> with<00:02:59.730> your<00:02:59.880> weapon<00:03:00.210> you'll

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
damage drop-off with your weapon you'll

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.030 
damage drop-off with your weapon you'll
see<00:03:00.540> that<00:03:00.660> it's<00:03:00.840> extreme<00:03:01.320> ranges<00:03:01.770> you<00:03:01.890> do<00:03:02.010> a

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
see that it's extreme ranges you do a

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.190 
see that it's extreme ranges you do a
bit<00:03:02.370> less<00:03:02.670> damage<00:03:03.150> than<00:03:03.390> you're<00:03:03.540> used<00:03:03.570> to<00:03:03.960> and

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
bit less damage than you're used to and

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.530 
bit less damage than you're used to and
I<00:03:04.740> imagine<00:03:05.190> with<00:03:05.340> better<00:03:05.610> range<00:03:05.940> on<00:03:06.150> any<00:03:06.330> gun

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
I imagine with better range on any gun

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.000 
I imagine with better range on any gun
you're<00:03:06.690> going<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.870> be<00:03:06.960> doing<00:03:07.110> more<00:03:07.410> damage<00:03:07.830> at

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
you're going to be doing more damage at

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.980 
you're going to be doing more damage at
range<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.760> description<00:03:09.330> says<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.660> improves

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
range the description says it improves

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.900

some<00:05:15.130> fundamental<00:05:15.820> balanced<00:05:16.270> questions<00:05:16.810> I

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
some fundamental balanced questions I

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.360 
some fundamental balanced questions I
mean<00:05:17.140> everybody<00:05:17.530> thought<00:05:17.770> that<00:05:17.830> the<00:05:18.160> iron

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
mean everybody thought that the iron

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.040 
mean everybody thought that the iron
banner<00:05:18.730> was<00:05:19.090> supposed<00:05:19.330> to<00:05:19.360> be<00:05:19.510> where<00:05:19.720> players

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
banner was supposed to be where players

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.780 
banner was supposed to be where players
were<00:05:20.590> able<00:05:20.830> to<00:05:20.860> play<00:05:21.070> with<00:05:21.220> their<00:05:21.370> extremely

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
were able to play with their extremely

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.790 
were able to play with their extremely
good<00:05:22.120> guns<00:05:22.360> in<00:05:22.540> PvP<00:05:22.960> and<00:05:23.080> kind<00:05:23.290> of<00:05:23.380> dominate

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
good guns in PvP and kind of dominate

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.740 
good guns in PvP and kind of dominate
people<00:05:24.130> if<00:05:24.250> you<00:05:24.340> had<00:05:24.490> a<00:05:24.520> better<00:05:24.790> weapon<00:05:25.060> but<00:05:25.630> it

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
people if you had a better weapon but it

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.080 
people if you had a better weapon but it
seems<00:05:25.960> like<00:05:26.140> even<00:05:26.350> in<00:05:26.710> vanilla<00:05:27.100> PvP<00:05:27.820> there<00:05:28.000> are

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
seems like even in vanilla PvP there are

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.430 
seems like even in vanilla PvP there are
certain<00:05:28.420> guns<00:05:28.570> that<00:05:28.720> are<00:05:28.870> just<00:05:29.110> gonna<00:05:29.230> out

damage other weapons and the Souris

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.670 
damage other weapons and the Souris
regime<00:05:31.720> is<00:05:31.900> certainly<00:05:32.170> one<00:05:32.350> of<00:05:32.380> the<00:05:32.530> better

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
regime is certainly one of the better

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.400 
regime is certainly one of the better
ones<00:05:32.950> out<00:05:33.100> there<00:05:33.310> the<00:05:33.730> vex<00:05:34.120> mythoclast<00:05:34.660> has

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.110 
ones out there the vex mythoclast has
been<00:05:35.560> kind<00:05:35.800> of<00:05:35.860> turning<00:05:36.190> some<00:05:36.370> heads<00:05:36.400> as<00:05:36.820> of
