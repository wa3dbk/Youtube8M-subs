we're going to step on out into the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.499 
we're going to step on out into the
factory<00:01:10.729> we're<00:01:10.940> going<00:01:11.090> to<00:01:11.179> see<00:01:11.360> the

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
factory we're going to see the

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:13.270 
factory we're going to see the
fabrication<00:01:12.170> area<00:01:12.350> where<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:12.860> parts<00:01:13.160> are

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
fabrication area where the parts are

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.450 
fabrication area where the parts are
made<00:01:13.570> into<00:01:14.570> weld<00:01:15.170> as<00:01:15.649> they<00:01:15.979> come<00:01:16.310> together

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
made into weld as they come together

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.210 
made into weld as they come together
into<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.060> fixtures<00:01:17.539> and<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:18.500> welding<00:01:19.069> is

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
into the fixtures and the welding is

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.820 
into the fixtures and the welding is
being<00:01:19.459> done<00:01:19.869> we'll<00:01:20.869> move<00:01:21.050> through<00:01:21.289> paint<00:01:21.649> and

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
being done we'll move through paint and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.249 
being done we'll move through paint and
then<00:01:22.429> back<00:01:22.700> into<00:01:22.970> assembly<00:01:23.630> and<00:01:23.899> we'll<00:01:24.080> also

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
then back into assembly and we'll also

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.380 
then back into assembly and we'll also
take<00:01:24.619> a<00:01:24.679> little<00:01:24.979> move<00:01:25.250> into<00:01:25.459> the<00:01:25.789> machine<00:01:26.119> shop

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
take a little move into the machine shop

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.180 
take a little move into the machine shop
to<00:01:26.450> kid<00:01:26.869> take<00:01:27.080> a<00:01:27.110> little<00:01:27.410> look<00:01:27.619> and<00:01:27.800> see<00:01:27.979> what's

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
to kid take a little look and see what's

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.520 
to kid take a little look and see what's
going<00:01:28.429> on<00:01:28.520> there<00:01:28.819> and<00:01:29.170> finally<00:01:30.170> we're<00:01:30.410> going

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
going on there and finally we're going

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.620 
going on there and finally we're going
to<00:01:30.590> make<00:01:30.830> a<00:01:30.860> trip<00:01:31.190> into<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:31.729> test<00:01:32.000> area<00:01:32.270> so

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
to make a trip into the test area so

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.809 
to make a trip into the test area so
that<00:01:32.660> you<00:01:32.840> can<00:01:33.110> see<00:01:33.380> how<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:33.890> testing<00:01:34.489> for<00:01:34.700> the

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819 
that you can see how the testing for the

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:37.540 
that you can see how the testing for the
equipment<00:01:35.239> is<00:01:35.330> done<00:01:35.599> and<00:01:36.530> how<00:01:36.890> are<00:01:37.039> the<00:01:37.160> data

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550
