00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.080
 appearances of life on this earth 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:19.710
 is a subject that passionates nicole 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:21.300
 ferroni and bah no he's just my 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.160
 know very well what you just said 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.119
 mister lopez because me precisely 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.960
 I find that first of all to talk about 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.220
 early life still needs 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.380
 actually we start at 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.720
 clear about what life is like because 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.000
 that just tell my kids and not 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.430
 living a goat yes that's except he 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.690
 have to take off so I looked for a 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.030
 little bit what is the common point in 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.969
 made between living things between a 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.460
 koala a bacteria a plant daniel 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:49.289
 morin good if not their sense of 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.059
 distributed and I found different 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.550
 points that are for me the fact that 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.219
 anne living beings is growing 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.829
 develops for that it feeds and 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.930
 finally know how to multiply that proliferates 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.210
 so for me really life it's a 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.519
 beauf sex is weight gain here 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.900
 so why is it important 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.119
 to define life beats to do the 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.979
 distinction between a good geologist like 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.509
 homeland of horror a bad game there that 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.759
 would not be able to recognize a 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.740
 protozoan of a proletarian that's it 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.439
 that's really important 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.759
 here to see precisely if we can 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.950
 talk about the appearance of life on 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:31.439
 March and that's fine talking about 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.850
 the appearance of life on march in a 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.070
 glass because march 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.560
 it's a planet that at 4 6 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.560
 billion years not even a bacteria 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.610
 in March and it starts from nothing at all 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.960
 marc stein co barely except when thomas 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.270
 frankly a bacterium excuse me 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.160
 what is this stuff 2 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.870
 micrometers you take a membrane like 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.940
 that you fucked me loose in there even 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.440
 no core and everything and after the guys 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.690
 who are going to ask you subsidies you 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.740
 see then yes it can be a new 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.240
 home planet was doing 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.620
 infrastructure and all I am 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.850
 sorry I do not want to spin wheat 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.200
 to build bricks on 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.710
 marc santrÃ© not able to manufacture 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.880
 short bacteria anyway I'm going 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.780
 not get upset for the appearance of the 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.430
 life because I do not know that 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.450
 interest me what did not interest me 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.970
 the appearance of life is 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.320
 the appearance of death because that I 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.850
 think it's interesting because 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.380
 that we have no trace at all of 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.940
 the appearance of death then at the same 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.620
 time you will tell me the first 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.120
 mafia bacteria they are not cons 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.320
 they will not leave you the 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.720
 Kalashnikov under the microscope 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.160
 they stashed the murder weapon it's 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.830
 for that we certainly have 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.320
 no trace but I thought imagine the 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.900
 death does not exist but what a mess 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.280
 ah but it's catastrophic because 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.450
 already all these basic bacteria would have 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.860
 proliferate bankruptcy all these 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.720
 bacteria but even kind you take to 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.390
 Bulgarian yoghurt in the yonne burgart 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.390
 yahia bacteria the 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.130
 lactobacillus us that multiplies all 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.900
 the twenty every 20 minutes 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.550
 so in the beginning you take one in 20 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.080
 minutes has two so on after 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.269
 one hour later you have 8 after 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.030
 two hours from one to 64 and it's after to 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.380
 after five hours are we going to 32 1768 from 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.860
 what's yoghurt stick that starts to 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.260
 overflow 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.180
 and then the hours go by 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.280
 bacteria multiply your fridge 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.780
 it's like that in real shot paf he 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.160
 explodes fire costs there are some 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.140
 bacteria but everywhere in your kitchen 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.459
 she continues at the end like that of a 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.880
 day they are billions and 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.040
 billion 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.750
 the walls help from balls to a tablecloth 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.310
 bacteria like that that pours into 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.780
 the street people are trying to avoid it 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.970
 but the layer of bacteria is 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.110
 superimpose habit they had to road 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.030
 like that up to the knees 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.459
 he tries not to be fooled but 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.950
 suddenly the lcp tablecloth if people are 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.870
 totally engulfed in yogurt the 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.550
 people the houses the buildings and at 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.240
 final and well what the world is more 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.970
 a huge Bulgarian yogurt see 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:47.240
 richard of the cep says it no I did 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.510
 a bts you saw david head alone 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.560
 during the decreed to the apocalypse 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.570
 but not the worst part is that I say 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.040
 bacteria even on lopez if ever that 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.510
 happens with humans if ever all 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.250
 humans who had been born there since 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.050
 the appearance of homo sapiens at 150 thousand 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.490
 years ago well he was not dead but at 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.930
 this hour we create hundreds 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.820
 billions and at this time 11 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.850
 tips frail time for I do not know 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.380
 for oil for water or for that 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.210
 kind of words by the way it's already the 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.440
 case and why this is the case but because 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.880
 that every second the pendant 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.050
 which I speak there are two people 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.350
 who are born but when there are 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:22.340
 die 2.9 and because of this tale of 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.170
 0.1 humans every second 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.840
 but it's him who eat us our 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.270
 bread then I tell you the future 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.910
 of death the future of life this is the 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.240
 dead but versions of the pierrot passes 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.240
 said
