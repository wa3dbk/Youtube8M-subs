00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.690 
if you look at the board you can see
like<00:02:41.900> two<00:02:42.170> sides<00:02:42.500> there's<00:02:42.830> a<00:02:42.920> blue<00:02:43.130> side<00:02:43.430> and

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
like two sides there's a blue side and

the red side so the red side is the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.440 
the red side so the red side is the
enemy<00:02:45.830> side<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.310> blue<00:02:46.489> side<00:02:46.790> is<00:02:47.090> your

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
is typically enough now the enemy is

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.130 
is typically enough now the enemy is
taking<00:04:05.620> my<00:04:05.890> castle<00:04:06.430> but<00:04:06.910> luckily<00:04:07.300> they<00:04:07.780> didn't
