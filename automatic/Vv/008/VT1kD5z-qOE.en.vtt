one kind of sheet double-sided and it's

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.200 
one kind of sheet double-sided and it's
easy<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.620> pick<00:00:49.770> up<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.550> understanding<00:00:51.120> of

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
the game the the game seems pretty well

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.990 
the game the the game seems pretty well
balanced<00:00:55.410> between<00:00:56.180> saboteurs<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:58.910> you<00:00:59.910> know

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
balanced between saboteurs and you know

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.810 
balanced between saboteurs and you know
good<00:01:00.210> gnomes<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.809> played<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> game<00:01:01.710> maybe<00:01:02.309> 15

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
good gnomes I played the game maybe 15

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.939 
good gnomes I played the game maybe 15
times<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:04.049> seems<00:01:04.379> like<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.830> know<00:01:04.920> it's

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
times and it seems like you know it's

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.240 
times and it seems like you know it's
there's<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.610> good<00:01:05.880> mix<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.500> when<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.650> saboteurs

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
there's a good mix of when the saboteurs

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.570 
there's a good mix of when the saboteurs
win<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.880> when<00:01:09.710> you<00:01:10.710> know<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.920> good<00:01:11.070> news<00:01:11.100> win

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
win and when you know the good news win

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.969 
win and when you know the good news win
so<00:01:12.330> it's<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.930> think<00:01:13.439> it's<00:01:13.650> pretty<00:01:13.770> well

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
so it's I think it's pretty well

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.899 
so it's I think it's pretty well
balanced<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.760> sense<00:01:16.759> one<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
balanced in that sense one of the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.749 
balanced in that sense one of the
advantages<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.540> has<00:01:18.750> over<00:01:19.110> bang<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.759> basically

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
advantages it has over bang is basically

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.580 
advantages it has over bang is basically
you<00:01:20.939> just<00:01:20.970> play<00:01:21.330> till<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.659> cards<00:01:21.960> run<00:01:22.140> out<00:01:22.350> so

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
you just play till the cards run out so

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.620 
you just play till the cards run out so
it<00:01:22.740> really<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.159> time<00:01:23.460> limited<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.180> not<00:01:24.390> like

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
it really is time limited it's not like

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.450 
it really is time limited it's not like
bang<00:01:24.900> where<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.320> game<00:01:25.470> could<00:01:25.650> keep<00:01:25.799> going<00:01:25.860> and

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
bang where the game could keep going and

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.429 
bang where the game could keep going and
going<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.000> going<00:01:27.240> because<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.049> know<00:01:28.140> people

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
going and going because you know people

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.160 
going and going because you know people
are<00:01:28.530> getting<00:01:28.590> injured<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.220> heal<00:01:29.460> up<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.170> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
are getting injured the heal up and the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.800 
are getting injured the heal up and the
game<00:01:31.320> plays<00:01:31.590> much<00:01:31.920> quicker<00:01:32.220> than<00:01:32.340> bang<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.090> I

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
game plays much quicker than bang and I

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.200 
game plays much quicker than bang and I
kind<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.380> prefer<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.369> bang<00:01:35.579> because<00:01:35.880> of

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
kind of prefer this to bang because of

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.440 
kind of prefer this to bang because of
that<00:01:37.159> but<00:01:38.159> there<00:01:38.460> are<00:01:38.579> unique<00:01:38.850> aspects<00:01:39.360> to

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
that but there are unique aspects to

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.960 
that but there are unique aspects to
bang<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.590> game<00:01:40.770> doesn't<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.130> but<00:01:41.820> why

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
bang that this game doesn't have but why

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.370 
bang that this game doesn't have but why
don't<00:01:42.119> we<00:01:42.180> take<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.390> look<00:01:42.600> at<00:01:42.869> how<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.170> game

the gnomes are trying to simply dig a
path<00:02:03.180> there<00:02:05.090> we'll<00:02:06.090> have<00:02:06.299> started<00:02:06.750> off<00:02:06.930> by

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
path there we'll have started off by

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.280 
path there we'll have started off by
dealing<00:02:08.340> out<00:02:08.840> different<00:02:09.840> roles<00:02:09.869> now

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
dealing out different roles now

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.559 
dealing out different roles now
for<00:02:11.980> simulating<00:02:12.489> say<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.670> five<00:02:12.970> player<00:02:13.299> game

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
for simulating say a five player game

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.530 
for simulating say a five player game
there's<00:02:14.260> going<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.650> be<00:02:14.769> six<00:02:15.340> cards<00:02:15.879> from<00:02:16.420> the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
there's going to be six cards from the

there's going to be six cards from the

diggers<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:18.610> two<00:02:19.420> saboteurs<00:02:20.110> so<00:02:20.799> you<00:02:20.860> could

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
diggers and two saboteurs so you could

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.850 
diggers and two saboteurs so you could
get<00:02:21.189> either<00:02:21.489> a<00:02:22.170> saboteur<00:02:23.170> card<00:02:23.500> that<00:02:23.680> looks

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
get either a saboteur card that looks

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.710 
get either a saboteur card that looks
like<00:02:23.980> this<00:02:24.220> gnome<00:02:24.459> would<00:02:24.670> simply<00:02:25.150> Saboteur

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
like this gnome would simply Saboteur

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.369 
like this gnome would simply Saboteur
written<00:02:25.989> on<00:02:26.079> it

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
written on it

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:33.569 
written on it
or<00:02:26.670> another<00:02:27.670> type<00:02:27.909> of<00:02:27.940> gnome<00:02:32.069> once<00:02:33.069> those<00:02:33.400> are

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
or another type of gnome once those are

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.520 
or another type of gnome once those are
distributed<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:34.299> so<00:02:34.840> here<00:02:35.079> that<00:02:35.260> could

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
distributed and so here that could

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.160 
distributed and so here that could
potentially<00:02:35.709> be<00:02:36.280> two<00:02:36.549> saboteurs<00:02:37.239> or<00:02:37.870> there

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
potentially be two saboteurs or there

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.990 
potentially be two saboteurs or there
could<00:02:38.349> just<00:02:38.530> be<00:02:38.680> one<00:02:38.859> saboteur<00:02:39.519> it's<00:02:39.790> been<00:02:39.970> a

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
could just be one saboteur it's been a

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.899 
could just be one saboteur it's been a
very<00:02:40.269> based<00:02:40.720> on<00:02:41.019> you<00:02:41.530> know<00:02:41.650> how<00:02:41.920> many<00:02:42.069> get

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
very based on you know how many get

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.149 
very based on you know how many get
dealt<00:02:43.180> out<00:02:43.390> so<00:02:44.109> there's<00:02:44.739> going<00:02:44.829> to<00:02:44.890> be<00:02:44.950> draw

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 
dealt out so there's going to be draw

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.460 
dealt out so there's going to be draw
pull<00:02:45.430> of<00:02:45.549> six<00:02:45.849> cards<00:02:46.209> only<00:02:46.629> five<00:02:47.019> cards<00:02:47.379> are

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
pull of six cards only five cards are

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.410 
pull of six cards only five cards are
dealt<00:02:47.650> so<00:02:48.459> we'll<00:02:48.670> deal<00:02:49.599> out<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.049> cards<00:02:50.099> and

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
dealt so we'll deal out the cards and

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.319 
dealt so we'll deal out the cards and
then<00:02:52.420> you<00:02:52.450> have<00:02:52.750> action<00:02:53.560> cards<00:02:53.980> here<00:02:54.310> that<00:02:54.849> can

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
then you have action cards here that can

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.800 
then you have action cards here that can
actually<00:02:55.569> affect<00:02:55.900> sort<00:02:56.769> of<00:02:56.829> how<00:02:57.549> the<00:02:57.609> game<00:02:58.000> is

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
actually affect sort of how the game is

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.800 
actually affect sort of how the game is
played<00:02:58.870> so<00:02:59.760> you<00:03:00.760> would<00:03:01.030> have<00:03:01.239> you<00:03:01.690> know<00:03:01.750> a

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
played so you would have you know a

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.440 
played so you would have you know a
piece<00:03:02.170> like<00:03:02.859> this<00:03:02.920> which<00:03:03.879> you<00:03:04.060> could<00:03:04.209> place

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
piece like this which you could place

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.729 
piece like this which you could place
down<00:03:04.840> like<00:03:05.590> so<00:03:05.980> you<00:03:06.639> could<00:03:06.970> not<00:03:07.150> place<00:03:07.659> a<00:03:07.989> piece

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
down like so you could not place a piece

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.199 
down like so you could not place a piece
like<00:03:08.950> that<00:03:09.190> that<00:03:09.459> would<00:03:09.519> be<00:03:09.579> an<00:03:09.760> illegal<00:03:10.269> move

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
like that that would be an illegal move

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.670 
like that that would be an illegal move
so<00:03:13.349> let's<00:03:14.349> say<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:15.629> on<00:03:16.629> my<00:03:16.840> turn<00:03:17.139> I<00:03:17.349> decide<00:03:17.650> to

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
so let's say I on my turn I decide to

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.059 
so let's say I on my turn I decide to
place<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.310> piece<00:03:18.699> here<00:03:19.120> because<00:03:19.750> I<00:03:19.780> am<00:03:20.049> as<00:03:20.560> you

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
place a piece here because I am as you

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.099 
place a piece here because I am as you
know<00:03:21.099> a<00:03:21.190> good<00:03:21.430> no<00:03:21.669> I'm<00:03:21.790> a<00:03:21.879> gold<00:03:22.090> digger<00:03:22.269> and<00:03:22.569> I'm

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109

trying<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.530> reach<00:03:23.859> the<00:03:24.099> gold<00:03:25.590> then<00:03:26.590> on<00:03:26.739> the

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
trying to reach the gold then on the

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.309 
trying to reach the gold then on the
next<00:03:26.980> players<00:03:27.310> turn<00:03:27.459> they're<00:03:28.359> going<00:03:28.660> to<00:03:28.810> break

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
next players turn they're going to break

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.150 
next players turn they're going to break
my<00:03:30.660> cart<00:03:31.660> so<00:03:32.199> I'm<00:03:32.260> gonna<00:03:32.349> play<00:03:32.590> that<00:03:32.739> out<00:03:32.980> and

now<00:05:21.620> as<00:05:21.830> the<00:05:22.310> game<00:05:22.520> develops<00:05:23.090> more<00:05:23.389> and

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
now as the game develops more and

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.740 
now as the game develops more and
there's<00:05:23.660> more<00:05:23.870> pieces<00:05:24.169> being<00:05:25.010> placed<00:05:25.750> then

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
there's more pieces being placed then

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.000 
there's more pieces being placed then
it's<00:05:27.530> going<00:05:27.919> to<00:05:29.050> be<00:05:30.050> more<00:05:30.260> difficult<00:05:30.380> to<00:05:30.770> place

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
it's going to be more difficult to place

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.150 
it's going to be more difficult to place
certain<00:05:31.340> cars<00:05:31.550> so<00:05:32.150> for<00:05:32.360> instance<00:05:32.919> one<00:05:33.919> could

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
certain cars so for instance one could

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.500 
certain cars so for instance one could
not<00:05:34.310> place<00:05:34.640> a<00:05:34.970> card<00:05:35.840> like<00:05:36.580> so<00:05:37.580> because<00:05:37.970> this

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
not place a card like so because this

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.180 
not place a card like so because this
cuts<00:05:38.870> off<00:05:39.080> this<00:05:39.260> path<00:05:39.560> and<00:05:39.890> it's<00:05:40.010> not<00:05:40.160> a

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
cuts off this path and it's not a

cuts off this path and it's not a
legitimate<00:05:40.910> path<00:05:41.150> you<00:05:42.050> could<00:05:42.350> however<00:05:43.360> place

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
legitimate path you could however place

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.640 
legitimate path you could however place
that<00:05:44.660> there<00:05:46.180> there's<00:05:47.180> other<00:05:47.450> cards<00:05:48.020> that<00:05:48.470> are
