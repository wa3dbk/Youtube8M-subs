00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
so you basically have to take the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.480 
so you basically have to take the
optimal<00:01:23.750> jobs<00:01:24.020> you<00:01:24.260> have<00:01:24.290> to<00:01:24.530> just<00:01:24.740> barely

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
optimal jobs you have to just barely

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.580

make<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:26.090> turns<00:01:26.330> and<00:01:26.690> so<00:01:27.140> if<00:01:27.260> you're<00:01:27.409> always

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
make the turns and so if you're always

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.260 
make the turns and so if you're always
on<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:27.950> edge<00:01:27.979> of<00:01:28.250> total<00:01:28.610> destruction
