00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
itself just just current today and then

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.370 
itself just just current today and then
it's<00:02:20.940> just<00:02:21.270> what<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.510> girls<00:02:21.720> are<00:02:21.840> counting<00:02:22.260> on

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
they lost the master of this so we had

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.890 
they lost the master of this so we had
to<00:02:42.159> rerecord<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:42.939> so<00:02:43.090> we<00:02:43.180> decided<00:02:43.629> to<00:02:43.719> do<00:02:43.870> a

to because we don't really enjoy your
success<00:03:38.829> I<00:03:39.069> think

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
success I think

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.380 
success I think
we<00:03:42.160> weren't<00:03:42.310> getting<00:03:42.520> along<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:43.120> this<00:03:43.210> is

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
we weren't getting along and this is

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.600 
we weren't getting along and this is
just<00:03:43.780> gone<00:03:43.960> inside<00:03:44.319> clothes<00:03:44.740> yeah<00:03:45.220> what

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
just gone inside clothes yeah what

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.970 
just gone inside clothes yeah what
happened<00:03:46.030> you<00:03:46.360> know<00:03:46.510> now<00:03:46.900> all<00:03:47.740> these<00:03:47.920> years

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
happened you know now all these years

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.550 
happened you know now all these years
later<00:03:48.250> I<00:03:48.880> think<00:03:49.420> that<00:03:49.569> we<00:03:49.720> can<00:03:49.900> look<00:03:50.080> back<00:03:50.110> in

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
later I think that we can look back in

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.870 
later I think that we can look back in
hindsight<00:03:50.680> and<00:03:51.160> see<00:03:51.310> what<00:03:51.490> was<00:03:51.610> great<00:03:51.819> about

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
hindsight and see what was great about

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.970 
hindsight and see what was great about
the<00:03:52.209> man<00:03:52.390> they<00:03:52.630> bring<00:03:52.900> that<00:03:53.080> back<00:03:53.440> and<00:03:53.680> throw

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
the man they bring that back and throw

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.470 
the man they bring that back and throw
away<00:03:54.100> all<00:03:54.310> that<00:03:54.340> stuff<00:03:54.790> that<00:03:55.000> doesn't<00:03:55.270> work

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
away all that stuff that doesn't work

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.480 
away all that stuff that doesn't work
and<00:03:56.380> the<00:03:56.500> other<00:03:56.650> thing<00:03:56.860> is<00:03:57.010> that<00:03:57.040> we're<00:03:57.370> not

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
and the other thing is that we're not

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.490 
and the other thing is that we're not
gonna<00:03:57.700> kill<00:03:58.120> ourselves<00:03:58.360> over<00:03:58.959> our<00:03:59.080> music

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
gonna kill ourselves over our music

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
it they are the go-go's so what you
