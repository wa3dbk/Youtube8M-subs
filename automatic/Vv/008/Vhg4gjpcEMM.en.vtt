00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
it'd look really cool still kind of

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.340 
it'd look really cool still kind of
realistic<00:04:26.580> then<00:04:27.210> going<00:04:27.510> with<00:04:27.660> that<00:04:27.780> a<00:04:27.840> second

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
realistic then going with that a second

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.830 
realistic then going with that a second
level<00:04:28.500> would<00:04:28.650> be<00:04:28.710> a<00:04:28.860> little<00:04:29.100> bit<00:04:29.190> steeper<00:04:29.840> for

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
level would be a little bit steeper for

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.590 
level would be a little bit steeper for
the<00:04:30.900> pattern<00:04:31.229> which<00:04:31.560> probably<00:04:31.800> took<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:32.250> most

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
the pattern which probably took the most

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.150 
the pattern which probably took the most
out<00:04:33.600> of<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:33.780> park<00:04:34.020> is<00:04:34.200> just<00:04:34.530> you<00:04:34.620> know<00:04:34.740> just<00:04:34.979> as

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
out of the park is just you know just as

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.280 
out of the park is just you know just as
you<00:04:35.729> guys<00:04:35.880> saw<00:04:36.060> I<00:04:36.090> just<00:04:36.210> pushed<00:04:36.570> that<00:04:36.720> pads<00:04:37.020> you

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
you guys saw I just pushed that pads you

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.469 
you guys saw I just pushed that pads you
put<00:04:37.500> the<00:04:37.680> bricks<00:04:38.220> and<00:04:38.520> then<00:04:38.910> you<00:04:39.030> put<00:04:39.240> one<00:04:39.450> of

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
put the bricks and then you put one of

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:40.940 
put the bricks and then you put one of
those<00:04:39.630> wedge<00:04:40.050> allegis<00:04:40.380> things<00:04:40.560> in<00:04:40.650> the<00:04:40.740> middle

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
those wedge allegis things in the middle

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.170 
those wedge allegis things in the middle
and<00:04:41.160> it<00:04:41.250> just<00:04:41.400> creates<00:04:41.610> like<00:04:41.729> a<00:04:41.789> really<00:04:42.030> cool

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
and it just creates like a really cool

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.270 
and it just creates like a really cool
path<00:04:42.450> and<00:04:42.780> I'm<00:04:43.380> gonna<00:04:43.500> just<00:04:43.770> create<00:04:43.919> something

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
path and I'm gonna just create something

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.250 
path and I'm gonna just create something
a<00:04:44.340> little<00:04:44.520> bit<00:04:44.610> different<00:04:44.970> and<00:04:45.090> as<00:04:46.080> you<00:04:46.200> can

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
a little bit different and as you can

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.900 
a little bit different and as you can
see<00:04:46.410> we<00:04:46.560> I<00:04:46.590> just<00:04:46.919> copy<00:04:47.130> I<00:04:47.280> kind<00:04:47.550> of<00:04:47.580> got<00:04:47.729> really

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
see we I just copy I kind of got really

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.700 
see we I just copy I kind of got really
lazy<00:04:48.180> with<00:04:48.390> these<00:04:48.510> ledges<00:04:48.840> I<00:04:48.960> didn't<00:04:49.560> really

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
lazy with these ledges I didn't really

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.230 
lazy with these ledges I didn't really
have<00:04:49.919> any<00:04:50.100> ideas<00:04:50.430> but<00:04:50.669> I<00:04:50.729> feel<00:04:50.910> like<00:04:51.030> you<00:04:51.150> know

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
have any ideas but I feel like you know

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.000 
have any ideas but I feel like you know
like<00:04:51.270> a<00:04:51.510> park<00:04:51.810> would<00:04:51.990> have<00:04:52.169> you<00:04:52.650> know<00:04:52.770> some

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
like a park would have you know some

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.290 
like a park would have you know some
benches<00:04:53.400> kind<00:04:53.640> of<00:04:53.700> like<00:04:53.820> that<00:04:54.000> not<00:04:54.270> like

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
benches kind of like that not like

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.969 
benches kind of like that not like
concrete<00:04:54.900> ledges<00:04:55.320> because<00:04:55.620> those<00:04:55.770> aren't

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
concrete ledges because those aren't

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.260 
concrete ledges because those aren't
necessarily<00:04:56.100> the<00:04:56.460> most<00:04:56.610> comfortable<00:04:57.030> to<00:04:57.090> sit

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
necessarily the most comfortable to sit

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.120 
necessarily the most comfortable to sit
on<00:04:57.300> so<00:04:57.990> that's<00:04:58.289> what<00:04:58.440> I<00:04:58.470> put<00:04:58.740> here<00:04:58.950> obviously

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
on so that's what I put here obviously

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.560 
on so that's what I put here obviously
is<00:04:59.550> that<00:04:59.669> I<00:04:59.700> put<00:04:59.880> on<00:04:59.940> a<00:05:00.060> bunch<00:05:00.210> of<00:05:00.300> these<00:05:00.390> would

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
is that I put on a bunch of these would

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.000 
is that I put on a bunch of these would
you<00:05:00.600> still<00:05:01.080> skate<00:05:01.350> really<00:05:01.500> well<00:05:01.740> it's<00:05:01.950> just

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
you still skate really well it's just

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.100 
you still skate really well it's just
done<00:05:02.580> a<00:05:02.610> little<00:05:02.850> bit<00:05:03.090> lazy<00:05:03.570> I<00:05:03.720> don't<00:05:04.050> know

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
done a little bit lazy I don't know

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.590 
done a little bit lazy I don't know
probably<00:05:04.580> you<00:05:05.580> know<00:05:05.669> if<00:05:05.850> I<00:05:06.000> do<00:05:06.060> make<00:05:06.240> like<00:05:06.479> a

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
probably you know if I do make like a

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.570 
probably you know if I do make like a
different<00:05:07.320> part<00:05:07.440> I'd<00:05:07.590> probably<00:05:07.710> use<00:05:07.950> real

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
different part I'd probably use real

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.240 
different part I'd probably use real
benches<00:05:08.910> I<00:05:09.120> got<00:05:09.930> this<00:05:10.020> idea<00:05:10.169> for<00:05:10.500> using<00:05:10.860> this

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
benches I got this idea for using this

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.010 
benches I got this idea for using this
you<00:05:11.940> know<00:05:11.970> fountain<00:05:12.479> I<00:05:12.570> don't<00:05:12.720> know<00:05:12.780> I<00:05:12.810> feel

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
you know fountain I don't know I feel

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.590 
you know fountain I don't know I feel
like<00:05:13.080> I<00:05:13.320> felt<00:05:13.710> like<00:05:13.890> it<00:05:14.070> FET<00:05:14.430> fit<00:05:15.150> right<00:05:15.450> in

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
like I felt like it FET fit right in

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.150 
like I felt like it FET fit right in
here<00:05:15.780> I<00:05:15.810> can't<00:05:16.229> pronounce<00:05:16.380> that<00:05:16.650> for<00:05:16.800> a<00:05:16.830> reason

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
here I can't pronounce that for a reason

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.710 
here I can't pronounce that for a reason
and<00:05:17.250> now<00:05:17.760> I'm<00:05:17.850> just<00:05:17.970> going<00:05:18.180> in<00:05:18.240> circles<00:05:18.600> but

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
and now I'm just going in circles but

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
and now I'm just going in circles but
yeah<00:05:18.840> it's<00:05:18.990> not<00:05:19.140> really<00:05:19.410> more<00:05:19.530> like<00:05:19.680> a

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
yeah it's not really more like a

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.140 
yeah it's not really more like a
scalable<00:05:20.100> object<00:05:20.430> it's<00:05:20.580> more<00:05:20.729> just<00:05:20.850> kind<00:05:21.030> of

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
scalable object it's more just kind of

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.760 
scalable object it's more just kind of
to<00:05:21.539> look<00:05:21.690> but<00:05:21.900> it<00:05:22.020> actually<00:05:22.260> fits<00:05:22.470> in<00:05:22.590> really

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
to look but it actually fits in really

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.440 
to look but it actually fits in really
well<00:05:23.010> because<00:05:23.190> you<00:05:23.340> got<00:05:23.460> like<00:05:23.580> a<00:05:23.610> cool<00:05:24.240> like

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
well because you got like a cool like

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.730 
well because you got like a cool like
little<00:05:24.780> statue<00:05:25.020> over<00:05:25.260> there<00:05:25.380> and<00:05:25.470> then<00:05:25.560> we<00:05:25.620> got

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
little statue over there and then we got

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.110 
little statue over there and then we got
this<00:05:25.950> fountain<00:05:26.520> I<00:05:26.610> don't<00:05:26.729> know<00:05:26.789> it<00:05:26.850> looks<00:05:27.000> like

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
this fountain I don't know it looks like

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.250 
this fountain I don't know it looks like
something<00:05:27.390> that<00:05:27.419> would<00:05:27.539> be<00:05:27.630> made<00:05:27.810> in<00:05:27.840> a<00:05:28.080> city

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
something that would be made in a city

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.380 
something that would be made in a city
and<00:05:28.500> it's<00:05:29.370> just<00:05:29.490> kind<00:05:29.610> of<00:05:29.640> cool<00:05:29.789> this<00:05:30.300> is

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
and it's just kind of cool this is

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.909 
and it's just kind of cool this is
probably<00:05:30.660> like<00:05:30.720> the<00:05:30.810> main<00:05:31.080> object<00:05:31.289> of<00:05:31.680> the

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
probably like the main object of the

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.279 
probably like the main object of the
park<00:05:32.520> it's<00:05:32.729> inspired<00:05:33.120> from<00:05:33.450> there's<00:05:33.960> actually

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
park it's inspired from there's actually

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.710 
park it's inspired from there's actually
a<00:05:34.409> ledge<00:05:34.680> in<00:05:34.950> front<00:05:35.039> of<00:05:35.490> the<00:05:35.610> planetarium<00:05:36.510> in

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
a ledge in front of the planetarium in

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.839 
a ledge in front of the planetarium in
downtown<00:05:37.140> Chicago<00:05:37.620> that<00:05:38.099> is<00:05:38.280> similar<00:05:38.789> to

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
downtown Chicago that is similar to

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:39.290 
downtown Chicago that is similar to
something

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
something

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.420 
something
I<00:05:39.330> like<00:05:39.599> this<00:05:39.750> were<00:05:40.020> you<00:05:40.740> know<00:05:40.830> like<00:05:41.129> it<00:05:41.310> has<00:05:41.400> a

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
I like this were you know like it has a

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.710 
I like this were you know like it has a
flat<00:05:41.729> part<00:05:41.970> and<00:05:42.060> then<00:05:42.150> there's<00:05:42.300> like<00:05:42.449> a<00:05:42.479> ledge

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
flat part and then there's like a ledge

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
inspired by like the Flushing Meadows

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.649 
inspired by like the Flushing Meadows
Park<00:06:06.810> from<00:06:07.460> not<00:06:08.460> New<00:06:08.759> York<00:06:09.030> do<00:06:09.330> you'll<00:06:09.449> see<00:06:09.629> I

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:09.659 
Park from not New York do you'll see I

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:10.820 
Park from not New York do you'll see I
believe<00:06:09.960> I<00:06:10.050> don't<00:06:10.199> remember<00:06:10.349> what's<00:06:10.590> called

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
believe I don't remember what's called

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.649 
believe I don't remember what's called
oh<00:06:11.099> yeah<00:06:11.520> so<00:06:11.759> there's<00:06:12.150> like<00:06:12.300> this<00:06:12.419> gate

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:12.659 
oh yeah so there's like this gate

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:14.089 
oh yeah so there's like this gate
stopper<00:06:13.050> so<00:06:13.199> you<00:06:13.289> can<00:06:13.409> kind<00:06:13.590> of<00:06:13.680> skate<00:06:13.919> over

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:14.099 
stopper so you can kind of skate over

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:15.860 
stopper so you can kind of skate over
that's<00:06:14.250> it's<00:06:14.430> not<00:06:14.699> necessarily<00:06:15.360> unrealistic

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
that's it's not necessarily unrealistic

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.320 
that's it's not necessarily unrealistic
but<00:06:16.199> it's<00:06:16.860> definitely<00:06:16.979> a<00:06:17.219> big<00:06:17.400> grind<00:06:17.669> so<00:06:17.969> I

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330
