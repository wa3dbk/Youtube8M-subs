00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
set photon shockwave i know i hadn't

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.799 
set photon shockwave i know i hadn't
talked<00:00:08.910> much<00:00:09.059> about<00:00:09.120> it<00:00:09.510> there<00:00:09.630> ain't<00:00:09.660> many

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.930 
to get generation force in English of
course<00:00:29.760> this<00:00:30.150> August<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.109> think<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:32.219> this

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
course this August so I think that this

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.030 
course this August so I think that this
pack<00:00:33.360> will<00:00:33.570> be<00:00:33.660> out<00:00:33.780> for<00:00:33.809> us<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.350> November<00:00:34.890> if

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
pack will be out for us in November if

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.380 
pack will be out for us in November if
i'm<00:00:35.130> not<00:00:35.250> mistaken<00:00:35.370> on<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.969> i'm<00:00:36.090> not<00:00:36.120> sure<00:00:36.270> i

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
i'm not mistaken on that i'm not sure i

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.330 
i'm not mistaken on that i'm not sure i
mean<00:00:36.600> that's<00:00:36.750> not<00:00:36.899> confirmed<00:00:37.230> in<00:00:37.469> any<00:00:37.620> way<00:00:37.800> you

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
mean that's not confirmed in any way you

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.160 
mean that's not confirmed in any way you
know<00:00:38.460> that's<00:00:38.640> just<00:00:38.700> my<00:00:39.030> guess<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.930> know<00:00:40.050> it

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
know that's just my guess you know it

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.690 
know that's just my guess you know it
kind<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.379> falls<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.739> how<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.309> other<00:00:41.460> packs

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
kind of falls on how the other packs

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.400 
kind of falls on how the other packs
have<00:00:41.879> usually<00:00:42.000> done<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:42.960> yeah<00:00:43.110> we'll<00:00:43.290> get

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
have usually done that so yeah we'll get

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.720 
have usually done that so yeah we'll get
this<00:00:43.649> before<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.640> year<00:00:44.789> ends<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.090> course<00:00:45.329> and

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
this before the year ends of course and

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.580 
this before the year ends of course and
this<00:00:47.730> set<00:00:48.030> will<00:00:48.270> contain<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.989> new<00:00:49.260> pump

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
this set will contain the new pump

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.270 
this set will contain the new pump

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
photon and elbow art art tops I believes

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.920 
photon and elbow art art tops I believes
has<00:00:53.460> pronounced<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.030> i'll<00:00:54.690> have<00:00:54.809> more

the elbow I think it's house press I'm

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:28.940 
the elbow I think it's house press I'm
not<00:03:28.200> sure<00:03:28.320> if<00:03:28.380> I'm<00:03:28.500> pronounced<00:03:28.739> that<00:03:28.769> right

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
not sure if I'm pronounced that right

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.259 
not sure if I'm pronounced that right
and<00:03:29.100> also<00:03:29.190> please<00:03:29.610> forgive<00:03:29.850> me<00:03:29.970> if<00:03:30.090> I'm

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.539 
and also please forgive me if I'm
mispronouncing<00:03:30.810> that<00:03:31.290> terribly<00:03:31.590> but<00:03:32.400> they're

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
mispronouncing that terribly but they're

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.670 
mispronouncing that terribly but they're
basically<00:03:32.970> like<00:03:33.090> reptile<00:03:33.660> monsters<00:03:34.049> that

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
basically like reptile monsters that

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.210 
basically like reptile monsters that
have<00:03:35.280> a<00:03:35.340> way<00:03:35.610> where<00:03:36.540> they<00:03:36.630> can<00:03:36.840> be<00:03:37.070> there<00:03:38.070> on

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
have a way where they can be there on

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.920 
have a way where they can be there on
the<00:03:38.340> field<00:03:38.489> you<00:03:39.060> know<00:03:39.090> they're<00:03:39.329> weak<00:03:39.480> monsters

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
the field you know they're weak monsters

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.750 
the field you know they're weak monsters
and<00:03:40.170> then<00:03:40.500> when<00:03:40.860> you<00:03:40.950> have<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.340> dinosaur

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
and then when you have the dinosaur

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.759 
and then when you have the dinosaur
version<00:03:42.090> of<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.269> elbows<00:03:42.630> you<00:03:43.200> can<00:03:43.380> like<00:03:43.560> get

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
version of the elbows you can like get

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.350 
version of the elbows you can like get
rid<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.160> reptile<00:03:44.579> so<00:03:44.970> it's<00:03:45.090> like<00:03:45.150> it's

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
rid of the reptile so it's like it's

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.810 
rid of the reptile so it's like it's
evolving<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:45.989> then<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.739> exceeds<00:03:47.190> for<00:03:47.670> the

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
evolving and then the exceeds for the

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.780 
evolving and then the exceeds for the
elbows<00:03:48.180> are<00:03:48.540> going<00:03:49.350> to<00:03:49.410> be<00:03:49.530> dragons<00:03:50.190> so<00:03:50.579> in<00:03:50.730> a

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
elbows are going to be dragons so in a

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.310 
elbows are going to be dragons so in a
way<00:03:50.970> what<00:03:51.269> they're<00:03:51.420> trying<00:03:51.600> to<00:03:51.690> do<00:03:51.810> is<00:03:52.079> like

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
way what they're trying to do is like

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.460 
way what they're trying to do is like
the<00:03:52.590> reptile<00:03:53.160> is<00:03:53.340> evolving<00:03:53.760> into<00:03:54.480> the

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
the reptile is evolving into the

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.650 
the reptile is evolving into the
dinosaur<00:03:56.010> and<00:03:56.280> then<00:03:56.400> that<00:03:56.549> is<00:03:56.760> evolving<00:03:57.329> into

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
dinosaur and then that is evolving into

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.060 
dinosaur and then that is evolving into
the<00:03:57.810> dragon<00:03:58.170> I<00:03:58.290> will<00:03:58.620> probably<00:03:58.950> have<00:03:59.040> a

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
the dragon I will probably have a

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.470 
the dragon I will probably have a
discussion<00:03:59.370> on<00:03:59.610> that<00:03:59.670> sometime<00:04:00.000> where<00:04:00.299> I<00:04:00.329> can

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
discussion on that sometime where I can

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.910 
discussion on that sometime where I can
talk<00:04:00.630> more<00:04:00.780> in<00:04:00.870> depth<00:04:01.049> on<00:04:01.170> that<00:04:01.230> they<00:04:01.650> really

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920
