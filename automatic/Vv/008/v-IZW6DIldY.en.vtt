 Characters that are forgotten painted by the production staff themselves 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.789
 There is only one Tiida sign 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.880

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.520
 It is funnel a

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.050
 Also burst 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.940
 Oh dear 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:53.120
 The shell blu-ray of the example was Takana 0 It was a domestic blow 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.520
 Well I wonder if it was towards the sill shake 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.710
 Even this 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:03.260
 I think I took if you were everyone's mission but I'm a robot soldiers 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.890

 I have used standing and city ​​double action 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.180
 You were a robot soldier 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:16.510
 It is this time jerk dragon mission 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:24.120
 It is a 5-series following stages Yes we are approaching to the other next week 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:24.120
 We had no robot soldiers have a double action in the way of the list 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.630
 I was not even a rare adviser 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.550
 this 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:40.010
 Completely forgotten 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:42.300
 Not you completely or are combined Maybe you say you what a nice to have been forgotten 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:47.180
 I wonder if 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:53.060
 Well said that the film's 10 billion power warriors 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:58.640
 Although Well people the way you saw the Dragon Ball movie you already think you know 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:02.060
 It is why robot soldiers will come move from the Well organization 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.229
 Such for at the Well double action put in the way of mission 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.229
 It is said that I started crawling 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:13.530
 Well that would be naturally carded as well 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.470
 Though I stepped on 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.950
 Was not 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.069
 After all 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.580
 I was looking forward to it and looking forward to it 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.580
 I am 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:32.460
 Maako is a powerful robot to the extent of a united robot soldier 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:38.370
 Well this is bird funeral and 2 rare 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:42.790
 Robot soldier and tournament prom and double action hearing warehouse 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.680
 I intend spider story deck in the wind that 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.010
 I went there 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:54.280
 I was not doing it, I was waiting for that 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:55.420
 If you are sure that play is assembled in the deck where Mr. T was wearing and the play video is posted 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.950
 Like 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.370
 Yes i remember 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:07.890
 Well that time because he had not yet endured sprouting of card 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:10.390
 Yes I did not post it, but I have not done it now I have not posted 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.330
 Though 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.080
 Roboter with double action 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.300
 Wet forget 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:22.590
 Completely lucky 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:27.330
 I was really looking forward to this double action of this robot a 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.590
 That a little too much Yari only spear of that keep out the mission does not carded 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.490
 Do you say kana 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:38.330
 It may be said a little too much to say that it is overkill well though 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:38.330
 Though it may leave up to the next set 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:46.580
 It was what hippopotamus image height Well piggybacked to bandage also something Majin Bone more of Heroes 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.390
 It seems that you have some professional 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:53.510
 Yup 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:56.319
 Though the following is still good if the double action of the robot comes out in that set of Promo 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.620
 There is still hope though 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:02.810
 With jerk dragon mission 5 bullets 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.810
 And the little possession in the frame 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:13.470
 I wanted you to put it out , so there was no cooler in the brainwashing player. 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:17.970
 Well it may be natural not to be a robot soldier though 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:23.080
 Well I wanted to get it double action with robot version 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:26.889
 I I wanted you to mustard actual card not just mission 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.740
 I still have a couple left behind 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:34.190
 A set of Promo 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.190
 I have no choice but to expect
