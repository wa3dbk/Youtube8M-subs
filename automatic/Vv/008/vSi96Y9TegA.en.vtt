are you doing this is Mike here again I
did<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:02.970> review<00:00:03.389> on<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.659> PV<00:00:03.990> bandit<00:00:04.350> part<00:00:04.589> 1<00:00:04.770> I'm

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
did a review on the PV bandit part 1 I'm

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.530 
did a review on the PV bandit part 1 I'm
gonna<00:00:05.130> redo<00:00:05.609> it<00:00:05.759> because<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.150> camera<00:00:06.509> was

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
gonna redo it because the camera was

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.410 
gonna redo it because the camera was
shaky<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.230> it<00:00:08.040> would<00:00:08.250> get<00:00:08.460> blurry<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.030> really

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
shaky and it would get blurry and really

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.060 
shaky and it would get blurry and really
mess<00:00:09.660> with<00:00:09.809> your<00:00:09.929> eyes<00:00:10.170> so<00:00:10.530> I'm<00:00:10.650> wondering

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
mess with your eyes so I'm wondering

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.129 
mess with your eyes so I'm wondering
what<00:00:11.309> for<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.820> we'll<00:00:12.480> do<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:12.660> right<00:00:12.719> now

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.670 

okay<00:00:16.139> this<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.980> PV<00:00:17.490> bandit<00:00:18.260> 112<00:00:19.260> this<00:00:19.470> is

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
okay this is the PV bandit 112 this is

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.290 
okay this is the PV bandit 112 this is
the<00:00:19.830> 2008<00:00:20.820> model<00:00:22.130> it's<00:00:23.130> got<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.519> trans<00:00:23.850> tube

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
the 2008 model it's got the trans tube

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.599 
the 2008 model it's got the trans tube
technology<00:00:24.600> what<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.500> means<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:26.160> it's

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
technology what that means is it's

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.810 
technology what that means is it's
transistor<00:00:27.330> but<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.199> emulates<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.920> tube<00:00:29.130> amp<00:00:29.310> PV

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
transistor but it emulates a tube amp PV

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.350 
transistor but it emulates a tube amp PV
was<00:00:29.970> able<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.269> design<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.960> there<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:32.360> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
was able to design it there the the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.810 
was able to design it there the the
masters<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.290> they<00:00:34.680> designed<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:35.790> it

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
masters of this they designed it so it

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.060 
masters of this they designed it so it
actually<00:00:36.360> breaks<00:00:36.600> up<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.200> sounds<00:00:37.500> like<00:00:38.040> a

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
actually breaks up and sounds like a

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.770 
actually breaks up and sounds like a
tube<00:00:38.370> amp<00:00:38.579> with<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.910> characteristics<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.719> a

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
tube amp with the characteristics of a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.319 
tube amp with the characteristics of a
tube<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.140> fantastic<00:00:41.070> without<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.120> worry

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
tube and fantastic without the worry

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.930 
tube and fantastic without the worry
about<00:00:42.750> tubes<00:00:43.050> breaking<00:00:43.559> down<00:00:43.739> just<00:00:44.190> awesome

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
about tubes breaking down just awesome

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.360 
about tubes breaking down just awesome
this<00:00:45.120> amp<00:00:45.329> cost<00:00:45.600> me<00:00:45.840> two<00:00:46.530> hundred<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.010> twenty
