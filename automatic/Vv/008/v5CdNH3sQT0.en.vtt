hello there we are going to discuss

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.269 
hello there we are going to discuss
about<00:00:02.159> a<00:00:02.760> solar<00:00:03.030> cooker<00:00:03.540> and<00:00:03.750> he'll<00:00:03.870> make<00:00:04.170> one

00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:04.279 
about a solar cooker and he'll make one

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.070 
about a solar cooker and he'll make one
at<00:00:05.279> home<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.910> solar<00:00:06.270> cooker<00:00:06.420> is<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.690> device

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
at home a solar cooker is the device

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.770 
at home a solar cooker is the device
which<00:00:07.319> use<00:00:07.649> sunlight<00:00:08.400> directly<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:09.269> cook<00:00:09.480> food

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
which use sunlight directly to cook food

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.080 
which use sunlight directly to cook food
without<00:00:10.080> using<00:00:10.290> any<00:00:10.800> conventional<00:00:11.730> foil

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
without using any conventional foil

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.430 
without using any conventional foil
there<00:00:12.570> are<00:00:12.690> two<00:00:12.870> kind

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
there are two kind

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.430 
there are two kind
one<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:14.389> box<00:00:15.389> type<00:00:15.660> for<00:00:15.870> heat<00:00:16.020> trapped<00:00:16.289> up

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
one is box type for heat trapped up

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.380 
one is box type for heat trapped up
another<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.830> parabolic<00:00:17.250> type<00:00:17.520> which<00:00:17.789> converts

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
another is parabolic type which converts

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.929 
another is parabolic type which converts
the<00:00:18.630> heat<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.960> single<00:00:19.350> point<00:00:19.590> in<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.189> box<00:00:20.550> type

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
the heat to a single point in a box type

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.630 
the heat to a single point in a box type
the<00:00:21.210> heat<00:00:21.420> get<00:00:21.779> reflected<00:00:22.410> by<00:00:22.740> reflector<00:00:23.400> into

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
the heat get reflected by reflector into

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.160 
the heat get reflected by reflector into
a<00:00:23.820> box<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.779> then<00:00:25.740> get<00:00:25.949> trapped<00:00:26.340> by<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.670> top

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
a box and then get trapped by the top

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.259 
a box and then get trapped by the top
glass<00:00:28.170> like<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.740> greenhouse<00:00:29.070> effect<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.730> heat

this<00:02:03.070> on<00:02:03.310> top<00:02:03.460> of<00:02:03.670> it<00:02:03.820> and<00:02:03.970> I<00:02:04.450> use<00:02:04.750> a<00:02:05.020> handle

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
this on top of it and I use a handle

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.219 
this on top of it and I use a handle
also<00:02:06.040> for<00:02:06.310> this<00:02:06.460> to<00:02:06.700> open<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.210> glass<00:02:07.869> like

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
also for this to open the glass like

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.280 
also for this to open the glass like
that<00:02:08.850> now<00:02:09.850> we<00:02:09.910> have<00:02:10.179> to<00:02:10.300> make<00:02:10.479> a<00:02:10.720> deflector

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
that now we have to make a deflector

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.110 
that now we have to make a deflector
this<00:02:11.530> size<00:02:11.920> is<00:02:12.280> shown<00:02:12.970> on<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:14.730> screen
