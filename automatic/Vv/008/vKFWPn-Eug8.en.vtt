hi guys its community and to a cookie so
we<00:00:07.880> have<00:00:08.059> our<00:00:08.269> supplier<00:00:09.050> package<00:00:09.380> here<00:00:09.950> and<00:00:10.190> we

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:11.180 
we have our supplier package here and we

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.000 
we have our supplier package here and we
did<00:00:11.390> find<00:00:11.630> more<00:00:11.840> supplies<00:00:12.200> together<00:00:12.410> because

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.010 
did find more supplies together because

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.179 
did find more supplies together because
figure<00:00:13.400> packages<00:00:13.940> get<00:00:14.240> faster<00:00:15.110> shipping<00:00:15.350> so

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:16.189 
figure packages get faster shipping so

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:17.980 
figure packages get faster shipping so
and<00:00:16.519> we<00:00:16.820> want<00:00:17.029> to<00:00:17.090> keep<00:00:17.210> faster<00:00:17.599> so<00:00:17.810> that's

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
and we want to keep faster so that's

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.900 
and we want to keep faster so that's
where<00:00:18.109> your<00:00:18.230> orders<00:00:18.470> together<00:00:18.619> and<00:00:19.490> as<00:00:19.789> you

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
where your orders together and as you

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.970 
where your orders together and as you
can<00:00:20.060> see<00:00:20.090> here<00:00:20.450> is<00:00:20.600> the<00:00:20.630> package<00:00:21.289> and<00:00:21.530> it's

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
can see here is the package and it's

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
can see here is the package and it's
pretty<00:00:22.699> big<00:00:22.970> and<00:00:23.030> heavy<00:00:23.480> yep<00:00:24.340> but<00:00:25.340> look<00:00:25.550> I<00:00:25.699> did

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
pretty big and heavy yep but look I did

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.880 
pretty big and heavy yep but look I did
expect<00:00:26.150> it<00:00:26.480> to<00:00:26.600> be<00:00:26.720> a<00:00:26.750> lot<00:00:27.080> bigger<00:00:27.230> since<00:00:27.650> it

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
expect it to be a lot bigger since it

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.160 
expect it to be a lot bigger since it
was<00:00:28.039> a<00:00:28.070> lot<00:00:28.279> of<00:00:28.310> stuff<00:00:28.730> than<00:00:28.910> we<00:00:29.000> order<00:00:29.330> but<00:00:29.960> um
