here<00:02:04.740> look<00:02:08.539> looks<00:02:09.539> tasty<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.890> think<00:02:11.220> the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
here look looks tasty so you think the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.449 
here look looks tasty so you think the
blue<00:02:11.519> would<00:02:11.730> be<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.030> cola<00:02:12.360> flavor

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
blue would be the cola flavor

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.830 
blue would be the cola flavor
and<00:02:15.110> that's<00:02:16.110> what<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.319> taste<00:02:16.709> it

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
and that's what I taste it

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.650 
and that's what I taste it
now<00:02:18.840> mix<00:02:19.170> in<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.650> yellow<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:21.180> looks<00:02:21.420> like

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
now mix in the yellow and it looks like

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.449 
now mix in the yellow and it looks like
from<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.050> picture<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:22.920> it's<00:02:23.040> going<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.250> turn

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
from the picture that it's going to turn

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.570 
from the picture that it's going to turn
green<00:02:26.360> not<00:02:27.360> sure<00:02:27.569> how<00:02:27.750> true<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.580> we're

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
green not sure how true that is we're

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.470 
green not sure how true that is we're
going<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.790> find<00:02:30.030> out

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
going to find out

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.309 
going to find out
get<00:02:31.200> our<00:02:31.319> scraps<00:02:31.650> out<00:02:31.890> of<00:02:32.040> here<00:02:33.049> all<00:02:34.049> right<00:02:34.200> so

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
get our scraps out of here all right so

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.289 
get our scraps out of here all right so
this<00:02:34.410> one<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:34.739> softer<00:02:35.370> unless<00:02:35.849> you<00:02:35.940> could<00:02:36.060> tell

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
this one is softer unless you could tell

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.360 
this one is softer unless you could tell
now<00:02:38.330> seems<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.390> be<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.569> little<00:02:39.750> bit<00:02:40.370> different

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
now seems to be a little bit different

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.890 
now seems to be a little bit different
so<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:41.790> have<00:02:41.880> a<00:02:41.970> sticky<00:02:42.450> that<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:42.690> soft

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
so you have a sticky that is soft

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:54.530 
so you have a sticky that is soft
overall<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.019> whole<00:02:46.140> candy<00:02:49.040> mmm<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:54.090> does<00:02:54.329> have

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
overall the whole candy mmm it does have

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.229 
overall the whole candy mmm it does have
that<00:02:54.690> lemon<00:02:55.019> taste<00:02:55.170> but<00:02:55.349> I'm<00:02:56.310> not<00:02:56.760> seeing<00:02:57.090> much

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
that lemon taste but I'm not seeing much

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.130 
that lemon taste but I'm not seeing much
color<00:02:57.569> in<00:02:57.780> this<00:02:59.599> what<00:03:00.599> you're<00:03:00.780> seeing<00:03:00.989> is<00:03:01.110> what

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140

color in this what you're seeing is what
I've<00:03:01.380> seen<00:03:01.590> it's<00:03:01.769> almost<00:03:02.040> clear<00:03:03.019> not<00:03:04.019> the

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
I've seen it's almost clear not the

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.759 
I've seen it's almost clear not the
camera<00:03:04.470> this<00:03:04.590> time<00:03:04.650> usually<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.250> camera

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
camera this time usually the camera

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.490 
camera this time usually the camera
plays<00:03:07.769> tricks<00:03:08.130> on<00:03:08.400> ya<00:03:08.810> now<00:03:09.810> it<00:03:09.989> kind<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.290> has<00:03:10.470> a

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
plays tricks on ya now it kind of has a

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.550 
plays tricks on ya now it kind of has a
little<00:03:10.680> hint<00:03:11.430> of<00:03:11.640> green<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:12.810> try<00:03:13.019> to<00:03:13.079> shade<00:03:13.410> it

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
little hint of green you try to shade it

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.979 
little hint of green you try to shade it
it's<00:03:13.680> really<00:03:13.859> hard<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.280> see<00:03:14.549> let<00:03:15.510> me<00:03:15.600> mix<00:03:15.750> it<00:03:15.900> up

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
it's really hard to see let me mix it up

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.599 
it's really hard to see let me mix it up
a<00:03:16.079> little<00:03:16.200> bit<00:03:16.350> more<00:03:18.980> I'll<00:03:19.980> show<00:03:20.220> you<00:03:20.340> what<00:03:20.459> the

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
a little bit more I'll show you what the

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:25.780 
a little bit more I'll show you what the
consistency<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:22.910> so<00:03:23.910> it's<00:03:24.060> like<00:03:24.150> maple<00:03:24.540> syrup

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
consistency is so it's like maple syrup

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.849 
consistency is so it's like maple syrup
or<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:26.850> thick<00:03:27.180> honey<00:03:27.530> probably<00:03:28.530> more<00:03:28.620> like<00:03:28.829> a

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
or a thick honey probably more like a

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:34.370 
or a thick honey probably more like a
honey<00:03:31.730> okay<00:03:32.730> so<00:03:32.790> yeah<00:03:33.060> now<00:03:33.239> it<00:03:33.810> does<00:03:34.109> have<00:03:34.350> a

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
honey okay so yeah now it does have a

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.340 
honey okay so yeah now it does have a
hint<00:03:34.859> or<00:03:35.280> a<00:03:35.430> hue<00:03:35.880> of<00:03:35.910> green<00:03:36.150> but<00:03:36.930> if<00:03:37.049> I<00:03:37.139> put<00:03:37.319> it

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
hint or a hue of green but if I put it

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.020 
hint or a hue of green but if I put it
up<00:03:37.470> next<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.799> something<00:03:38.130> that<00:03:38.160> was<00:03:38.549> green<00:03:38.880> it

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
up next to something that was green it

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.990 
up next to something that was green it
would<00:03:39.150> really<00:03:39.299> stand<00:03:39.959> out<00:03:40.200> more<00:03:40.500> okay<00:03:41.220> so

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
would really stand out more okay so

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.150 
would really stand out more okay so
there's<00:03:42.180> number<00:03:42.540> two<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:43.019> then<00:03:43.500> number<00:03:43.560> three

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
there's number two and then number three

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.910 
there's number two and then number three
is<00:03:44.370> this<00:03:44.609> reddish<00:03:45.569> orange<00:03:48.319> so<00:03:49.319> here<00:03:49.470> we<00:03:49.560> go<00:03:49.739> the

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
is this reddish orange so here we go the

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.900 
is this reddish orange so here we go the
last<00:03:49.950> one<00:03:51.799> definitely<00:03:52.799> an<00:03:52.980> easier<00:03:53.400> kit<00:03:53.670> that

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
last one definitely an easier kit that

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.849 
last one definitely an easier kit that
Pizza<00:03:54.329> kid<00:03:54.540> took<00:03:54.750> awhile<00:03:54.900> just<00:03:55.109> to<00:03:55.530> get<00:03:55.650> it<00:03:55.739> all

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
Pizza kid took awhile just to get it all

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.770 
Pizza kid took awhile just to get it all
the<00:03:56.040> steps<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:56.549> to<00:03:56.670> make<00:03:56.849> a<00:03:56.880> little<00:03:57.209> pizza<00:03:57.420> box

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
the steps and to make a little pizza box

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.379 
the steps and to make a little pizza box
and<00:03:57.989> I<00:03:58.109> do<00:03:58.230> all<00:03:58.410> that<00:03:58.940> look<00:03:59.940> at<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:00.150> here<00:04:00.329> we

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
and I do all that look at that here we

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:07.580 
and I do all that look at that here we
go<00:04:02.209> mmm<00:04:03.209> see<00:04:03.510> thicker<00:04:03.810> No

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.500 

so<00:04:08.590> I'm<00:04:08.650> guessing<00:04:08.860> then<00:04:09.159> that<00:04:10.030> should<00:04:10.269> be<00:04:10.360> the

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
so I'm guessing then that should be the

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.300 
so I'm guessing then that should be the
strawberry<00:04:11.080> flavor<00:04:11.440> right<00:04:13.980> see<00:04:14.980> how<00:04:15.010> sticky

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
strawberry flavor right see how sticky

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:25.290 
strawberry flavor right see how sticky
that<00:04:15.519> is<00:04:17.910> it's<00:04:18.910> like<00:04:18.970> little<00:04:20.010> pieces<00:04:24.300> I'm

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
that is it's like little pieces I'm

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.590 
that is it's like little pieces I'm
tasting<00:04:25.510> it<00:04:25.780> off<00:04:25.870> the<00:04:26.020> bag<00:04:26.229> I<00:04:27.330> don't<00:04:28.330> get<00:04:28.570> a

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
tasting it off the bag I don't get a

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.170 
tasting it off the bag I don't get a
very<00:04:28.840> strong<00:04:29.139> flavor<00:04:29.560> with<00:04:29.919> that<00:04:30.070> one<00:04:30.280> so<00:04:31.060> here

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
very strong flavor with that one so here

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.640 
very strong flavor with that one so here
we<00:04:31.270> go

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.260 

but<00:04:38.650> you<00:04:38.800> feel<00:04:39.010> now<00:04:39.190> it's<00:04:39.340> definitely<00:04:39.970> change

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
but you feel now it's definitely change

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.650 
but you feel now it's definitely change
it's<00:04:40.510> got<00:04:40.750> a<00:04:41.370> pullback<00:04:42.449> consistency<00:04:43.449> to<00:04:43.630> it

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
it's got a pullback consistency to it

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.140 
it's got a pullback consistency to it
now<00:04:43.930> very<00:04:44.680> much<00:04:44.740> like<00:04:45.039> if<00:04:45.190> you<00:04:45.310> are<00:04:45.340> melting

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
now very much like if you are melting

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.409 
now very much like if you are melting
sugar<00:04:46.180> in<00:04:46.750> a<00:04:47.050> pot<00:04:47.639> and<00:04:48.639> you're<00:04:48.789> just<00:04:49.000> poured<00:04:49.330> it

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
sugar in a pot and you're just poured it

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.070 
sugar in a pot and you're just poured it
