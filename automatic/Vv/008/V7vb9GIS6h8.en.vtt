00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
the old Constitution at that stage when

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.520 
the old Constitution at that stage when
I<00:01:52.350> was<00:01:52.560> president<00:01:53.570> we<00:01:54.570> still<00:01:54.840> had<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.350> death

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.690 
I was president we still had the death
sentence<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.930> therefore<00:01:58.040> life<00:01:59.040> imprisonment

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
sentence and therefore life imprisonment

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.959 
sentence and therefore life imprisonment
usually<00:02:00.570> ended<00:02:00.960> after<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.590> maximum<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.340> 25

years and I believe that he should have

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.969 
years and I believe that he should have
been<00:02:08.129> released<00:02:08.729> apart<00:02:09.720> now<00:02:09.899> from<00:02:10.319> political

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
advanced when he at an earlier stage

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.610 
advanced when he at an earlier stage
suggests<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.370> he<00:02:17.610> should<00:02:17.819> be<00:02:17.970> released<00:02:18.620> but

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
suggests that he should be released but

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.160 
suggests that he should be released but
purely<00:02:20.190> in<00:02:20.519> terms<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.300> law<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.959> all

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
apart from political motivation which

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.850 
apart from political motivation which
also<00:02:28.950> played<00:02:29.340> part<00:02:29.640> in<00:02:29.849> my<00:02:30.000> decision<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.860> felt

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
Mandela was a very special man I think

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.260 
Mandela was a very special man I think
nothing<00:05:11.280> is<00:05:11.580> being<00:05:11.850> overplayed<00:05:12.390> I<00:05:13.310> think<00:05:14.310> he

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
nothing is being overplayed I think he

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.090 
nothing is being overplayed I think he
is<00:05:15.300> held<00:05:15.990> in<00:05:16.380> high<00:05:16.410> the<00:05:17.310> highest<00:05:17.910> esteem<00:05:19.100> not

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
South Africans but worldwide I think

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.370 
South Africans but worldwide I think
