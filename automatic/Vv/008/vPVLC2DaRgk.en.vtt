we<00:00:05.010> need<00:00:05.190> really<00:00:05.610> versatile<00:00:06.000> pieces<00:00:06.450> of

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:06.630 
we need really versatile pieces of

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:07.970 
we need really versatile pieces of
equipment<00:00:06.780> for<00:00:07.050> what<00:00:07.260> we're<00:00:07.410> doing<00:00:07.440> because

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
equipment for what we're doing because

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.970 
equipment for what we're doing because
we're<00:00:08.429> using<00:00:08.610> loaders<00:00:09.570> as<00:00:09.780> as<00:00:10.019> loadouts<00:00:10.650> and

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
we're using loaders as as loadouts and

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.940 
we're using loaders as as loadouts and
stockpiled<00:00:11.760> machines<00:00:12.180> and<00:00:12.390> at<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.720> face

we're using them just for what they're
designed<00:00:15.360> for<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.080> they're<00:00:16.949> engineered

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
designed for it and they're engineered

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.300 
designed for it and they're engineered
well<00:00:17.580> right<00:00:18.180> now<00:00:18.330> we're<00:00:18.570> running<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:19.039> 400<00:00:20.039> we've

another<00:00:43.950> thing<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.250> like<00:00:44.430> about<00:00:44.460> it's<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.910> high

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
another thing I like about it's the high

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.910 
another thing I like about it's the high
lift<00:00:45.360> capability<00:00:45.930> coming<00:00:46.379> over<00:00:46.559> these<00:00:46.680> open

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920

top<00:00:47.070> trailers<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.940> still<00:00:48.329> have<00:00:48.510> room<00:00:48.540> to<00:00:48.719> go

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
top trailers and still have room to go

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.389 
top trailers and still have room to go
and<00:00:49.350> be<00:00:49.440> able<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.620> completely<00:00:49.890> dump<00:00:50.160> I've

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
and be able to completely dump I've

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.540 
and be able to completely dump I've
never<00:00:50.940> experienced<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.540> before<00:00:52.399> we<00:00:53.399> have

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
never experienced that before we have

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.000 
never experienced that before we have
three<00:00:53.850> hydraulic<00:00:54.510> loaders<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.379> we've<00:00:55.800> had

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
three hydraulic loaders and we've had

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.040 
three hydraulic loaders and we've had
very<00:00:56.489> very<00:00:56.730> good<00:00:56.850> luck<00:00:57.300> with<00:00:57.510> those<00:00:57.629> machines

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
very very good luck with those machines

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.410 
very very good luck with those machines
ever<00:00:58.350> since<00:00:58.590> we<00:00:58.710> got<00:00:58.739> them<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.219> one<00:00:59.940> year<00:01:00.270> we

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
ever since we got them in one year we

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.290 
ever since we got them in one year we
put<00:01:00.570> almost<00:01:00.719> 5000<00:01:01.440> hours<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.860> a<00:01:01.890> machine

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
put almost 5000 hours on a machine

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.459 
put almost 5000 hours on a machine
considering<00:01:03.300> there's<00:01:03.420> only<00:01:03.600> 2,000<00:01:04.199> working

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:04.469

were to take the Doosan name off it and

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.379 
were to take the Doosan name off it and
just<00:03:27.150> run<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.660> loader<00:03:28.670> you'd<00:03:29.670> find<00:03:29.940> a<00:03:30.030> machine

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
just run the loader you'd find a machine

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:31.879 
just run the loader you'd find a machine
that<00:03:30.630> would<00:03:30.810> be<00:03:30.959> comparable<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.500> any<00:03:31.680> other

machine you would find and probably even
better<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:34.230> then<00:03:34.380> you<00:03:34.470> put<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.709> Doosan<00:03:35.069> name

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
better and then you put the Doosan name

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.970 
better and then you put the Doosan name
on<00:03:35.459> it<00:03:35.609> with<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:36.090> guarantee<00:03:36.989> behind<00:03:37.349> it<00:03:37.560> where
