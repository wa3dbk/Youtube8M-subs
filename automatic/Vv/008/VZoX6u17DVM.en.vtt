out<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:21.020> that's<00:02:22.020> what<00:02:23.240> increases<00:02:24.240> the

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
out of it and that's what increases the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.980 
out of it and that's what increases the
alkalinity<00:02:24.780> of<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.290> water<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.920> so<00:02:26.730> I<00:02:27.060> fill<00:02:27.900> it

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
alkalinity of the water and so I fill it

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.620 
alkalinity of the water and so I fill it
up<00:02:28.080> right<00:02:28.320> from<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.620> tap<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:29.820> wait<00:02:30.510> about

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
up right from the tap you wait about

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.600 
up right from the tap you wait about
five<00:02:31.020> or<00:02:31.200> ten<00:02:31.380> minutes<00:02:31.710> and<00:02:32.000> I<00:02:33.000> just<00:02:33.240> drink<00:02:33.510> the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
five or ten minutes and I just drink the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.190 
five or ten minutes and I just drink the
the<00:02:35.610> water<00:02:35.850> just<00:02:36.060> like<00:02:36.210> I<00:02:36.360> do<00:02:36.420> from<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.810> regular
