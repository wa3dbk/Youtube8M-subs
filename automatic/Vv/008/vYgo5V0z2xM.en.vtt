00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.710
 yes windows ten technician developer 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.580
 preview what should i say to that 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.620
 after a few hours is now 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.980
 I would have tried my say 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.840
 first impression is quite good there 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.900
 many nice innovations the start menu 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.820
 The return will be many greet me 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.800
 personally I have to admit warmly 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.000
 no matter i have been there since windows vista 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.550
 if i have any programs 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.640
 So anyway, it was always just going to be done 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.809
 windows button and then the letter 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.399
 initial letters of the program you 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.059
 wanted to start typing and then 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.190
 so that's what makes me go now 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.600
 not especially church or I have it 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.670
 not swim that was gone 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.800
 that is back but it is quite good 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.590
 I think that's not bad 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.930
 This tile optics are not that strong anymore 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.390
 to find one is where you actually too 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.199
 in normal windows 8 1 operating relative 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.960
 rarely encountered and she becomes 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.210
 yes, stay in the background for 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.540
 the use on tablets or touch 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.130
 equipment, therefore, I think that 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.510
 microsoft or good step in the 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.549
 right direction what the operation on 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.189
 the desktop has done in terms of 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.590
 virtual desktops the possibilities of 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.580
 window organization that you too 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.080
 apps can shrink that in the same way 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.250
 be treated like other programs 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.250
 also that one knew so far 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.430
 for such an early version works 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.920
 actually quite good we have 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.659
 even seen play works in 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.450
 many cases with the drivers of 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.920
 windows 8.1 then actually very good going on 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.780
 origin has a few problems 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.220
 I do not want to exclude now 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.899
 that may be elsewhere 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.979
 lies and the problem and not 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:49.000
 necessarily here at microsoft windows 10 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.320
 we will see how the whole thing 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.360
 I am definitely developing 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.960
 looking forward to it and I would be fine 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.050
 Imagine windows 10 again 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.360
 a few more lovers I say at the time 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.899
 users will find as windows 8 and 81 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.700
 I have done the hope that the format 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.489
 We also tried it for the first time 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.140
 have you liked it quite well 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.269
 please just comment under the 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.190
 video under the article what you think of that 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.930
 format holds what's in the article 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.550
 what he wants to change , what she might want 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.220
 still wants to know around windows 10 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.640
 and co, I'll say huh and see you 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.640
 next time
