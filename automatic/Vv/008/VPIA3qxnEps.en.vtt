00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:15.210
 do not 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.900
 do not 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.900
 ansa 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.730
 in this 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.000
 I'm afraid 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.520
 I will bring back the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.100
 solution how to increase the accounts 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.320
 because of what 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.210
 when they understood him or did not know what 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.820
 do what 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.380
 well first we know what to do 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.760
 this 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.760
 I'm intentional about the plugin 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:49.170
 plugin that 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.510
 so the moment of a server this 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.519
 registry 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.019
 to be able to place this on the server 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:03.649
 now this tutorial to increase 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:03.649
 the accounts whether you're already going 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.149
 well given to all spaces using 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.170
 different accounts on the same server 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.760
 obviously this is not going to work since 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.640
 this is for 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.300
 this limit or increase the accounts in 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.520
 the servers 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.859
 by the owner 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.790
 well as I said have to have 

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:27.530
 plugin to 2000 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.150
 obviously they are going to say it is to load 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.150
 his sheep true and description 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.240
 obviously when you turn on the server 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.159
 lets vote 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.390
 and they will generate the folder 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.640
 which is called out be 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.780
 and in the same agreements 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.920
 can avoid 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.920
 the wolfpack 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:04.180
 but showing the tics stories 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.180
 the second option 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.480
 the third option 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.580
 and in says max register 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.450
 one would rather be this maximum of 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.450
 poly recorder p 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:24.730
 so you can enter the server 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.650
 with your same ip and you have to be at least 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.320
 changes in value of this case is wanted 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:34.240
 is that it is one and it is growing if you want 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:36.470
 that is 34 100 what you want besides 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.230
 you put it year 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.569
 of course in 3 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.240
 it is not save 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.210
 and that would be all basically 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.530
 I'm more reboot is the server and 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.530
 you already look is what it is 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.600
 he admits it is configured and could already 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.760
 enter the players with 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.480
 these issues 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.480
 account 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.690
 that would be everything and also I hope already clear 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.790
 your doubt 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.440
