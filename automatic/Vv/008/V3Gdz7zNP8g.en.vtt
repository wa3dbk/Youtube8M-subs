00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.820
 discuss will unpack here here in this 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:40.700
 the package should have bluetooth 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.700

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.350
 without a knife unpack 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.670
 while I calm down I will say bluetooth 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:57.680

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:01.890
 obd2 diagnostic connector 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:05.369
 protocols lm 327 which is 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.000
 almost already in many people but one I 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.990
 I have lost my friend a long time ago 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.869

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.950
 will be under the video to see what it is 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.300
 for writing 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.210
 according to the seller 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:28.759
 the version ate exactly this bluetooth 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.970
 adapter 2.1 we usually have a version 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:36.750
 1.5 1.4 she had 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.070
 adapter version 2.1 let's see what 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.950
 noteworthy she has a button 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.570
 off that's not to here 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.940
 waste extra battery power i 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.220
 so I wanted to take it with 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.480
 shutting down so I took a test 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:58.410
 so that comes with us 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:01.380
 we have a CD with 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.120
 software most likely 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.550
 it's for the computer but I don't use them 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.780
 never really there is a disk 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:15.770
 as always , let's open the second one 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:19.340
 parcel second parcel with us 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.700
 there should be a track number stub on 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:28.970
 this car is kia venga 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:30.260
 hinged door lock plugs they 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.900
 now this form 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:37.390
 bare that is bare metal here and 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.740
 respectively 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.740
 wanted some kind of aesthetic 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.940
 pleasures to close these 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.940
 covers so 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.960
 Here we are two bags in 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.410
 each bag has two plugs 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:03.160
 right-left they look like this 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:06.190
 the way that is, the principle is very much 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.180
 good plastic good and league casting 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.800
 by the way I will tell you not the worst 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.550
 pretty average good 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.370
 We'll see the level later. 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:21.940
 i will simply insert it now not 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.200
 I have time so I put a little later and 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.090
 the final result and you must 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.770
 will show 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.220
 I would also like to say now bye 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:36.540
 I will go immediately and at the same time will tell you by 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:41.020
 about the previous unpacking video 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.840
 mount on the head and chest I promised 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.990
 you throw off the test results and 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.490
 so testing the monopod decided to do 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:53.080
 as follows 1 because of our friends 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:56.710
 mates club venga forum point 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:01.350
 ru now he does not have a car 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:04.210
 kia venga but no matter what he does 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.870
 ski slopes are not appropriate 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.490
 agreed to test both cameras then 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.630
 you can have two cameras at the same time 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:16.580
 we fix it accordingly 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:20.989
 let's test it in combat conditions 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:23.520
 to be exactly 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:28.440
 applicable as you specifically in this 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:31.190
 case after we test 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.930
 I test video 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.520
 I will lay out in order to 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.830
 could see but actually 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:43.560
 Such videos are already full on the Internet 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:47.340
 special on such a straightforward something new 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:51.630
 we will not bring well, just to be 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:56.660
 options for people to see and watch 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:05:01.550
 how it turns out well and on this i 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:03.860
 finish this 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.169
