00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.630
 task conditions for the robot to drive 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:11.419
 arbitrary track 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:13.659
 from handy households to drive 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:18.220
 he needs to finish 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:20.780
 finish is indicated by a white sheet of paper 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:26.590
 the robot must determine for itself what it is 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:30.950
 drove to the finish line and stop the track 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:35.440
 protected by improvised items 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:39.500
 tall with a robot or above 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:45.489
 between fences there may be a distance 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:48.489
 in which the robot cannot pass the robot 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.489
 programmed 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:57.649
 laid programmed algorithm 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:01.600
 he determines the obstacles determines 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.600
 route to go where 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.020
 the robot 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.200
 subscribe to the channel to be in 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.410
 news course on the construction of this
