00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.670 
very clear idea of what is happening
with<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.709> dirt<00:02:10.890> moving<00:02:11.310> on<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.610> project

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
with the dirt moving on the project

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.630 
with the dirt moving on the project
and<00:02:12.769> it<00:02:12.859> makes<00:02:13.310> it<00:02:14.060> very<00:02:14.390> very<00:02:14.950> easy<00:02:15.950> to<00:02:16.400> move

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
and it makes it very very easy to move

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.360 
and it makes it very very easy to move
the<00:02:16.819> dirt<00:02:17.000> one<00:02:17.329> time<00:02:17.599> and<00:02:17.930> one<00:02:18.049> time<00:02:18.079> only<00:02:18.370> the

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.869 
has a 3d display in the operators cab so
that<00:02:28.579> the<00:02:28.700> operator<00:02:29.150> can<00:02:29.900> literally<00:02:30.739> see<00:02:31.069> the
