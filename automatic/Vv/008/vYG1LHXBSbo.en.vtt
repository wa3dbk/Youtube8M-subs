00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
doing a business yeah well i think

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.580 
doing a business yeah well i think
people<00:00:53.940> underestimate<00:00:54.719> how<00:00:54.750> serious<00:00:55.440> that

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
people underestimate how serious that

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.619 
people underestimate how serious that
injury<00:00:55.949> he<00:00:56.489> got<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> couple<00:00:56.910> years<00:00:57.120> ago<00:00:57.210> against

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
injury he got a couple years ago against

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.990 
injury he got a couple years ago against
a<00:00:57.719> cause<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:57.989> mean<00:00:58.260> it's<00:00:58.710> not<00:00:58.829> just<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
a cause I mean it's not just the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.459 
a cause I mean it's not just the
physical<00:01:00.180> side<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:00.930> also<00:01:01.079> the

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
physical side of it it's also the

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.110 
physical side of it it's also the
psychological<00:01:01.800> side<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.520> going<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:02.910> for

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
psychological side of it going in for

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.539 
psychological side of it going in for
big<00:01:03.239> challenges<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.989> fighting<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.129> know<00:01:05.280> out

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
big challenges and fighting you know out

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.700 
big challenges and fighting you know out
on<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.790> pitch<00:01:05.970> again<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.299> think<00:01:06.360> today<00:01:07.200> sort<00:01:07.590> of

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
on the pitch again I think today sort of

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.410 
on the pitch again I think today sort of
marks<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.520> full<00:01:08.700> circle<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.299> I

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
marks the full circle so I

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.359 
marks the full circle so I
psychologically<00:01:10.200> scored<00:01:10.830> against<00:01:11.130> them<00:01:11.189> and

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
psychologically scored against them and

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.010 
psychologically scored against them and
I<00:01:11.430> think<00:01:11.490> that's<00:01:11.700> completely<00:01:12.510> put<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.869> bed

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
I think that's completely put it to bed

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.390 
I think that's completely put it to bed
now<00:01:13.170> he's<00:01:13.290> going<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.619> for<00:01:13.650> challengers<00:01:14.159> again

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
now he's going in for challengers again

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.010 
now he's going in for challengers again
his<00:01:14.820> score<00:01:15.030> against<00:01:15.270> Stoke<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.630> think<00:01:15.810> it's

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
his score against Stoke I think it's

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.240 
his score against Stoke I think it's
ought<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.259> be<00:01:16.350> forgotten<00:01:16.740> about<00:01:16.890> now<00:01:17.070> and

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
ought to be forgotten about now and

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.380 
ought to be forgotten about now and
onwards<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:17.970> upwards

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
onwards and upwards

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.120

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
it's going to be a big question what if

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.140 
it's going to be a big question what if
we<00:02:19.350> can<00:02:19.500> build<00:02:19.740> a<00:02:19.890> lead<00:02:20.070> at<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.340> top<00:02:20.550> you<00:02:21.060> know
