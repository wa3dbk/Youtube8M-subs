become vulnerable to the counter and he

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:30.690 
become vulnerable to the counter and he
didn't<00:02:28.989> do<00:02:29.079> that<00:02:29.109> because<00:02:29.859> I<00:02:30.189> think<00:02:30.250> all<00:02:30.579> the

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
know is my view you know see people that

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.839 
know is my view you know see people that
otherwise<00:03:02.200> is<00:03:02.889> that<00:03:03.159> if<00:03:03.310> you're<00:03:03.459> fighting<00:03:03.819> a

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
otherwise is that if you're fighting a

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.369 
otherwise is that if you're fighting a
guy<00:03:04.000> who's<00:03:04.209> not<00:03:04.389> coming<00:03:04.659> to<00:03:04.840> fight<00:03:05.079> and

guy who's not coming to fight and

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.949 
guy who's not coming to fight and
backing<00:03:05.769> off<00:03:05.889> your<00:03:06.099> design<00:03:06.389> then<00:03:07.389> you<00:03:07.840> know

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
backing off your design then you know

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.300 
backing off your design then you know
you're<00:03:08.109> not<00:03:08.169> gonna<00:03:08.319> catch<00:03:08.530> him<00:03:08.650> cleaning<00:03:09.129> he

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
you're not gonna catch him cleaning he

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.309 
you're not gonna catch him cleaning he
takes<00:03:09.669> two<00:03:09.939> to<00:03:10.150> fight<00:03:10.329> and<00:03:10.810> that's<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.109> point
