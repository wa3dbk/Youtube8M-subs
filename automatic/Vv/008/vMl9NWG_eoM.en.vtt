00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
hello and welcome to this section on

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.010 
hello and welcome to this section on
rotating<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.830> flipping<00:00:11.550> in<00:00:11.790> our<00:00:12.390> course<00:00:12.720> on

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:13.020 
rotating and flipping in our course on

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.210 
rotating and flipping in our course on
Adobe<00:00:13.920> PSC<00:00:14.460> 11<00:00:14.960> now<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.020> can<00:00:16.350> rotate<00:00:16.650> or<00:00:17.160> flip

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
Adobe PSC 11 now you can rotate or flip

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.940 
Adobe PSC 11 now you can rotate or flip
a<00:00:17.880> selection<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.810> layer<00:00:19.710> or<00:00:20.100> an<00:00:20.670> entire<00:00:21.120> image

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
a selection a layer or an entire image

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.740 
a selection a layer or an entire image
so<00:00:22.950> let's<00:00:23.160> take<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.370> look<00:00:23.580> at<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.940> in<00:00:24.210> relation

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
so let's take a look at that in relation

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.450 
so let's take a look at that in relation
to<00:00:24.780> this<00:00:25.110> picture<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.650> two<00:00:25.830> sheep<00:00:26.190> on<00:00:26.400> the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
to this picture of the two sheep on the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.240 
to this picture of the two sheep on the
deck<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.030> the<00:00:27.330> ship

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.580 

so<00:00:32.250> let's<00:00:32.460> go<00:00:32.580> to<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.850> image<00:00:33.090> menu<00:00:33.140> hover<00:00:34.140> over

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
so let's go to the image menu hover over

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.970 
so let's go to the image menu hover over
rotate<00:00:35.220> we<00:00:35.580> get<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> flyout<00:00:36.120> menu<00:00:36.720> the<00:00:37.470> top<00:00:37.710> two

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
rotate we get a flyout menu the top two

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.370 
rotate we get a flyout menu the top two
sections<00:00:38.520> were<00:00:38.670> interested<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.390> here<00:00:39.690> first

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
sections were interested in here first

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.400 
sections were interested in here first
of<00:00:40.620> all<00:00:40.770> we<00:00:41.100> have<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:42.090> six<00:00:42.660> commands<00:00:43.170> here

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
of all we have this six commands here

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.430 
of all we have this six commands here
that<00:00:43.980> relate<00:00:44.400> in<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.940> case<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.140> image

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
that relate in this case to the image

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.010 
that relate in this case to the image
and<00:00:46.680> then<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:47.370> have<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.699> second<00:00:48.330> group<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.660> six

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
and then we have a second group of six

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.780 
and then we have a second group of six
that<00:00:49.470> relate<00:00:49.830> to<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.100> currently<00:00:50.519> selected

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
that relate to the currently selected

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.780 
that relate to the currently selected
layer<00:00:51.860> so<00:00:52.860> let's<00:00:53.070> start<00:00:53.340> with<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.550> top

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
layer so let's start with the top

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.650 
layer so let's start with the top
section<00:00:54.059> first<00:00:54.720> ninety<00:00:55.379> degrees<00:00:55.739> left<00:00:56.660> that

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
section first ninety degrees left that

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.960 
section first ninety degrees left that
rotates<00:00:58.080> the<00:00:58.320> whole<00:00:58.590> thing<00:00:58.949> ninety<00:00:59.610> degrees

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
rotates the whole thing ninety degrees

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.490 
rotates the whole thing ninety degrees
left<00:01:00.530> do<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.650> same<00:01:01.860> again

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
left do the same again

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.690 
left do the same again
and<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.650> course<00:01:04.799> that's<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.100> equivalent<00:01:05.610> of

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
and of course that's the equivalent of

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.539 
and of course that's the equivalent of
doing<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:06.120> hundred<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.600> eighty<00:01:06.720> degrees<00:01:07.200> left

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
doing a hundred and eighty degrees left

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.710 
doing a hundred and eighty degrees left
if<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:09.060> click<00:01:09.479> again<00:01:09.630> image<00:01:10.530> rotate<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.720> do

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
if I click again image rotate and do

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.090 
if I click again image rotate and do
custom<00:01:13.729> custom<00:01:14.729> lets<00:01:14.940> me<00:01:15.090> specify<00:01:15.630> an<00:01:16.290> angle

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
custom custom lets me specify an angle

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.070 
custom custom lets me specify an angle
let's<00:01:17.549> say<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.850> do<00:01:18.920> 270<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.479> right<00:01:21.479> or<00:01:21.690> left

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
let's say I do 270 and right or left

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.750 
let's say I do 270 and right or left
I'll<00:01:22.170> stick<00:01:22.590> with<00:01:22.619> right<00:01:23.250> at<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> moment

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
I'll stick with right at the moment

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.960 
I'll stick with right at the moment
click<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.690> OK<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.440> that's<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.460> equivalent<00:01:26.880> of

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
click on OK and that's the equivalent of

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.929 
click on OK and that's the equivalent of
doing<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.450> ninety<00:01:27.960> degree<00:01:28.110> right<00:01:28.939> rotation

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
doing a ninety degree right rotation

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.230 
doing a ninety degree right rotation
from<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.600> start<00:01:31.549> now<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.610> get<00:01:32.850> back<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.119> where

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
from the start now to get back to where

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.690 
from the start now to get back to where
we<00:01:33.299> were<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.659> begin<00:01:33.960> with<00:01:34.170> rotate<00:01:34.860> 90<00:01:35.370> degrees

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
we were to begin with rotate 90 degrees

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.480 
we were to begin with rotate 90 degrees
left<00:01:36.030> takes<00:01:36.660> us<00:01:36.870> back<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.200> there

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.580 

now<00:01:42.490> let's<00:01:42.760> try<00:01:42.970> flipping<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:44.020> whole<00:01:44.200> image

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
now let's try flipping the whole image

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.150 
now let's try flipping the whole image
image<00:01:45.780> rotate<00:01:46.920> flip<00:01:47.920> horizontal<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:50.560> flips

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
image rotate flip horizontal this flips

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.670 
image rotate flip horizontal this flips
in<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.820> horizontal<00:01:52.510> direction<00:01:53.200> so<00:01:53.410> the<00:01:53.500> whole

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
in the horizontal direction so the whole

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.560 
in the horizontal direction so the whole
thing<00:01:53.980> changes<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:54.940> sheep<00:01:55.120> are<00:01:55.270> now<00:01:55.390> looking

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
thing changes the sheep are now looking

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.210 
thing changes the sheep are now looking
instead<00:01:56.140> of<00:01:56.260> from<00:01:56.440> right<00:01:56.620> to<00:01:56.650> left<00:01:56.830> they're

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
instead of from right to left they're

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.610 
instead of from right to left they're
looking<00:01:57.490> from<00:01:57.700> left<00:01:57.970> to<00:01:58.060> right<00:01:58.360> and<00:01:58.690> then<00:01:59.470> also

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
looking from left to right and then also

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.030 
looking from left to right and then also
obviously<00:01:59.920> image<00:02:00.820> rotate<00:02:01.420> flip<00:02:02.020> vertical

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
obviously image rotate flip vertical

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.370 
obviously image rotate flip vertical
the<00:02:03.430> whole<00:02:03.610> thing<00:02:03.880> is<00:02:04.150> flipped<00:02:04.810> over<00:02:04.990> on<00:02:05.230> his

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
the whole thing is flipped over on his

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.240 
the whole thing is flipped over on his
head

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.530 

so<00:02:10.250> that's<00:02:10.460> dealing<00:02:10.729> with<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:11.000> whole<00:02:11.180> image

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
so that's dealing with the whole image

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.360 
so that's dealing with the whole image
let's<00:02:11.750> look<00:02:12.050> at<00:02:12.200> some<00:02:12.410> operations<00:02:13.070> on

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
let's look at some operations on

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.580 
let's look at some operations on
individual<00:02:13.880> layers<00:02:14.180> this<00:02:14.990> is<00:02:15.110> an<00:02:15.200> area<00:02:15.470> where

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
individual layers this is an area where

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.710 
individual layers this is an area where
you<00:02:15.740> have<00:02:15.950> to<00:02:16.040> be<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.190> little<00:02:16.340> bit<00:02:16.580> careful<00:02:16.940> let

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
you have to be a little bit careful let

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.110 
you have to be a little bit careful let
me<00:02:17.810> show<00:02:18.020> you<00:02:18.080> first<00:02:18.710> of<00:02:18.920> all<00:02:19.040> rotating<00:02:19.910> the

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
me show you first of all rotating the

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.750 
me show you first of all rotating the
background<00:02:20.690> copy<00:02:21.080> layer<00:02:21.290> so<00:02:22.280> this<00:02:22.520> is

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
background copy layer so this is

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.150 
background copy layer so this is
basically<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.960> ship<00:02:24.320> or<00:02:24.560> part<00:02:24.800> of<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:24.950> ship

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
basically the ship or part of the ship

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.120 
basically the ship or part of the ship
and<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.490> deck<00:02:25.730> so<00:02:26.450> click<00:02:26.720> on<00:02:26.750> image<00:02:27.470> click<00:02:27.920> on

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
and the deck so click on image click on

all<00:02:33.800> got<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.010> word<00:02:34.190> layer<00:02:34.490> in<00:02:34.730> them<00:02:34.910> and<00:02:35.150> let's

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
all got the word layer in them and let's

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.640 
all got the word layer in them and let's
do<00:02:35.870> a<00:02:36.110> flip<00:02:36.470> layer<00:02:37.010> of<00:02:37.400> vertical<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:39.380> there<00:02:39.530> we

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
do a flip layer of vertical and there we

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.760 
do a flip layer of vertical and there we
are<00:02:39.680> we<00:02:40.070> have<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.959> layer<00:02:41.959> with<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.410> ship<00:02:42.590> on

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
are we have the layer with the ship on

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.710 
are we have the layer with the ship on
it<00:02:42.920> flipped<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.880> sheep<00:02:44.120> are<00:02:44.300> now<00:02:44.450> hanging

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
it flipped the sheep are now hanging

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.460 
it flipped the sheep are now hanging

upside down on their own if I wanted to

perform an operation on the sheep layer

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.350 
perform an operation on the sheep layer
might<00:02:52.010> think<00:02:52.280> I<00:02:52.459> could<00:02:52.640> do<00:02:52.730> exactly<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.330> same

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
might think I could do exactly the same

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.720 
might think I could do exactly the same
thing<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.020> achieve<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.530> same<00:02:54.770> effect<00:02:54.980> but

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
thing and achieve the same effect but

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.640 
thing and achieve the same effect but
that<00:02:55.850> won't<00:02:56.000> actually<00:02:56.360> happen<00:02:57.080> because<00:02:57.440> the

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
that won't actually happen because the

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.130 
that won't actually happen because the
Sheep<00:02:58.010> if<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:58.850> look<00:02:59.180> at<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.420> thumbnail<00:02:59.900> here

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
Sheep if you look at the thumbnail here

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.670 
Sheep if you look at the thumbnail here
it<00:03:00.290> helps<00:03:00.500> you<00:03:00.890> to<00:03:01.340> realize<00:03:01.700> they<00:03:02.690> are<00:03:02.870> just<00:03:03.380> an

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
it helps you to realize they are just an

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.160 
it helps you to realize they are just an
object<00:03:04.489> in<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.880> corner<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:05.690> if<00:03:05.840> I<00:03:05.989> were<00:03:06.110> to

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
object in the corner and if I were to

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.560 
object in the corner and if I were to
flip<00:03:06.470> them<00:03:06.800> vertically<00:03:07.370> they<00:03:08.060> would<00:03:08.239> only

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
flip them vertically they would only

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.870 
flip them vertically they would only
flip<00:03:08.989> within<00:03:09.410> their<00:03:09.770> own<00:03:09.920> dimension<00:03:10.400> within

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
flip within their own dimension within

flip within their own dimension within
this<00:03:11.600> object<00:03:11.900> itself<00:03:12.800> so<00:03:13.040> I've<00:03:13.130> got<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.459> layer

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610

them elsewhere in the picture but they

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.990 
them elsewhere in the picture but they
don't<00:03:41.060> flip<00:03:41.450> over<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:42.709> whole<00:03:43.100> size<00:03:43.670> of<00:03:43.880> the

don't flip over the whole size of the
image<00:03:44.239> because<00:03:44.690> they<00:03:44.870> don't<00:03:45.080> occupy<00:03:45.620> the

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
whole size of the image they just a

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.530 
whole size of the image they just a
relatively<00:03:48.350> small<00:03:48.830> object<00:03:49.459> within<00:03:49.730> it<00:03:50.030> that

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
relatively small object within it that

relatively small object within it that
is<00:03:50.720> movable

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.600 

now<00:03:55.349> let<00:03:55.500> me<00:03:55.530> just<00:03:55.770> make<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.130> image<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.459> little

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
now let me just make the image a little

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.430 
now let me just make the image a little
bit<00:03:56.760> bigger<00:03:57.030> I'm<00:03:57.150> gonna<00:03:57.360> do<00:03:57.599> view<00:03:57.959> fit<00:03:58.290> on

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
bit bigger I'm gonna do view fit on

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.699 
bit bigger I'm gonna do view fit on
screen<00:03:59.150> there<00:04:00.150> is<00:04:00.330> also<00:04:00.510> a<00:04:00.750> free<00:04:01.110> rotate

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
screen there is also a free rotate

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.160 
screen there is also a free rotate
option<00:04:02.250> that<00:04:02.370> you<00:04:02.550> can<00:04:02.790> apply<00:04:03.120> to<00:04:03.270> these<00:04:03.810> same

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
option that you can apply to these same

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.250 
option that you can apply to these same
things<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.709> image<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.310> selection<00:04:05.849> etc<00:04:06.480> let's

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
things the image the selection etc let's

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.110 
things the image the selection etc let's
try<00:04:07.560> that<00:04:07.770> now<00:04:08.010> on<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.400> layer<00:04:08.700> we've

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
try that now on the layer we've

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.180 
try that now on the layer we've
currently<00:04:09.599> still<00:04:09.870> got<00:04:10.020> the<00:04:10.140> sheep<00:04:10.440> selected

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
currently still got the sheep selected

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.190 
currently still got the sheep selected
so<00:04:11.489> image<00:04:12.319> rotate<00:04:13.580> free<00:04:14.580> rotate<00:04:15.180> layer<00:04:15.660> and

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
so image rotate free rotate layer and

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.580 
so image rotate free rotate layer and
what<00:04:17.070> this<00:04:17.400> enables<00:04:18.000> us<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.209> do<00:04:18.540> is<00:04:18.570> to<00:04:18.959> rotate

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
what this enables us to do is to rotate

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.700 
what this enables us to do is to rotate
the<00:04:20.220> selected<00:04:21.150> item<00:04:21.540> the<00:04:21.750> layer<00:04:21.989> the

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
the selected item the layer the

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.480 
the selected item the layer the
selection<00:04:23.280> or<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.639> image<00:04:24.080> freely<00:04:25.340> using<00:04:26.340> the

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
mouse or keyboard shortcuts and just

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.390 
mouse or keyboard shortcuts and just
rotate<00:04:30.389> it<00:04:30.540> visually<00:04:31.200> to<00:04:31.740> exactly<00:04:32.190> the

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
rotate it visually to exactly the

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.640 
rotate it visually to exactly the
setting<00:04:32.850> that<00:04:32.880> you<00:04:33.180> want<00:04:33.479> when<00:04:34.320> you've<00:04:34.470> got

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
the setting that you want you can either

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.020 
the setting that you want you can either
confirm<00:04:36.720> or<00:04:37.229> cancel<00:04:37.500> on<00:04:38.160> this<00:04:38.400> occasion<00:04:38.880> I'm

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
confirm or cancel on this occasion I'm

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.610 
confirm or cancel on this occasion I'm
going<00:04:39.479> to<00:04:39.600> cancel

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.800 

so<00:04:44.620> we've<00:04:44.800> looked<00:04:44.950> at<00:04:45.190> rotating<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:46.240> flipping

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
so we've looked at rotating and flipping

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.380 
so we've looked at rotating and flipping
layers<00:04:47.530> and<00:04:47.890> the<00:04:47.980> whole<00:04:48.160> image<00:04:48.490> let's<00:04:49.120> just

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
layers and the whole image let's just

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.390 
layers and the whole image let's just
try<00:04:49.600> a<00:04:49.630> selection<00:04:50.230> let's<00:04:50.440> go<00:04:50.710> to<00:04:50.770> the

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
try a selection let's go to the

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.330 
try a selection let's go to the
background<00:04:52.030> copy<00:04:52.270> to<00:04:52.660> the<00:04:52.840> ship<00:04:53.050> itself<00:04:53.560> let

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
background copy to the ship itself let

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.540 
background copy to the ship itself let
me<00:04:54.490> use<00:04:54.730> the<00:04:54.970> quick<00:04:55.330> selection<00:04:55.750> tool<00:04:55.990> and<00:04:56.650> I'm

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
me use the quick selection tool and I'm

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.480 
me use the quick selection tool and I'm
just<00:04:57.580> going<00:04:57.910> to<00:04:58.270> select<00:04:58.930> the<00:04:59.890> top<00:05:00.130> of<00:05:00.340> the

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
just going to select the top of the

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.430 
just going to select the top of the
funnel<00:05:00.880> on<00:05:01.000> the<00:05:01.150> ship<00:05:01.450> there<00:05:01.690> that'll<00:05:02.080> do<00:05:02.200> for

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
funnel on the ship there that'll do for

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.060 
funnel on the ship there that'll do for
now<00:05:02.500> and<00:05:03.060> with<00:05:04.060> any<00:05:04.270> selection<00:05:05.140> on<00:05:05.320> any<00:05:05.680> layer

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
now and with any selection on any layer

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.460 
now and with any selection on any layer
with<00:05:06.700> the<00:05:06.850> selection<00:05:07.210> the<00:05:07.480> marching<00:05:07.960> ants<00:05:08.140> in

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
with the selection the marching ants in

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.640 
with the selection the marching ants in
view<00:05:08.830> if<00:05:09.220> I<00:05:09.790> go<00:05:09.970> to<00:05:10.030> the<00:05:10.360> image<00:05:10.840> menu<00:05:10.870> and<00:05:11.530> look

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
view if I go to the image menu and look

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.880 
view if I go to the image menu and look
at<00:05:11.800> rotate<00:05:12.430> you'll<00:05:13.330> see<00:05:13.750> that<00:05:14.230> the<00:05:14.410> menu<00:05:14.590> has

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
at rotate you'll see that the menu has

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.710 
at rotate you'll see that the menu has
actually<00:05:15.310> changed<00:05:15.340> because<00:05:16.030> the<00:05:16.300> second

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
actually changed because the second

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
actually changed because the second
section<00:05:16.990> no<00:05:17.740> longer<00:05:18.130> says<00:05:18.340> layer<00:05:18.880> it<00:05:19.210> says

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
section no longer says layer it says

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.000 
section no longer says layer it says
selection<00:05:20.740> so<00:05:21.520> for<00:05:21.790> instance<00:05:22.150> I<00:05:22.270> could<00:05:22.600> say

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
selection so for instance I could say

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:28.470 
selection so for instance I could say
rotate<00:05:24.010> selection<00:05:24.970> 90<00:05:25.480> degrees<00:05:25.900> right<00:05:27.480> and

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480 
rotate selection 90 degrees right and

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.930 
rotate selection 90 degrees right and
what<00:05:28.660> happens<00:05:28.990> now<00:05:29.320> is<00:05:29.350> just<00:05:30.160> the<00:05:30.400> selected

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
what happens now is just the selected

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.970 
what happens now is just the selected
part<00:05:31.240> of<00:05:31.360> the<00:05:31.420> image<00:05:31.570> rotates<00:05:32.530> now<00:05:32.770> of<00:05:32.860> course

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 
part of the image rotates now of course

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.090 
part of the image rotates now of course
it<00:05:33.580> leaves<00:05:33.910> a<00:05:34.090> hole<00:05:34.120> I<00:05:34.810> can<00:05:35.260> see<00:05:35.710> through<00:05:36.070> a

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
it leaves a hole I can see through a

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.010 
it leaves a hole I can see through a
transparent<00:05:36.940> section<00:05:37.300> of<00:05:37.360> the<00:05:37.450> image<00:05:37.570> because

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
transparent section of the image because

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.980 
transparent section of the image because
I've<00:05:38.430> rotated<00:05:39.430> part<00:05:40.000> of<00:05:40.150> the<00:05:40.270> image<00:05:40.540> and<00:05:40.750> left

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
I've rotated part of the image and left

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.960 
I've rotated part of the image and left
the<00:05:41.080> gap<00:05:41.290> behind<00:05:41.740> but<00:05:42.280> again<00:05:42.520> you<00:05:42.700> can<00:05:42.850> be

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
the gap behind but again you can be

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.030 
the gap behind but again you can be
creative<00:05:43.510> with<00:05:43.720> that<00:05:43.750> and<00:05:44.140> that<00:05:44.470> may<00:05:44.620> be<00:05:44.680> just

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.040 
creative with that and that may be just

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.380 
creative with that and that may be just
the<00:05:45.160> sort<00:05:45.340> of<00:05:45.400> thing<00:05:45.580> you<00:05:45.670> need<00:05:45.880> to<00:05:46.000> do<00:05:46.180> to

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
the sort of thing you need to do to

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.690 
the sort of thing you need to do to
achieve<00:05:46.510> what<00:05:46.990> you<00:05:47.110> want<00:05:47.320> to<00:05:47.500> do<00:05:47.650> so<00:05:48.250> you'll

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
achieve what you want to do so you'll

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.960 
achieve what you want to do so you'll
only<00:05:48.940> see<00:05:49.630> the<00:05:50.290> rotate<00:05:50.830> and<00:05:51.040> flip<00:05:51.220> commands

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
only see the rotate and flip commands

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.750 
only see the rotate and flip commands
related<00:05:52.450> to<00:05:53.020> a<00:05:53.050> selection<00:05:53.860> when<00:05:54.340> you<00:05:54.490> actually

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
related to a selection when you actually

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.550 
related to a selection when you actually
have<00:05:55.330> a<00:05:55.390> selection

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.290 

but<00:06:00.250> one<00:06:00.430> other<00:06:00.580> thing<00:06:00.790> I'd<00:06:00.910> like<00:06:01.060> to<00:06:01.120> point

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
but one other thing I'd like to point

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.500 
but one other thing I'd like to point
out<00:06:01.750> here<00:06:02.290> if<00:06:02.560> you<00:06:03.060> continue<00:06:04.060> with<00:06:04.090> this

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
out here if you continue with this

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.360 
out here if you continue with this
selection<00:06:04.930> here<00:06:05.139> the<00:06:05.500> top<00:06:05.740> of<00:06:05.889> the<00:06:05.980> funnel<00:06:06.310> on

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
selection here the top of the funnel on

the ship image rotate free rotate
selection<00:06:12.160> if<00:06:13.090> you<00:06:13.870> show<00:06:14.230> the<00:06:14.440> tool<00:06:14.740> options

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
selection if you show the tool options

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.730 
selection if you show the tool options
at<00:06:15.490> the<00:06:15.610> bottom<00:06:15.870> there<00:06:16.870> are<00:06:17.020> a<00:06:17.050> number<00:06:17.169> of

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
at the bottom there are a number of

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.030 
at the bottom there are a number of
things<00:06:18.250> you<00:06:18.610> can<00:06:18.790> change<00:06:19.389> such<00:06:19.840> as<00:06:19.870> the<00:06:20.440> fact

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.040 
things you can change such as the fact

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.000 
things you can change such as the fact
that<00:06:21.220> not<00:06:21.370> only<00:06:21.400> can<00:06:21.910> you<00:06:21.970> do<00:06:22.330> a<00:06:22.360> rotation

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
that not only can you do a rotation

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.590 
that not only can you do a rotation
transformation<00:06:24.010> you<00:06:24.160> can<00:06:24.190> do<00:06:24.520> a<00:06:24.730> scale<00:06:25.210> or<00:06:25.510> a

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.600 
transformation you can do a scale or a

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.409 
transformation you can do a scale or a
skew<00:06:26.500> transformation<00:06:27.370> here<00:06:27.639> so<00:06:27.850> for<00:06:28.090> instance

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419 
skew transformation here so for instance

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:31.710 
skew transformation here so for instance
with<00:06:28.990> a<00:06:29.050> skew<00:06:29.650> I<00:06:29.919> could<00:06:30.520> actually<00:06:30.669> skew<00:06:31.540> the

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
with a skew I could actually skew the

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.460 
with a skew I could actually skew the
shape<00:06:32.020> make<00:06:32.350> it<00:06:32.560> an<00:06:32.680> unusual<00:06:32.860> shape<00:06:33.820> like<00:06:34.120> that

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470 
shape make it an unusual shape like that

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.980 
shape make it an unusual shape like that
but<00:06:35.470> I<00:06:35.620> can<00:06:35.860> also<00:06:36.190> change<00:06:36.940> the<00:06:37.360> point<00:06:37.660> about

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
but I can also change the point about

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.560 
but I can also change the point about
which<00:06:38.290> the<00:06:38.740> rotation<00:06:39.130> occurs<00:06:39.700> so<00:06:40.389> with

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:40.570 
which the rotation occurs so with

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.379 
which the rotation occurs so with
rotation<00:06:41.200> selected<00:06:41.830> I<00:06:42.010> can<00:06:42.280> choose<00:06:42.970> one<00:06:43.360> of

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:43.389 
rotation selected I can choose one of

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:45.300 
rotation selected I can choose one of
these<00:06:43.660> points<00:06:44.380> on<00:06:44.560> the<00:06:44.680> square<00:06:45.040> in<00:06:45.190> the<00:06:45.280> middle

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 
these points on the square in the middle

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.690 
these points on the square in the middle
as<00:06:45.940> the<00:06:46.870> reference<00:06:47.380> point<00:06:47.470> location<00:06:48.340> for<00:06:48.610> the

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:48.700 
as the reference point location for the

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.930 
as the reference point location for the
rotation<00:06:49.330> so<00:06:49.570> if<00:06:49.810> I<00:06:50.200> click<00:06:50.590> that<00:06:50.860> as<00:06:51.280> the

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:51.940 
rotation so if I click that as the

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.570 
rotation so if I click that as the
reference<00:06:52.419> point<00:06:52.510> for<00:06:52.930> the<00:06:53.020> rotation<00:06:53.770> watch

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580 
reference point for the rotation watch

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.030 
reference point for the rotation watch
what<00:06:54.790> happens<00:06:55.120> if<00:06:55.300> I<00:06:55.419> now<00:06:55.630> rotate<00:06:56.229> I<00:06:56.410> rotate

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.040 
what happens if I now rotate I rotate

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.000 
what happens if I now rotate I rotate
about<00:06:57.190> that<00:06:58.020> rather<00:06:59.020> than<00:06:59.380> the<00:06:59.500> middle<00:06:59.800> of<00:06:59.889> the

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.010 
about that rather than the middle of the

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.490 
about that rather than the middle of the
image<00:07:00.160> now<00:07:00.790> there<00:07:00.970> are<00:07:01.090> several<00:07:01.389> options<00:07:01.870> down

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:02.500 
image now there are several options down

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.170 
image now there are several options down
here<00:07:02.830> that<00:07:03.040> you<00:07:03.100> might<00:07:03.370> want<00:07:03.580> to<00:07:03.640> experiment

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:04.180 
here that you might want to experiment

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.800 
here that you might want to experiment
with<00:07:04.510> a<00:07:04.840> combination<00:07:05.680> of<00:07:06.100> rotate<00:07:06.640> scale<00:07:07.120> skew

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:07.810 
with a combination of rotate scale skew

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.170 
with a combination of rotate scale skew
and<00:07:08.020> various<00:07:08.860> options<00:07:09.370> you<00:07:09.669> can<00:07:09.789> get<00:07:09.970> some

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.180 
and various options you can get some

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.450 
and various options you can get some
really<00:07:10.360> great<00:07:10.660> effects<00:07:11.229> using<00:07:12.039> these

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:12.460 
really great effects using these

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.679 
really great effects using these
facilities<00:07:13.030> in<00:07:13.330> PSC<00:07:13.990> 11

00:07:17.679 --> 00:07:17.689 

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:19.999 

so<00:07:18.689> there<00:07:18.900> we<00:07:18.990> are<00:07:19.020> in<00:07:19.139> this<00:07:19.349> section<00:07:19.590> we've

00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:20.009 
so there we are in this section we've

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:22.429 
so there we are in this section we've
looked<00:07:20.340> at<00:07:20.580> rotating<00:07:21.330> and<00:07:21.599> flipping<00:07:22.110> hole

00:07:22.429 --> 00:07:22.439 
looked at rotating and flipping hole

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:25.760 
looked at rotating and flipping hole
images<00:07:22.919> layers<00:07:23.729> and<00:07:24.150> selections<00:07:25.050> and<00:07:25.289> we've

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:25.770 
images layers and selections and we've

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.529 
images layers and selections and we've
also<00:07:25.919> looked<00:07:26.189> at<00:07:26.400> some<00:07:26.430> of<00:07:27.000> the<00:07:27.180> options

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:27.539 
also looked at some of the options

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:30.350 
also looked at some of the options
associated<00:07:28.439> with<00:07:28.590> rotating<00:07:29.159> so<00:07:30.090> there's

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 
associated with rotating so there's

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.850 
associated with rotating so there's
quite<00:07:30.509> a<00:07:30.539> bit<00:07:30.719> there<00:07:30.900> for<00:07:31.050> you<00:07:31.139> to<00:07:31.319> experiment

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:31.860 
quite a bit there for you to experiment

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.730 
quite a bit there for you to experiment
with<00:07:32.340> in<00:07:32.669> the<00:07:33.000> meantime<00:07:33.259> please<00:07:34.259> join<00:07:34.530> me<00:07:34.650> in

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:34.740 
with in the meantime please join me in

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.520 
with in the meantime please join me in
