00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.450
 in this video I will prove that everyone 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.340
 can draw a little fashion for those who 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.039
 do not know what a disgust is too 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.320
 used in fashion design then by 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.210
 your effort to do yourself 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.010
 will know you will learn easy easy 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.039
 I do not know how to draw water. 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:31.830
 do not draw because so if you 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:33.390
 train if you can saw the first 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.579
 something that we are going to do the child 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.920
 a straight line of nine-part media 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:44.390
 equal and then total will give 10 up 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.390
 in the first part will be the head 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:52.010
 in the third twig it will be where it goes 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.989
 being the bust in the room so the 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:59.149
 waist 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:04.759
 The site enters so will have the knee in the 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:06.890
 9ยบ the ankle just after the feet and me 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.020
 sorry for the parents or roses that the 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.659
 dislike but this is one thing that 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.229
 really have to train a lot rukh 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.420

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:19.310
 Anyway, in the way of the waist we go 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.210
 to do the elbow and in the following 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.670
 pulse 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:27.500
 just after the hands another thing that also 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.810
 You have to train a lot of honor now to 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.520
 draw something on top of our model 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.690
 following the legal is to place a paper 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.929
 up and draw on what you want 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.929
 to draw 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.710
