00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.670 
I woke up it was still wet but my hair
dries<00:01:33.360> extremely<00:01:33.869> fast<00:01:34.079> with<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.350> texturizer

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
dries extremely fast with the texturizer

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.260 
dries extremely fast with the texturizer
so<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.070> check<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.400> out<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> braids<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.090> within

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
so I check it out the braids and within

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.030 
so I check it out the braids and within
ten<00:01:36.810> or<00:01:36.930> fifteen<00:01:37.229> minutes<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.590> was<00:01:37.680> totally

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
ten or fifteen minutes it was totally

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.609 
ten or fifteen minutes it was totally
dry<00:01:38.220> without<00:01:38.549> me<00:01:38.700> doing<00:01:38.850> anything<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.390> it

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
dry without me doing anything to it

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.649 
dry without me doing anything to it
which<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.829> love<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.700> convenience<00:01:42.299> about<00:01:42.509> it

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
which I love the convenience about it

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.639 
which I love the convenience about it
and<00:01:42.750> that's<00:01:42.899> really<00:01:43.110> why<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.350> got<00:01:43.560> the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
and that's really why I got the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.359 
and that's really why I got the
texturizer<00:01:43.979> anyway<00:01:44.570> so<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:46.189> love<00:01:47.189> the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
texturizer anyway so I love the

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.580 
texturizer anyway so I love the
convenience<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.180> it's<00:01:48.479> like<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:49.079> mean<00:01:49.290> but

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
convenience of it it's like I mean but

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.469 
convenience of it it's like I mean but
again<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.159> do<00:01:50.399> have<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.700> really<00:01:51.000> take<00:01:51.180> care<00:01:51.390> of

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
again you do have to really take care of

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.789 
again you do have to really take care of
your<00:01:51.600> hair<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.899> have<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.140> decide<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.500> it's

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
your hair you have to decide that it's

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.080 
your hair you have to decide that it's
something<00:01:52.979> it's<00:01:53.189> like<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:54.060> a

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
something it's like a like a

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.359 
something it's like a like a
life-changing<00:01:54.780> decision<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.130> have<00:01:56.159> to

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
life-changing decision that you have to

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.399 
life-changing decision that you have to
make<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:57.210> you're<00:01:57.390> actually<00:01:57.540> gonna<00:01:57.780> put

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
forth the effort to take care of it then

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.359 
forth the effort to take care of it then
I<00:02:00.840> also<00:02:01.049> wanted<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.380> tell<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.649> guys<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.829> ever

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
I also wanted to tell you guys that ever

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.429 
I also wanted to tell you guys that ever
since<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.700> did<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.030> protein<00:02:03.390> treatment<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.960> did

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
since I did that protein treatment I did

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.490 
since I did that protein treatment I did
shoot<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.950> video<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:06.079> effigy<00:02:07.079> two-step

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
shoot the video the effigy two-step

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.490 
shoot the video the effigy two-step
protein<00:02:07.829> treatment

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
protein treatment

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.200 
protein treatment
I<00:02:08.530> shot<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:08.950> video<00:02:09.070> but<00:02:09.460> my<00:02:09.580> camera<00:02:09.759> cut<00:02:10.090> off

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
I shot the video but my camera cut off

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.600 
I shot the video but my camera cut off
so<00:02:10.840> I<00:02:11.230> don't<00:02:11.470> have<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:11.800> whole<00:02:11.950> thing<00:02:12.250> but<00:02:12.520> the

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
so I don't have the whole thing but the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.370 
so I don't have the whole thing but the
next<00:02:12.850> time<00:02:12.910> I<00:02:13.030> do<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.300> in<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.480> few<00:02:13.630> weeks<00:02:13.870> I<00:02:14.050> will

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
next time I do it in a few weeks I will

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.140 
next time I do it in a few weeks I will
definitely<00:02:14.860> try<00:02:15.130> my<00:02:15.280> best<00:02:15.430> to<00:02:15.550> tape<00:02:15.790> it

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
definitely try my best to tape it

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.210 
definitely try my best to tape it
but<00:02:16.630> ever<00:02:16.900> since<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.290> did<00:02:17.350> that<00:02:17.530> might<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:17.920> have

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
but ever since I did that might I have

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.900 
but ever since I did that might I have
seen<00:02:18.490> huge<00:02:18.940> improvements<00:02:19.090> in<00:02:19.690> my<00:02:19.810> hair<00:02:20.140> um

haven't seen nearly as much shedding the

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.620 
haven't seen nearly as much shedding the
breakage<00:02:39.640> was<00:02:39.850> more<00:02:40.120> what<00:02:40.270> I<00:02:40.300> was<00:02:40.480> concerned

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
breakage was more what I was concerned

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.449

about<00:02:40.870> crocheting<00:02:41.260> is<00:02:41.500> natural<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.340> I

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
about crocheting is natural and I

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.160 
about crocheting is natural and I
definitely<00:02:42.670> haven't<00:02:43.209> seen<00:02:43.420> as<00:02:43.570> much<00:02:43.690> breakage

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
definitely haven't seen as much breakage

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.560 
definitely haven't seen as much breakage
so<00:02:44.500> I'm<00:02:45.430> loving<00:02:45.670> that<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.150> then<00:02:46.239> when<00:02:46.330> I<00:02:46.360> took

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
strands just felt so different they felt

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.490 
strands just felt so different they felt
so<00:02:51.550> much<00:02:51.670> stronger<00:02:52.030> so<00:02:52.690> much<00:02:52.810> more<00:02:53.020> nourished
