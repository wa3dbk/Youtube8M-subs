00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.930
 this recipe 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.870
 let's occupy three chicken breasts 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.520

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.500
 chicken two tablespoons sauce 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.530
 oyster is that they could actually be 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.840
 smoked and milkshake options with milk 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.880

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.700
 spoonful of dried tree chili and 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.640
 ground two tablespoons of oil 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.820
 sesame onion two mendocinos 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.399
 cambray finely chopped 200 grams of 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.429
 mushrooms filleted a cup of 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:46.010
 chinese peas boiled two tablespoons 

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:49.129
 of ginger grated three carrots 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.609
 peeled and chopped into thin strips and 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:55.789
 boiled two packages of jaume in knots 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:58.519
 boiled two tablespoons of peanut and 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.609
 two tablespoons of chopped walnut let's 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:04.909
 season quickly the chickens salt and pepper 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.830
 we're going to seal them in a pan in this 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.260
 case I will not use oil because 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.100
 I need to recover what remains 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.820
 stuck in the pan then as well as 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.600
 we are going to put it 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.830
 value 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.830
 pan is already 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:29.050
 since I hit you a little chicken in the 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.420
 pan let's add some oil 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.130
 you wait for what you want to be a 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.200
 little pegadito and now they add the 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.470
 oil in this case I'm going to add 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.150
 canola oil using all 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.190
 nutrients that we will use the day 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:49.280
 today because canoy oil has omega 3 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.890
 omega 6 and omega 9 in balance in addition 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.990
 has vitamin is from vitamin e is 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.420
 great to restore all the 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.220
 body tissues is an antioxidant and 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.560
 this antioxidant then also eliminate 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.010
 free radicals of the body and so 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.190
 It makes aging more 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.880
 dragged on 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.450
 as well 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.860
 also with the purchase of a bottle of 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.440
 cinnamon we help the children of the telethon 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.989
 which is great and is also a liter 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.060
 thing that the others oil after 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:23.650
 calling you're on the tape here is that 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.650
 I recommend oil with side 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:32.569
 let's do in in another pot we're going to 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:36.430
 put the half cup of soy sauce 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.430
 we are going to add the one with chrome 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.340
 we are also going to add the sauce 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.489
 the options that I repeat to you can be 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.489
 smoked options milled with milk 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.830
 let's add a pinch of sugar 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.150
 good 2a 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.220
 and the chile 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.950
 and here may be the dry chili of your 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.459
 preference as chipotle wash 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.900
 and I do not care about the one that most 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.909
 like 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.829
 in another pan and let's start 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:15.750
 First add the onion with a 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.750
 trickle of oil but sesame 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.090
 and here we are going to leave our 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.090
 onion 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:34.420
 see what 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:36.910
 in 2005 they found the vestige of the 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.630
 oldest successful pasta that barely us 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.180
 it was almost almost in china then 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.540
 between you already saw that there was so dean 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.310
 that peace is Italian but no longer 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.590
 we knew finally if it's final 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.610
 and it was probably the pole frame that was 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:58.330
 took italy the part 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.080
 which we greatly appreciate 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.100
 because it's delicious 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.660
 an interesting source of carbohydrates 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.240
 and carbohydrates hear their super 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.090
 necessary for daily activity or 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.060
 be that the carbohydrate makes you fat 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.370
 do not get fat 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.840
 for anything contrary is necessary for the 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.510
 good functioning of the mind of 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.280
 body that we react to all 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.380
 circumstances 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.020
 very important 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.210
 well I'm going to pepper the onion 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.680
 and I will incorporate the rest of the 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.039
 ingredients that in this case is going to be 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.039
 mushroom 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.800
 you can make the variations that 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.870
 want in the increase these are the ones that 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.140
 I chose because I'm putting proteins 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.780
 beta carotene in carrot released 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.600
 of the Chinese pea 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.960
 and I'm going to take advantage of it's a food 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.919
 oriental to add the ginger that 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:00.410
 it is a root that has some powers 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:03.050
 incredible antioxidants and besides that 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:06.020
 it's antioxidants helps eliminate all 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.570
 the conditions of gastritis cholera 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.110
 you do not know what to do, really take 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.180
 ginger 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.570
 and it could be ready I'm going to add it 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.570
 here 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.740
 I'm going to add some soy 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.310
 and my sauce has boiled 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.640
 and I will incorporate it in this same 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.640
 mixture 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.650
 Exactly, I will also incorporate the 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.650
 jaume gurus 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.930
 the nuts 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:55.729
 and the peanuts 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:58.459
 villeta in what is finished sewing 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:01.869
 mitch increases the hand is a cut that 

00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:01.869
 we came back with a divorced pudding 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.680
 today's pepper the Chinese who are going to 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.110
 have been the first to have created 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.410
 the charmin is as it was the first 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:20.750
 reference written in the videos was 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:25.120
 coming from the tang dynasty between the 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.120
