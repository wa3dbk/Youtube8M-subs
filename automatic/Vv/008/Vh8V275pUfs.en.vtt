00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.850
 Recently in a modern car dealership 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.100
 a customer of the car dealership transfers a novel measuring system with his car 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.539
 in the courtyard entrance 

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:12.269
 At the same time, the profile depths are all tires 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.020
 measured virtually without guidance and that he is this team of the dealership 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.659
 transmitted 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:21.589
 at the same time, the driver is informed of a light indicator on the tread depth 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:24.449
 informed of his critical tire 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.649
 the indicator has made the customer curious 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.649
 he is curious what it has on it 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.710
 about the mark or the customer name as if the term has the 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.850
 Service consultants quick access to the data of the customer vehicle and 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.650
 sees the new critical measurement results of professional depths available 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.120
 A picture is worth a thousand words 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.480
 So, the service advisor can provide the customer with the protocol expressing the condition 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.500
 convincingly present his tires 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.389
 In this case, the customer can rely on it 

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:03.589
 from his dealership in time to the risks of too low tread depth 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.619
 and closed by a bad set the suspension on one side 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.210
 to reach 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.090
 to be informed 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.970
 the European minimum legal profiling depth is one point 6 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.120
 However, millimeter traffic experts recommend at least three millimeters at 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.120
 Summer tires and four millimeters for winter tires 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.630
 Guilt or complicity in accidents when not the weather conditions 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.770
 adjusted tires 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.830
 as well as a fine for causing traffic obstructions or hazards 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.480
 This is the moment when the customer is through this information 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.740
 competent car dealership is grateful 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.060
 and the order like to renew the worn tires or one 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.740
 Suspension measurement extended 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.890
 One night phoning and an indication of such defects at the pickup 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.340
 of the vehicle are rarely successful and left behind 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.800
 the customer a bad impression 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.520

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.380

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.300
