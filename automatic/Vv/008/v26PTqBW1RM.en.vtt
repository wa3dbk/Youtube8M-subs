car and I'm more aware of the turbo when
I<00:00:49.760> am<00:00:50.059> driving<00:00:50.330> at<00:00:50.600> higher<00:00:50.809> speeds<00:00:51.350> as<00:00:51.770> opposed

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
I am driving at higher speeds as opposed

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.610 
I am driving at higher speeds as opposed
to<00:00:52.790> accelerating<00:00:53.600> from<00:00:53.780> a<00:00:53.900> standstill

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.650 

where<00:00:57.620> you<00:00:57.710> going<00:00:57.920> down<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:58.160> motorway<00:00:58.660> 6070

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
where you going down the motorway 6070

where you going down the motorway 6070
miles<00:00:59.840> now<00:01:00.140> if<00:01:00.320> you<00:01:00.440> accelerate<00:01:00.710> then<00:01:01.220> it

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
miles now if you accelerate then it

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.999 
miles now if you accelerate then it
seems<00:01:01.670> to<00:01:01.850> have<00:01:02.030> more<00:01:02.210> power<00:01:02.600> which<00:01:03.470> makes<00:01:03.680> one

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
seems to have more power which makes one

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:06.430 
seems to have more power which makes one
which<00:01:04.339> makes<00:01:04.610> certain<00:01:05.600> supposing<00:01:06.110> more

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
which makes certain supposing more

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.950 
which makes certain supposing more
mid-range<00:01:06.950> torque<00:01:07.450> now<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:08.509> first<00:01:08.750> thing<00:01:08.900> I

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
mid-range torque now the first thing I

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.510 
mid-range torque now the first thing I
notice<00:01:09.200> about<00:01:09.229> this<00:01:09.470> car<00:01:09.740> is<00:01:09.890> a<00:01:10.040> lot<00:01:10.250> lower

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
notice about this car is a lot lower

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.540 
notice about this car is a lot lower
than<00:01:11.290> what<00:01:12.290> would<00:01:12.440> first<00:01:12.740> assume<00:01:13.130> getting<00:01:13.460> in

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
than what would first assume getting in

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.139 
than what would first assume getting in
out<00:01:13.700> of<00:01:13.759> the<00:01:13.820> car<00:01:14.090> can<00:01:14.330> be<00:01:14.360> quite<00:01:14.690> an<00:01:14.810> issue<00:01:16.149> but

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
out of the car can be quite an issue but

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.120 
out of the car can be quite an issue but
once<00:01:17.360> you're<00:01:17.539> in<00:01:17.660> the<00:01:17.780> car<00:01:18.020> great<00:01:18.740> driving

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
position as I say it has this cockpit

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.249 
position as I say it has this cockpit
feel<00:01:21.850> everything<00:01:22.850> is<00:01:23.000> very<00:01:23.180> air<00:01:23.390> crafty<00:01:23.990> about

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.570 
there the side mirrors are good size
nothing<00:02:21.020> a<00:02:21.140> little<00:02:21.440> bit<00:02:21.590> low<00:02:21.980> there<00:02:22.400> could<00:02:22.550> be

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
nothing a little bit low there could be

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.660 
nothing a little bit low there could be
a<00:02:22.700> bit<00:02:22.880> higher<00:02:24.010> steering<00:02:25.010> on<00:02:25.160> this<00:02:25.370> is<00:02:25.640> a

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
a bit higher steering on this is a

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.090 
a bit higher steering on this is a
little<00:02:25.880> bit<00:02:26.120> dodgy<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.810> cars<00:02:27.080> done<00:02:27.530> sixty

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
little bit dodgy the cars done sixty

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.610 
little bit dodgy the cars done sixty
five<00:02:28.340> thousand<00:02:29.000> miles<00:02:29.209> and<00:02:30.170> there's<00:02:30.350> quite<00:02:30.560> a

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
five thousand miles and there's quite a

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.280 
five thousand miles and there's quite a
bit<00:02:30.740> of<00:02:31.040> lag<00:02:31.700> there<00:02:32.090> in<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:32.360> steering<00:02:32.780> wheel<00:02:32.840> I

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
bit of lag there in the steering wheel I

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.660 
bit of lag there in the steering wheel I
mean<00:02:33.830> look<00:02:33.980> at<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.130> end<00:02:34.250> of<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.370> day<00:02:34.490> that

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
mean look at the end of the day that

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.280 
mean look at the end of the day that
could<00:02:34.820> be<00:02:34.880> down<00:02:35.090> to<00:02:35.270> warm<00:02:35.510> pushes<00:02:35.959> for<00:02:36.200> the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
could be down to warm pushes for the

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.900 
could be down to warm pushes for the
sixty<00:02:36.590> five<00:02:36.740> thousand<00:02:37.280> miles<00:02:37.430> I<00:02:37.610> think<00:02:37.640> it's

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
sixty five thousand miles I think it's

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.210 
sixty five thousand miles I think it's
unlikely<00:02:38.200> so<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.350> steering<00:02:39.680> is<00:02:40.070> not

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
unlikely so the steering is not

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.460 
unlikely so the steering is not
fantastic<00:02:41.030> if<00:02:41.480> you<00:02:41.540> give<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.900> car<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.140> bit<00:02:42.170> of<00:02:42.380> a

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
fantastic if you give the car a bit of a

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.100 
fantastic if you give the car a bit of a
shake<00:02:42.880> you<00:02:43.880> do<00:02:44.060> have<00:02:44.330> a<00:02:44.360> bit<00:02:44.570> of<00:02:44.600> a<00:02:44.750> wiggle<00:02:44.930> a

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
shake you do have a bit of a wiggle a

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.810 
shake you do have a bit of a wiggle a
bit<00:02:45.440> of<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.590> roll<00:02:45.800> going<00:02:45.830> on<00:02:46.370> there<00:02:46.580> which<00:02:46.700> I

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
bit of a roll going on there which I

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.850 
bit of a roll going on there which I
don't<00:02:47.030> like<00:02:47.270> it<00:02:47.540> in<00:02:47.630> a<00:02:47.660> day<00:02:47.900> this<00:02:48.020> is<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.230> low<00:02:48.440> car

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
don't like it in a day this is a low car

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.760 
don't like it in a day this is a low car
it's<00:02:49.730> a<00:02:49.820> cabriolet<00:02:50.270> it's<00:02:51.020> going<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.290> sporty

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
it's a cabriolet it's going to sporty

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.720 
it's a cabriolet it's going to sporty
feel<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.070> it

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
feel to it

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.650 
feel to it
so<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.150> have<00:02:53.860> rolling<00:02:54.860> suspension<00:02:55.670> to<00:02:56.330> be<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:56.510> bit

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
so I have rolling suspension to be a bit

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.620 
so I have rolling suspension to be a bit
firmer<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:59.030> actual<00:02:59.360> steering<00:02:59.959> itself<00:03:01.239> well<00:03:02.239> I

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
firmer the actual steering itself well I

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.360 
firmer the actual steering itself well I
don't<00:03:03.080> know<00:03:03.170> I<00:03:03.440> think<00:03:03.890> that's<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.100> bit<00:03:04.250> of<00:03:04.310> an

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
don't know I think that's a bit of an

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.600 
don't know I think that's a bit of an
issue<00:03:04.459> for<00:03:04.640> me<00:03:04.880> personally<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.920> brakes<00:03:07.340> not

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
issue for me personally the brakes not

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.680 
issue for me personally the brakes not
bad<00:03:07.820> at<00:03:08.000> all<00:03:09.610> maybe<00:03:10.610> a<00:03:10.700> little<00:03:10.820> bit<00:03:11.030> grabby<00:03:11.390> if

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
bad at all maybe a little bit grabby if

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.680 
bad at all maybe a little bit grabby if
anything<00:03:12.940> but<00:03:13.940> being<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.209> front-wheel<00:03:14.660> drive

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
anything but being a front-wheel drive

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.290 
anything but being a front-wheel drive
it<00:03:15.350> ruins<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:16.100> driving<00:03:16.700> your<00:03:16.820> settings<00:03:17.180> of

it ruins the driving your settings of

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.350 
it ruins the driving your settings of
this<00:03:17.450> vehicle<00:03:17.989> because

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
this vehicle because

this vehicle because
doesn't<00:03:21.020> really<00:03:21.140> feel<00:03:21.320> like<00:03:21.380> a<00:03:21.470> driver's<00:03:22.010> car

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
doesn't really feel like a driver's car

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.330 
doesn't really feel like a driver's car

when it's from the interior of the car
is<00:03:25.640> a<00:03:25.700> little<00:03:25.850> bit<00:03:26.060> plasticky<00:03:26.420> and<00:03:27.520> I<00:03:28.520> know

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
is a little bit plasticky and I know

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.550 
is a little bit plasticky and I know
obviously<00:03:29.330> the<00:03:29.600> weights<00:03:29.840> going<00:03:30.080> to<00:03:30.200> be<00:03:30.290> kept

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
obviously the weights going to be kept

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.620 
obviously the weights going to be kept
down<00:03:30.740> with<00:03:31.010> a<00:03:31.040> car<00:03:31.400> but<00:03:32.240> there<00:03:32.450> are

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
down with a car but there are

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.200 
down with a car but there are
alternatives<00:03:33.560> you<00:03:34.160> know<00:03:34.310> you<00:03:34.610> have<00:03:34.760> good<00:03:35.000> and

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.210 
alternatives you know you have good and

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.290 
alternatives you know you have good and
bad<00:03:35.240> plastic<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:36.110> the<00:03:36.200> plastic<00:03:36.650> is<00:03:36.830> a<00:03:37.490> bit

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
bad plastic and the plastic is a bit

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.330 
bad plastic and the plastic is a bit
Nirali<00:03:38.720> in<00:03:38.960> place<00:03:39.230> it's<00:03:39.500> not<00:03:39.650> too<00:03:39.860> bad<00:03:40.100> on<00:03:40.250> the

Nirali in place it's not too bad on the

Nirali in place it's not too bad on the

really<00:03:43.970> need<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.210> get<00:03:44.300> away<00:03:44.420> from<00:03:44.540> this<00:03:44.780> shiny

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
really need to get away from this shiny

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.690 
really need to get away from this shiny
plastic<00:03:45.410> thing<00:03:46.959> I<00:03:48.100> think<00:03:49.100> all<00:03:49.250> in<00:03:49.400> all<00:03:49.520> the

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
plastic thing I think all in all the

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.820 
plastic thing I think all in all the
snow<00:03:49.970> bad<00:03:50.240> car<00:03:50.630> it<00:03:50.990> does<00:03:51.230> have<00:03:51.440> a<00:03:51.470> bit<00:03:51.680> of<00:03:51.770> a

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
snow bad car it does have a bit of a

snow bad car it does have a bit of a
feminine<00:03:52.310> approach<00:03:52.550> to<00:03:52.970> it<00:03:53.120> I<00:03:53.209> have<00:03:53.390> to<00:03:53.540> say

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
feminine approach to it I have to say

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.540 
feminine approach to it I have to say
but<00:03:56.209> it's<00:03:56.360> quite<00:03:56.600> quite<00:03:56.930> a<00:03:56.959> good<00:03:57.200> fun<00:03:58.190> to<00:03:58.370> drive

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
but it's quite quite a good fun to drive

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.130 
but it's quite quite a good fun to drive
but<00:03:58.880> there<00:03:59.000> are<00:03:59.150> improvements<00:03:59.480> and<00:03:59.900> need<00:04:00.050> to

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
but there are improvements and need to

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.160 
but there are improvements and need to
be<00:04:00.230> made<00:04:00.730> if<00:04:01.730> I<00:04:01.880> was<00:04:02.030> going<00:04:02.180> to<00:04:02.239> buy<00:04:02.390> this<00:04:02.450> car<00:04:02.900> I

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
be made if I was going to buy this car I

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.949 
be made if I was going to buy this car I
certainly<00:04:03.590> have<00:04:03.739> a<00:04:03.770> little<00:04:04.130> steering<00:04:04.959> maybe

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
certainly have a little steering maybe

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.110 
certainly have a little steering maybe
upgrade<00:04:06.410> the<00:04:06.560> brakes<00:04:06.700> and<00:04:07.700> I'd<00:04:07.820> look<00:04:07.970> at

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
upgrade the brakes and I'd look at

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.580 
upgrade the brakes and I'd look at
getting<00:04:08.330> getting<00:04:08.720> a<00:04:08.870> bigger<00:04:09.080> engine<00:04:09.290> I<00:04:09.560> think

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
getting getting a bigger engine I think

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.290 
getting getting a bigger engine I think
the<00:04:09.800> engine<00:04:10.070> in<00:04:10.160> this<00:04:10.280> car<00:04:10.340> still<00:04:10.850> down<00:04:11.090> to

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
the engine in this car still down to

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.210 
the engine in this car still down to
