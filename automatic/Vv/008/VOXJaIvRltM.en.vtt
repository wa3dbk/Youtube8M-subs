00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:03.450 
is the largest organ in the body

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.360 
is the largest organ in the body
and<00:00:03.960> when<00:00:04.170> it's<00:00:04.320> severely<00:00:04.650> burned

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:06.370 
and when it's severely burned

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.879 
and when it's severely burned
it<00:00:06.850> needs<00:00:07.089> to<00:00:07.240> be<00:00:07.359> replaced<00:00:07.689> too<00:00:07.899> quickly<00:00:08.109> and

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:08.889 
it needs to be replaced too quickly and

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.010 
it needs to be replaced too quickly and
massively<00:00:09.490> the<00:00:09.969> standard<00:00:10.540> techniques<00:00:10.900> that

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.020 
massively the standard techniques that

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.370 
massively the standard techniques that
we<00:00:11.110> have<00:00:11.139> now<00:00:11.530> that<00:00:12.400> takes<00:00:13.090> weeks<00:00:13.299> or<00:00:13.840> months

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:14.380 
we have now that takes weeks or months

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.960 
we have now that takes weeks or months
sometimes

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
sometimes

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.749 
sometimes
and<00:00:17.779> the<00:00:18.650> reason<00:00:18.949> why<00:00:19.039> people<00:00:19.070> die<00:00:19.550> is<00:00:19.609> because

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:19.759 
and the reason why people die is because

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:21.730 
and the reason why people die is because
of<00:00:20.210> infections<00:00:20.810> that<00:00:20.869> develop<00:00:21.289> while<00:00:21.500> we're

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
of infections that develop while we're

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.589 
of infections that develop while we're
waiting<00:00:22.009> for<00:00:22.039> the<00:00:22.189> skin<00:00:22.400> to<00:00:22.490> heal

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.210 

so<00:00:27.599> if<00:00:27.689> we<00:00:27.840> could<00:00:27.960> find<00:00:28.169> a<00:00:28.320> way<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.500> get<00:00:28.740> normal

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
so if we could find a way to get normal

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.609 
so if we could find a way to get normal
healthy<00:00:29.669> skin<00:00:29.970> as<00:00:30.630> much<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.079> it<00:00:31.199> as<00:00:31.259> we<00:00:31.320> want

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
healthy skin as much of it as we want

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.630 
healthy skin as much of it as we want
within<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.550> week

too<00:01:48.840> long<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:51.060> doctor<00:01:51.450> said<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:52.050> might<00:01:52.260> be

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
too long the doctor said that I might be

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.700 
a candidate for this procedure which is
a<00:01:56.190> spray<00:01:56.580> gun<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.260> asked<00:01:58.260> me<00:01:58.380> if<00:01:58.440> I<00:01:58.530> would<00:01:58.680> be

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
a spray gun and asked me if I would be

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.740 
a spray gun and asked me if I would be
interested

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.880 

since<00:02:02.410> L<00:02:02.650> spring<00:02:02.950> is<00:02:03.100> like<00:02:03.220> paint<00:02:03.550> spraying

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890
