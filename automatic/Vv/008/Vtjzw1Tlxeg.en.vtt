00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 Mom, stop feeding me there when this 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.690
 style 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.690
 I'm watching a video of home 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.290
 you know how to like 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.779
 and what about that again in case it 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.970
 encounter with the virus and then we are going to 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.579
 see one of their worlds that had facts 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.520
 already in survival because the others 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:30.919
 says that it is already tightened with the 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.719
 the update and then I come to 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.430
 show what is second before the 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.399
 creative 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.870
 if you will not believe me this now we have 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.750
 several tests to see if 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.300
 before creative or what while we go to 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.480
 see what of your cactus river plant 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.090
 I keep in sakura good power your tree 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.250
 of the sakura is a Japanese tree there 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.070
 from jajaja hahaha 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.860
 Japanese from Japan here we go this 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.870
 we made little trees at night because 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.570
 He put a lot of gladstone decoration look 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.370
 says it at night 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.370
 we started to rain too 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.310
 I think 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.829
 for me 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.829
 the joke is what 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.530
 it's a Chinese town so to speak 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.530
 Japanese no more than anything Japanese I think 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.710
 good is born but as you realize 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.430
 what you are using there is pure plank 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.430
 normal or what was before and 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:41.380
 Obsidian and the odd color of 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:44.230
 wool is not what I was using him in 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.760
 its constructions the truth before not 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.430
 we had many materials there was no 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.100
 planks he still knows there were no 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.830
 what more girlfriend 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.439
 this to decorate the leaves and all that 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.200
 look here is this lawyer of the 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.329
 welcome no 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.219
 there was nothing to decorate and I do not know how 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:07.460
 we did it that's why many of us 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:11.030
 pixel because that's how it looked nice 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.660
 here we have the stairs the stairs 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.660
 eternal 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:21.890
 and there was more this red mushrooms 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:24.140
 now you are looking for where you are already with 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.180
 the creative and everything is very rare to find 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.400
 that red mushrooms then then the 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.709
 nice if there is but then I do the 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.170
 seen you did not leave before and then later 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.840
 he saw a good a good a good 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.690
 mushrooms red landmarks 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.019
 good from all red I do not know that they are 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.019
 per se 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.990
 on your stairs as I tell you is 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.360
 obsidian and gloss where is it what I was 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.010
 working and you are several of your 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.090
 constructions everything could already put the 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:56.420
 buttons this the stairs and what is 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.180
 the redstone torches on top of 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.170
 the glo are if they want to try to do 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.269
 now you can not 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.470
 you just can not not leave you now 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.000
 let's do an open test now 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.819
 we are in the second update 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.700
 well we are already this creative nothing for 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.540
 show the map but we would like 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.540
 install him sixth 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.230
 because many are not going to believe we are going 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:26.020
 to say anything since everything is 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.450
 sure there was if there is a saying something 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.710
 in this looking for the torch there is the 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.480
 Torch 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.940
 there is the torch if you want to do 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.110
 that can no longer simply no longer 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.040
 can we are going to make a sample 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:41.020
 we hold the torch what we see here 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.610
 we try to put can not be done 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.400
 when we broke the left side it 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.050
 automatically removed the right there 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.320
 I'm trying to put it but I do not know 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.320
 can 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.290
 there's the little button if the invoice is 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.920
 once what is happening, I have such 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.310
 they vote 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.319
 because now we are targeting 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.780
 what is this the creative to see the 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:08.770
 world to itself is what is already happening 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:12.110
 what is all all minecraft before if 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.300
 could put the whole balloon exterminator 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.700
 it's a good sign that this map 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.510
 louis in creative the truth simply 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.370
 with the same obsidian kid this he 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.150
 he told me that he got obsidian and 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.699
 The gloss finished the cricket 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.520
 yes because I do not stain getting everything 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:33.610
 this would be impossible we have what is 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.099
 the infernal train 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.189
 a very nice train, but it has a side 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:42.610
 here a little plank here is what 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:46.800
 he had told them the stairs this 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.800
 done if you break one they destroy all 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.630
 they saw each other I did not do anything 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:03.699
 it's a good good sign that what 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:03.699
 did in survival and then to see 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:12.010
 how the infernal train looks from outside 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.010
 today 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.430
 in that water decoration set 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:22.820
 now so in some of the wagons 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.820
 the infernal glass train is very cool 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:30.080
 I do not know I do not know where he told me he told me 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:32.900
 but if you relied on something you have now yes 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.300
 that clock towers houses each car 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:39.800
 it's something different by a significant 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:44.780
 with an architecture with a house one 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:47.450
 church and things like that the truth yes yes you 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:51.850
 you fall from the same as you see at night, 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.850
 I recorded during the day because then no no 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.330
 very very nice the truth very very pretty 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:05.409
 and well you know my band will be Luis 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:11.289

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:14.409
 significant and now yes that of yucatan

 and from cancún quintana roo 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:21.260
 and because I told them so look for search 

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:25.600
 look for what it means 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.600
 it's not bad at all it's not bad 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.669
 here is everything everything everything we have 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:34.960
 and this infernal train the part of 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:37.479
 opposite what came out of the inter 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.270
