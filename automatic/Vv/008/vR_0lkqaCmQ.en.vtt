00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
like this room I practically got to

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:45.040 
like this room I practically got to
myself<00:00:38.620> just<00:00:39.620> paint<00:00:40.550> these<00:00:40.879> pictures<00:00:44.050> and

myself just paint these pictures and
basically<00:00:46.010> I<00:00:46.070> was<00:00:46.940> at<00:00:47.089> college<00:00:47.750> finding<00:00:48.350> Kaali

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
basically I was at college finding Kaali

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.420 
basically I was at college finding Kaali
before<00:00:48.860> and<00:00:49.850> I<00:00:49.970> done<00:00:50.710> those<00:00:51.710> difference<00:00:52.159> I<00:00:52.250> did

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
before and I done those difference I did

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.460 
before and I done those difference I did
textile<00:00:53.180> 3d<00:00:53.540> and<00:00:53.659> graphics<00:00:53.989> and<00:00:54.199> I<00:00:54.229> wasn't

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
textile 3d and graphics and I wasn't

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.719 
textile 3d and graphics and I wasn't
really<00:00:54.589> sure<00:00:54.769> what<00:00:54.799> I<00:00:54.979> wanted<00:00:55.220> to<00:00:55.339> specialize

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:55.729 
really sure what I wanted to specialize

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:57.850 
really sure what I wanted to specialize
in<00:00:55.879> so<00:00:56.479> this<00:00:56.720> course<00:00:57.170> gives<00:00:57.409> you<00:00:57.470> a<00:00:57.500> perfect

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
in so this course gives you a perfect

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.890 
in so this course gives you a perfect
opportunity<00:00:58.519> to<00:00:58.549> kind<00:00:58.790> of<00:00:58.850> put<00:00:59.659> them<00:00:59.780> all

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
opportunity to kind of put them all

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.719 
opportunity to kind of put them all
together<00:01:00.019> explore<00:01:00.830> different<00:01:01.129> stages<00:01:01.699> and

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:01.729 
together explore different stages and

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.700 
together explore different stages and
then<00:01:02.030> you<00:01:02.479> can<00:01:02.629> specialize<00:01:03.049> what<00:01:03.409> you<00:01:03.470> feels

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
then you can specialize what you feels

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.429 
then you can specialize what you feels
best<00:01:03.890> for<00:01:04.010> you<00:01:04.159> it<00:01:04.970> helped<00:01:05.150> me<00:01:05.269> because<00:01:05.540> I<00:01:05.630> had

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
best for you it helped me because I had

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.289 
best for you it helped me because I had
no<00:01:06.560> idea<00:01:06.650> wanted<00:01:07.100> to<00:01:07.159> do<00:01:07.310> I<00:01:07.549> actually<00:01:08.000> thought

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
no idea wanted to do I actually thought

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:09.940 
no idea wanted to do I actually thought
I<00:01:08.540> was<00:01:08.570> going<00:01:08.780> to<00:01:08.840> go<00:01:08.930> more<00:01:09.200> textiles<00:01:09.770> based

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
I was going to go more textiles based

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.620 
I was going to go more textiles based
and<00:01:10.280> it<00:01:10.340> really<00:01:10.549> did<00:01:10.759> surprise<00:01:11.030> me<00:01:11.060> when<00:01:11.390> I<00:01:11.509> had

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
and it really did surprise me when I had

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.630 
and it really did surprise me when I had
to<00:01:11.720> go<00:01:11.840> 3d<00:01:12.170> because<00:01:12.619> I<00:01:12.770> had<00:01:12.890> Judy<00:01:13.250> last<00:01:13.460> year

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
to go 3d because I had Judy last year

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.480 
to go 3d because I had Judy last year
but<00:01:13.850> it<00:01:13.970> wasn't<00:01:14.320> certain<00:01:15.320> but<00:01:16.070> like<00:01:16.369> they

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
but it wasn't certain but like they

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.620 
but it wasn't certain but like they
allowed<00:01:16.670> me<00:01:16.850> here<00:01:17.030> to<00:01:17.180> experience<00:01:17.570> a

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
allowed me here to experience a

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.179 
allowed me here to experience a
different<00:01:17.780> aspect<00:01:18.229> of<00:01:18.470> 3d<00:01:18.799> was<00:01:18.979> really

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
different aspect of 3d was really

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:19.510 
different aspect of 3d was really
helpful

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
helpful

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.310 
helpful
so<00:01:20.240> more<00:01:20.420> ceramics<00:01:20.869> I<00:01:20.990> never<00:01:21.140> really

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
so more ceramics I never really

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.690 
so more ceramics I never really
experienced<00:01:21.650> that<00:01:21.710> before<00:01:21.830> everyone<00:01:22.579> and

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
experienced that before everyone and

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.989 
experienced that before everyone and
even<00:01:22.759> has<00:01:22.969> a<00:01:22.999> bit<00:01:23.149> longer<00:01:23.329> than<00:01:23.570> I<00:01:23.659> really<00:01:24.999> but

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:25.999 
even has a bit longer than I really but

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:27.580 
even has a bit longer than I really but
I<00:01:26.090> was<00:01:26.179> really<00:01:26.329> broadened<00:01:26.749> my<00:01:26.780> sort<00:01:27.259> of<00:01:27.320> field

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
I was really broadened my sort of field

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.840 
I was really broadened my sort of field
very<00:01:29.079> well<00:01:30.079> originally<00:01:30.829> when<00:01:31.399> I<00:01:31.490> came<00:01:31.609> onto

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
very well originally when I came onto

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.999 
very well originally when I came onto
the<00:01:32.030> course<00:01:32.240> I<00:01:32.659> definitely<00:01:33.560> think<00:01:33.649> I'm<00:01:33.859> gonna

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
the course I definitely think I'm gonna

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.169 
the course I definitely think I'm gonna
be<00:01:34.159> a<00:01:34.189> graphic<00:01:34.429> designer<00:01:34.729> that's<00:01:34.880> from<00:01:35.060> my

just really helped me to clarify what I
was<00:01:48.319> going<00:01:48.469> to<00:01:48.530> do<00:01:48.679> and<00:01:49.159> as<00:01:49.280> soon<00:01:49.520> as<00:01:49.609> I<00:01:49.670> knew

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
was going to do and as soon as I knew

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:52.749 
was going to do and as soon as I knew
that<00:01:49.999> I<00:01:50.030> was<00:01:50.270> straight<00:01:50.509> and<00:01:50.659> final<00:01:51.759> even

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
that I was straight and final even

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.099 
that I was straight and final even
though<00:01:52.909> it<00:01:53.060> was<00:01:53.149> still<00:01:53.210> bit<00:01:53.450> of<00:01:53.509> a<00:01:53.569> race<00:01:53.749> it<00:01:54.020> was

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:54.109 
though it was still bit of a race it was

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:58.419 
though it was still bit of a race it was
definitely<00:01:54.289> paid<00:01:54.710> off<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.920> best<00:01:58.100> things<00:01:58.310> that
