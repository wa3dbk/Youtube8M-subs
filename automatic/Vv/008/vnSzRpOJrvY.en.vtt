00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.990
Hello this video at nexusx.ru

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.170
As probably you already know I have a Nexus

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.419
fourth with 8 gigabytes

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:13.569
sometimes while traveling

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:15.339
when I go out to the countryside

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:16.329
Far away

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.149
or somewhere else

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:20.869
I had a problem with free space at my Nexus 4.
It is really not enough

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.799
I want to download some movies on my smartphone

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:24.349
to watch them on the way

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:25.949
however, it is not

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.159
possible

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:29.379
Many smartphones support USB-OTG

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.359

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.910
on the go, but the Nexus 4 is not one of them

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:33.399

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.820
let's try to connect flash drive

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.120
and see what happens

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.130
pink slash-drive

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.440
And as you can see, nothing happens

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.810
smartphone just does not recognize
the USB-Drive

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.250
I read on the Internet. People written about

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.020
Nexus 4 can't provide provide the necessary current

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.860
on USB port

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.210
For starting USB-OTG support

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.940
To connect flash to smartphone

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.080
We need to

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.770
use this kind of cable

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.660
If we just put it in smartphone

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.270
and connect the external power supply

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.430
Nothing is happen too

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.870
For USB-OTG support

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.510
you need to install the patch via a custom recovery

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.410
patch can be downloaded from

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.900
xda-developers.com

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.650
Version of patch is depending on the OS version on your

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.670
smartphone

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.409
after loading smartphone

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.080
we don't see any changes, but

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.660
Now we can connect the cable with Flash-drive

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.580
Cable I have also now connected to the charging

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.430
and

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.140
will detect a new USB

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.030
device

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.940
Here are the top reads: "Prepare USB

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.260
drive "

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.150
and now we can through ES Explorer or

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.120
any other file manager

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.150
to reach the contents of the flash-drive

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.550
Here it is here defined as the USB-drive

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.280
0%

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.250
On a flash drive I have a lot of strange

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.010
files. Apparently I have installed some OS using this usb-drive.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.770
here is a video file

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.460
You can play it directly

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.550
with Flash

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.629

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.999
everything is working fine.

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.319
Let's try another stick

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.379
USB 3.0

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.980
and probably it will work with

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.789
USB 2.0 speed

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:20.589
but let's see how this

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:21.639
will work

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.239
32 Gb flash drive

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.779
Put in

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:32.799
"Preparing USB-Drive"

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.099
We can also see

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.349
the size of the memory

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.319
here's settings

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.779
paragraph memory

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:41.549
here is displayed as

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.199
USB-drive so you can see the drive

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:46.209
29

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.259
42

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:50.199
let's go through the ES explorer

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:54.239
And let's see what's inside

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.039
Stick USB drive is defined as 0

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:01.399
and now I have another video

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:08.399

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:12.730
That's all.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.080
it was a video on the nexusx.ru

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.950
subscribe, Like, goodbye!
