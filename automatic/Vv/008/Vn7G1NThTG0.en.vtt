00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 bentam system analysis center and 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.580
 forecasting growthist and puppy we 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.440
 discuss today 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.030
 the outcome of the Minsk meeting and prospects 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.880
 Ukrainian settlement rostislav 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.349
 good evening probably the most 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.900
 interesting question after all how to 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.340
 determine the format of this meeting here 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.220
 minsk who meets with this 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.650
 the European Union with the customs union is 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.500
 there are presidents of countries of customs 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.289
 Union or the most important thing is a meeting 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.090
 Putin and Poroshenko but basically I 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.009
 the Russian side and the Ukrainian side 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.110
 side in their way reports yet 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.750
 the upcoming meeting defined it as 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.340
 meeting of the customs union and Poroshenko in 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.300
 presence of a representative of the European 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.899
 union 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.780
 Moreover, if in Russia they hinted that 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.489
 European Union for the presence of York 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.500
 I was looking for sauce insisted Poroshenko then 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.120
 Now the Ukrainian side is starting 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.920
 insist on production 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.579
 European Union insisted Russian 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.530
 federation 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.879
 I honestly I doubt that Russia 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.350
 especially insisted on being present 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.690
 European Union especially since 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.450
 representatives themselves were interested 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.070
 attend these talks what 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.890
 they need on these negotiation principle 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.270
 let's see so customs union 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.189
 submitted by the heads of state of the European Union 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.950
 submitted to the topic but who can 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.170
 Probably called a political archive 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.979
 by people who in general will be leaving soon 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.829
 their posts 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.270
 this meeting of equal partners I would call 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.070
 they don't even go martian 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.460
 political corpses on it like you 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.090
 more like no no this is not meeting 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.030
 equal partners the thing is 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.470
 share interests and the interests of the euro 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.179
 bureaucracy on what from my point of view 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.520
 Teles is still and teles and 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.409
 States coming from in this case 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.090
 painfully dealing with almost 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.039
 the main euro tags are rabbis who 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.220
 serving the last days before 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.590
 transfer your authority 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:00.060
 the next composition of the European Commission 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.280
 sweeper so I think that those who 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.209
 today is in the negotiations 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.030
 there is only one interest and 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:11.989
 she was formulated Poroshenko true 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.849
 more generally it save face 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.890
 because basically their own political 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.530
 perspectives they lost at that moment 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.630
 when in November, Yanukovych refused 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.790
 sign an association agreement 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.100
 Yanukovych did not understand what he was doing 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.170
 thought he was in his trade 15 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.780
 billion dollars actually 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.760
 since there was no time for 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.769
 redefining this is in fact he 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.500
 at this time destroyed the prospects 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.880
 association agreements as an agreement 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.920
 interesting for the European Union 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.350
 I destroyed a career that he destroyed 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.019
 a career of frosts we wanted a career all 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.329
 pouring and not by chance then it is these 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.680
 politicians actively participated in 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.750
 coup organizations 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.850
 who turned the neck and Yanukovych 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.400
 because they already had to him 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.560
 deep personal feeling he them out 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.290
 successful European politicians did 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.299
 some actually garbage sent 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.160
 in the trash where they are today essentially 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.980
 and there are people who are today 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.370
 represent the European Union and I think 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.560
 not by chance before this meeting to Poroshenko 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.230
 Merkel flew in to 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.250
 state him no position ashton opposition 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.959
 european union 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.549
 that is, the position of Germany which 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.650
 much determines the position of the European 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.750
 union 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.269
 But after all, Poroshenko for this Minsk meeting 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.379
 drove as previously stated with 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.260
 its peaceful plan 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:33.140
 out of 15 points it was accepted long ago 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.420
 rather not accepted made public and 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.489
 behind the screen of the plan that's developed 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.069
 the same bloodbath in the southeast 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.959
 Ukraine actually this peace plan 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.730
 for whom nothing is not worth it 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.489
 the only cargo that 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.650
 Poroshenko brought in Minsk you know if 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.590
 you eat a mound length of 5 meters then 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.049
 one hundred meters you do not run so with 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.560
 what would peaceful plans Poroshenko 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:00.200
 not voiced they will always be 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.720
 It boils down to the fact that novorosii 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.299
 Otomri DNR and LNR must capitulate 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.299
 lay down your arms and after that she will become 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:11.480
 total grace because of poroshenko 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:14.480
 is in a situation when he is like 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.400
 politics is no other way 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.349
 he can perfectly understand what he is 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.849
 never lead donbass there may 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:20.930
 perfectly understand even this 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:24.320
 I doubt but can theoretically 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.570
 understand that Kiev is losing out soon 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.130
 he will suffer in this war he may even 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.990
 understand that he will soon have to go somewhere 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.210
 run if you have time to the end of life 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.949
 work as president in exile but 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.520
 he can't do anything because 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:39.409
 domestically it relies on 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.260
 neo-nazi militants who don't want to 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:45.349
 peace or at least don't want peace 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.360
 not subject to the recognition of the DNI and lnr not 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:47.960
 milder conditions of federalization 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.570
 of Ukraine 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.789
 for them it is absolutely unacceptable and 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.349
 any president any political 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.440
 Ukrainian leader who will start 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:05:00.050
 talks of this kind of format are just 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.880
 risks being overthrown right here 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.830
 one side of the coin the other side 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.320
 medals is that the United 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.110
 states did not incite this 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.220
 conflict to poroshenko him in his 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.800
 interest put out 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.949
 because if poroshenko is possible and 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.210
 need some there more or less 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:19.430
 stable even reduced 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.020
 geographically ukraine united states 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.360
 perfectly aware that they are 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.740
 control Ukraine will not be one by one 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.169
 simple reason you need to invest in it 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.729
 huge amount of money throughout 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.750
 but at least 10 years 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:31.640
 and whether 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.230
 it can be starting from 100 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.130
 billion dollars a year and beyond 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.890
 increasing 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.330
 and therefore the EU and Russia will invest 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.700
 money to Ukraine is more someone 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.290
 less united states no wear 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.100
 cruel joke is that Poroshenko 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.630
 ready to fight to the last on ukraintsa 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.180
 but here's what you talk about fate 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.890
 Poroshenko himself , this is your forecast 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.240
 looks rather gloomy but for him 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.340
 at least that is, you assume that 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.670
 Poroshenko figure is temporary and his 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.620
 political career will stretch no more 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.060
 than a few months or even 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.980
 I would not go to Ukraine now 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.870
 civil war which aggravates 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.790
 Poroshenko's position I am in this very 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.910
 Akela was skeptical of political 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.830
 prospects because in Ukraine 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:17.000
 hot phase in february fourteenth 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:18.650
 years passed the Nazi revolution any 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.320
 revolution she must reach to 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.690
 logical completion ie we must 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.790
 realize their task so here 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.500
 Poroshenko as the leader of Ukraine is not 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.690
 fits the Nazi task 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.040
 revolution he is too oligarchs chen and not 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.560
 quite radical 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.419
 so even in the case of absolute 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.550
 Poroshenko's stability would be threatened 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:39.350
 next coup d'etat no 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.580
 besides in the conditions when civil 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.310
 war is lost 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.260
 and Poroshenko supreme commander 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:48.919
 moreover Poroshenko dissolve the genus a 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.300
 it means all powers are concentrated in 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:51.979
 his hands are full with authority 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.410
 concentrated and responsibility 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:56.000
 just does not come under fire 

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.410
 fire criticism radicals under fire 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.419
 critics of radicals not only to her 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.770
 quite radical well and like half 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.360
 traitor to the loser of the war 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.770
 so I think he has no chance for long 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.249
 hold out and who will come to him on 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.769
 shift all the same 

00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:10.079
 some radical leader even more 

00:07:07.769 --> 00:07:11.879
 nationalistic even more 

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:14.339
 aggressive who wants even more 

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:16.559
 blood even more aggressive military 

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:18.449
 action here are three options either i 

00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:22.319
 before you win there fast enough and 

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:24.119
 then to replace Poroshenko in Kiev just 

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:26.459
 will be one of the leaders of the southeast 

00:07:24.119 --> 00:07:29.449
 either really come to replace him 

00:07:26.459 --> 00:07:31.319
 more radical leader who can 

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:33.899
 in some way 

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:36.749
 at least for the Dnieper or somewhere else 

00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:39.119
 further stabilize the front line and 

00:07:36.749 --> 00:07:41.759
 keep fighting southeast so what 

00:07:39.119 --> 00:07:43.349
 most likely in the end 

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:45.569
 Russia European Union website 

00:07:43.349 --> 00:07:47.909
 agree between themselves and since they 

00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:49.679
 endure too long can not have this 

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:51.779
 winter will be critical for them from the point
