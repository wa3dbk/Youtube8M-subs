00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.170
 hello friends family subscribers 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.970
 unknown and anonymous users of 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.730
 youtube how are you 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.980
 I am shadows 117 and today I bring you a 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.060
 different video is about a creepy 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.710
 Minecraft paste I hope and like it xd 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.200
 I was with a friend of mine talking about 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.420
 special or entertaining games and the 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.520
 I brought up the theme of minecraft said it was 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.530
 very entertaining and fun I do not 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.930
 I believed and he said he will play it since 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.850
 I knew I would change my mind 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.980
 the next day I was in doubt about the 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.500
 I turned on my computer and decided 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.570
 investigate about the game apparently my 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.879
 friend was right since I saw many 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.979
 videos of that game I saw it entertaining and 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.199
 more the creative way since I could do 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:01.180
 and undo in the game I decided to download 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.280
 I pirated it because I can not buy the 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.260
 original version I searched and searched 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.450
 several sites until I found one 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.840
 something slight the weird thing about that was that it was 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.180
 minecraft version 6.6 point six that was 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.520
 curious since I do not think there was that 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.440
 version I decided to download it taking advantage 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.050
 how light it was since I did not have 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.000
 space on my pc everything was fine with the 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.760
 download and installation but what 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.950
 inexplicable was just beginning at the moment 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.510
 to open the game everything was weird almost 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.150
 the whole background was in red 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.340
 It seemed the size of the mother but not 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.740
 I was ignored because I did not know the 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.990
 game I started in survival mode for 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.480
 know what I should or should not do there I started 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.360
 with all my house the achievements and everything 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.610
 others almost in the middle of the game going to the 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.830
 dimension of the medium I realized something 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.140
 in the time that the player has seen a 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.120
 curious creature was an intern but 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.830
 He had red eyes and always in 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.140
 I saw myself and when I was in the 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.300
 half there it was but a little bigger 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.370
 it seemed strange to me that he was there since 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.040
 in the videos I did not see any sick people 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.350
 he gave me at the end of the achievements of that 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.360
 dimension I went back to my house but note 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.310
 that was no longer the end brother try to 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.470
 investigate about that ndr man but not 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.450
 there was nothing when returning to the game I left my 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.850
 house at night well prepared with some 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.890
 weapons looking for that ndr man but not what 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.780
 I found I continued with the achievements and I gave myself 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.940
 mind that I could go to the dimension in 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.770
 derman take advantage of that achievement to search 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.830
 that ndr man but I only found 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.510
 normal and not one with red eyes when 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.610
 finish the achievements of that dimension 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.920
 I tried to go back to my house but I did not 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.930
 I found the portal to my dimension in the 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.940
 time you look for that portal note that 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.190
 two in derman I was watching a 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.110
 little strange to be in the center of 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.300
 that dimension I noticed there was a sell 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.070
 more different was not the one I was looking for anymore 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.410
 that was all red and eyes 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.660
 blacks had the same size as the 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.550
 the average dimension and the weirdness of that in 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.440
 there way I could talk to myself 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:58.060
 he was staring for about two 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:01.690
 minutes and he told me you and you are the one 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.380
 is looking for you have something that nobody 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:08.410
 more has your soul is pure very special 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:12.610
 I must have in my hands 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:15.070
 here there is no exit your end is insured 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.290
 that sick woman started to follow me I ran 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.190
 I ran all the end brother followed me 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.140
 non-stop 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.730
 I wanted to pause the game and remove it but the 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.909
 sick in red 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.549
 you do not leave here so easily you 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:31.720
 you do not know what I am capable of 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:34.840
 álex do not remove the game if you know what 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.000
 it suits you, decide to pay attention to it 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.099
 I panicked I tried to look for the 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.920
 portal and almost at the end of that dimension 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:44.530
 I found the portal I had it easily 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.540
 and already being in my house I locked myself up and 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.150
 I prepared with my weapons but I did not see anything 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.220
 everything was very quiet since it was 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.860
 putting at night and each time had more 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.989
 fear the darker it got the more 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.420
 difficult to see in the shadows of the 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.280
 trees after a short time 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.069
 I heard that voice a little more 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:07.209
 strong and I feel that you thought that 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:10.629
 you would easily save your weapons are 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:13.569
 useless your strategies are very 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:16.150
 limited consider what you should 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:19.120
 do so you can save yourself 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.729
 but nothing is sure I had to consider 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.860
 what I was doing to get rid of this was 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:26.139
 something came to mind not sick 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.529
 they support the water so they decide to go to 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:32.619
 sea and again I heard that voice saying 

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:35.829
 well thought álex but not always 

00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:38.100
 you will be in the sea we will see you sooner 

00:04:35.829 --> 00:04:41.040
 of what you think 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.110
 I thought I could get out of the game and 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.600
 I was able to leave and when I saw the icon of 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.580
 game on the desk was different was 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.860
 the face of that in derman I decided 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.140
 ignore it turn off the compu and I decided already 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.360
 do not play that game anymore by turning off the 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.610
 compu I heard that they knocked on the door was 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.690
 a man with a red shirt and pants 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:04.350
 red and he said hello to álex as I told you 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:07.320
 you do not know what I 'm capable of, I know what 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:10.680
 It's your house and all your movements in the 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.160
