screen<00:00:25.260> protection<00:00:25.740> so<00:00:26.609> let's<00:00:26.820> do<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.449> strength

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
screen protection so let's do a strength

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.609 
screen protection so let's do a strength
test<00:00:28.160> these<00:00:29.160> are<00:00:29.630> industrialized<00:00:30.630> strength

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
test these are industrialized strength

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.060 
test these are industrialized strength
pens<00:00:32.149> this<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.360> level<00:00:33.920> nine<00:00:36.829> there's<00:00:37.829> a

so let's kick it up to the last level
which<00:02:28.110> is<00:02:28.140> level<00:02:28.770> nine<00:02:30.500> and<00:02:31.500> that's<00:02:31.709> what<00:02:31.920> the

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
which is level nine and that's what the

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.479 
which is level nine and that's what the
level<00:02:32.370> nine<00:02:32.550> looks<00:02:32.819> like<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:34.099> if<00:02:35.099> it<00:02:35.250> can't

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
level nine looks like and if it can't

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.820 
level nine looks like and if it can't
take<00:02:35.700> an<00:02:35.880> eight<00:02:36.260> definitely<00:02:37.260> know<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.410> answer

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
take an eight definitely know the answer

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.089 
take an eight definitely know the answer
to<00:02:37.980> this<00:02:38.010> one

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.770 

okay<00:02:44.080> do<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.140> same<00:02:45.560> thing

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
okay do the same thing

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.380 
okay do the same thing
all<00:02:48.290> over<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:50.750> get<00:02:50.959> up<00:02:51.080> close<00:02:52.030> it's<00:02:53.030> pretty

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
all over and get up close it's pretty

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:00.520 
all over and get up close it's pretty
much<00:02:54.100> clean<00:02:56.050> look<00:02:57.050> on<00:02:57.200> that<00:02:57.380> side<00:02:59.140> let's<00:03:00.140> wipe

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
much clean look on that side let's wipe

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:07.570 
much clean look on that side let's wipe
it<00:03:01.390> give<00:03:02.390> it<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:02.540> nice<00:03:02.980> wipe<00:03:06.040> make<00:03:07.040> sure<00:03:07.310> that

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
it give it a nice wipe make sure that

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:14.510 
it give it a nice wipe make sure that
this<00:03:07.760> side<00:03:08.060> is<00:03:08.090> clean<00:03:08.510> as<00:03:08.690> well

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.720 

and<00:03:14.850> that's<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.450> difference
