systems<00:00:20.840> okay<00:00:21.840> what<00:00:22.140> can<00:00:22.380> we<00:00:22.470> expect<00:00:22.619> from

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
systems okay what can we expect from

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.439 
systems okay what can we expect from
Maverick<00:00:23.279> because<00:00:23.670> I've<00:00:23.789> noticed<00:00:23.970> your<00:00:24.269> bike

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
Maverick because I've noticed your bike

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.740 
Maverick because I've noticed your bike
over<00:00:24.720> there<00:00:25.130> I'm<00:00:26.130> saying<00:00:26.580> there's<00:00:27.119> discs<00:00:27.599> on

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
over there I'm saying there's discs on

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.120 
over there I'm saying there's discs on
it<00:00:27.869> exactly<00:00:28.500> what<00:00:28.619> you've<00:00:28.769> seen<00:00:28.980> is

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
it exactly what you've seen is

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.930 
it exactly what you've seen is
prototypes<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.269> road<00:00:30.449> disc<00:00:30.660> by<00:00:31.579> frame<00:00:32.579> and

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
prototypes of a road disc by frame and

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.880 
prototypes of a road disc by frame and
brakes<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.600> wheels<00:00:33.989> as<00:00:34.170> well<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.829> is

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
brakes and wheels as well so this is

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.380 
brakes and wheels as well so this is
what<00:00:35.190> we<00:00:35.520> are<00:00:35.610> working<00:00:35.790> on<00:00:36.030> at<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.360> moment

it's not the only thing we are working
on<00:00:38.610> we<00:00:38.790> are<00:00:38.820> working<00:00:39.149> on<00:00:39.300> many<00:00:39.450> other<00:00:39.690> projects

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
on we are working on many other projects

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.400 
on we are working on many other projects
around<00:00:41.120> around<00:00:42.120> carbon<00:00:42.690> stuff<00:00:43.170> or<00:00:43.320> on

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
around around carbon stuff or on

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.959 
around around carbon stuff or on
aerodynamics<00:00:43.649> around<00:00:44.399> many<00:00:44.610> many<00:00:44.789> other

aerodynamics around many many other

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.790 
aerodynamics around many many other
things<00:00:45.090> but<00:00:45.360> there<00:00:45.870> would<00:00:46.230> be<00:00:46.260> plenty<00:00:46.590> of

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
things but there would be plenty of

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.340 
things but there would be plenty of
things<00:00:46.950> coming<00:00:47.160> up<00:00:47.309> for<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.640> next<00:00:48.210> four<00:00:48.690> so

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
things coming up for this next four so

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.660 
things coming up for this next four so
mavica<00:00:49.829> definitely<00:00:50.219> moving<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
mavica definitely moving in the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.510 
mavica definitely moving in the
direction<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:51.829> coming<00:00:52.829> out<00:00:52.949> with<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.190> disc

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
direction of coming out with a disc

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.330 
direction of coming out with a disc
wheel<00:00:53.960> yes<00:00:54.960> yes<00:00:55.320> that's<00:00:55.590> where<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> market<00:00:56.309> is

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
wheel yes yes that's where the market is

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.639 
wheel yes yes that's where the market is
going<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:56.940> we<00:00:57.120> got<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.449> be<00:00:57.539> ready<00:00:57.660> for<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.050> so

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
going so we got to be ready for that so

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.590 
going so we got to be ready for that so
we<00:00:58.829> are<00:00:58.920> preparing<00:00:59.250> our<00:00:59.550> very<00:01:00.059> own<00:01:00.120> wheel

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
we are preparing our very own wheel

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.470 
we are preparing our very own wheel
technology<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:01.770> foreign<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:03.210> brake

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480

working<00:01:06.270> with<00:01:06.390> anybody<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.930> particular<00:01:07.130> SRAM

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
working with anybody in particular SRAM

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.000 
working with anybody in particular SRAM
or<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:09.180> we<00:01:09.689> are<00:01:09.780> working<00:01:09.960> with<00:01:10.470> SRAM<00:01:10.799> because

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
or we we are working with SRAM because

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.859 
or we we are working with SRAM because
we<00:01:11.070> have<00:01:11.189> good<00:01:11.460> connection<00:01:11.850> with<00:01:11.880> them<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.420> we

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
we have good connection with them so we

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.320 
we have good connection with them so we
are<00:01:13.020> making<00:01:13.260> testing<00:01:13.830> with<00:01:14.040> with<00:01:14.490> some<00:01:15.240> of

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
are making testing with with some of

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.480 
are making testing with with some of
their<00:01:15.479> brakes<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.830> far<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.130> been<00:01:17.159> it's

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
their brakes and so far it's been it's

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.719 
their brakes and so far it's been it's
been<00:01:17.520> going<00:01:18.180> very<00:01:18.420> well<00:01:19.189> and<00:01:20.189> then<00:01:20.369> we're<00:01:20.580> also

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
been going very well and then we're also

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.219 
been going very well and then we're also
in<00:01:20.880> connection<00:01:21.240> with<00:01:21.270> lots<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.750> bike

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229

evolution on a famous cosmic carbon SL
you<00:01:47.729> will<00:01:47.820> see<00:01:47.970> some<00:01:48.180> new<00:01:48.600> stuff<00:01:48.869> coming<00:01:49.110> up<00:01:49.290> in

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
you will see some new stuff coming up in

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.679 
you will see some new stuff coming up in
the<00:01:49.710> CX<00:01:50.310> are<00:01:50.549> wheels<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.060> know<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.360> one<00:01:51.540> the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
the CX are wheels you know the one the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.600 
the CX are wheels you know the one the
very<00:01:51.810> aerodynamic<00:01:52.229> wheel<00:01:52.799> tire<00:01:53.009> system<00:01:53.460> that

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
very aerodynamic wheel tire system that

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.950 
very aerodynamic wheel tire system that
we<00:01:53.700> introduced<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.299> we'll<00:01:54.479> enter<00:01:54.689> out

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
we introduced so we'll enter out

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.620 
we introduced so we'll enter out
together<00:01:55.310> we<00:01:56.310> introduced<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.909> 90<00:01:57.210> millimeter

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
together we introduced a 90 millimeter

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.450 
together we introduced a 90 millimeter
version<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.140> last<00:01:58.560> year<00:01:58.829> there<00:01:59.250> will<00:01:59.399> be

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
version of that last year there will be

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.429 
version of that last year there will be
a<00:01:59.759> 16<00:02:00.149> millimeter<00:02:00.270> weights<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.079> clean<00:02:01.259> shot

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
a 16 millimeter weights and a clean shot

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.990
