00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.480
 hello everyone with you blender and today 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.910
 I'll show you a mod that will allow you 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.889
 turn out the times continuum and let's 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.570
 just started them a small situation 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.430
 which I think was a lot of people 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.400
 who plays maykravt with see 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.109
 let us have a home well posh house I 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.449
 spent a few hours to build 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.180
 him we have a pig and a workbench and in 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.519
 principle what else do we need and we go out 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.130
 every day we get to the street here 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.020
 resources and this is boring friends I want 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.270
 set part with a white sheet with so 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.250
 say monday and to start 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.059
 all white paper we need the door 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.180
 Yes Yes 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.430
 the door is not a simple door and even two 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.440
 doors have two options and let's 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.539
 try to craft i will show you how it is 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.649
 looks and how it works so that 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.350
 bovine required 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.500
 Ender Pearl, that is, an eye from German and 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.719
 either wood or iron and what is 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.859
 stigma you ask first is that a 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.500
 if you do 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.870
 because of the tree you get an oak 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.640
 say so so and demo you 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.770
 normal doors and if you do 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.470
 the pirate izador gets more or less 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.200
 such zinder first iron to receive 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.689
 the same cool real man's door 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.439
 so we made two doors and let's 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.390
 put them one here and the other here 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.810
 but in principle they can be used as 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.939
 home decoration and generally chic but not in 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.460
 in case you like everything 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.650
 no pig and your house is not completed yet 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.390
 open and do not enter into my 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.220
 case I have everything ready i mean i 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.439
 principle held minecraft 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.240
 I have a decent life 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.600
 a pair of x diamond armor but nothing 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.240
 scary okay open the door and what we 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.600
 see some particles and let's go in 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.899
 here, you kind of opened the door and entered 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.369
 you have tselt and a large number and now 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.049
 we are in some groove in 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.210
 prostration because at the moment 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.860
 It is about loading chunks as you can see 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.810
 the prognosis to man is perfect with 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.040
 now add brightness so you can 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.140
 see something and the brightness at the maximum we 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.629
 there was some kind of burning and let's be honest 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.239
 frankly speaking i'm afraid to imagine 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.980
 where we actually oh you saw 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.040
 at the beginning the number is there five thousand with something 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.879
 kilometers oh my god grave falls on here 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.120
 this number is the number of blocks that 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:26.099
 we were transported but actually oh here 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.840
 to find out the exact number of blocks by 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.879
 which brought you this 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.220
 the number that is five thousand multiplied by 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.590
 a thousand is about five million 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.840
 blocks that is our sweet home until 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.280
 our pigs go from here 5 thousand 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.170
 blocks in an unknown direction i 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.810
 honestly I don't know well isn't it cool 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.550
 you appear a cave and here you can 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.379
 mine really mine collect 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.450
 some resources he's like that i see 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.250
 iron and here it seems to me just 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.050
 gorgeous because not always successful 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.300
 you can find a cave in which you will 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.830
 immediately diamond come of course i don't 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.030
 I guarantee that in this cave, too, immediately 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.800
 there will be diamonds but nevertheless it is cool and 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.480
 so that in order to go back to us 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.069
 will need to break this stone stone 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.480
 will need to be broken because yes not 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.940
 will blades let's just like that 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.640
 give in to come back to us 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.950
 will need to enter this door just 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.310
 take and enter it open it again 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.190
 and enter no no no no apparently the other 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.810
 parties here we entered and returned then 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.790
 the most important thing is to close the door so that 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.060
 don't sweat the partnership back of the 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.430
 same place to our cute little pig and it 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.200
 cool it's cool many will ask why 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.060
 then the second door if that's great 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.849
 works like I said this door 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.349
 which is pink like a pig she is more 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.330
 This demo is actually 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.349
 when you use it you just 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.090
 be transported somewhere 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:46.799
 now here at 6800 45 kilometers then 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.780
 there are 6 million eight hundred forty five 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.290
 thousand five hundred blocks from the place where 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.269
 you were 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.700
 and as we see, appeared also in some kind 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.379
 dad i don't even know what hope you 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.930
 do you see anything now because 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:00.080
 here from the cave actually well that's the brightness 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.600
 to the maximum but here is a cave and 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.280
 you can't get out of here 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.900
 so use that door I you 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.120
 extremely not advise 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.100
