00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:12.080
 so here we have the engine zid want 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:16.680
 show how to install homemade 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.920
 ignition because these engines already 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.410
 native ignition 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:26.400
 many don't work and many ask 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:30.929
 how to make the easiest way i 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.690
 I think this is the installation of the magnet on the crankshaft 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.510
 on the other side of the back 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:42.149
 engine here it is there it goes 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:47.300
 crankshaft and it's closed here 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:52.050
 lid unscrew the lid this 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:54.870
 do in the crankshaft grinder pass 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.969
 such as a screwdriver 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:04.680
 Well , something like this pass in one word 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:08.220
 take the magnets and shafts on the day off 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.610
 magnet do sharpen as if under 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.409
 screwdriver only wider of course so that 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.409
 she walked right into that groove and 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:32.610
 it's like done then we take plywood 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:33.300
 grind a hole well, such as in 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.500
 cap 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.980
 and fasten it in the center and still a little hole 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.100
 under the crankshaft 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:47.880
 magnet and fasten it into those holes 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.460
 which screwed the cap further 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.210
 take the magnet 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:57.300
 we put my groove substitute wean 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.040
 so as to fit here with us 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.070
 width 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.860
 if anything is possible here a sample 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.040
 here do as if in a circle a little bit 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.410
 knock out if suddenly she is very long then 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.750
 the floor 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:17.280
 a little short well 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:21.690
 fasten this plywood to plywood 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:25.890
 already turn fasten here you see 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.230
 and here we fasten the magnet and now this 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.880
 coin here it goes to the candle perfectly 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.959
 working no problem think it 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.390
 the easiest 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:41.660
 how would the solution of the question put this fire 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.910
 then the engine is still like 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.370
 despite the fact that there already have coil 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.850
 I was completely there Perry was rotting 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.709
 all 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:57.440
 and did not work so do 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.440
 use thanks for attention
