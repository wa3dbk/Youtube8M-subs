00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
start when it's done and it's very

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.440 
start when it's done and it's very
hypnotic<00:06:22.570> screen

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.450 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.340 

it's<00:06:26.810> loading<00:06:27.230> right<00:06:27.410> now<00:06:28.900> takes<00:06:29.900> about<00:06:30.020> five

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:30.350 
it's loading right now takes about five

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:42.200 
it's loading right now takes about five
minutes<00:06:30.640> six<00:06:31.640> minutes

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.590 

all<00:06:42.720> right<00:06:43.290> the<00:06:43.950> game<00:06:44.160> was<00:06:44.370> loaded<00:06:44.820> took<00:06:45.300> about

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 
all right the game was loaded took about

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.830 
all right the game was loaded took about
six<00:06:45.960> minutes<00:06:46.380> twenty<00:06:46.860> seconds<00:06:47.510> and<00:06:48.510> then<00:06:48.690> it

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 
six minutes twenty seconds and then it

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.140 
six minutes twenty seconds and then it
works

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:59.610 

here<00:06:51.570> this

00:06:59.610 --> 00:06:59.620 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.010 

so<00:07:00.130> I<00:07:00.160> guess<00:07:00.760> if<00:07:01.030> I<00:07:01.180> want<00:07:01.360> to<00:07:01.420> start<00:07:01.660> the<00:07:01.810> game

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.020 
so I guess if I want to start the game

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:26.540 
so I guess if I want to start the game
and<00:07:02.440> press<00:07:02.830> little<00:07:03.340> s

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:26.550 

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.760 

and<00:07:27.030> of<00:07:27.150> course<00:07:27.419> the<00:07:27.930> game<00:07:28.139> doesn't<00:07:28.500> have<00:07:28.530> any

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:28.770 
and of course the game doesn't have any

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.460 
and of course the game doesn't have any
sound<00:07:29.160> because<00:07:29.880> the<00:07:30.690> system<00:07:31.050> doesn't<00:07:31.259> have

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:31.470 
sound because the system doesn't have

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:47.210 
sound because the system doesn't have
sound<00:07:31.910> at<00:07:32.910> least<00:07:33.180> a<00:07:33.330> stuck<00:07:33.630> one<00:07:35.960> so<00:07:36.960> here<00:07:37.560> we<00:07:37.650> go

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:47.220 

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:51.380

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:51.390 
trying to use this keys because they're

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:55.670 
trying to use this keys because they're
