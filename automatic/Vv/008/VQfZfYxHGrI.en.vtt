 [Music] 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.150
 around 1780 luigi galvani teacher 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.650
 of anatomy at the University of Bologna 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:30.509
 is interested in the action of electricity 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.180
 on the nerves in his lab he 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.820
 experiment on various animals I 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.320
 dissected and prepare a frog 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.510
 when one of my helpers touched 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.400
 slightly with the tip of his scalpel 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.970
 the nerves believed high of this 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.010
 frog 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.940
 we saw all the muscles of its members 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.940
 to contract violently 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.250
 another of the assistants got the impression 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.500
 that these contractions occurred at the 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.360
 moment a spark springs up it's 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.190
 the machine was this a simple 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.199
 coincidence 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.699
 I was then price of an incredible desire 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:06.550
 to redo the galvani experience with his 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.110
 wife lucia and her nephew multiplies the 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.710
 experiences and draws this conclusion 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.869
 amazing an electric spark has the 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.330
 ability to remotely excite 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.430
 muscular contraction as long as a thread 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:23.410
 metallic enough one is in 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:25.509
 contact with the nerve will succeed us to 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.630
 observe the phenomenon discovered by 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.789
 galvani take a dead frog 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.410
 since some time 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.780
 an incision clears the masses 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.390
 thigh muscle 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.580
 we distinguish the artery a cord 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.560
 whitish appears to his right 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.550
 it is the crural nerve that is isolated at 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.550
 using a glass rod 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.720
 we can provoke a contraction 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.630
 muscle by pinching the nerve it's up to 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.580
 say by mechanical stimulation the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.549
 reactivity of the body of the animal is therefore 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.840
 still good at producing the 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.759
 sparks of ethics 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.680
 we use a coil romont 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.539
 much more design body 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.170
 recent that the electrostatic machine 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:14.569
 which galvani used a long thread of 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.569
 iron and put in direct contact with an era 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:28.129
 false 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.290
 the success of the experiment and imega to 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:33.370
 each is a salt occurs a live 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.370
 contraction of the thigh 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.810
 could the lightnings of a thunderstorm be there 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.510
 produce the same effect as 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.760
 sparks electrical machines for 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.019
 know galvani carry these 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.019
 frogs on the terrace of his house 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.650
 every time a lightning straightener 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.889
 muscles was undergoing at the same time 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.989
 numerous and violent contractions 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:58.700
 but during these experiments he 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.939
 see a surprising thing 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.680
 in the absence of any thunderstorm a thigh and 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:06.439
 contracts when the hook of 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.599
 copper planted in his spinal cord and 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:12.639
 put in contact with the iron railing 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.639
 on which is the member 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.180
 he then conducts a series of tests in 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.010
 his lab to try to 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.070
 reproduce the observation made on the 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.170
 terrace contractions occurs 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.120
 whenever the nerve and the muscle of 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.130
 the thigh are simply put in contact 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.310
 through two metals 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.310
 different 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.790
 no more electric machine in the 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.850
 we slip a slide of zinc under 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.040
 the muscle the end of a stem 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:50.080
 bent copper and put in contact with 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:56.650
 the Incas approach the nerve the other 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:58.060
 end of this copper rod and to 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.700
 the surprise and joy of 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.530
 experimenters a sharp contraction 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.180
 produces as soon as the copper comes to touch 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.830
 delicately the nerve it's not about 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.440
 mechanical stimulation 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.930
 indeed if the copper rod is not 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:18.330
 in contact by its other end with 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.330
 Zinc one gets no contraction 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:26.160
 in 1791 galvani writes his results 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.690
 provoked in me a great astonishment and 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.660
 began to make me suspect 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.140
 the existence of inherent electricity 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.060
 to the animal itself 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.490
 for him it is the animal that comes 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.590
 electricity that by discharging itself to 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.520
 through the metal arc causes the 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.520
 muscle movement 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.370
 but the physicist to the ashes 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.780
 fluttered from the university of pavie did 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.080
 delay in challenging the interpretation 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:57.230
 of Galvani for him it is the contact 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.880
 between the two copper and zinc metals that 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.880
 puts electricity in motion 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:08.020
 the animal only reacts to this 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.020
 electricity of metal origin 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:15.580
 metallic electricity or electricity 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.530
 animal experience and against experience 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.020
 feed the controversy that opposes 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:24.460
 supporters of volta to those of galvan 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.320
 and the unexpected result of this 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.020
 controversy that will last a dozen 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.780
 of years was the invention by alessandro 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.690
 volta of his stack a stack of 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.370
 alternating zinc copper washers and 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.150
 separated by slices of cards have 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.230
 impregnated with salt water this stack 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.180
 originally intended to eliminate 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.910
 animal electricity from the field of 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.910
 science will become a source 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.830
 of electricity of a brand new type it 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:54.180
 immediately arouses the enthusiasm of 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:57.850
 scholars and the first consul bonaparte 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:00.700
 for the French physicist arago this 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:02.470
 bizarre assembly this stack and the most 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.330
 wonderful instrument that men and 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:19.250
 never invented 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:22.379

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.379
 [Applause] 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.670
 Oh
