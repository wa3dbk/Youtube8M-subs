00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 after analyzing the consistency of 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.600
 the glaciers and the data of the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.300
 atmosphere of Mars the scientists of the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.269
 nasa concluded that the red planet 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.490
 had 4300 million years ago a 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.269
 ocean with a volume of water greater than 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.269
 the arctic 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.300
 Our study estimates the volume of 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.940
 water that had mars on its surface and 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.110
 what then evaporated into space like this 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.040
 says the scientist of the nasa 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.040
 geronimo villanueva 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.329
 the study is based on the data 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.089
 provided by three telescopes 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.800
 able to distinguish the signs of 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:48.949
 the two different types of water in the 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.100
 Mars atmosphere heavy water and water 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.839
 semi-heavy in whose molecules an atom 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.729
 of hydrogen is displaced by the 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.729
 isotope deuterium hd o 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.150
 this way after having analyzed the ratio 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.620
 of these two types the scientists 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.050
 they have calculated that they have calculated 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.000
 volumes that would have had Mars if the 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.570
 waters would not have evaporated 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.570
 space 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.580
 according to the research currently the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.409
 red planet conserves only 13 per 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.530
 hundred percent of the original water in its 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.140
 glaciers while doing 4 thousand 300 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.750
 millions of years had an ocean that 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.270
 it covered 19 percent of its territory 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.759
 and that in some places he had more 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.759
 1.6 kilometers deep 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.880
 in terms of surface exceeded the 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.880
 arctic of the earth 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:03.800
