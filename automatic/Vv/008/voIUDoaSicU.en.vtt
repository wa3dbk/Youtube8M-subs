I'm pretty sure you guys have seen this
technique<00:01:11.250> used<00:01:11.520> before<00:01:11.730> but<00:01:12.690> the<00:01:12.840> only

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
technique used before but the only

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.360 
technique used before but the only
difference<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.980> that<00:01:14.010> we're<00:01:14.340> using

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
difference is is that we're using

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.730 
difference is is that we're using
plastic<00:01:15.330> clips<00:01:15.660> compared<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
plastic clips compared to the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.640 
plastic clips compared to the
traditional<00:01:17.670> metal<00:01:17.940> clips<00:01:18.330> which<00:01:19.080> sometimes

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
traditional metal clips which sometimes

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.060 
traditional metal clips which sometimes
snag<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.850> hair<00:01:21.150> or<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.840> causes<00:01:22.050> breakage

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
snag the hair or it causes breakage

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:40.490

whenever<00:01:23.760> you're<00:01:24.060> removing<00:01:24.420> them

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.240 

and<00:01:41.070> normally<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.240> metal<00:01:42.630> clips<00:01:42.930> are<00:01:43.290> used<00:01:43.830> to

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
and normally the metal clips are used to

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.330 
and normally the metal clips are used to
roller<00:01:44.730> set<00:01:45.120> the<00:01:45.270> hair<00:01:45.540> but<00:01:46.320> since<00:01:46.680> we<00:01:47.040> are<00:01:47.130> not

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
