00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
so can't really tell and you don't need

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.550 
so can't really tell and you don't need
a<00:01:15.800> lot<00:01:16.100> because<00:01:16.520> you<00:01:17.360> can<00:01:17.540> reapply<00:01:17.840> it<00:01:18.080> at<00:01:18.350> any

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
a lot because you can reapply it at any

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.150 
a lot because you can reapply it at any
time<00:01:19.900> and<00:01:20.900> you<00:01:21.350> can<00:01:21.500> put<00:01:21.680> it<00:01:21.770> on<00:01:22.690> once<00:01:23.690> a<00:01:23.900> week
