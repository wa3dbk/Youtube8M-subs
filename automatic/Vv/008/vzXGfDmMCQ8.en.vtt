game and I've turned everything

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.350 
game and I've turned everything
absolutely<00:02:29.260> up<00:02:29.500> as<00:02:29.769> far<00:02:30.099> as<00:02:30.250> it'll<00:02:30.400> go<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:30.970> it

absolutely up as far as it'll go and it
loads<00:02:31.629> faster<00:02:32.200> because<00:02:32.379> the<00:02:32.500> multi<00:02:32.769> call

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
loads faster because the multi call

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.020 
instantly it runs about 70 frames per
second<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:37.959> it<00:02:38.829> looks<00:02:39.040> really<00:02:39.310> really<00:02:39.760> good
