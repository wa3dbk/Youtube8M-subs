00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello everyone today we are going to talk about two 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.210
 vowels the vowel 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.670
 and the vowel or that separately 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.150
 they mean nothing but as soon as 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.920
 together we become a weapon 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.320
 extremely powerful 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:23.340
 what is going on here so easy 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:26.609
 we have I do what I do and the best 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.420
 cubes of the universe is not that it is so is 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.480
 that is to say the 3 by 3 or long the best 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.700
 or between the best clubs 3 for 3 the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.879
 south side the best 4x4 I do not have any 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.090
 doubt and the side was the best 7 by 7 without 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.120
 no doubt worth with these two I do not doubt 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.000
 nothing the ball 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.700
 vale is the option chosen by many 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.699
 ok there are still many people who 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.739
 they use the waylon of course the fancy 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.350
 even the sanchis is worth while sometimes 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.990
 makes pop but hey the ball is 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.600
 treading very hard has good to see 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.560
 If it is the option chosen by many already 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.410
 you can imagine us great cuts corners 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.660
 does not pop just a turn is blocked 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.770
 very nice it is true that sometimes 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.230
 I have broken a corner that I have to 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.210
 I have to admit it to see 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.150
 I made videos of these cubes but it's that 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.250
 They are so good that they deserve a video 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.770
 special not the three together 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.940
 still do not get too close we're going to 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.620
 ask a question type test 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.530
 obviously because otherwise this is not a 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.930
 video that can be uploaded to youtube 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.500
 incredible I love the south side the side 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.930
 south 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.380
 this special edition of the osu had 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.820
 So much success that they got the background version 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.630
 black white background with different backgrounds 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.820
 stickers leds with traditional colors 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.990
 and also with these colors so a 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.110
 little bit more special not 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.180
 these colors are fine but they can 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.220
 get tired even if it does not seem like it 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.180
 you use it a lot I do not know why are the 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.180
 very soft colors not 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.300
 elway his was an excellent cube and the 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.920
 South side is better than the ways and here not 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.920
 I have no doubt it 's better than the same 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.599
 show is that in semis sometimes not 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.940
 When I did things like that , there's a 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.590
 little blog blocked and that ends 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.810
 bothering is still a cube 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.700
 excellent, but this one seems better 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.340
 it's that simple, let's see it 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.140
 very nice these colors is that they call 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.860
 a lot of attention you can not resist 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:37.180
 they are not as addictive to see we are in 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:41.380
 August and is not available yet 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.680
 mod 55 although they had already announced 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.870
 not even 66 we have 77 but good 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.850
 not even the 13 by 13 is worth continuing 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.830
 still in pre order because I think that a 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.210
 see what they were going to get out but just before 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.850
 take it out they discovered that there was like a 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.220
 small problem with some piece something 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.410
 well and then it's lagging a lot 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.240
 ok I already had it in charge and we're going to 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.100
 seeing is already taking a lot of fact 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.890
 from chicago stores and you already have it 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.470
 Well, they sent me a 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.960
 message from that page saying that what 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.880
 I felt sorry for the delay I do not know what and 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.120
 as soon as it is available they send it to you 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:20.700
 we go with express delivery the next day 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.569
 is in your house is normal not good 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.460
 like me 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.430
 it's going to be done 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.920
 with the full market very will dominate 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.600
 the world I like a little what I 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.370
 it seems to me it's been a long time 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.140
 since I made the first video 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.060
 mobile impressions 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.720
 and now I do not have any doubt 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.370
 is the best 7 for 7 of the universe best 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.780
 that the same show 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.720
 the sensor obviously is still a 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.820
 it's very good, but this one for me is 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.620
 better has the robust voucher you have to 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.950
 you have a lot of body you feel very 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.300
 sure with this bucket has a smooth twist 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.030
 extremely soft and controllable 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.860
 they do not go there for a walk the coat 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.900
 circling is flexible also worth and 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.390
 it does not pop 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.360
 hardly cause man to see when 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.040
 we already have seven by seven large cubes 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.510
 eight by eight we have to have more 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.239
 Care is good when we make turns 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.009
 extremes because although they have certain 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.350
 Cut corners if you spend it worth 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:22.630
 do something like that yes that some piece of 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.300
 here it can go off fired it's worth it 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.909
 be careful but 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.710
 all cubes have limits no 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:31.470
 normal if we are not going to see what is 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.150
 happening here but it's the best as 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.580
 had commented on the video when there was 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.009
 talked about this cube this sticker is me 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.270
 getting nervous and the most curious is 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.699
 It makes me nervous and I have not turned it 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.050
 I do not know it's like it's not possible, not me 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:46.520
 I think by doing a little bit of force already 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.569
 you turn things that happen this also 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.090
 good in general are put with 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:53.060
 pretty hurry, we're not going to see it very 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:59.430
 nice I'm impatient for the moyo 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:01.830
 13-13 I who know 15 15 the 6 the 8 the 9 more 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.280
 modifications because no pyramids 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.650
 dodecahedron is good 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.540
 and I think he has sold so much that he 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.180
 can allow to market more 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.030
 versions not because I'm sure they 're going 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.100
 good things 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.420
 very nice ah by the way you imagine a 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.270
 seven times seven I do not know if I was 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:22.030
 announced seven times seven I'm 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.730
 carles moyà but with these colors is worth 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.220
 I think they were going to put it on the market that 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.710
 it seems pretty quite done 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.510
 technology we go a little bit more because not 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.440
 I get tired of turning it 's cube the truth 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.280
 is that I always take it to all 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.720
 parts is wonderful I am delighted 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.600
 since I 'm videos it's a bit 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:44.110
 random but is that as I said before 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:47.440
 they are so good that they deserve another video 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:50.230
 together and moyúa is renovating the market 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.740
 in such an extreme way that also 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:55.810
 these three cubes start with water 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.330
 that is already there you deserve a video 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.030
 you'll tell me if you have these cubes 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.130
 obviously I recommend it is clear 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.650
 I say goodbye here as always with the 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:09.420
 best game of all a greeting and we 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.420
 we see in another video
