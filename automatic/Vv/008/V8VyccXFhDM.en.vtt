00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
is the base jump that actually was

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.900 
is the base jump that actually was

three<00:03:10.200> so<00:03:11.200> on<00:03:11.319> this<00:03:11.500> jump<00:03:11.769> I<00:03:11.889> actually<00:03:12.069> take<00:03:12.370> a

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
three so on this jump I actually take a

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.569 
three so on this jump I actually take a
pilot<00:03:12.790> chute<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.180> face<00:03:14.069> jumper<00:03:15.069> goes<00:03:15.250> off

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
pilot chute to the face jumper goes off

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.690 
pilot chute to the face jumper goes off
pitches<00:03:16.569> I<00:03:16.840> see<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.799> pilots<00:03:18.160> you<00:03:18.250> come<00:03:18.489> out
