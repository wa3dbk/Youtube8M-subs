okay we're gonna be drawing an eye here

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:10.129 
okay we're gonna be drawing an eye here
using<00:00:07.799> pen<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:08.639> ink<00:00:08.760> I'm<00:00:09.389> also<00:00:09.540> going<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:09.990> be

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.930 
using pen and ink I'm also going to be
cross<00:00:10.469> hatching<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.070> affinity<00:00:11.370> we've<00:00:11.790> got

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
cross hatching of affinity we've got

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.430 
cross hatching of affinity we've got
several<00:00:12.179> pens<00:00:12.480> laying<00:00:12.780> around<00:00:12.900> here<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.410> a

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.650 
I'm actually not gonna use either one of
those<00:00:19.859> pins<00:00:20.160> I'm<00:00:20.400> going<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.789> use<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.119> micron

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
those pins I'm going to use this micron

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.470 
those pins I'm going to use this micron
pin<00:00:21.900> right<00:00:22.080> here<00:00:22.820> you<00:00:23.820> can<00:00:23.970> pick<00:00:24.119> one<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.390> these

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
$15 and I've started by drawing my eye

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.549 
$15 and I've started by drawing my eye
with<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> 7h<00:00:31.980> pencil<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.899> now<00:00:33.899> I'm<00:00:34.110> gonna<00:00:34.320> just

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
with a 7h pencil and now I'm gonna just

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.709 
with a 7h pencil and now I'm gonna just
outline<00:00:35.100> everything<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:35.910> I've<00:00:36.059> drawn<00:00:36.360> here

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
outline everything that I've drawn here

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.260 
outline everything that I've drawn here
done<00:00:37.140> it's<00:00:37.290> very<00:00:37.559> simple<00:00:37.920> drawing<00:00:38.129> with<00:00:39.090> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
done it's very simple drawing with the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.440 
done it's very simple drawing with the
micron<00:00:39.660> pen<00:00:39.960> now<00:00:40.770> for<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.190> example<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.879> wasn't

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
micron pen now for this example I wasn't

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.660 
micron pen now for this example I wasn't
using<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.750> photo<00:00:42.960> reference<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.620> think<00:00:44.430> you'll

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
using a photo reference I think you'll

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.819 
using a photo reference I think you'll
find<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.270> better<00:00:45.539> success<00:00:45.840> if<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.410> do<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:46.800> a

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
find a better success if you do have a

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.610 
find a better success if you do have a
photo<00:00:47.219> reference<00:00:47.670> yeah<00:00:48.170> now<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.230> next<00:00:49.530> thing

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
photo reference yeah now the next thing

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.930 
photo reference yeah now the next thing
I'm<00:00:49.739> gonna<00:00:49.829> do<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.070> I'm<00:00:50.250> gonna<00:00:50.309> start<00:00:50.460> writing

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start writing

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.580 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start writing
the<00:00:51.000> pupil<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.510> eye<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:52.199> I'm<00:00:52.320> gonna<00:00:52.469> be

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
the pupil of the eye but I'm gonna be

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.439 
the pupil of the eye but I'm gonna be
very<00:00:52.739> careful<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.430> leave<00:00:53.610> an<00:00:53.789> area<00:00:54.090> for<00:00:54.270> how<00:00:54.420> I

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
very careful and leave an area for how I

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.869 
very careful and leave an area for how I
highlight<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.739> area<00:00:56.010> we're<00:00:56.160> by<00:00:56.280> Tasmania

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
highlight is the area we're by Tasmania

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.299 
highlight is the area we're by Tasmania
it's<00:00:57.270> gonna<00:00:57.360> make<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.719> eye<00:00:57.890> appear<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.100> have

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
it's gonna make the eye appear to have

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.729 
it's gonna make the eye appear to have
some<00:00:59.730> wetness<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.359> then<00:01:01.289> I'm<00:01:01.410> going<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.620> go

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
some wetness and then I'm going to go

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.700 
some wetness and then I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.070> crosshatch<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.570> people<00:01:03.960> now<00:01:04.680> I

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
ahead and crosshatch the people now I

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.060 
ahead and crosshatch the people now I
could<00:01:04.949> just<00:01:04.979> color<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.610> solid<00:01:05.880> but<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:07.380> want

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
could just color it in solid but I want

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.649 
could just color it in solid but I want
everything<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:08.640> cross-hatched<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.479> here

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
everything to be cross-hatched on here

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.260 
everything to be cross-hatched on here
even<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.260> areas<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.619> are<00:01:10.890> super<00:01:11.220> dark<00:01:11.520> now

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
even the areas that are super dark now

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.730 
even the areas that are super dark now
I'm<00:01:12.360> gonna<00:01:12.540> begin<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.900> make<00:01:13.049> lines<00:01:13.260> coming<00:01:13.590> out

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
I'm gonna begin to make lines coming out

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.990 
I'm gonna begin to make lines coming out
from<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.010> center<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.549> pupil

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
from the center of the pupil

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.510 
from the center of the pupil
it's<00:01:15.540> actually<00:01:15.990> on<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.500> iris<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.250> most

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
it's actually on the iris and most

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.770 
it's actually on the iris and most
people<00:01:17.790> have<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.180> pattern

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
people have this pattern

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.910 
people have this pattern
that's<00:01:20.780> what<00:01:20.930> I'm<00:01:21.020> gonna<00:01:21.110> start<00:01:21.200> with<00:01:21.530> it

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
that's what I'm gonna start with it

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.370 
that's what I'm gonna start with it
would<00:01:22.070> be<00:01:22.159> very<00:01:22.310> careful<00:01:22.790> to<00:01:22.880> stay<00:01:23.060> away<00:01:23.299> from

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
would be very careful to stay away from

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.980 
would be very careful to stay away from
highlight<00:01:24.380> that<00:01:25.340> area<00:01:25.479> and<00:01:26.479> I'm<00:01:26.600> gonna<00:01:26.689> repeat

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
highlight that area and I'm gonna repeat

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.109 
highlight that area and I'm gonna repeat
this<00:01:27.170> process<00:01:27.380> around<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:28.130> outside<00:01:28.670> part<00:01:29.000> of

this process around the outside part of
the<00:01:29.210> eros<00:01:29.570> now<00:01:30.259> you'll<00:01:30.409> notice<00:01:30.590> I'm<00:01:30.860> kind<00:01:30.979> of

on<00:01:50.960> creating<00:01:51.530> some<00:01:51.880> some<00:01:52.880> Gray's<00:01:53.149> different

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
on creating some some Gray's different

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.419 
on creating some some Gray's different
different<00:01:54.350> values<00:01:54.710> basically<00:01:55.250> different

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
different values basically different

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.580 
different values basically different
have<00:01:55.670> some<00:01:55.819> dark<00:01:56.060> values<00:01:56.479> dark<00:01:56.990> grays<00:01:57.229> and

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
have some dark values dark grays and

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.620 
have some dark values dark grays and
some<00:01:57.890> light<00:01:58.130> Gray's<00:01:58.399> and<00:01:58.729> some<00:01:59.119> whites<00:01:59.360> of

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
some light Gray's and some whites of

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.600 
some light Gray's and some whites of
course<00:01:59.890> so<00:02:00.890> need<00:02:01.069> to<00:02:01.159> build<00:02:01.280> these<00:02:01.429> up<00:02:01.490> here

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.160 

people<00:02:07.610> just<00:02:07.789> a<00:02:08.149> little<00:02:08.390> bit<00:02:08.509> darker<00:02:08.869> again

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
people just a little bit darker again

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.039 
people just a little bit darker again
just<00:02:09.619> by<00:02:09.769> hatching<00:02:09.979> and<00:02:10.310> cross-hatching

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 
just by hatching and cross-hatching

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:13.809 
just by hatching and cross-hatching
now<00:02:12.049> I'm<00:02:12.140> going<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.350> start<00:02:12.560> adding<00:02:12.819> some

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
now I'm going to start adding some

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.800 
now I'm going to start adding some
shading<00:02:14.239> into<00:02:15.230> value<00:02:15.680> around<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.250> outside

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
shading into value around the outside

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.380 
shading into value around the outside
portion<00:02:17.810> of<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.709> eyeball<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.790> eyeball<00:02:20.239> is

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
portion of the eyeball the eyeball is

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.310 
portion of the eyeball the eyeball is
actually<00:02:20.810> a<00:02:20.840> ball<00:02:21.110> inside<00:02:21.590> of<00:02:21.739> your<00:02:21.860> head<00:02:22.069> so

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
actually a ball inside of your head so

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.110 
actually a ball inside of your head so
when<00:02:24.320> you<00:02:24.410> have<00:02:24.650> your<00:02:24.950> eyelid<00:02:25.459> that<00:02:25.760> lays<00:02:25.940> over

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
when you have your eyelid that lays over

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.090 
when you have your eyelid that lays over
the<00:02:26.299> top<00:02:26.540> of<00:02:26.570> it<00:02:26.930> it's<00:02:27.470> gonna<00:02:27.590> create<00:02:27.829> some

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
the top of it it's gonna create some

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.470 
the top of it it's gonna create some
shadow<00:02:28.370> on<00:02:28.670> there<00:02:28.850> so<00:02:29.000> I'm<00:02:29.060> gonna<00:02:29.150> go<00:02:29.209> right

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
shadow on there so I'm gonna go right

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.729 
shadow on there so I'm gonna go right
underneath<00:02:29.720> that<00:02:29.840> I'm<00:02:30.260> just<00:02:30.410> gonna<00:02:30.500> make

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
underneath that I'm just gonna make

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.490 
underneath that I'm just gonna make
vertical<00:02:30.980> lines<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.579> begin<00:02:31.910> with<00:02:32.350> gonna<00:02:33.350> let

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
vertical lines to begin with gonna let

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.470 
vertical lines to begin with gonna let
those<00:02:33.650> vertical<00:02:34.100> lines<00:02:34.130> go<00:02:34.459> right<00:02:34.760> on<00:02:35.030> top<00:02:35.269> of

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
those vertical lines go right on top of

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.949 
those vertical lines go right on top of
my<00:02:35.870> iris<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.970> there's<00:02:38.420> gonna<00:02:38.570> be<00:02:38.720> a<00:02:38.750> little

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
my iris and there's gonna be a little

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.170 
my iris and there's gonna be a little
bit<00:02:39.079> of<00:02:39.230> shading<00:02:39.590> on<00:02:39.859> the<00:02:39.950> bottom<00:02:40.280> for<00:02:40.519> portion

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
bit of shading on the bottom for portion

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.289 
bit of shading on the bottom for portion
to<00:02:41.829> now<00:02:42.829> go<00:02:43.010> back<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.250> start<00:02:43.700> to<00:02:43.850> crosshatch

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
to now go back and start to crosshatch

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:45.880 
to now go back and start to crosshatch
that<00:02:44.570> just<00:02:44.810> a<00:02:44.959> little<00:02:45.200> bit<00:02:45.350> to<00:02:45.560> make<00:02:45.739> this

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
that just a little bit to make this

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.580 
that just a little bit to make this
shadow<00:02:46.220> just<00:02:46.609> a<00:02:46.730> little<00:02:46.940> bit<00:02:47.060> darker<00:02:47.440> just<00:02:48.440> so

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
shadow just a little bit darker just so

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.979 
shadow just a little bit darker just so
it<00:02:48.709> appears<00:02:49.010> like<00:02:49.100> my<00:02:49.820> top<00:02:50.030> eyelid<00:02:50.299> actually

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
it appears like my top eyelid actually

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.650 
it appears like my top eyelid actually
does<00:02:51.290> overlap

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.080 

it<00:02:57.660> might<00:02:57.900> make<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.610> Irish<00:02:59.610> just<00:02:59.820> a<00:02:59.880> little

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
it might make the Irish just a little

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.080 
it might make the Irish just a little
bit<00:03:00.180> darker<00:03:01.310> now<00:03:02.310> I'm<00:03:02.400> gonna<00:03:02.550> start<00:03:02.820> adding

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
bit darker now I'm gonna start adding

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.950 
bit darker now I'm gonna start adding
some<00:03:03.690> shadow<00:03:04.050> and<00:03:04.530> some<00:03:05.040> value<00:03:05.430> around<00:03:05.970> the

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
some shadow and some value around the

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.220 
some shadow and some value around the
outside<00:03:07.440> portion<00:03:07.770> of<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.160> eye<00:03:08.190> I<00:03:09.230> started

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
outside portion of the eye I started

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.260 
outside portion of the eye I started
with<00:03:10.530> just<00:03:10.860> on<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.160> upper<00:03:11.490> portion<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.090> the

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
with just on the upper portion of the

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.500 
with just on the upper portion of the
crease<00:03:12.600> that<00:03:12.900> happens<00:03:13.290> right<00:03:13.560> above<00:03:13.830> your

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
crease that happens right above your

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.930 
crease that happens right above your
eyelid<00:03:15.530> that<00:03:16.530> area<00:03:16.860> is<00:03:16.980> usually<00:03:17.430> pretty<00:03:17.610> dark

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
eyelid that area is usually pretty dark

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.320 
eyelid that area is usually pretty dark
and<00:03:18.390> your<00:03:19.290> eyelid<00:03:19.650> is<00:03:19.800> actually<00:03:20.160> just<00:03:20.330> usually

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
and your eyelid is actually just usually

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.750 
and your eyelid is actually just usually
it<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.540> little<00:03:21.690> bit<00:03:21.900> lighter<00:03:22.110> than<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:22.760> they

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
it a little bit lighter than that they

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.280 
it a little bit lighter than that they
also<00:03:24.000> might<00:03:24.300> notice<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:24.750> on<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:24.960> bottom

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
also might notice that on the bottom

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.600 
also might notice that on the bottom
portion<00:03:25.620> of<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.710> I'm<00:03:25.890> leaving<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.370> little<00:03:26.490> bit

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
portion of the I'm leaving a little bit

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.310 
portion of the I'm leaving a little bit
of<00:03:26.790> space<00:03:27.000> between<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.540> bottom<00:03:27.750> part<00:03:28.140> of<00:03:28.200> the

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
of space between the bottom part of the

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.980 
of space between the bottom part of the
eye<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:29.130> where<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.550> skin<00:03:30.240> comes<00:03:30.510> out<00:03:30.720> that's

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
eye and where the skin comes out that's

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.180 
eye and where the skin comes out that's
because<00:03:31.080> your<00:03:31.380> skin<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.800> little<00:03:32.100> bit

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
because your skin is a little bit

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.330 
because your skin is a little bit
thicker<00:03:32.490> underneath<00:03:33.180> your<00:03:33.360> eyeball<00:03:33.690> and

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
thicker underneath your eyeball and

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.890 
thicker underneath your eyeball and
you're<00:03:35.340> gonna<00:03:35.460> see<00:03:35.670> a<00:03:35.700> little<00:03:35.970> bit<00:03:36.300> of<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.600> flap

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
you're gonna see a little bit of a flap

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.830 
you're gonna see a little bit of a flap
of<00:03:36.930> skin<00:03:37.140> there<00:03:37.680> so<00:03:37.980> you<00:03:38.850> want<00:03:39.030> that<00:03:39.210> shadow

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
of skin there so you want that shadow

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.020 
of skin there so you want that shadow
and<00:03:40.320> that<00:03:40.440> value<00:03:40.830> to<00:03:41.010> happen<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.550> little<00:03:41.910> bit

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
and that value to happen a little bit

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.180 
and that value to happen a little bit
further<00:03:42.330> away<00:03:42.660> from<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.650> bottom<00:03:43.980> portion

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
further away from the bottom portion

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.510 
further away from the bottom portion
yeah<00:03:46.130> now<00:03:47.130> add<00:03:47.940> an<00:03:48.390> eyebrow<00:03:49.070> and<00:03:50.070> if<00:03:50.370> you've

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
yeah now add an eyebrow and if you've

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.420 
yeah now add an eyebrow and if you've
seen<00:03:50.760> my<00:03:50.910> video<00:03:51.210> on<00:03:51.270> how<00:03:51.390> to<00:03:51.540> draw<00:03:51.780> an<00:03:51.930> eye<00:03:52.430> with

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
seen my video on how to draw an eye with

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.670 
seen my video on how to draw an eye with
graphite<00:03:53.940> I<00:03:54.210> just<00:03:54.480> started<00:03:54.810> kind<00:03:55.260> of<00:03:55.410> drew<00:03:55.560> the

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
graphite I just started kind of drew the

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.350 
graphite I just started kind of drew the
shape<00:03:55.950> and<00:03:56.160> then<00:03:56.280> started<00:03:56.580> making<00:03:56.820> lots<00:03:57.060> but

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
shape and then started making lots but

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.830 
shape and then started making lots but
pinin<00:03:57.900> II<00:03:57.990> can't<00:03:58.380> really<00:03:58.590> do<00:03:58.830> that<00:03:59.070> so<00:03:59.340> I<00:04:00.030> guess

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
pinin II can't really do that so I guess

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.150 
pinin II can't really do that so I guess
you<00:04:00.930> could<00:04:01.020> do<00:04:01.140> it<00:04:01.230> with<00:04:01.320> a<00:04:01.350> pencil<00:04:01.650> but<00:04:02.100> I

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
you could do it with a pencil but I

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.730 
you could do it with a pencil but I
didn't<00:04:02.550> here<00:04:02.910> so<00:04:03.209> I've<00:04:03.540> just<00:04:03.570> started<00:04:04.110> in<00:04:04.470> the

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
didn't here so I've just started in the

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.850 
didn't here so I've just started in the
area<00:04:05.480> where<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:06.630> eyebrow<00:04:07.230> actually<00:04:07.620> starts

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
area where the eyebrow actually starts

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.530 
area where the eyebrow actually starts
to<00:04:07.920> grow<00:04:08.220> and<00:04:08.250> then<00:04:08.610> just<00:04:08.880> kind<00:04:09.090> of<00:04:09.180> make<00:04:09.330> lines

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
to grow and then just kind of make lines

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.720 
to grow and then just kind of make lines
M&amp;F<00:04:10.050> from<00:04:10.260> there<00:04:10.440> and<00:04:10.950> it's<00:04:11.100> really<00:04:11.280> easy<00:04:11.550> to

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
M&amp;F from there and it's really easy to

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.140 
M&amp;F from there and it's really easy to
create<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.420> illusion<00:04:12.630> of<00:04:12.930> hair<00:04:13.290> with<00:04:14.150> your

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
create the illusion of hair with your

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.170 
create the illusion of hair with your
drawing<00:04:15.810> infinity

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
drawing infinity

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.810 
drawing infinity
I'm<00:04:18.540> gonna<00:04:18.840> catch<00:04:19.109> you<00:04:19.290> inside<00:04:19.560> yeah<00:04:19.979> now<00:04:20.579> make

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
I'm gonna catch you inside yeah now make

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.340 
I'm gonna catch you inside yeah now make
this<00:04:21.030> inner<00:04:21.329> portion<00:04:21.750> of<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:21.930> a<00:04:21.959> little<00:04:22.259> bit

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
this inner portion of the a little bit

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.930 
this inner portion of the a little bit
darker<00:04:23.419> just<00:04:24.419> to<00:04:24.600> give<00:04:24.750> it<00:04:24.780> a<00:04:24.930> little<00:04:25.050> more

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
darker just to give it a little more

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.020 
darker just to give it a little more
three-dimensional<00:04:26.940> quality<00:04:27.060> a<00:04:28.910> lot<00:04:29.910> of

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
three-dimensional quality a lot of

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.680 
three-dimensional quality a lot of
people<00:04:30.300> are<00:04:30.389> really<00:04:30.690> stiff<00:04:31.050> with<00:04:31.590> the<00:04:31.800> penny<00:04:32.190> I

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
people are really stiff with the penny I

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.900 
people are really stiff with the penny I
like<00:04:33.690> to<00:04:33.900> be<00:04:34.380> a<00:04:34.410> little<00:04:34.650> bit<00:04:34.770> looser<00:04:35.190> kind<00:04:35.820> of

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
like to be a little bit looser kind of

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.790 
like to be a little bit looser kind of
crosshatch<00:04:36.360> freely<00:04:36.870> gives<00:04:37.259> me<00:04:37.470> a<00:04:37.500> little<00:04:37.650> bit

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
crosshatch freely gives me a little bit

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.180 
crosshatch freely gives me a little bit
more<00:04:38.039> freedom<00:04:38.340> to<00:04:39.440> create<00:04:40.440> the<00:04:40.680> line<00:04:40.860> settle

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
more freedom to create the line settle

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.920 
more freedom to create the line settle
one<00:04:41.370> now<00:04:42.120> I'm<00:04:42.210> going<00:04:42.360> to<00:04:42.419> start<00:04:42.630> with<00:04:42.750> the

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
one now I'm going to start with the

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.320 
one now I'm going to start with the
eyelashes<00:04:43.830> and<00:04:44.130> I'm<00:04:44.699> going<00:04:44.820> to<00:04:44.880> start<00:04:45.060> the

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
eyelashes and I'm going to start the

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.600 
eyelashes and I'm going to start the
right<00:04:45.570> side<00:04:45.870> of<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.139> eye<00:04:46.169> and<00:04:46.650> basically<00:04:47.430> just

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
right side of the eye and basically just

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.129 
right side of the eye and basically just
make<00:04:47.789> you<00:04:47.880> check<00:04:48.120> marks<00:04:48.479> to<00:04:48.600> kind<00:04:48.780> of<00:04:48.810> go<00:04:48.930> down

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
make you check marks to kind of go down

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.710 
make you check marks to kind of go down
and<00:04:49.410> up<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:50.430> closer<00:04:50.729> we<00:04:51.000> get<00:04:51.180> to<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.510> center

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
and up the closer we get to the center

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.170 
and up the closer we get to the center
portion<00:04:52.169> of<00:04:52.229> the<00:04:52.350> eye<00:04:52.380> or<00:04:53.010> vertical<00:04:53.970> they'll

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
portion of the eye or vertical they'll

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.960 
portion of the eye or vertical they'll
go<00:04:54.360> and<00:04:54.690> then<00:04:55.620> on<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:55.889> left<00:04:56.130> side<00:04:56.250> of<00:04:56.729> the<00:04:56.850> odd

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
go and then on the left side of the odd

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.340 
go and then on the left side of the odd
they're<00:04:57.389> going<00:04:57.510> to<00:04:57.570> go<00:04:57.690> in<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:57.960> opposite

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
they're going to go in the opposite

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.320 
they're going to go in the opposite
direction<00:04:58.500> actually<00:04:59.490> going<00:04:59.610> to<00:04:59.699> check<00:04:59.940> out<00:05:00.120> to

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
direction actually going to check out to

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.480 
direction actually going to check out to
the<00:05:00.449> left<00:05:00.660> you<00:05:01.560> can<00:05:01.680> see<00:05:01.860> these<00:05:02.010> on<00:05:02.190> the<00:05:02.310> right

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
the left you can see these on the right

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.210 
the left you can see these on the right
I'm<00:05:02.699> checking<00:05:02.970> out<00:05:03.180> to<00:05:03.389> the<00:05:03.510> right<00:05:03.949> and<00:05:04.949> as<00:05:05.070> we

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
I'm checking out to the right and as we

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.670 
I'm checking out to the right and as we
get<00:05:05.400> closer<00:05:05.699> to<00:05:05.880> the<00:05:06.150> center<00:05:06.479> the<00:05:07.050> more<00:05:07.350> up<00:05:07.530> and

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
get closer to the center the more up and

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.439 
get closer to the center the more up and
down<00:05:07.770> these<00:05:08.130> lines<00:05:08.400> are<00:05:08.520> gonna<00:05:08.610> go<00:05:08.820> a<00:05:09.210> lot<00:05:09.360> of

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
down these lines are gonna go a lot of

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.620 
down these lines are gonna go a lot of
times<00:05:09.660> people<00:05:09.870> make<00:05:10.310> eyelashes<00:05:11.310> actually<00:05:11.699> too

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
times people make eyelashes actually too

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.320 
times people make eyelashes actually too
small<00:05:13.400> eyelashes<00:05:14.400> are<00:05:14.520> actually<00:05:14.880> pretty<00:05:15.150> long

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
small eyelashes are actually pretty long

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.029 
small eyelashes are actually pretty long
especially<00:05:16.169> when<00:05:16.289> you're<00:05:16.410> drawing<00:05:16.560> and

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
especially when you're drawing and

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.969 
especially when you're drawing and
closed<00:05:17.460> up<00:05:17.490> like<00:05:17.820> this<00:05:18.229> now<00:05:19.229> the<00:05:19.289> eyelashes<00:05:19.860> on

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
closed up like this now the eyelashes on

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:21.050 
closed up like this now the eyelashes on
the<00:05:20.039> bottom<00:05:20.340> portion<00:05:20.520> of<00:05:20.759> the<00:05:20.849> eye<00:05:20.880> are

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
the bottom portion of the eye are

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.750 
the bottom portion of the eye are
definitely<00:05:21.780> a<00:05:21.810> lot<00:05:22.080> shorter<00:05:22.410> and<00:05:22.830> they

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
definitely a lot shorter and they

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.240 
definitely a lot shorter and they
basically<00:05:24.090> follow<00:05:24.690> the<00:05:24.810> reverse<00:05:25.110> of<00:05:25.710> the<00:05:26.130> out

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
basically follow the reverse of the out

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.520 
basically follow the reverse of the out
lashes<00:05:26.639> on<00:05:26.760> the<00:05:26.789> top<00:05:27.120> so<00:05:27.599> they're<00:05:28.349> on<00:05:28.440> the

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
lashes on the top so they're on the

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:29.870 
lashes on the top so they're on the
bottom<00:05:28.680> they'll<00:05:29.010> kind<00:05:29.250> of<00:05:29.340> go<00:05:29.430> on<00:05:29.610> the<00:05:29.729> right

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
bottom they'll kind of go on the right

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.310 
bottom they'll kind of go on the right
side<00:05:30.150> that<00:05:30.180> goes<00:05:30.419> off<00:05:30.660> into<00:05:30.900> the<00:05:31.080> right<00:05:31.289> and

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
side that goes off into the right and

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.680 
side that goes off into the right and
then<00:05:31.830> come<00:05:32.130> more<00:05:32.669> vertical<00:05:33.090> closer<00:05:33.330> to<00:05:33.570> the

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
then come more vertical closer to the

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.379 
then come more vertical closer to the
center<00:05:34.020> and<00:05:34.199> then<00:05:34.800> up<00:05:35.099> into<00:05:35.310> the<00:05:35.460> left<00:05:35.820> now<00:05:36.300> I'm

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
center and then up into the left now I'm

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:37.939 
center and then up into the left now I'm
just<00:05:36.539> gonna<00:05:36.690> darken<00:05:36.900> up<00:05:37.110> the<00:05:37.169> eyebrow<00:05:37.620> just<00:05:37.800> a

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:37.949 
just gonna darken up the eyebrow just a

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:40.610 
just gonna darken up the eyebrow just a
little<00:05:38.190> bit<00:05:38.280> base<00:05:38.639> of<00:05:38.849> contrast<00:05:39.620> basically

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
little bit base of contrast basically
