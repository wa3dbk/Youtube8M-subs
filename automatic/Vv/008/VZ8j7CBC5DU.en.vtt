00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
nexus 5 map twice which means I

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.620 
nexus 5 map twice which means I
essentially<00:00:11.280> be<00:00:11.400> 50<00:00:11.969> rounds<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.480> game

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630

essentially be 50 rounds of the game
this<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.290> around<00:00:13.469> 50<00:00:13.920> or<00:00:14.009> ceiling<00:00:14.370> here<00:00:14.610> and

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
this is around 50 or ceiling here and

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.880 
this is around 50 or ceiling here and
it's<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.120> very<00:00:15.150> very<00:00:15.750> difficult<00:00:15.929> wait<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.770> way

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.920 
it's a very very difficult wait the way
I<00:00:16.920> got<00:00:17.130> for<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.310> was<00:00:17.430> clever<00:00:18.119> killstreak<00:00:18.600> usage

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
I got for it was clever killstreak usage

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.480 
I got for it was clever killstreak usage
I<00:00:19.080> figured<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.529> just<00:00:19.710> show<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:19.859> some<00:00:20.070> gameplay

the<00:00:26.340> different<00:00:26.460> areas<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.910> exits<00:00:27.300> level

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
the different areas of exits level

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.390 
the different areas of exits level
because<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:28.050> played<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.470> lot<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.800> games<00:00:29.130> now<00:00:29.369> and

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
good treatment to have in your

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.900 
good treatment to have in your
collection<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.620> let's<00:00:44.160> get<00:00:44.309> started<00:00:44.460> them

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
collection so let's get started them

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.250 
collection so let's get started them
with<00:00:45.120> killstreaks<00:00:45.600> because<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.899> saw<00:00:46.050> me<00:00:46.140> use

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
with killstreaks because you saw me use

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.959 
with killstreaks because you saw me use
mine<00:00:46.410> at<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.530> start<00:00:46.829> there<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.520> excess<00:00:47.820> one

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
mine at the start there that excess one

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.340 
mine at the start there that excess one
Vulcan<00:00:48.360> was<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.510> lot<00:00:48.809> better<00:00:48.989> than<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.289> figured

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
Vulcan was a lot better than I figured

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.979 
Vulcan was a lot better than I figured
it'd<00:00:49.680> be<00:00:49.829> like<00:00:50.039> at<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.250> stuff<00:00:50.460> around<00:00:50.610> and

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
it'd be like at the stuff around and

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.090 
it'd be like at the stuff around and
basically<00:00:51.989> there's<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.590> few<00:00:52.829> things<00:00:52.949> you

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
basically there's a few things you

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.930 
basically there's a few things you
should<00:00:53.129> realize<00:00:53.399> like<00:00:53.550> there<00:00:53.730> are<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> few

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
should realize like there are a few

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.549 
should realize like there are a few
killstreaks<00:00:54.360> worth<00:00:54.600> keeping<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.230> they're<00:00:55.530> a

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
killstreaks worth keeping and they're a

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.229 
killstreaks worth keeping and they're a
few<00:00:55.710> kill<00:00:55.920> streak<00:00:56.100> starts<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.940> good<00:00:57.180> example

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
few kill streak starts so a good example

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.090 
few kill streak starts so a good example
one<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.109> warbird<00:00:58.500> can<00:00:58.770> get<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.980> like

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
one that is the warbird can get you like

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.549 
one that is the warbird can get you like
15<00:00:59.579> 20<00:00:59.820> kills<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.210> around<00:01:00.359> if<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.600> spray<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
15 20 kills and around if you spray the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.039 
15 20 kills and around if you spray the
missile<00:01:01.890> strike<00:01:02.190> can<00:01:02.430> kill<00:01:02.609> Goliath<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.270> also

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
missile strike can kill Goliath and also

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.929 
missile strike can kill Goliath and also
a<00:01:04.080> few<00:01:04.559> enemies<00:01:04.680> around<00:01:04.979> him<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.850> you've

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
a few enemies around him that you've

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.640 
a few enemies around him that you've
also<00:01:06.060> got<00:01:06.270> stuff<00:01:06.510> like<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.930> remote<00:01:07.170> century

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
also got stuff like the remote century

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.920 
also got stuff like the remote century
which<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.159> know<00:01:08.250> when<00:01:08.430> upgraded<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.210> really

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
which you know when upgraded can really

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.690 
which you know when upgraded can really
really<00:01:10.170> help<00:01:10.290> out<00:01:10.590> but<00:01:11.280> there<00:01:11.430> are<00:01:11.460> kill

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
really help out but there are kill

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.310 
really help out but there are kill
streaks<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.210> UAV<00:01:12.600> which<00:01:12.810> are<00:01:12.960> kind<00:01:13.170> of

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
streaks like the UAV which are kind of

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.260 
streaks like the UAV which are kind of
useful<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.130> Goliath<00:01:14.580> which<00:01:14.820> include<00:01:15.150> oh

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
useful and the Goliath which include oh

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.910 
useful and the Goliath which include oh
that<00:01:15.689> they're<00:01:15.869> useful<00:01:16.110> but<00:01:16.500> they<00:01:16.619> don't

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
that they're useful but they don't

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.499 
that they're useful but they don't
really<00:01:17.100> help<00:01:17.220> out<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.729> much<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.210> they're

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
really help out that much and they're

you which is what you really want to do
in<00:02:51.810> this<00:02:51.900> game<00:02:51.959> mode<00:02:52.319> that's<00:02:52.590> 20<00:02:53.100> 30<00:02:53.340> enemies

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
in this game mode that's 20 30 enemies

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.610 
in this game mode that's 20 30 enemies
it's<00:02:54.120> nice<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.450> take<00:02:54.569> down<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.900> like<00:02:54.989> 15<00:02:55.440> the

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
it's nice to take down to like 15 the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.289 
it's nice to take down to like 15 the
kinetic<00:02:55.920> issue<00:02:56.160> so<00:02:56.489> that's<00:02:56.760> what<00:02:56.910> I<00:02:56.940> recommend

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
kinetic issue so that's what I recommend

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.539 
kinetic issue so that's what I recommend
as<00:02:57.660> far<00:02:58.019> as<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.410> actual<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:59.099> know<00:02:59.220> primary

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
as far as the actual you know primary

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.160 
as far as the actual you know primary
weapon<00:02:59.819> goes<00:03:00.030> but<00:03:00.239> what<00:03:00.330> about<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.599> secondary

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
weapon goes but what about the secondary

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.680 
weapon goes but what about the secondary
so<00:03:01.580> honestly<00:03:02.580> like<00:03:03.000> having<00:03:03.239> a<00:03:03.299> secondary

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
so honestly like having a secondary

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.059 
so honestly like having a secondary
weapon<00:03:04.049> if<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.200> chose<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.620> primary<00:03:04.950> that

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
weapon if you chose the primary that

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.650 
weapon if you chose the primary that
doesn't<00:03:05.310> have<00:03:05.400> unlimited<00:03:05.489> ammo<00:03:05.880> like<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.299> IMR

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
doesn't have unlimited ammo like the IMR

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.660 
doesn't have unlimited ammo like the IMR
or<00:03:06.840> it's<00:03:06.989> not<00:03:07.110> unlimited<00:03:07.380> but<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:08.130> regenerates

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
or it's not unlimited but it regenerates

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.789 
or it's not unlimited but it regenerates
you<00:03:08.849> worry<00:03:09.209> about<00:03:09.269> it<00:03:09.599> I<00:03:09.750> recommend<00:03:10.590> picking

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
you worry about it I recommend picking

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.949 
you worry about it I recommend picking
you<00:03:11.190> know<00:03:11.310> secondary<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:12.299> does<00:03:12.540> have<00:03:12.810> that

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
you know secondary that does have that

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.750 
you know secondary that does have that
so<00:03:13.230> either<00:03:13.410> laser<00:03:13.769> weapon<00:03:14.160> or<00:03:14.310> something<00:03:14.670> like

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
so either laser weapon or something like

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.550 
so either laser weapon or something like
that<00:03:14.819> if<00:03:15.239> you're<00:03:15.569> okay<00:03:16.019> with<00:03:16.049> just<00:03:16.260> spending

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
different parts of the map where you

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:55.550 
different parts of the map where you
need<00:03:54.569> to<00:03:54.690> be<00:03:54.750> watching<00:03:54.959> out<00:03:55.139> for<00:03:55.290> EM<00:03:55.350> is<00:03:55.470> in

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
need to be watching out for EM is in

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.750 
need to be watching out for EM is in
front<00:03:55.739> of<00:03:55.799> you<00:03:55.920> and<00:03:56.069> sometimes<00:03:56.519> you<00:03:56.639> need<00:03:56.700> to

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
front of you and sometimes you need to

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.099 
front of you and sometimes you need to
watch<00:03:56.910> out<00:03:57.030> for<00:03:57.090> him<00:03:57.239> is<00:03:57.329> at<00:03:57.450> distance<00:03:57.840> that's

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
watch out for him is at distance that's

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.809 
watch out for him is at distance that's
that's<00:03:58.560> just<00:03:58.680> kind<00:03:58.859> of<00:03:58.920> how<00:03:58.980> it<00:03:59.130> goes<00:03:59.340> you<00:03:59.639> want

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
that's just kind of how it goes you want

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.520 
that's just kind of how it goes you want
to<00:03:59.910> do<00:04:00.000> both<00:04:00.239> really<00:04:00.750> well<00:04:00.930> ID<00:04:01.139> at<00:04:01.500> least

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
to do both really well ID at least

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.740 
to do both really well ID at least
that's<00:04:01.889> how<00:04:02.010> I<00:04:02.100> think<00:04:02.400> because<00:04:02.700> so<00:04:03.569> yeah

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
that's how I think because so yeah

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.080 
that's how I think because so yeah
there's<00:04:04.019> that<00:04:04.079> so<00:04:04.560> um<00:04:04.799> don't<00:04:05.519> that<00:04:05.790> be<00:04:05.940> my

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
there's that so um don't that be my

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.789 
there's that so um don't that be my
general<00:04:06.299> like<00:04:06.660> actual<00:04:06.959> class<00:04:07.170> up<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:07.560> excess

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
general like actual class up the excess

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.759 
general like actual class up the excess
Bible<00:04:08.250> as<00:04:08.400> far<00:04:08.639> as<00:04:08.730> what<00:04:08.970> you<00:04:09.090> should<00:04:09.269> do<00:04:09.450> in<00:04:09.600> it

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
Bible as far as what you should do in it

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.470 
Bible as far as what you should do in it
honestly<00:04:10.769> just<00:04:11.370> try<00:04:11.760> and<00:04:11.819> move<00:04:12.030> around<00:04:12.180> as

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
honestly just try and move around as

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.539 
honestly just try and move around as
much<00:04:12.600> as<00:04:12.780> you<00:04:12.870> can<00:04:12.989> so<00:04:13.290> if<00:04:13.709> you<00:04:14.040> have<00:04:14.160> a<00:04:14.190> turret

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
much as you can so if you have a turret

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.670 
much as you can so if you have a turret
sit<00:04:14.730> down<00:04:14.910> if<00:04:15.090> using<00:04:15.389> leftist<00:04:15.750> class<00:04:15.959> then

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
sit down if using leftist class then

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.199 
sit down if using leftist class then
it's<00:04:16.799> not<00:04:16.979> so<00:04:17.039> important<00:04:17.700> but<00:04:17.850> if<00:04:18.000> you're

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
it's not so important but if you're

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.719 
it's not so important but if you're
moving<00:04:18.570> around<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.930> lot<00:04:19.160> then<00:04:20.160> you<00:04:20.340> won't<00:04:20.489> get

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
moving around a lot then you won't get

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.219 
moving around a lot then you won't get
swarmed<00:04:21.030> there<00:04:21.329> won't<00:04:21.419> be<00:04:21.570> five<00:04:21.780> Emmys<00:04:22.049> and

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
swarmed there won't be five Emmys and

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.690 
swarmed there won't be five Emmys and
you<00:04:22.470> can<00:04:22.590> just<00:04:22.710> kill<00:04:22.919> enemies<00:04:23.159> as<00:04:23.340> you<00:04:23.520> walk

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
you can just kill enemies as you walk

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.060 
you can just kill enemies as you walk
past<00:04:23.940> them<00:04:24.240> and<00:04:24.390> it<00:04:25.020> takes<00:04:25.229> longer<00:04:25.620> but<00:04:25.890> it's

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
past them and it takes longer but it's

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.460 
past them and it takes longer but it's
um

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
um

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.290
