 cook a seasoned mushroom soup 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.230
 in a caldillo de chile guajillo with a 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.290
 I'm going to show you the ingredients 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.309
 I have here some mushrooms that jarre 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.699
 worth is worth more or less delgaditos and 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.390
 I have approximately that is more than 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:49.199
 half a kilo crave like 600 grams too 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.629
 I have here 4 guajillo chiles right now 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:55.530
 I will teach how to clean a chile 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.989
 wide a quart of onion I put 2 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.220
 aÃ±itos because they are very young 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.870
 cloves of garlic some bay leaves 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.320
 half chopped onion and a little 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.039
 good chicken broth let's start with 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.810
 clean let's start with chilies 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:16.850
 guajillo then what we are going to do 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:21.150
 we are going to cut you short 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:25.280
 we are going to open it 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.440
 in half we're going to take out all the 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.710
 Seed the veins and after that 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.260
 I have done all this with all the 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.800
 chiles let's move on to the stove and 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.300
 Let's put to boil in water and the 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.030
 let's leave it for steeping 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.850
 approximately 20 minutes already 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.490
 I teach the next step because I put the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.170
 chiles I'm going to turn it off and I'm going to 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.780
 Let them soak until they are 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.350
 very soft then we're going to pass them 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.090
 to grind and to strain and we will continue to strain 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.910
 he said is so soft though 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.160
 hydrated we're going to put them in the 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.530
 food processor can also 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.930
 do in lakua dora I like it a lot 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.840
 use the processor because I feel that I 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.590
 they leave them much more 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.959
 damn then 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.560
 let's put a little bit of the water 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.560
 the cooking 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:26.230
 and let's put your garlic 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.230
 and onion 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:33.910
 and we'll see if we need more water in 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.910
 he will start 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.540
 this is very thick and I need a 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.799
 little monkey then I'm going to take a little 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:48.409
 more than water I will continue reading 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.409
 and we will also pass it to brew 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.340
 this is already ready it is already well ground and 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.940
 now we are going to strain it very well 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.940
 this monkey 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:16.090
 so that when we use it in the 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.090
 soup do not leave the pieces of chili 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.860
 and now we 're going to the chair 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.310
 next step I have here all the 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.790
 chili peel and all the monito quedo 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:32.240
 down here then let's throw the 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:35.120
 cascaritas and we go to the oil and 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.210
 hot I'll start with the onion 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.710
 that you nuanced 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.710
 let's start to get 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.960
 when the field is translucent 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.020
 transparent 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:55.470
 then we will put our 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.970
 mushrooms also to fry 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.300
 now that the onion is already 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:03.000
 transparent let's start throwing the 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.520
 mushrooms 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.740
 I'm finishing adding the 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.020
 mushrooms remember that when the 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.840
 mushrooms start sewing 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.300
 they are going to let go of their ass they are going to be more 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.170
 small and all this that seems 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:23.800
 very much is going to be very little very 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:26.950
 little is not enough for food 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.200
 of two or three people well what they 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:33.400
 I said already released the juice is already 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.200
 starting to cook now what are we going to 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.310
 do I put three quarters of 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:42.390
 teaspoon of chicken bouillon powder 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:48.060
 to the nice one that we made 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:48.060
 I'm going to stir well and I'm going to throw it 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:51.839
 to the mushrooms 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:05:02.190
 and as this despite the chiles 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:04.380
 we put them to boil in water does not want 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.350
 to say that the sauce is cooked 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.260
 raw remember that garlic and onion 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:13.740
 they were ground raw then 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:17.100
 we need to give enough time to 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:20.610
 this nice here already with the mushrooms 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:24.090
 so that it cooks completely if not 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.070
 the volume will remain raw 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.580
 let's test if three quarters of 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.520
 teaspoon of chicken bouillon powder 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.750
 it was enough for him to have already 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.680
 flavor to salt then let's use 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.680
 this spoon 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:44.240
 does not lack salt 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.150
 let's throw him another little bit more 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.740
 chicken soup is easier to put 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.110
 what to take away then I prefer to go 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:55.250
 putting it on a bit and we're going to put 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:57.650
 also his laurel leaves and we 're going 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.930
 to leave to continue cooking 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:03.350
 because this sauce still tasted cross 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:07.420
 but they already spent 15 minutes cooking 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:11.750
 in the soup and if the color of the 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:14.240
 Caldillo and in return is a different red 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:18.320
 to when he was raw now what 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:22.610
 we have to do is put your broth 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:25.430
 chicken that I have it here ready the joke 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.080
 of this soup is that this is dating and 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.580
 I throw all this chicken broth at 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.450
 better I'll save it then let's 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:36.080
 go doing a spoonful let's go 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:37.430
 incorporating it and I 'll decide if I put it 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.550
 plus 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:43.310
 chicken broth, I do not think we'll throw it 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:47.020
 still another little bit more then also 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.020
 I have to go back to try salt 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:54.669
 and we already have and the soup was clear list 

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:56.319
 we're going to have to keep cooking another 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:07:00.509
 I'm waiting for the chicken broth 

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:04.840
 also know in the flavors of the 

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:06.759
 soup because we already serve the soup and what 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.069
 you have to remember about this soup is that 

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:11.289
 how is it made with guajillo chile 

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:13.120
 basically it's a chili that does not itch is 

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:16.990
 a chile that is used in stews 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.759
 Mexicans to give texture and color to 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:23.999
 the same now let's try the 

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:23.999
 Caldillo let's see how it went 

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:32.810
 It is delicious 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:35.570
 It is very tasty and the beauty of this 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.910
 soup is that it does not get fat and is very 

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:40.850
