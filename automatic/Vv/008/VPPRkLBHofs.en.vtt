setting we have to play with brushes a

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.950 
setting we have to play with brushes a
typical<00:01:26.159> brush<00:01:26.430> sound<00:01:26.790> might<00:01:27.060> be<00:01:27.090> too<00:01:27.689> light

to project over the ensemble in that
case<00:01:31.770> something<00:01:32.549> like<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.759> dreadlock<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.720> a

case something like the dreadlock is a

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.740 
case something like the dreadlock is a
good<00:01:34.140> alternative<00:01:34.700> it's<00:01:35.700> got<00:01:35.880> steel<00:01:36.180> bristles

that<00:01:36.930> are<00:01:37.049> more<00:01:37.409> stiff<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.070> therefore<00:01:38.939> it

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
that are more stiff and therefore it

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.609 
that are more stiff and therefore it
projects<00:01:39.360> better<00:01:39.570> than<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> typical<00:01:40.290> brush

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
projects better than a typical brush

projects better than a typical brush
would<00:01:42.890> sometimes<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.100> might<00:01:44.189> be<00:01:44.250> called<00:01:44.549> on<00:01:44.640> to
