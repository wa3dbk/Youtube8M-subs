the<00:00:55.410> top<00:00:56.039> 200<00:00:56.610> players<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.840> US<00:00:58.109> you

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
the top 200 players in the US you

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.619 
the top 200 players in the US you

probably noticed i was not on there
which<00:01:01.140> makes<00:01:01.379> sense<00:01:01.530> because<00:01:01.649> i'm<00:01:02.129> not<00:01:02.340> that

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
which makes sense because i'm not that

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.520 
which makes sense because i'm not that
good<00:01:02.600> actually<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.629> was<00:01:03.750> probably<00:01:03.870> like<00:01:04.019> 200

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530

200 first or something you know so it's
not<00:01:06.510> not<00:01:06.689> too<00:01:06.810> bad<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:06.990> think<00:01:09.409> so<00:01:10.409> what<00:01:10.500> he<00:01:10.560> goes

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
not not too bad I think so what he goes

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.840 
not not too bad I think so what he goes
like<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.860> play<00:01:10.979> got<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.220> do<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> lot<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.520> one<00:01:11.700> big

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
make sure any suvs are in the area will

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.740 
make sure any suvs are in the area will
get<00:02:39.030> taken<00:02:39.329> out<00:02:39.420> so<00:02:40.019> he<00:02:40.170> cannot<00:02:40.410> scout<00:02:41.750> speed

and his expansion just got scattered so
we'll<00:02:58.680> see<00:02:58.860> if<00:02:58.890> Trump<00:02:59.700> decides<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.569> do

we'll see if Trump decides to do

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.620 
we'll see if Trump decides to do
anything<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:01.139> stop<00:03:01.680> this<00:03:02.269> but<00:03:03.269> it's<00:03:03.389> early<00:03:03.569> in

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
anything to stop this but it's early in

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
the game it is fairly safe unless they

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.390 
the game it is fairly safe unless they

stamp refer to this one up top a little

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.520 
stamp refer to this one up top a little
bit<00:04:55.740> safer<00:04:56.000> coming<00:04:57.000> with<00:04:57.120> three<00:04:57.390> hellions<00:04:57.720> but

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
bit safer coming with three hellions but

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:26.590 
bit safer coming with three hellions but
there's<00:04:58.680> a<00:04:58.770> spine<00:04:59.010> crawler<00:04:59.250> down<00:04:59.490> but<00:05:20.150> 350

there you go audrid listen GG but he
leaves<00:06:25.370> the<00:06:25.520> game<00:06:25.640> that<00:06:26.270> is<00:06:26.450> his<00:06:26.630> style<00:06:27.430> so

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:36.980 
macro so once he gets his base he just

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.060 
macro so once he gets his base he just
tries<00:06:37.280> to<00:06:37.520> to<00:06:38.270> a<00:06:38.300> you<00:06:39.140> know<00:06:39.230> build<00:06:39.500> drones<00:06:39.680> like

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.070 
tries to to a you know build drones like

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.040 
tries to to a you know build drones like
crazy<00:06:40.280> you<00:06:41.270> can<00:06:41.390> see<00:06:41.510> this<00:06:41.630> is<00:06:41.780> just<00:06:41.810> to

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
crazy you can see this is just to

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.050 
crazy you can see this is just to
barracks<00:06:42.320> and<00:06:42.530> a<00:06:42.650> factory<00:06:43.100> and<00:06:43.220> army<00:06:44.000> of

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
barracks and a factory and army of

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.490 
barracks and a factory and army of
course<00:06:44.210> coming<00:06:44.420> down<00:06:44.540> and<00:06:44.870> you<00:06:45.200> spilled<00:06:45.440> a

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:45.500 
course coming down and you spilled a

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.960 
course coming down and you spilled a
couple<00:06:45.710> Marauders<00:06:46.040> he<00:06:46.190> had<00:06:46.340> his<00:06:46.430> hellions<00:06:46.730> and

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:46.970 
couple Marauders he had his hellions and

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.190 
couple Marauders he had his hellions and
that's<00:06:47.180> pretty<00:06:47.450> effective<00:06:47.870> against<00:06:48.080> zerg

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:48.200 
that's pretty effective against zerg

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.620 
that's pretty effective against zerg
because<00:06:48.560> the<00:06:49.490> zerglings<00:06:49.700> die<00:06:49.970> so<00:06:50.240> fast<00:06:50.450> the

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:50.630 
because the zerglings die so fast the

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.020 
because the zerglings die so fast the
Hellions<00:06:51.250> of<00:06:52.250> course<00:06:52.430> these<00:06:52.520> Marauders<00:06:52.790> take

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.030 
Hellions of course these Marauders take

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.430 
Hellions of course these Marauders take
out<00:06:53.150> the<00:06:53.240> spine<00:06:53.450> crawlers<00:06:53.750> no<00:06:53.960> problems<00:06:54.350> as

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.440 
out the spine crawlers no problems as

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.890
