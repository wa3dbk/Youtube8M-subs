00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
what I want you notice how I do this I'm

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.490 
what I want you notice how I do this I'm
holding<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.180> chisel<00:01:05.509> so<00:01:05.990> that<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.229> butt<00:01:06.380> is

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
holding the chisel so that the butt is

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.590 
holding the chisel so that the butt is
in<00:01:06.530> my<00:01:06.770> palm<00:01:07.009> I've<00:01:07.670> got<00:01:07.880> it<00:01:08.000> locked<00:01:08.180> into<00:01:08.509> my

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
in my palm I've got it locked into my

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.480 
in my palm I've got it locked into my
body<00:01:08.840> I'm<00:01:09.020> actually<00:01:09.170> using<00:01:09.470> my<00:01:09.650> bodyweight<00:01:10.130> to

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
body I'm actually using my bodyweight to

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.830 
body I'm actually using my bodyweight to
move<00:01:10.670> that<00:01:10.850> chisel<00:01:11.210> forward<00:01:11.509> instead<00:01:11.750> of

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
move that chisel forward instead of

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.950 
move that chisel forward instead of
using<00:01:12.020> my<00:01:12.170> arm<00:01:12.470> and<00:01:12.740> I<00:01:13.460> slide<00:01:14.030> along<00:01:14.300> the<00:01:14.360> face

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
using my arm and I slide along the face

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.650 
using my arm and I slide along the face
of<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.290> Vie<00:01:15.440> of<00:01:15.619> the<00:01:15.770> bench<00:01:15.979> and<00:01:16.450> it<00:01:17.450> just

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
of the Vie of the bench and it just

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.700 
of the Vie of the bench and it just
makes<00:01:17.810> it<00:01:17.990> very<00:01:18.220> easy<00:01:19.220> to<00:01:19.460> do<00:01:19.759> I<00:01:20.710> mentioned

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
makes it very easy to do I mentioned

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.190 
makes it very easy to do I mentioned
earlier<00:01:21.979> about<00:01:22.070> predictability<00:01:22.930> what<00:01:23.930> I<00:01:23.960> mean

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
earlier about predictability what I mean

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.430 
earlier about predictability what I mean
by<00:01:24.380> that<00:01:25.300> when<00:01:26.300> that<00:01:26.420> back<00:01:26.690> is<00:01:26.899> absolutely

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
by that when that back is absolutely

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.789 
by that when that back is absolutely
flat<00:01:27.740> I<00:01:28.040> know<00:01:28.340> exactly<00:01:29.290> when<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:30.409> chisel<00:01:30.710> is

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
flat I know exactly when the chisel is

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.380 
flat I know exactly when the chisel is
going<00:01:30.950> to<00:01:31.040> start<00:01:31.310> to<00:01:31.400> work<00:01:31.610> if<00:01:32.000> you've<00:01:32.210> ever

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
going to start to work if you've ever

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.880 
going to start to work if you've ever
used<00:01:32.479> a<00:01:32.780> chisel<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:33.229> on<00:01:33.350> end<00:01:33.560> grain<00:01:33.740> in

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
used a chisel and on end grain in

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.620 
used a chisel and on end grain in
particular<00:01:34.190> found<00:01:35.060> that<00:01:35.210> you<00:01:35.299> had<00:01:35.390> to<00:01:35.479> keep

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
particular found that you had to keep

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.060 
particular found that you had to keep
lifting<00:01:36.080> and<00:01:36.229> lifting<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:36.680> lifting<00:01:36.770> to

lifting and lifting and lifting to
finally<00:01:37.400> get<00:01:37.520> it<00:01:37.640> to<00:01:37.729> bite<00:01:37.940> back<00:01:38.900> your<00:01:39.110> chisel

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
finally get it to bite back your chisel

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.950 
finally get it to bite back your chisel
probably<00:01:39.860> isn't<00:01:40.100> flat<00:01:40.340> with<00:01:41.120> this<00:01:41.330> one<00:01:41.570> I<00:01:41.840> know

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
probably isn't flat with this one I know

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.930 
probably isn't flat with this one I know
exactly<00:01:42.530> where<00:01:42.920> that's<00:01:43.190> going<00:01:43.400> to<00:01:43.520> start<00:01:43.850> to

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
exactly where that's going to start to

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.240 
exactly where that's going to start to
pick<00:01:44.150> up<00:01:44.210> a<00:01:44.390> shaving<00:01:44.810> it<00:01:45.680> makes<00:01:45.830> it<00:01:45.979> a<00:01:46.040> lot

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
pick up a shaving it makes it a lot

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.130 
pick up a shaving it makes it a lot
easier<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.729> use<00:01:46.930> now<00:01:47.930> that's<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.470> 25<00:01:48.890> degree<00:01:49.310> I

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
easier to use now that's the 25 degree I

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.109 
easier to use now that's the 25 degree I
was<00:01:51.140> cutting<00:01:51.380> dovetails<00:01:51.860> in<00:01:52.190> some<00:01:52.549> soft<00:01:52.850> wood

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
was cutting dovetails in some soft wood

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.080 
was cutting dovetails in some soft wood
and<00:01:53.360> I<00:01:54.350> had<00:01:54.560> constant<00:01:54.920> wood<00:01:55.310> failure<00:01:55.790> between

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
and I had constant wood failure between

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.780 
and I had constant wood failure between
the<00:01:56.479> tails<00:01:56.890> didn't<00:01:57.890> no<00:01:57.950> matter<00:01:58.100> how<00:01:58.310> sharp<00:01:58.580> the

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
the tails didn't no matter how sharp the

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.940 
the tails didn't no matter how sharp the
chisel<00:01:59.119> was<00:01:59.299> the<00:01:59.960> wood<00:02:00.170> in<00:02:00.290> between<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.740> tails

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.500 
chisel was the wood in between the tails
would<00:02:01.159> break<00:02:01.400> out<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:01.760> big<00:02:02.000> chunks<00:02:02.360> would

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
would break out and big chunks would

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.600 
would break out and big chunks would
come<00:02:02.659> out<00:02:02.780> it's<00:02:03.470> extremely<00:02:03.890> frustrating<00:02:04.010> so<00:02:04.580> I

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
come out it's extremely frustrating so I

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.030 
come out it's extremely frustrating so I
started<00:02:04.909> experimenting<00:02:05.420> with<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:06.350> primary

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
started experimenting with the primary

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.190 
started experimenting with the primary
bevel<00:02:07.220> angles<00:02:07.729> and<00:02:07.970> I<00:02:08.570> would<00:02:08.720> change<00:02:09.049> the

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
bevel angles and I would change the

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.199 
bevel angles and I would change the
angle<00:02:09.500> to<00:02:09.590> be<00:02:09.679> a<00:02:09.709> little<00:02:09.979> more<00:02:10.100> acute<00:02:10.429> sharpen

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
angle to be a little more acute sharpen

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.330 
angle to be a little more acute sharpen
the<00:02:11.269> chisel<00:02:11.660> try<00:02:11.989> it<00:02:12.049> keep<00:02:12.680> doing<00:02:13.010> that<00:02:13.130> until

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
the chisel try it keep doing that until

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.830 
the chisel try it keep doing that until
I<00:02:13.400> finally<00:02:13.730> got<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.239> point<00:02:14.420> where<00:02:14.660> it

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
I finally got to the point where it

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.199 
I finally got to the point where it
would<00:02:14.989> chop<00:02:15.320> through<00:02:15.650> soft<00:02:16.489> woods<00:02:16.790> without

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
would chop through soft woods without

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.500 
would chop through soft woods without
fracturing<00:02:17.810> well<00:02:18.739> I<00:02:19.040> found<00:02:19.489> it<00:02:19.700> 17<00:02:20.180> degrees

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
fracturing well I found it 17 degrees

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.720 
fracturing well I found it 17 degrees
seemed<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:20.930> be<00:02:21.019> the<00:02:21.140> magic<00:02:21.470> number<00:02:21.549> now<00:02:22.549> this

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
seemed to be the magic number now this

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.460 
seemed to be the magic number now this
is<00:02:22.820> a<00:02:22.880> piece<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.209> basswood<00:02:23.390> so<00:02:23.900> watch<00:02:24.200> how

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
is a piece of basswood so watch how

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.330 
is a piece of basswood so watch how
clean<00:02:26.410> this<00:02:27.410> chisel<00:02:27.890> will<00:02:28.040> cut<00:02:28.810> leaves<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:29.959> nice

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
clean this chisel will cut leaves a nice

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.880 
clean this chisel will cut leaves a nice
surface<00:02:31.340> behind<00:02:31.870> it's<00:02:32.870> very<00:02:33.170> easy<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.680> push

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
surface behind it's very easy to push

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.050 
surface behind it's very easy to push
that<00:02:34.100> through<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.520> wood

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.390 

now<00:02:40.060> most<00:02:40.569> chisel<00:02:40.959> manufacturers<00:02:41.650> would<00:02:42.159> not

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
now most chisel manufacturers would not

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.190 
now most chisel manufacturers would not
recommend<00:02:42.790> that<00:02:43.150> you<00:02:43.299> grind<00:02:43.569> their<00:02:43.750> chisel<00:02:44.079> to

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
recommend that you grind their chisel to

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.440 
recommend that you grind their chisel to
17<00:02:44.620> degrees<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.280> I<00:02:45.760> think<00:02:45.969> it's<00:02:46.090> only<00:02:46.209> the

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
17 degrees and I think it's only the

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.360 
17 degrees and I think it's only the
best<00:02:46.689> ones<00:02:46.959> that<00:02:47.049> will<00:02:47.230> actually<00:02:47.590> stand<00:02:47.829> up<00:02:48.099> I

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
best ones that will actually stand up I

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.699 
best ones that will actually stand up I
actually<00:02:49.239> suggest<00:02:49.569> to<00:02:49.870> my<00:02:50.019> students<00:02:50.469> that<00:02:50.530> you

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
actually suggest to my students that you

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.709 
actually suggest to my students that you
buy<00:02:50.890> a<00:02:50.920> second<00:02:51.519> half<00:02:51.700> inch<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.180> a<00:02:52.299> second

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:52.719 
buy a second half inch and a second

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:55.649 
buy a second half inch and a second
quarter<00:02:53.590> inch<00:02:53.739> chisel<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.310> grind<00:02:55.120> those<00:02:55.359> down

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:55.659 
quarter inch chisel and grind those down

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.990 
quarter inch chisel and grind those down
to<00:02:55.959> something<00:02:56.260> similar<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:56.950> this<00:02:57.159> and<00:02:57.489> just

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
to something similar to this and just

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.149 
to something similar to this and just
save<00:02:58.269> those<00:02:58.599> for<00:02:59.290> dealing<00:02:59.590> with<00:02:59.709> those<00:02:59.859> woods

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 
save those for dealing with those woods

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:05.160 
save those for dealing with those woods
like<00:03:00.340> pine<00:03:00.959> Aspen<00:03:02.790> basswood<00:03:03.790> alder<00:03:04.780> some<00:03:05.079> of

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
like pine Aspen basswood alder some of

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.660 
like pine Aspen basswood alder some of
the<00:03:05.230> woods<00:03:05.409> that<00:03:05.560> are<00:03:05.650> tend<00:03:06.220> to<00:03:06.310> be<00:03:06.400> fragile

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
the woods that are tend to be fragile

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.550 
the woods that are tend to be fragile
but<00:03:07.659> you'll<00:03:07.810> find<00:03:08.079> that<00:03:08.200> it<00:03:08.319> works

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
but you'll find that it works

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:16.409 
but you'll find that it works
tremendously<00:03:08.859> well<00:03:14.549> little<00:03:15.549> circular<00:03:16.000> motion

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:16.419 
tremendously well little circular motion

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:19.530 
tremendously well little circular motion
now<00:03:17.200> I<00:03:17.230> do<00:03:17.409> this<00:03:17.799> until<00:03:18.250> it<00:03:18.819> leaves<00:03:19.120> a

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
now I do this until it leaves a

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.229 
now I do this until it leaves a
full-width<00:03:20.139> shadow<00:03:20.560> now<00:03:21.340> I<00:03:21.370> can<00:03:21.730> go<00:03:21.849> in<00:03:21.970> there

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
full-width shadow now I can go in there

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.929 
full-width shadow now I can go in there
I<00:03:22.450> can<00:03:22.750> use<00:03:22.780> my<00:03:23.139> hand<00:03:23.409> to<00:03:23.620> pry<00:03:23.859> against<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:24.549> I

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:24.939 
I can use my hand to pry against and I

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:27.839 
I can use my hand to pry against and I
can<00:03:25.090> pull<00:03:25.299> up<00:03:25.329> those<00:03:25.659> chips<00:03:26.079> and<00:03:26.319> not<00:03:27.040> damage

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
can pull up those chips and not damage

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.849 
can pull up those chips and not damage
