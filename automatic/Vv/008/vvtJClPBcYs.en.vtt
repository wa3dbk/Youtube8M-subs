amount<00:01:18.590> of<00:01:18.740> flash<00:01:19.189> that<00:01:19.490> comes<00:01:19.640> out<00:01:19.790> of<00:01:19.969> the

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
amount of flash that comes out of the

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.419 
amount of flash that comes out of the
flash<00:01:20.509> in<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:20.810> camera<00:01:21.200> or<00:01:21.380> top<00:01:21.829> mounted<00:01:22.159> flash

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 
flash in the camera or top mounted flash

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:24.550 
flash in the camera or top mounted flash
and<00:01:22.759> what<00:01:23.149> this<00:01:23.270> does<00:01:23.479> is<00:01:23.719> change<00:01:24.049> the<00:01:24.229> balance

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
and what this does is change the balance

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.679 
and what this does is change the balance
of<00:01:24.799> the<00:01:25.219> cameras<00:01:25.729> lighting<00:01:25.939> to<00:01:26.179> the<00:01:26.270> ambient

lighting<00:01:26.840> in<00:01:27.079> the<00:01:27.259> image<00:01:27.679> so<00:01:28.460> you<00:01:28.490> can<00:01:28.700> see<00:01:28.909> the

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
lighting in the image so you can see the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.010 
lighting in the image so you can see the
difference<00:01:29.979> when<00:01:30.979> you<00:01:31.130> adjust<00:01:31.520> it<00:01:31.729> down<00:01:31.939> or<00:01:32.270> up

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
difference when you adjust it down or up

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.739 
difference when you adjust it down or up
in<00:01:33.590> other<00:01:33.829> words<00:01:34.009> plus<00:01:34.399> adds<00:01:34.789> more<00:01:35.240> light<00:01:35.539> from

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:35.749 
in other words plus adds more light from

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:36.969 
in other words plus adds more light from
your<00:01:35.869> flash<00:01:36.139> and<00:01:36.350> this<00:01:36.439> would<00:01:36.590> be<00:01:36.649> used<00:01:36.799> a<00:01:36.859> lot

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
your flash and this would be used a lot

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
metering and the white balance so notice

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.369 
metering and the white balance so notice
it<00:03:32.239> went<00:03:32.389> right<00:03:32.569> out<00:03:32.750> of<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.930> setting<00:03:33.230> mode

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:33.379 
it went right out of the setting mode

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:34.839 
it went right out of the setting mode
I'm<00:03:33.590> going<00:03:33.709> to<00:03:33.769> go<00:03:33.859> and<00:03:34.010> press<00:03:34.069> that<00:03:34.310> again<00:03:34.370> and

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
I'm going to go and press that again and

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.009

we're on the white balance if we do the

first one is the metering and that's

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:43.509 
first one is the metering and that's
going<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:42.530> be<00:03:42.620> the<00:03:42.769> evaluative<00:03:43.370> metering

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
going to be the evaluative metering

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.240 
going to be the evaluative metering
where<00:03:44.120> you<00:03:44.239> see<00:03:44.389> all<00:03:44.419> the<00:03:44.750> segments<00:03:45.169> lit<00:03:45.319> and

where you see all the segments lit and

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.309 
where you see all the segments lit and
we<00:03:46.370> went<00:03:46.519> out<00:03:46.609> of<00:03:46.699> set<00:03:46.909> mode<00:03:47.090> they're

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
we went out of set mode they're

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.869 
we went out of set mode they're
evaluative<00:03:48.319> metering<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:48.739> then<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.579> partial

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 
evaluative metering and then the partial

evaluative metering and then the partial

that<00:03:54.409> one's<00:03:54.530> a<00:03:54.620> good<00:03:54.739> one<00:03:54.799> and<00:03:55.099> then<00:03:55.760> you<00:03:56.389> have

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
that one's a good one and then you have

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.500 
that one's a good one and then you have
spot<00:03:57.290> metering<00:03:57.739> which<00:03:58.579> only<00:03:58.879> measures<00:03:59.329> the

center three percent of the screen if

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.930 
center three percent of the screen if
you<00:04:01.069> just<00:04:01.190> want<00:04:01.370> to<00:04:01.430> be<00:04:01.519> sure<00:04:01.639> that<00:04:01.849> the

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
you just want to be sure that the

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.729 
you just want to be sure that the
person's<00:04:02.329> face<00:04:02.479> is<00:04:02.659> perfectly<00:04:03.079> exposed<00:04:03.530> and

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
person's face is perfectly exposed and

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.860 
person's face is perfectly exposed and
you<00:04:03.799> don't<00:04:03.949> care<00:04:04.159> if<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:04.879> rest<00:04:05.030> of<00:04:05.120> it<00:04:05.239> is<00:04:05.359> you

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
you don't care if the rest of it is you

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.050 
you don't care if the rest of it is you
know<00:04:05.900> not<00:04:06.169> right<00:04:06.500> you<00:04:07.040> do<00:04:07.190> spot<00:04:07.549> metering<00:04:07.879> it's

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
know not right you do spot metering it's

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.119 
know not right you do spot metering it's
very<00:04:08.269> if<00:04:08.389> it's<00:04:08.510> very<00:04:08.720> critical<00:04:09.199> and<00:04:09.349> then

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.129 
very if it's very critical and then

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:11.619 
very if it's very critical and then
there's<00:04:10.310> Center<00:04:10.669> weighted<00:04:11.030> average<00:04:11.419> which<00:04:11.599> is

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
there's Center weighted average which is

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.780 
there's Center weighted average which is
not<00:04:12.109> seeing<00:04:12.349> any<00:04:12.470> segments<00:04:12.979> lit<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.400> that

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
not seeing any segments lit and that

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.159 
not seeing any segments lit and that
means<00:04:13.970> it<00:04:14.090> takes<00:04:14.329> the<00:04:14.540> center<00:04:14.810> part<00:04:14.989> of<00:04:15.079> the

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.169 
means it takes the center part of the

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.349 
means it takes the center part of the
screen<00:04:15.440> and<00:04:15.620> makes<00:04:15.889> a<00:04:16.039> judgment<00:04:16.250> on<00:04:16.489> how<00:04:17.299> to

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
screen and makes a judgment on how to

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:18.699 
screen and makes a judgment on how to
expose<00:04:17.750> the<00:04:17.930> image<00:04:18.139> but<00:04:18.289> it<00:04:18.380> will<00:04:18.440> also

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
expose the image but it will also

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.219 
expose the image but it will also
consider<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.970> area<00:04:20.180> around<00:04:20.630> it<00:04:20.840> the<00:04:20.959> entire

consider the area around it the entire

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800

that full evaluative which which means

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.340 
that full evaluative which which means

going ahead and getting that exposure

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.930 
going ahead and getting that exposure
right<00:04:35.040> and<00:04:36.770> then<00:04:37.770> we<00:04:38.130> have<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:38.490> white<00:04:38.610> balance
