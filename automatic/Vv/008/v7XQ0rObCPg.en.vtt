00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.059 
person they're really cool but you know
yeah<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:18.090> course<00:02:18.450> boy<00:02:19.049> would<00:02:19.319> box<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.950> hell

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.530 
yeah of course boy would box the hell
out<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.250> me<00:02:20.459> if<00:02:20.670> we<00:02:20.819> were<00:02:20.910> in<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.090> boxing<00:02:21.480> match

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
out of me if we were in a boxing match

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.710 
out of me if we were in a boxing match
but<00:02:22.049> I<00:02:22.290> think<00:02:22.799> that<00:02:22.980> boxing<00:02:23.579> is<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:24.180> limited

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
but I think that boxing is a limited

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.690 
but I think that boxing is a limited
form<00:02:24.989> of<00:02:25.079> fighting<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.769> we're<00:02:26.310> in<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.519> much

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
form of fighting and we're in a much

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.789 
form of fighting and we're in a much
less<00:02:26.970> limited<00:02:27.269> form<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:27.780> fighting<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:28.530> I

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
less limited form of fighting and so I

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.620 
less limited form of fighting and so I
have<00:02:29.280> trained<00:02:29.730> my<00:02:29.849> whole<00:02:30.030> life<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.450> prepare

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
have trained my whole life to prepare

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.690 
have trained my whole life to prepare
for<00:02:30.959> things<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.950> know<00:02:32.069> he<00:02:32.280> hasn't<00:02:32.489> been

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
for things that you know he hasn't been

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.250 
for things that you know he hasn't been
prepared<00:02:32.849> for<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.239> mean<00:02:33.480> when<00:02:33.840> he's<00:02:33.989> fighting

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
prepared for I mean when he's fighting

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.080 
prepared for I mean when he's fighting
my<00:02:34.349> Adana<00:02:34.680> he<00:02:34.980> got<00:02:35.130> kneed<00:02:35.430> in<00:02:35.579> the<00:02:35.610> head<00:02:35.730> and

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
my Adana he got kneed in the head and

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.210 
my Adana he got kneed in the head and
taken<00:02:36.420> down<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.840> mean<00:02:37.709> it's<00:02:37.920> just<00:02:37.980> not

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
taken down I mean it's just not

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.520 
taken down I mean it's just not
something<00:02:38.640> that<00:02:38.849> he's<00:02:39.180> been<00:02:39.450> trained<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.349> look

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
something that he's been trained to look

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.920 
something that he's been trained to look
out<00:02:40.709> for
