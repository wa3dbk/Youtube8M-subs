00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.250 
bar which is an inch and a quarter thick
to<00:01:09.640> my<00:01:09.760> understanding<00:01:10.000> which<00:01:10.900> is<00:01:11.049> pretty

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
to my understanding which is pretty

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.870 
to my understanding which is pretty
shocking<00:01:11.619> because<00:01:11.950> I<00:01:12.100> think<00:01:12.310> the<00:01:12.400> stock<00:01:12.670> one

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
shocking because I think the stock one

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.760 
shocking because I think the stock one
is<00:01:12.970> about<00:01:13.150> a<00:01:13.180> half-inch<00:01:13.570> thick<00:01:13.720> so<00:01:14.200> that

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
is about a half-inch thick so that

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.289 
is about a half-inch thick so that

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
should help firm up the front end a lot
