00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
actually true and so um what is a lot of

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.539 
actually true and so um what is a lot of
changes<00:01:09.840> have<00:01:10.049> been<00:01:10.229> implemented<00:01:11.010> into<00:01:11.430> this

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
changes have been implemented into this

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.010 
changes have been implemented into this
version<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.119> guess<00:01:12.150> um<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:13.790> what<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.090> when

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
version I guess um the what is this when

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.499 
version I guess um the what is this when
you<00:01:16.110> run<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.560> looks<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.640> lot<00:01:17.790> different<00:01:17.820> it's

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
you run it it looks a lot different it's

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.450 
you run it it looks a lot different it's
I<00:01:18.900> think<00:01:19.200> it's<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.619> bit<00:01:19.710> more<00:01:19.860> complicated

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
I think it's a bit more complicated

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.310 
I think it's a bit more complicated
it's<00:01:20.549> at<00:01:20.729> first<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.570> get<00:01:21.990> your<00:01:22.200> way

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
it's at first but you get your way

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.789 
it's at first but you get your way
around<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.799> guess<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.250> um<00:01:24.180> yeah<00:01:25.020> that's

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
around it I guess and um yeah that's

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.190 
around it I guess and um yeah that's
pretty<00:01:26.009> much<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.580> um<00:01:27.060> much<00:01:27.540> car<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.869> will<00:01:27.930> be

not just and like a Paris is copy and
here's<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.480> new<00:03:21.599> layouts<00:03:21.959> it<00:03:22.199> looks<00:03:22.379> a<00:03:22.500> lot

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
here's the new layouts it looks a lot

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.610 
here's the new layouts it looks a lot
better<00:03:22.859> anyway<00:03:23.220> up<00:03:23.430> but<00:03:24.120> like<00:03:24.389> they're<00:03:24.629> going

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
better anyway up but like they're going

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.849 
better anyway up but like they're going
on<00:03:25.859> so<00:03:26.639> anyway<00:03:27.060> what<00:03:27.840> you<00:03:27.870> need<00:03:28.319> to<00:03:28.440> do<00:03:28.560> is
