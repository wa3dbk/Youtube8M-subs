works this is a machine that that we've
been<00:02:21.750> using<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.320> what<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.680> does<00:02:22.800> is<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.040> emits

been using and what it does is it emits

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.060 
been using and what it does is it emits
a<00:02:23.580> warm<00:02:23.850> air<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:25.200> dries<00:02:25.500> out<00:02:25.710> the<00:02:25.770> lights

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
a warm air and it dries out the lights

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.000 
a warm air and it dries out the lights
and<00:02:26.190> it's<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.930> their<00:02:27.930> their<00:02:28.200> eighty<00:02:28.800> percent

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
and it's and their their eighty percent

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.340 
and it's and their their eighty percent
fluid<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.450> it's<00:02:30.600> easy<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:31.110> know<00:02:31.230> they're

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
fluid and so it's easy you know they're

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.980 
fluid and so it's easy you know they're
easily<00:02:31.500> dried<00:02:31.860> out<00:02:31.890> but<00:02:32.070> it<00:02:32.370> it's<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.180> constant

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
easily dried out but it it's a constant

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.410 
easily dried out but it it's a constant
temperature<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.680> warm<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:35.130> warm<00:02:35.490> air<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.940> we<00:02:36.300> do

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
temperature to warm a warm air and we do

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.320 
temperature to warm a warm air and we do
a<00:02:36.450> pattern<00:02:36.900> around<00:02:37.230> their<00:02:37.440> head<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:38.330> that's

fancy word for drying them out they're

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.690 
fancy word for drying them out they're
very<00:03:17.910> small<00:03:18.360> and<00:03:18.750> they're<00:03:19.110> flat<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:20.430> they<00:03:20.550> have

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
very small and they're flat so they have

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.210 
very small and they're flat so they have
a<00:03:20.730> hard<00:03:21.030> time<00:03:21.360> hanging<00:03:22.110> on<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.470> moisture<00:03:23.010> like

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
a hard time hanging on to moisture like

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.080 
a hard time hanging on to moisture like
a<00:03:23.250> lot<00:03:23.520> of<00:03:23.670> small<00:03:23.970> insects<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:25.380> so<00:03:25.770> if<00:03:26.430> you<00:03:26.490> hit

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
a lot of small insects and so if you hit

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.170 
a lot of small insects and so if you hit
them<00:03:27.300> directly<00:03:28.140> with<00:03:29.010> a<00:03:29.040> large<00:03:29.370> volume<00:03:29.730> of

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
them directly with a large volume of

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.960 
them directly with a large volume of
warm<00:03:30.480> air<00:03:30.780> they<00:03:31.350> simply<00:03:31.770> can't<00:03:32.040> survive<00:03:32.550> that

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
warm air they simply can't survive that

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.210 
warm air they simply can't survive that
and<00:03:33.600> especially<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:34.200> eggs<00:03:34.470> have<00:03:34.830> trouble

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
and especially the eggs have trouble

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.000 
and especially the eggs have trouble
surviving<00:03:35.510> and<00:03:36.510> so<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.810> machine<00:03:36.960> is<00:03:37.800> capable

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
surviving and so the machine is capable

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.860 
surviving and so the machine is capable
of<00:03:38.340> killing<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.850> hundred<00:03:39.150> percent<00:03:39.270> of<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.690> eggs

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
of killing a hundred percent of the eggs

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.130 
of killing a hundred percent of the eggs
basically<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:40.800> most<00:03:41.040> of<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.370> lice<00:03:42.080> ok<00:03:43.080> so

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
basically and most of the lice ok so

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.650 
basically and most of the lice ok so
does<00:03:43.320> it<00:03:43.440> require<00:03:43.710> numerous<00:03:44.610> treatments<00:03:45.480> or

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
does it require numerous treatments or

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.630 
does it require numerous treatments or
just<00:03:45.930> one<00:03:46.170> or<00:03:46.440> how<00:03:46.530> I<00:03:46.860> mean<00:03:47.190> how<00:03:47.250> does<00:03:47.400> it<00:03:47.490> work

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
just one or how I mean how does it work

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.410 
just one or how I mean how does it work
no<00:03:48.630> in<00:03:48.990> the<00:03:49.230> often<00:03:50.190> just<00:03:50.550> one<00:03:50.730> treatment<00:03:51.060> will

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
no in the often just one treatment will

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.660 
no in the often just one treatment will
work<00:03:51.450> if<00:03:51.960> the<00:03:52.140> machine<00:03:52.500> is<00:03:52.680> used<00:03:52.920> properly<00:03:53.460> it

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
work if the machine is used properly it

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.480 
work if the machine is used properly it
requires<00:03:54.240> a<00:03:54.330> little<00:03:54.510> bit<00:03:54.690> of<00:03:54.780> training<00:03:55.490> to

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
requires a little bit of training to

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.790 
requires a little bit of training to
learn<00:03:56.640> how<00:03:56.700> to<00:03:57.030> use<00:03:57.330> it<00:03:57.540> on<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.840> scalp<00:03:58.170> and<00:03:58.440> we

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
learn how to use it on the scalp and we

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.950 
learn how to use it on the scalp and we
offer<00:03:58.980> that<00:03:59.310> training<00:03:59.850> to<00:04:00.480> people<00:04:00.810> who

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:24.569 
and it's usually not necessary to do

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:27.379 
and it's usually not necessary to do
much<00:04:25.110> cleaning<00:04:25.770> of<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:25.949> home<00:04:26.280> just<00:04:27.270> the

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
much cleaning of the home just the

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.869 
much cleaning of the home just the
sheets<00:04:27.659> maybe<00:04:28.020> and<00:04:28.319> so<00:04:28.530> on<00:04:28.590> but<00:04:28.830> Weiss<00:04:29.550> can't

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:29.879 
sheets maybe and so on but Weiss can't

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:32.689 
sheets maybe and so on but Weiss can't
survive<00:04:30.330> off<00:04:30.719> the<00:04:30.960> scale<00:04:31.490> for<00:04:32.490> more<00:04:32.669> than

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
survive off the scale for more than

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.999 
survive off the scale for more than
about<00:04:32.969> 12<00:04:33.479> or<00:04:33.659> 24<00:04:33.990> hours<00:04:34.560> they<00:04:34.800> die<00:04:34.979> very

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
about 12 or 24 hours they die very

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.279 
about 12 or 24 hours they die very
quickly<00:04:35.400> oh<00:04:35.999> that's<00:04:36.719> good<00:04:36.900> to<00:04:36.960> know<00:04:36.990> so<00:04:37.199> how

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
quickly oh that's good to know so how

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:42.260 
quickly oh that's good to know so how
did<00:04:37.349> you<00:04:37.529> come<00:04:37.680> up<00:04:37.710> with<00:04:37.979> it<00:04:38.779> by<00:04:39.779> accident<00:04:41.270> we

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
did you come up with it by accident we

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.019 
did you come up with it by accident we
do<00:04:42.419> research<00:04:42.870> on<00:04:43.249> parasites<00:04:44.249> mainly<00:04:44.669> of<00:04:44.759> birds

00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:45.029 
do research on parasites mainly of birds

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:47.510 
do research on parasites mainly of birds
actually<00:04:45.719> in<00:04:46.139> my<00:04:46.379> lab<00:04:46.650> at<00:04:46.949> the<00:04:47.039> University<00:04:47.490> of

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
actually in my lab at the University of

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.909 
actually in my lab at the University of
Utah<00:04:47.909> and<00:04:48.659> we<00:04:48.779> discovered<00:04:49.139> when<00:04:49.439> I<00:04:49.469> moved<00:04:49.770> my

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
Utah and we discovered when I moved my

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.339 
Utah and we discovered when I moved my
lab<00:04:50.310> here<00:04:50.699> from<00:04:50.939> another<00:04:51.240> University<00:04:52.020> that<00:04:52.229> we

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:52.349 
lab here from another University that we

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:54.679 
lab here from another University that we
couldn't<00:04:52.650> keep<00:04:52.939> feather<00:04:53.939> light<00:04:54.180> switch<00:04:54.539> we

00:04:54.679 --> 00:04:54.689 
couldn't keep feather light switch we

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:56.959 
couldn't keep feather light switch we
study<00:04:54.990> alive<00:04:55.349> on<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:55.770> birds<00:04:56.039> and<00:04:56.430> it's

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:56.969 
study alive on the birds and it's

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:58.999 
study alive on the birds and it's
because<00:04:57.270> it's<00:04:57.419> too<00:04:57.629> dry<00:04:57.930> the<00:04:57.990> climate<00:04:58.740> here<00:04:58.889> is

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009 
because it's too dry the climate here is

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:01.279 
because it's too dry the climate here is
too<00:04:59.219> dry<00:04:59.430> meanwhile<00:05:00.120> my<00:05:00.389> kids<00:05:00.779> when<00:05:01.080> they<00:05:01.229> were

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
too dry meanwhile my kids when they were

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.769 
too dry meanwhile my kids when they were
young<00:05:01.590> got<00:05:02.310> head<00:05:02.580> lice<00:05:02.610> and<00:05:02.849> so<00:05:03.419> we<00:05:03.569> thought

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:03.779 
young got head lice and so we thought

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:07.279 
young got head lice and so we thought
well<00:05:03.990> we<00:05:04.050> wonder<00:05:04.500> if<00:05:04.529> we<00:05:04.710> can<00:05:04.919> use<00:05:05.479> dry<00:05:06.479> air<00:05:06.810> to

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
well we wonder if we can use dry air to

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:09.499 
well we wonder if we can use dry air to
kill<00:05:07.949> head<00:05:08.189> lice<00:05:08.219> and<00:05:08.430> it<00:05:08.819> took<00:05:08.969> quite<00:05:09.150> a<00:05:09.240> few

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:09.509 
kill head lice and it took quite a few
