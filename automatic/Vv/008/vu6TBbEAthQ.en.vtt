Deek of the week last week we showed you

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.070 
Deek of the week last week we showed you
a<00:00:05.549> toe<00:00:05.730> drag<00:00:06.000> this<00:00:06.450> week<00:00:06.660> I'm<00:00:06.779> going<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:06.930> show

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
a toe drag this week I'm going to show

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.720 
a toe drag this week I'm going to show
you<00:00:07.140> what<00:00:07.710> I<00:00:07.770> like<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:07.980> call<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.220> reverse<00:00:08.519> toe

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
you what I like to call the reverse toe

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.549 
you what I like to call the reverse toe
drag<00:00:08.940> it's<00:00:09.179> kind<00:00:09.330> of<00:00:09.360> like<00:00:09.510> it's<00:00:10.050> very<00:00:10.230> similar

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
drag it's kind of like it's very similar

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.230 
drag it's kind of like it's very similar
to<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.740> toe<00:00:10.889> drag<00:00:11.099> used<00:00:11.700> in<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.910> lot<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.150> the

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
to the toe drag used in a lot of the

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.150 
to the toe drag used in a lot of the
same<00:00:12.360> situations<00:00:12.990> but<00:00:13.410> instead<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.740> using<00:00:13.980> the

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
same situations but instead of using the

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.369 
same situations but instead of using the
toe<00:00:14.340> use<00:00:14.610> in<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.849> back<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.269> stick<00:00:15.540> this<00:00:16.260> is

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
toe use in the back of the stick this is

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.080 
toe use in the back of the stick this is
a<00:00:16.410> method<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.859> like<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.160> use<00:00:17.220> it's<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.880> bit

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
a method that I like to use it's a bit

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.240 
a method that I like to use it's a bit
easier<00:00:18.510> than<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.810> toe<00:00:18.990> drag<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.890> sometimes

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
easier than the toe drag and I sometimes

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.890 
easier than the toe drag and I sometimes
a<00:00:20.340> bit<00:00:20.460> more<00:00:20.609> effective<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:21.390> let's<00:00:21.660> get<00:00:21.779> right

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
a bit more effective so let's get right

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.250 
a bit more effective so let's get right
to<00:00:21.960> it

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
to it

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.660 
to it
this<00:00:22.650> thing<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:22.980> what<00:00:23.100> some<00:00:23.279> people<00:00:23.310> call<00:00:23.640> the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
this thing is what some people call the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.490 
this thing is what some people call the
backhand<00:00:24.180> throw<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.480> against<00:00:24.960> us<00:00:25.140> very

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
backhand throw it against us very

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.080 
backhand throw it against us very
similar<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.099> code<00:00:26.369> rag<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.820> you're<00:00:26.939> using

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
similar to the code rag and you're using

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.730 
similar to the code rag and you're using
a<00:00:27.300> lot<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.480> same<00:00:27.750> situations<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.410> toe<00:00:28.529> drag

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
a lot of same situations the toe drag

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.410 
a lot of same situations the toe drag
but<00:00:29.429> it's<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.730> bit<00:00:29.880> different

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
but it's a bit different

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.669 
but it's a bit different
and<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.750> my<00:00:30.869> mind<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:31.230> think<00:00:31.289> it's<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.529> lot<00:00:31.650> easier

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
and in my mind I think it's a lot easier

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.430 
and in my mind I think it's a lot easier
and<00:00:32.180> sometimes<00:00:33.180> more<00:00:33.360> effective<00:00:33.750> basically

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
and sometimes more effective basically

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.350 
and sometimes more effective basically
what<00:00:34.559> you're<00:00:34.680> doing<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:35.130> with<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.940> toe<00:00:36.090> drag

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
what you're doing is with the toe drag

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.270 
what you're doing is with the toe drag
you're<00:00:36.780> pulling<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.469> catching<00:00:38.160> it

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
you're pulling the in catching it

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.580 
you're pulling the in catching it
with<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:39.120> back<00:00:39.329> end<00:00:39.570> basically<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.440> same

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
with the back end basically the same

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.380 
with the back end basically the same
thing<00:00:40.829> we're<00:00:41.010> pulling<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.640> puck<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.210> back

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
thing we're pulling the puck in the back

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:53.250 
thing we're pulling the puck in the back
of<00:00:42.750> your<00:00:43.020> plate

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.869 

and<00:00:53.350> use<00:00:53.590> it<00:00:53.739> almost<00:00:53.890> the<00:00:54.190> same<00:00:54.399> as<00:00:54.550> the<00:00:54.670> token

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
and use it almost the same as the token

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.639 
and use it almost the same as the token
egg<00:00:55.269> what's<00:00:55.480> bit<00:00:55.690> easier<00:00:55.960> to<00:00:56.050> use<00:00:56.230> your<00:00:56.379> whole

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
egg what's bit easier to use your whole

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.670 
egg what's bit easier to use your whole
back-end<00:00:57.219> plate<00:00:57.820> and<00:00:58.030> I'll<00:00:58.690> show<00:00:58.870> you<00:00:58.899> very

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
back-end plate and I'll show you very

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.950 
back-end plate and I'll show you very
simply<00:01:00.039> uses<00:01:00.519> the<00:01:01.210> first<00:01:01.390> example<00:01:01.809> here<00:01:01.930> I

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
simply uses the first example here I

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.360 
simply uses the first example here I
actually<00:01:02.109> do<00:01:02.320> a<00:01:02.350> bit<00:01:02.500> of<00:01:02.530> a<00:01:02.620> sneaky<00:01:02.979> trick<00:01:03.190> I

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
actually do a bit of a sneaky trick I

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.859 
actually do a bit of a sneaky trick I
put<00:01:03.579> it<00:01:03.670> into<00:01:03.850> my<00:01:03.940> skate<00:01:04.210> kick<00:01:04.420> it<00:01:04.540> behind<00:01:04.720> me

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
put it into my skate kick it behind me

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:05.940 
put it into my skate kick it behind me
and<00:01:04.899> grab<00:01:05.080> it<00:01:05.229> on<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:05.350> other<00:01:05.409> side<00:01:05.530> and<00:01:05.890> I'll

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
and grab it on the other side and I'll

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.139 
and grab it on the other side and I'll
show<00:01:06.100> that<00:01:06.250> again<00:01:06.430> one<00:01:06.610> more<00:01:06.729> time

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
show that again one more time

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:08.880 
show that again one more time
I<00:01:07.180> basically<00:01:07.810> had<00:01:07.990> to<00:01:08.080> do<00:01:08.200> that<00:01:08.350> because<00:01:08.530> ken

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
I basically had to do that because ken

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.560 
I basically had to do that because ken
knew<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.670> move<00:01:09.789> is<00:01:09.909> coming<00:01:10.060> so<00:01:10.299> he<00:01:10.390> kept

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
knew the move is coming so he kept

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.749 
knew the move is coming so he kept
knocking<00:01:10.869> the<00:01:10.960> puck<00:01:11.140> off<00:01:11.320> my<00:01:11.530> stick<00:01:11.770> and<00:01:12.009> so<00:01:12.700> I

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
knocking the puck off my stick and so I

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.460 
knocking the puck off my stick and so I
had<00:01:12.880> to<00:01:13.000> take<00:01:13.210> it<00:01:13.330> up<00:01:13.420> a<00:01:13.539> notch<00:01:13.570> and<00:01:14.049> show<00:01:14.350> him

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
had to take it up a notch and show him

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.870 
had to take it up a notch and show him
that<00:01:14.500> you<00:01:14.740> can<00:01:14.770> still<00:01:15.100> do<00:01:15.190> the<00:01:15.310> move<00:01:15.430> even<00:01:15.759> if

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
that you can still do the move even if

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.279 
that you can still do the move even if
the<00:01:15.970> guy<00:01:16.060> knows<00:01:16.270> that<00:01:16.450> move<00:01:16.750> is<00:01:16.840> coming<00:01:16.990> so

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
the guy knows that move is coming so

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.710 
the guy knows that move is coming so
here's<00:01:17.470> the<00:01:17.680> actual<00:01:17.890> move<00:01:18.220> here<00:01:18.460> my<00:01:19.450> favorite

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
here's the actual move here my favorite

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.389 
here's the actual move here my favorite
time<00:01:19.840> to<00:01:19.869> do<00:01:20.170> this<00:01:20.350> move<00:01:20.560> is<00:01:20.830> when<00:01:21.159> I'm<00:01:21.220> trying

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
time to do this move is when I'm trying

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:22.950 
time to do this move is when I'm trying
to<00:01:21.460> gain<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.759> center<00:01:22.060> say<00:01:22.539> the<00:01:22.630> defenseman

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
to gain the center say the defenseman

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.630 
to gain the center say the defenseman
