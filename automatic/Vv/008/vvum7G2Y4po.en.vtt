and stuff I'm just just a normal average
person<00:02:17.500> with<00:02:18.310> 70<00:02:18.910> prayer<00:02:19.239> and<00:02:19.660> i<00:02:20.140> happen<00:02:20.590> to

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
person with 70 prayer and i happen to

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.520 
person with 70 prayer and i happen to
have<00:02:20.739> bandos<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:21.880> stuff<00:02:22.150> so<00:02:22.930> I<00:02:22.959> would

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
have bandos and stuff so I would

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.440 
have bandos and stuff so I would
recommend<00:02:23.560> banjos<00:02:24.550> because<00:02:24.820> it<00:02:24.940> has<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.060> pretty

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
recommend banjos because it has a pretty

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.060 
recommend banjos because it has a pretty
nice<00:02:25.660> range<00:02:25.989> defense<00:02:26.410> because<00:02:26.709> they<00:02:26.830> do<00:02:26.890> have

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
nice range defense because they do have

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.449 
nice range defense because they do have
a<00:02:27.250> range<00:02:27.550> attack<00:02:27.880> now<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:29.440> think<00:02:29.590> jagex

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
a range attack now and I think jagex

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.430 
a range attack now and I think jagex
updated<00:02:31.000> them<00:02:31.180> because<00:02:31.540> when<00:02:31.720> they<00:02:31.870> first

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
updated them because when they first

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.620 
updated them because when they first

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
forks fine for me see there's that

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.370

little<00:03:12.250> gay<00:03:12.549> blue<00:03:12.850> orb<00:03:13.090> usually<00:03:13.900> never<00:03:14.049> comes

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
little gay blue orb usually never comes

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.220 
little gay blue orb usually never comes
around<00:03:14.530> that<00:03:14.799> much<00:03:15.070> but<00:03:15.970> you<00:03:16.660> just<00:03:16.870> want<00:03:17.110> to

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
around that much but you just want to

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.280 
around that much but you just want to
keep<00:03:17.350> doing<00:03:17.739> this<00:03:17.920> all<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.370> way<00:03:18.730> until<00:03:19.290> you

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
keep doing this all the way until you

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.210 
keep doing this all the way until you
fill<00:03:20.560> up<00:03:20.709> an<00:03:20.860> inventory<00:03:21.160> and<00:03:21.790> I<00:03:22.750> suggest<00:03:23.380> don't

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
fill up an inventory and I suggest don't

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.190

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
save any of your potions even if you

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.530 
save any of your potions even if you
didn't<00:03:26.440> use<00:03:26.650> one<00:03:26.760> because<00:03:27.760> their<00:03:28.030> prayer

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
didn't use one because their prayer

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.800 
didn't use one because their prayer
potions<00:03:28.959> are<00:03:29.110> only<00:03:29.230> like<00:03:29.670> 5.5<00:03:30.670> 6k<00:03:31.360> right<00:03:31.630> now

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
potions are only like 5.5 6k right now

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.800 
potions are only like 5.5 6k right now
and<00:03:32.110> each<00:03:32.769> of<00:03:32.920> these<00:03:33.010> bones<00:03:33.340> are<00:03:33.609> over<00:03:33.940> 18<00:03:34.480> Kate

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
and each of these bones are over 18 Kate

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.410 
and each of these bones are over 18 Kate
like<00:03:34.989> 18.3<00:03:35.950> k<00:03:36.160> so<00:03:36.970> it's<00:03:37.450> better<00:03:37.959> off<00:03:38.230> just<00:03:39.420> here

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
like 18.3 k so it's better off just here

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.150 
like 18.3 k so it's better off just here
I<00:03:40.450> just<00:03:40.840> skipped<00:03:41.140> to<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.350> end<00:03:41.440> where<00:03:41.859> I'm

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
I just skipped to the end where I'm

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.640 
I just skipped to the end where I'm
almost<00:03:43.030> done<00:03:43.299> with<00:03:43.510> my<00:03:43.540> run<00:03:43.930> but<00:03:44.440> it's<00:03:44.560> better

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
almost done with my run but it's better

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.910 
almost done with my run but it's better
off<00:03:44.980> just<00:03:45.160> to<00:03:45.459> drop<00:03:45.700> your<00:03:45.910> potions<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:47.620> stuff

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
off just to drop your potions and stuff

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.880 
off just to drop your potions and stuff
if<00:03:48.070> you<00:03:48.220> don't<00:03:48.400> use<00:03:48.640> them<00:03:48.880> than<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:49.620> save<00:03:50.620> them

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
if you don't use them than to save them

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.620 
if you don't use them than to save them
because<00:03:51.100> you<00:03:51.340> won't<00:03:51.519> make<00:03:51.670> as<00:03:51.850> many<00:03:52.030> for<00:03:52.329> trip

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
because you won't make as many for trip

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.599 
because you won't make as many for trip
and<00:03:52.870> that<00:03:53.019> brings<00:03:53.620> on<00:03:53.859> your<00:03:54.010> cash<00:03:54.250> per<00:03:54.489> hour

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
and that brings on your cash per hour

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.060 
and that brings on your cash per hour
and<00:03:55.000> that's<00:03:55.120> never<00:03:55.390> good<00:03:55.720> because<00:03:56.709> money<00:03:56.950> is

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
and that's never good because money is

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.160 
and that's never good because money is
good<00:03:57.900> using<00:03:58.900> my

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
good using my

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.130 
good using my
use<00:03:59.290> bad<00:04:00.180> especially<00:04:01.180> if<00:04:01.540> you<00:04:01.660> do<00:04:01.780> in<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:01.959> same

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
use bad especially if you do in the same

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.030 
use bad especially if you do in the same
amount<00:04:02.200> of<00:04:02.410> time<00:04:03.540> so<00:04:04.540> yeah<00:04:05.410> you<00:04:05.470> pretty<00:04:05.920> much

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
amount of time so yeah you pretty much

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.790 
amount of time so yeah you pretty much
just<00:04:06.580> want<00:04:07.300> to<00:04:07.390> keep<00:04:07.540> killing<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.349> Dragons

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
exactly how I'm doing now you probably

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.870 
exactly how I'm doing now you probably
used<00:04:12.520> about<00:04:12.670> 100<00:04:13.599> and<00:04:13.780> I<00:04:14.050> think<00:04:14.560> I<00:04:14.650> used<00:04:14.880> 160

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
used about 100 and I think I used 160

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
so they just selling from minimum and

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.890 
so they just selling from minimum and
that's<00:05:51.620> pretty<00:05:52.189> much<00:05:52.400> all<00:05:52.639> I'll<00:05:53.270> make<00:05:53.659> more

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
that's pretty much all I'll make more
