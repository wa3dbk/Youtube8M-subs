 They were in charge of monitoring and protecting the 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.000
 won in germany in such a way this 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.000
 dog becomes one of the most 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.880
 dangerous not for their owners but for 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.820
 the uski's siberian intruders 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.909

 race that is used to throw those 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.590
 sledding in the snow for this reason are 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.780
 dogs for work and not animals of 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.179
 company is that generally 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.149
 coaches have problems with the 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:48.490
 behavior of this race the figures 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.369
 they say 6 percent of deaths 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.649
 by dog ​​bites is because of this 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:58.689
 alaskan race malamute alaskan malamute 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.599
 is the dog breed closest to the 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:04.659
 wolves and I think with that I say enough 

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:07.330
 they are great workers and in this they do not 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.569
 they will give problem however it is difficult 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.090
 stop them when they start elsewhere 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.130
 they have a strong sense of herd by 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.150
 which is likely to attack in a 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:23.560
 group of several dogs between 35 and 45 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:27.250
 kilos of weight each doberman pinscher 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.290
 breed of loyal and brilliant dogs is 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.630
 definitely the one of the doberman 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.780
 pinscher considered one of the 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.420
 best guardian dogs for this reason 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.000
 they are dogs that attack when they see that their 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.690
 territory or your family is being 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.450

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.270
 the chaucha or stuffed animal race 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.640
 they could be bad however his vision 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.280
 limited peripheral makes them dogs 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.540
 scary and ill- tempered what the 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.330
 becomes dangerous big dane is not 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.060
 so dangerous for the race itself but for 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.370
 its size is one of the dog breeds 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.250
 the world's largest there comes 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.410
 his great Danish name which means 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.470
 that if it's out of control you can 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.860
 become a real danger 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.570
 canary prey as its name indicates the 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.600
 dogs of the canary prey race 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.940

 dog bred to handle livestock or 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.680
 as a hunting dog so it's very

 energetic is not afraid and is very 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.760
 smart your violence can be with 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:41.879
 other dogs or with the human boxer 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.430
 boxer dogs are another race of origin 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:47.040
 German pretty close and difficult to 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.250
 train but not aggressive by nature 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.989
 however it is a very playful dog and 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.049
 Sociable that needs big

 become distrustful and aggressive the 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.030
 patience and time are the key to 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.670
