00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.990
 it's bad we got a little tired 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.949
 because we had a big session 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.119
 still one of the last I think that 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:26.900
 with efforts we do not like and 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.029
 it is what makes physics 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.560
 in the form of one-on-one duels and 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.970
 three against three so it's true that 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.160
 it's a little bit tiring 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.950
 need also because we did yesterday a 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.360
 plio session so here it is a little 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.910
 hard for the organisms but I think 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.960
 now this one is sure 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:48.770
 recovery and then people coming in 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:50.809
 will be more and more yes we think about it 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.050
 obviously all we do there is 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.760
 think when it's hard we think about it 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.260
 and we think that all these little efforts 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.820
 they will allow us to go to the 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.410
 victory 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.800
 it's very important the group lives well 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.970
 a group 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.620
 lives hard times on the 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.790
 field together when it's prep 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.040
 physical but in any case one clings 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.270
 everything is dirty main to go for 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.280
 go get a title 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.980
 it's a match that did during 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.980
 preparation so team that is also 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.360
 a physical effort to cash in and then 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.160
 remake a little bit the settings so 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.290
 obviously we can not wait to play because 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.330
 what we love is play 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.680
 matches so it's with pleasure 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.460
 we are going to manage norway is done with 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.430
 pleasure to elbow craving especially and of 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.960
 show that we are here and 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.520
 we are preparing very well for the euro 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.040
 after the result of north bay I do not 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.200
 did not know if it may not be 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.320
 the hairdresser to the euro, but at least if 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:49.110
 refresh third ground the summer 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.360
 Franco wars and he frankly I finished 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.970
 I still finished first of the 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.330

 and the little boys who hatched then 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.730
 this operation that have made beautiful 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.590
 benefits 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.390
 so well on the field as outside with 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.090

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.810
 so we all have last year we have 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.810
