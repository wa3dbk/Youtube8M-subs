00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello everyone welcome to a new one 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.830
 series on my channel 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.660
 bibliographies you but you knew that 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.460
 probably yes and this time we do 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.800
 the series from the cupboard where demand 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.509
 jordi off course you come out of the closet 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.370
 no the next time games from the greenhouse we 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.980
 you can see something of the crime above that 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.990
 who women men and bartok's the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.600
 most three game orders ever 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.090
 and in this series I do the kind of one 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.720
 review about games that copy then 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.609
 crack okay so watch village I'm not going 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.380
 real reviewer understood that is nobody 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.500
 I am of the opinion that I am going 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.960
 give about the game the game is normal me 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.850
 mean there is not what you wait for yourself 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.070
 if you have all those trainers that day for sure 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.510
 knowing that i was a little more open i 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.800
 certainly had the vegetables do succeed 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.600
 reve lost also saw 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.700
 you are doing everything but also as a group 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.250
 the game that the middle was open but 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:55.289
 actually it was just sort of yes 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.789
 of it was less i would rather avoid it 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.840
 fights in games than I do them too 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.879
 really enter into it 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.039
 but in this case you got experience 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.550
 from people of words and not from sometimes 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.949
 to sail 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.890
 so by the side was just stupid because 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.659
 you couldn't upgrade your character 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.260
 whatever he was stupid in hubble we say 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.850
 of game I found the game 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.860
 mediocre I certainly won't do any better 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.140
 give insufficient but I had them too 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.869
 not high enough to give some march too 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.790
 its like fun it gave something never 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.700
 had seen before in games and that was it 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.380
 sure something cool to see but me 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.829
 thought we could do more things with it 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.630
 see 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.600
 i like choices in games that is also the 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.619
 reason why I love arbies or online 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.860
 from 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.220
 skill tree or games such as the walking 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.320
 dead in which a simple dialogue shows you all the 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.329
 whole game can change for you and that 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.460
 is sure it will be because 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.549
 stokes can't make choices but over on it 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.649
 end and venture into choices 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.990
 it was killing or being killed 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.969
 which I just put more pounds on 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.920
 corn was consolation that is the game I was on 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.329
 your we actually used music and sometimes 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.700
 you even did that in the storyline 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.330
 missions I am a youtuber and we 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.220
 can't 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.040
 your use when the music because 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.690
 therefore our channel can be thrown 11 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:15.870
 be lost at once that's crap 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.180
 and Bartok's was a game that had that 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.830
 so buy your own music insight and i 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.480
 think your gta do it much as a child 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.160
 it does, which is sure to 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.260
 plotting in my stokes 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.540
 but sometimes it was about some sort of thing 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.210
 just rode random neighbor to the me and 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.180
 then it was not the strangest of them 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.500
 my later the enemy spans were too 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.860
 completely crazy 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.760
 have give up with the boss at your rack 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:45.600
 just complete lack of 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.550
 stampin 'him never joke well this directly 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.900
 of having was wrong then 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.930
 Well even as a simple example 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.900
 give you a door and we were on one 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.120
 roof you think directly to yourself we 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.040
 say very logical think a know that 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.440
 something arrived enemies 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.570
 a little under percent sure that 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.209
 everyone has to come because you're up 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.100
 a motherfucking day and nobody can go on 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.900
 that then there will be more that bunch and the 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.250
 helicopters or cheat 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.260
 yet do not assume that in addition to 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.330
 happen but i will be right at the door too 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.930
 wait wait until the enemies 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.580
 arrived 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.000
 because I was smart and I went somewhere 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.030
 sit behind your bivouac box clever 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.760
 nail polish how on the day I was doing 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.349
 suddenly behind me 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.030
 to a cell and the fridge where this is 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.680
 just can't easily think that 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.629
 if i have a jersey 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.120
 that 500 actually also do door 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:41.720
 must come or at least 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.319
 a place for which you think oh yes yes that 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.590
 makes sense 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:48.049
 eat when suddenly stand behind me because that 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.530
 is just illogical and 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:53.629
 pretty spicy gray well that wasn't 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.579
 the only problem with washing box 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:58.040
 in general I did experience it 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.319
 more problems and I liked the game 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.450
 just against falling very much 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.540
 disappointments in places where it is correct 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.400
 that can be incredibly good 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.959
 and that's my opinion about what kind of me 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.680
 actually wanted to completely crack because 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.209
 know it for sure 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.889
 the game is pretty good 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.449
 it the ec game i also know how you like 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.070
 also done because we never did 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.470
 had seen 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.150
 hacking yes and know it for sure 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.280
 have to expand but ultimately 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.380
 this has become a kind of gta in which 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.270
 you occasionally hold the button down to 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.160
 to hack things because year goes like this 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.590
 simply very many one but the button 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.240
 pressed and it has been hacked 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.000
 feels that he already actually problems 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.660
 was sooner to spam and q spam 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.330
 as side leads and I think bart the should 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.340
 therefore just an average game 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.560
 the graphics were certainly good it 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.139
 sound was also still to do the music 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.520
 am a counter wash less that sung 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.320
 that copyright became just one 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.289
 stupid your own music was sure 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.449
 call well so that was not a minus there 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.039
 is a plus 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.349
 yes but half youness against graphics 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:06.740
 were good actually the look was good the 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:08.760
 celebration was good only the missions 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.320
 were just 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.320
 the predestined 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.150
 I had more hope and expect this game and 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.340
 it was not really one as usual 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.900
 a pity and 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.850
 just quickly get whatever you feature 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.100
 the attracted 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:26.220
 just to get in the mood 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:28.470
 completely forgot to say was one 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.960
 against me in 6s not a six and a half 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.540
 pick me up from six 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:38.760
 average game still get an extra point 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:40.320
 worth trying 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.720
 but I definitely know a wheel two 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.250
 you we are football of this series 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.960
 then you are not allowed out of youtube isoft 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.080
 equally blunder made with the 6 pi 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.330
 day and always part 1 but yogis or so 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.460
 always a try 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.380
 that is always the case so maybe we go 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.570
 even better the game I expect 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.890
 I actually want 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.470
 so it found you like game runs 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.520
 in the comments next week 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.220
 maybe a new one out of the closet 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.200
 about my series i have watched before 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.550
 crack like you there or my opinion 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.050
 want to hear please leave a comment 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.090
 in the back here at the bottom of each 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.050
 I feel for a moment and always like that 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.090
 I mean this is a green thumb 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.680
 Willem in is the coupons time and time again 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:20.430

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:24.020
 new from cupboard or another series
