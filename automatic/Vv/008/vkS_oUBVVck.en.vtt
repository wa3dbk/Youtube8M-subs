welcome up to the crow's nest thank you
what<00:00:09.990> do<00:00:10.050> you<00:00:10.080> think<00:00:10.290> about<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.500> one<00:00:10.679> either

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
what do you think about this one either

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.039 
what do you think about this one either
look<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:11.790> impressive<00:00:11.940> so<00:00:12.509> far<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.960> the

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
look that impressive so far and the

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.810 
look that impressive so far and the
judges<00:00:13.410> gave<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.650> decision<00:00:14.160> in<00:00:14.280> shut<00:00:14.490> as<00:00:14.639> well

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
judges gave a decision in shut as well

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.060 
judges gave a decision in shut as well
yeah<00:00:15.269> yeah<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.960> think<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.560> think<00:00:16.740> it's<00:00:16.859> going<00:00:16.980> to

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
yeah yeah I think I think it's going to

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.529 
yeah yeah I think I think it's going to
be<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.220> very<00:00:17.460> very<00:00:17.640> interesting<00:00:17.910> match<00:00:18.300> because

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
be a very very interesting match because

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.310 
be a very very interesting match because
what<00:00:18.840> we've<00:00:18.990> got<00:00:19.140> here<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:19.439> two<00:00:20.279> horizontal

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
what we've got here is two horizontal

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.080 
what we've got here is two horizontal
disks<00:00:22.320> countering<00:00:23.310> into<00:00:23.580> each<00:00:23.670> other<00:00:23.880> so

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
disks countering into each other so

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.210 
disks countering into each other so
sucking<00:00:24.539> everything<00:00:24.779> in<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.320> one<00:00:25.769> great<00:00:26.039> big

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
sucking everything in and one great big

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.769 
sucking everything in and one great big
vertical<00:00:26.460> one<00:00:26.880> going<00:00:27.180> right<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.570> way

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
vertical one going right this way

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.050 
vertical one going right this way
shredders<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.590> bit<00:00:28.830> more<00:00:28.980> maneuverable<00:00:29.609> but<00:00:29.820> I

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
shredders a bit more maneuverable but I

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.759 
shredders a bit more maneuverable but I
don't<00:00:30.269> think<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.570> has<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.720> power<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.170> f3<00:00:31.590> so

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
don't think it has the power of f3 so

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.139 
don't think it has the power of f3 so
it's<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.070> really<00:00:32.189> interesting<00:00:32.430> match<00:00:32.700> process

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
it's a really interesting match process

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.270 
it's a really interesting match process
good<00:00:33.329> test<00:00:33.630> case<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.260> different<00:00:34.920> types<00:00:35.100> of

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
good test case of the different types of

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.910 
good test case of the different types of
discs<00:00:35.550> actually<00:00:36.360> very<00:00:36.570> impressive<00:00:37.140> in<00:00:37.260> series

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
discs actually very impressive in series

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.280 
discs actually very impressive in series
five<00:00:37.950> as<00:00:38.430> well<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.570> disk<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.870> very<00:00:40.079> heavy

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
five as well and the disk is very heavy

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.040 
five as well and the disk is very heavy
very<00:00:40.469> powerful<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.280> yes<00:00:41.610> but<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:42.719> just<00:00:42.960> a

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
very powerful it is yes but it's just a

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.540 
very powerful it is yes but it's just a
maneuverability<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.950> little<00:00:44.219> bit<00:00:44.370> early

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
maneuverability is a little bit early

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.619 
maneuverability is a little bit early
okay<00:00:45.239> which<00:00:45.480> way<00:00:45.690> do<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.899> go<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.379> one<00:00:47.120> s3<00:00:49.550> so

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
okay which way do I go on this one s3 so

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.139 
okay which way do I go on this one s3 so
two<00:00:51.629> robots<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.500> come<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> long<00:00:52.980> long<00:00:53.190> way<00:00:53.460> but

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
two robots have come a long long way but

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.290 
two robots have come a long long way but
for<00:00:54.329> one<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.350> end<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.920> line<00:00:56.300> prepare

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
for one it's the end of the line prepare

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.069 
for one it's the end of the line prepare
for<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> heat<00:00:58.379> final

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
a good robot this yeah we thought yours

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.100 
a good robot this yeah we thought yours
was<00:05:49.340> as<00:05:49.520> well<00:05:49.700> we<00:05:50.180> thought<00:05:50.390> so<00:05:50.600> as<00:05:50.720> well<00:05:50.750> and

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
was as well we thought so as well and

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.780 
was as well we thought so as well and
we've<00:05:51.590> done<00:05:51.740> some<00:05:51.800> cracking<00:05:52.130> driving<00:05:52.670> it's

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
we've done some cracking driving it's

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.060 
we've done some cracking driving it's
been<00:05:52.910> brilliant<00:05:53.090> yeah<00:05:53.600> I<00:05:53.900> needed<00:05:54.500> robots<00:05:54.890> or

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
been brilliant yeah I needed robots or

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.320 
been brilliant yeah I needed robots or
thought<00:05:55.280> it's<00:05:55.580> best<00:05:55.850> to<00:05:55.940> give<00:05:56.060> him<00:05:56.150> a<00:05:56.180> chance

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
thought it's best to give him a chance

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.600 
thought it's best to give him a chance
to<00:05:56.450> go<00:05:56.600> through<00:05:56.630> the<00:05:56.930> semi<00:05:57.140> for<00:05:57.350> anything<00:05:57.610> I

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
to go through the semi for anything I

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.100 
to go through the semi for anything I
even<00:05:59.030> drove<00:05:59.210> yourself<00:05:59.330> down<00:05:59.720> a<00:05:59.750> pit<00:05:59.960> in<00:05:59.990> the

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
even drove yourself down a pit in the

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.480 
even drove yourself down a pit in the
engine<00:06:00.410> so<00:06:00.560> make<00:06:00.740> sure<00:06:00.770> they<00:06:01.130> went<00:06:01.250> through

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
engine so make sure they went through

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.100 
engine so make sure they went through
properly<00:06:01.880> we<00:06:02.510> thought<00:06:02.750> you<00:06:02.900> were<00:06:03.020> just

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110
