rose<00:04:51.510> because<00:04:51.690> we<00:04:51.960> have<00:04:52.910> quite<00:04:53.910> a<00:04:53.940> few

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
rose because we have quite a few

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.430 
rose because we have quite a few
different<00:04:54.360> sets<00:04:54.540> that<00:04:54.720> are<00:04:54.750> involved<00:04:55.080> here

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
different sets that are involved here

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.070

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
conflicting with each other so let's go

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.990

doesn't have enhancement as a spec we're

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:09.980 
doesn't have enhancement as a spec we're
going<00:05:08.729> to<00:05:08.789> go<00:05:08.909> ahead<00:05:08.999> and<00:05:09.120> turn<00:05:09.360> off<00:05:09.539> each<00:05:09.749> one

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
going to go ahead and turn off each one

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.950 
going to go ahead and turn off each one
of<00:05:10.020> these<00:05:10.699> enhancement<00:05:11.699> power<00:05:12.180> Wars<00:05:12.449> by<00:05:12.659> shift

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
of these enhancement power Wars by shift

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:20.950 
of these enhancement power Wars by shift
left<00:05:13.229> clicking<00:05:13.469> on<00:05:13.710> them

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.870 

alright<00:05:21.560> so<00:05:21.770> now<00:05:21.889> these<00:05:22.039> powers<00:05:22.460> were<00:05:22.669> never

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
alright so now these powers were never

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.260 
alright so now these powers were never
come<00:05:23.120> on<00:05:23.270> unless<00:05:23.569> we're<00:05:23.960> enhancement<00:05:24.610> so

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
come on unless we're enhancement so

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.060 
come on unless we're enhancement so
we're<00:05:27.780> gonna<00:05:27.900> go<00:05:28.020> ahead<00:05:28.110> and<00:05:28.200> change<00:05:28.560> each<00:05:28.890> one

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
we're gonna go ahead and change each one

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.770 
we're gonna go ahead and change each one
of<00:05:29.100> these<00:05:29.250> on<00:05:29.520> the<00:05:29.760> resto<00:05:30.120> ones<00:05:30.330> so<00:05:30.630> that

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
of these on the resto ones so that

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.900 
of these on the resto ones so that
they're<00:05:30.960> only<00:05:31.140> allowed<00:05:31.980> on<00:05:32.310> the<00:05:32.520> secondary

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
they're only allowed on the secondary

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.810 
they're only allowed on the secondary
spec<00:05:33.240> which<00:05:33.510> is<00:05:33.690> his<00:05:33.870> secondary<00:05:34.680> spec<00:05:34.980> so<00:05:35.700> we

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
spec which is his secondary spec so we

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.520 
spec which is his secondary spec so we
uncheck<00:05:36.030> the<00:05:36.330> first<00:05:36.570> spec<00:05:36.810> on<00:05:37.050> each<00:05:37.290> one<00:05:37.500> of

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
uncheck the first spec on each one of

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.700 
uncheck the first spec on each one of
these

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:57.439 

so

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:07.190 

all<00:05:57.930> right<00:05:58.110> let's<00:05:58.770> finish<00:05:58.949> sure

going to our le cooldowns now and we're
into<00:06:11.430> the<00:06:11.520> same<00:06:11.700> but<00:06:11.910> we're<00:06:12.030> instead<00:06:12.210> of

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
into the same but we're instead of

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.690 
into the same but we're instead of
removing<00:06:13.290> first<00:06:13.740> pack<00:06:13.920> remember<00:06:14.250> the<00:06:14.340> second

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
removing first pack remember the second

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:36.320 
removing first pack remember the second
spec

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330
