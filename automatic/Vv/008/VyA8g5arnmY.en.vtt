okay so there's the back of it now it
just<00:03:44.930> needs<00:03:45.080> to<00:03:45.230> be<00:03:45.380> set<00:03:45.800> aside<00:03:45.920> till<00:03:46.400> it's

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
just needs to be set aside till it's

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:54.720 
just needs to be set aside till it's
completely<00:03:46.820> dry<00:03:50.620> all<00:03:51.620> right<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:52.580> glue<00:03:53.180> is

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
completely dry all right the glue is

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.700 
completely dry all right the glue is
just<00:03:55.730> about<00:03:56.060> completely<00:03:56.600> dry<00:03:56.840> stuff<00:03:57.530> probably

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
just about completely dry stuff probably

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.770 
just about completely dry stuff probably
needs<00:03:58.010> a<00:03:58.160> little<00:03:58.310> bit<00:03:58.490> longer<00:03:58.730> but<00:03:59.030> it's<00:03:59.270> dry

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
needs a little bit longer but it's dry

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:00.880 
needs a little bit longer but it's dry
enough<00:03:59.990> to<00:04:00.050> handle<00:04:00.530> right<00:04:00.650> now

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
enough to handle right now

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.550 
enough to handle right now
it's<00:04:01.790> been<00:04:01.970> about<00:04:02.120> half<00:04:02.210> an<00:04:02.750> hour<00:04:02.870> 45<00:04:03.260> minutes

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
it's been about half an hour 45 minutes

it's been about half an hour 45 minutes
or<00:04:03.770> so<00:04:04.330> now<00:04:05.330> it's<00:04:05.480> time<00:04:05.630> to<00:04:05.750> cut<00:04:05.900> it<00:04:05.930> out<00:04:06.160> so

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160

before I touch the card I'm gonna attach
the<00:05:42.469> butterfly<00:05:42.919> and<00:05:43.550> the<00:05:43.610> easiest<00:05:43.909> way<00:05:44.090> to<00:05:44.120> do

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
the butterfly and the easiest way to do

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.019 
the butterfly and the easiest way to do
it<00:05:44.449> is<00:05:44.629> to<00:05:45.050> flip<00:05:45.289> it<00:05:45.379> over<00:05:45.500> so<00:05:46.370> the<00:05:46.400> back<00:05:46.639> side

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:47.029 
it is to flip it over so the back side

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:48.459 
it is to flip it over so the back side
is<00:05:47.150> facing<00:05:47.509> me<00:05:47.629> with<00:05:47.810> all<00:05:47.930> the<00:05:48.080> glitter<00:05:48.319> and
