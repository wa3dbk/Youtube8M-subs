00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.440
 according to the uses as I want 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.940
 good guys welcome to another one 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.090
 boxing more 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.970
 and we have another package here another package 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.859
 pretty beautiful 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.640
 that comes with numbers and does not come with 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:34.220
 numbers because it is something that is worth enough 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.360
 quite a lot of money because if you 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.710
 spend a little more product of 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.530
 tracing 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.989
 it is about and opening it is about a 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.560
 car radio you already know that go gogh 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.370
 has several radios 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:54.270
 and then I have acquired one to replace 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:58.200
 the stage that you saw in a previous one 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.480
 previous boxing said some two 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.970
 months there is not a sound stage the most 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.370
 the one that is fattest is not the circuit 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.580
 integrated 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.070
 and here comes the radios it comes without 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.280
 box or nothing was the one that had more 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:17.210
 economic that people had bought if 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:22.010
 I do not remember badly and it takes usb reader 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.750
 cards tickets etc 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.770
 well I will show you the first thing is the 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.359
 radio 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.929
 proceed to a boxing and then 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:32.390
 next I guess in the video 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:36.250
 you will see the 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.250
 the tests of the gala 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.670
 good 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.170
 well here we have the radio is supposed to 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.030
 I'm like this, I'm going to use it 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.430
 externally but you can put it in a 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.190
 car weighs nothing 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.150
 and this we have here on the wheel these 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:01.150
 they are buttons buttons vote buttons 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.610
 negotiations this is I suppose the infrared 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:07.400
 for the command 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.340
 to put a card etc to put a 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.780
 jack with a device counts sound and 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.890
 here for a usb 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.319
 usb 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.370
 and a little more we will open all the 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.370
 buttons that was born exactly 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.150
 and they are given to take out 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.430
 I feel 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.870
 here it comes to us according to 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.600
 the pins that is the cable has well 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.770
 come some sir 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.460
 the feed pins of the feed 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.460
 what it is 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.109
 what is each state let's say 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.230
 power and each speaker this itself 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:55.689
 will be sound input per jack for not 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.250
 have to be plugged in here or it will be 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:04.620
 special exit for something and then here 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:06.680
 the radio connection here we have 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.930
 the dedications 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.260
 thinks it tells us good rather if it 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.550
 we read like that tells us that green and green and 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.490
 white is the frontal 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.280
 etcetera etcetera what is food 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.800
 what is the antenna look from here it puts 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.150
 in rca out or is it an audio output 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.480
 what it meant for a stage 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.760
 to connect a stage 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.769
 a stage of sound that sounds out 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.330
 clean without equalizing and then already the stage 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:39.799
 of helix and well let's see here what 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.980
 that brings us apart from the command and the 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:44.730
 cables 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.730
 here we have the stable cables go 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.730
 here 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.020
 look at each cable steve is what it is 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.340
 although it is written I do not know if you can 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.980
 to appreciate 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:02.170
 for example this says it's antenna 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:06.489
 this one says it's some baby battery 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:10.720
 these two are white chicha the red and 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:14.320
 black and they are also speakers 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:17.230
 and up to here the radio antenna is 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.200
 cheering with his protector so that we 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:23.820
 take the pile because I guess it brings 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.820
 stack 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:31.940
 and here is the stack 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.819
 takes a pile then this will work with 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.310
 style of red if you can see it there is 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:39.190
 the infrared 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.710
 and little more than telling you now you know 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.010
 the demonstration of how it works and here 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.010
 you have 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:51.530
 14 volts will be a little bit 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.360
 complicated of the 14 laps I have 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:58.539
 are 12 volts with will work 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.889
 the impedance since 4 years has four 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.889
 50 watt channels 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:08.510
 the fm radio with its usb card ranges 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.150
 atlanta reader is said in the modes 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.540
 waths up 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.020
 mute to the clock etc. f3 more options 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.930
 but good 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.870
 I will 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.620
 trapiche tune the little bit to 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.990
 show us how it works and see you in 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.400
 all the miserable duration in a while 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.680
 because you will have to mess up what 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.270
 you be below but nothing 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.820
 quality but I'm recording with the 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:37.240
 active xperia and I hope you are 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.789
 listening and seeing well that records 720 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.830
 it's not with the lg although on the axis the 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:45.310
 bonuses that the lights are very white 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:48.150
 also but good you'll tell me now 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.150
 right away we go back
