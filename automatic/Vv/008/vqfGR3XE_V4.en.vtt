really had no some good thing he's done

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.780 
really had no some good thing he's done
this<00:00:35.370> before

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
this before

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.110 
this before
then<00:00:36.570> cloud<00:00:36.809> with<00:00:37.079> jab<00:00:37.850> instead<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.969> blocking

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
then cloud with jab instead of blocking

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.549 
then cloud with jab instead of blocking
the<00:00:39.390> jam<00:00:39.629> with<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> rear<00:00:40.079> hand<00:00:40.110> like<00:00:40.469> you

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
the jam with the rear hand like you

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.130 
the jam with the rear hand like you
should<00:00:40.800> he<00:00:41.399> was<00:00:41.550> blocking<00:00:41.760> with<00:00:41.969> bleeding<00:00:42.210> now

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
should he was blocking with bleeding now

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.200 
should he was blocking with bleeding now
you<00:00:43.980> don't<00:00:44.160> necessarily<00:00:44.280> want<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.850> do<00:00:45.030> that

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
you don't necessarily want to do that

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.910 
you don't necessarily want to do that
because<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.079> right<00:00:46.230> hand<00:00:46.260> could<00:00:46.590> be<00:00:46.620> coming

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
because the right hand could be coming

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.940 
because the right hand could be coming
over<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.100> top<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:48.079> release<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.230> expose<00:00:49.590> but

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
over the top of it release to expose but

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.760 
over the top of it release to expose but
because<00:00:50.700> Bernard<00:00:51.180> can<00:00:51.840> shoulder<00:00:52.199> roll<00:00:52.410> he<00:00:52.620> was

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
because Bernard can shoulder roll he was

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.830 
because Bernard can shoulder roll he was
able<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.070> block<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.640> with<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.850> lead<00:00:54.000> hand<00:00:54.270> and

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
able to block it with the lead hand and

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.170 
able to block it with the lead hand and
be<00:00:55.020> prepared<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.710> roll<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.579> right<00:00:56.820> hand<00:00:57.000> off

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
be prepared to roll that right hand off

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.029 
be prepared to roll that right hand off
should<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.600> come<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.320> another<00:00:58.559> was<00:00:58.739> watching

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
should it come and another was watching

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.639 
should it come and another was watching
it<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.539> but<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.570> think<00:01:00.870> he<00:01:01.020> was<00:01:01.199> doing<00:01:01.500> that

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
it and but I think he was doing that

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.039 
it and but I think he was doing that
because<00:01:02.460> he<00:01:02.760> wanted<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.090> keep<00:01:03.210> his<00:01:03.420> his<00:01:03.809> right

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
because he wanted to keep his his right

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.340 
because he wanted to keep his his right
hand<00:01:04.290> at<00:01:04.439> home<00:01:04.619> preparing<00:01:05.430> for<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.350> cloud
