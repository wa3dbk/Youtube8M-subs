00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
really did find this to challenge

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.820 
really did find this to challenge
because<00:00:17.789> she<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.630> very<00:00:18.779> prominent<00:00:19.320> features

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
because she is very prominent features

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.700 
because she is very prominent features
that<00:00:20.490> at<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.600> same<00:00:21.779> time<00:00:21.840> are<00:00:22.230> kind<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.500> hard

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
that at the same time are kind of hard

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.710 
that at the same time are kind of hard
to<00:00:22.769> define<00:00:22.980> on<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> sim<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.970> make<00:00:24.150> her<00:00:24.300> not<00:00:24.480> look

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
to define on a sim to make her not look

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.800 
to define on a sim to make her not look
like<00:00:24.900> just<00:00:25.140> some<00:00:25.350> normal<00:00:26.240> regular<00:00:27.240> sim<00:00:27.630> with

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
like just some normal regular sim with

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.450 
like just some normal regular sim with
black<00:00:28.050> hair<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.769> was<00:00:28.890> sort<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.160> hard<00:00:29.369> to

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
black hair so that was sort of hard to

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.859 
black hair so that was sort of hard to
do<00:00:29.670> but<00:00:29.849> you'll<00:00:30.029> see<00:00:30.269> me<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.449> think<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.750> had

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
do but you'll see me I think I had

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.479

accomplished<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.560> pretty<00:00:31.769> well<00:00:32.009> here<00:00:32.309> I

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
accomplished that pretty well here I

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.420 
accomplished that pretty well here I
went<00:00:33.270> with<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.540> just<00:00:33.750> normal<00:00:34.020> down<00:00:34.559> hair<00:00:35.070> style

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
went with a more almond shaped eye that

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.639 
went with a more almond shaped eye that
way<00:00:58.980> she<00:00:59.399> would<00:01:00.090> not<00:01:00.719> have<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.109> rounded<00:01:01.469> eyes

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649

structure<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.370> default<00:01:02.789> sim<00:01:03.090> came<00:01:03.359> with

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
structure that the default sim came with

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.310 
structure that the default sim came with
and<00:01:03.870> then<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.379> came<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:05.330> just<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.900> changed

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
and then I came and just just changed

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.440 
and then I came and just just changed
very<00:01:07.500> small<00:01:08.070> things<00:01:08.400> with<00:01:08.700> her<00:01:08.850> eyes<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.330> make

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
very small things with her eyes to make

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.719 
very small things with her eyes to make
it<00:01:09.570> more<00:01:09.689> look<00:01:09.960> more<00:01:10.200> realistic<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:11.070> was<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
it more look more realistic I was the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.750 
it more look more realistic I was the
one<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.030> here<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.270> right<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.260> her<00:01:13.500> braid<00:01:14.369> out

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
one in here and right in her braid out

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.700 
one in here and right in her braid out
her<00:01:14.939> nose<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.479> made<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.049> tip<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.380> her<00:01:16.500> nose<00:01:16.530> a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
her nose and made the tip of her nose a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.039 
her nose and made the tip of her nose a
little<00:01:16.979> bit<00:01:17.250> wider<00:01:17.460> as<00:01:17.729> well<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.360> then<00:01:18.960> I

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
little bit wider as well and then I

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.690 
little bit wider as well and then I
wanted<00:01:19.290> here<00:01:19.530> made<00:01:19.770> small<00:01:20.070> tweaks<00:01:20.430> for<00:01:20.640> a

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
wanted here made small tweaks for a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.550 
wanted here made small tweaks for a
facial<00:01:20.909> structure<00:01:21.570> you'll<00:01:21.869> see<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.140> go<00:01:22.380> back

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
facial structure you'll see I go back

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.719 
facial structure you'll see I go back
and<00:01:22.799> change<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.189> multiple<00:01:23.670> times

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
and change that multiple times

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.510 
and change that multiple times
throughout<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.420> video<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:26.220> think<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
throughout the video and and I think the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.190 
throughout the video and and I think the
end<00:01:26.670> product<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.270> up<00:01:27.420> well<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:27.900> much

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
end product is it up well but much

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.460 
end product is it up well but much
different<00:01:28.590> than<00:01:28.770> what<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.100> see<00:01:29.310> here<00:01:30.470> Selena

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
different than what you see here Selena

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.730 
different than what you see here Selena
Gomez<00:01:31.829> has<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.610> very<00:01:33.119> large<00:01:33.509> lips<00:01:34.049> but<00:01:34.409> at<00:01:34.619> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
Gomez has a very large lips but at the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.890 
Gomez has a very large lips but at the
same<00:01:34.950> time<00:01:35.189> her<00:01:35.790> top<00:01:36.060> lip<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.390> much<00:01:36.600> thinner

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
same time her top lip is much thinner

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.899 
same time her top lip is much thinner
than<00:01:37.020> her<00:01:37.380> bottom<00:01:37.740> lip<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.250> had<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.820> go

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
than her bottom lip so I had to go

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.160 
than her bottom lip so I had to go
through<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.270> change<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.750> couple<00:01:40.020> of

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
through and change that a couple of

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.280 
through and change that a couple of
times<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:41.000> didn't<00:01:42.000> just<00:01:42.180> change<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.840> overall

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
times and didn't just change the overall

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.410 
times and didn't just change the overall
structure<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.220> her<00:01:44.369> lip<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.729> didn't<00:01:45.030> like<00:01:45.210> how

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
set so I changed that as well I went

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.670
