00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.750 
original position so all I do is I put
the<00:02:39.640> far<00:02:39.850> end<00:02:40.090> all<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.330> way<00:02:40.360> down<00:02:40.570> there<00:02:41.760> take

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
the far end all the way down there take

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.880 
the far end all the way down there take
loops<00:02:43.030> like<00:02:43.269> that<00:02:43.500> stick<00:02:44.500> them<00:02:44.650> underneath

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
loops like that stick them underneath

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.960 
loops like that stick them underneath
this<00:02:45.190> bungee<00:02:45.700> that's<00:02:46.030> not<00:02:46.150> used

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.870 

I<00:02:49.000> want<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.540> make<00:02:49.630> sure<00:02:49.660> there's<00:02:49.900> no<00:02:50.020> knots<00:02:50.880> or

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
I want to make sure there's no knots or

00:02:51.880 --> 00:03:00.350 
I want to make sure there's no knots or
obstructions<00:02:52.480> in<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:52.630> line

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.380 

and<00:03:00.660> there's<00:03:00.930> your<00:03:01.050> line<00:03:01.370> all<00:03:02.370> in<00:03:02.670> place<00:03:02.970> and

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
and there's your line all in place and

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.320 
and there's your line all in place and
the<00:03:04.260> reason<00:03:04.560> for<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:04.740> is<00:03:05.100> here's<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:06.090> main

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
the reason for that is here's the main

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.120 
the reason for that is here's the main
portion<00:03:06.690> that<00:03:07.560> goes<00:03:07.620> right<00:03:08.070> into<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:09.170> clip<00:03:10.170> if

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
portion that goes right into the clip if

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.160 
portion that goes right into the clip if
I<00:03:11.310> got<00:03:11.850> a<00:03:11.880> gust<00:03:12.150> of<00:03:12.240> wind<00:03:12.420> right<00:03:12.660> now<00:03:12.840> as<00:03:13.020> we

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
I got a gust of wind right now as we

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.380 
I got a gust of wind right now as we
were<00:03:13.260> speaking<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.830> wanted<00:03:14.400> unlock<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:14.940> so<00:03:15.270> the

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
were speaking I wanted unlock it so the

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.450 
were speaking I wanted unlock it so the
boat<00:03:15.570> wouldn't<00:03:15.840> tip<00:03:15.960> over<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.470> just<00:03:17.040> lift<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.340> up

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
boat wouldn't tip over I just lift it up

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.040 
boat wouldn't tip over I just lift it up
and<00:03:17.720> I<00:03:18.720> can<00:03:18.990> fall<00:03:19.410> take<00:03:19.800> all<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.220> out<00:03:21.050> right

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
and I can fall take all that out right

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.230 
and I can fall take all that out right
there<00:03:25.280> I'm<00:03:26.280> back<00:03:26.550> to<00:03:26.760> sailing

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
there I'm back to sailing

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.910 
there I'm back to sailing
so<00:03:27.680> just<00:03:28.680> lock<00:03:28.890> that<00:03:29.070> down

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.440 

but<00:03:32.520> my<00:03:32.670> excess

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
but my excess

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.950 
but my excess
and<00:03:35.200> here<00:03:35.530> in<00:03:35.680> an<00:03:35.770> orderly<00:03:36.250> fashion<00:03:36.610> so<00:03:37.000> that

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
and here in an orderly fashion so that

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.440 
and here in an orderly fashion so that
if<00:03:38.050> I<00:03:38.530> got<00:03:38.740> a<00:03:38.800> gust<00:03:39.069> of<00:03:39.220> wind<00:03:39.370> I<00:03:39.490> could<00:03:39.640> dump<00:03:40.240> the

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
if I got a gust of wind I could dump the

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.780 
if I got a gust of wind I could dump the
sail<00:03:40.660> that<00:03:41.440> boat<00:03:41.650> wouldn't<00:03:41.830> tip<00:03:42.100> over<00:03:42.400> and

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
sail that boat wouldn't tip over and

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.780 
sail that boat wouldn't tip over and
again<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.569> other<00:03:43.660> tip<00:03:43.959> is<00:03:44.430> keep<00:03:45.430> your<00:03:45.550> weight

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
again the other tip is keep your weight

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.660 
again the other tip is keep your weight
on<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.060> upwind<00:03:46.630> side<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.950> two<00:03:48.100> big<00:03:48.280> things<00:03:48.430> to

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
on the upwind side the two big things to

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.660 
on the upwind side the two big things to
not<00:03:48.790> tip<00:03:49.000> over<00:03:49.150> is<00:03:49.480> your<00:03:49.660> weight<00:03:50.340> that's<00:03:51.340> the

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
not tip over is your weight that's the

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.550 
not tip over is your weight that's the
second<00:03:52.030> most<00:03:52.060> important<00:03:52.630> and<00:03:52.750> by<00:03:53.260> far<00:03:53.530> the

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
second most important and by far the

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.550 
second most important and by far the
primary<00:03:54.220> item<00:03:54.370> is<00:03:54.840> just<00:03:55.840> be<00:03:55.959> prepared<00:03:56.350> to

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
primary item is just be prepared to

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.220 
primary item is just be prepared to
release<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.280> sail<00:03:57.520> just<00:03:57.760> do<00:03:58.270> that<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:58.959> let

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
release the sail just do that and let

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.500 
release the sail just do that and let
all<00:03:59.350> that<00:03:59.530> line<00:03:59.800> out<00:04:00.010> and<00:04:00.520> let<00:04:00.820> the<00:04:00.970> sail<00:04:01.180> flat

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
all that line out and let the sail flat

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.130 
all that line out and let the sail flat
and<00:04:03.239> there'll<00:04:04.239> be<00:04:04.300> no<00:04:04.510> way<00:04:04.660> for<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:04.900> wind<00:04:05.080> to

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
and there'll be no way for the wind to

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.320 
and there'll be no way for the wind to
tip<00:04:05.350> the<00:04:05.470> boat<00:04:05.620> over<00:04:05.670> so<00:04:06.670> that's<00:04:06.850> that's<00:04:07.120> the

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
tip the boat over so that's that's the

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.890 
tip the boat over so that's that's the
story<00:04:07.630> and<00:04:08.730> yeah<00:04:09.730> there<00:04:10.209> we<00:04:10.330> go<00:04:10.360> doing<00:04:12.900> about
