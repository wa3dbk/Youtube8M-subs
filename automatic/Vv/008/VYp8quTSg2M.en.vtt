when<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:33.810> go<00:02:33.990> through<00:02:34.230> Corian<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.490> notice<00:02:35.880> it

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
when you go through Corian you notice it

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.630 
when you go through Corian you notice it
went<00:02:36.270> down<00:02:36.480> hard<00:02:36.870> but<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:37.800> doesn't<00:02:38.190> hurt<00:02:38.400> the

just get done drilling and as you can
see<00:02:48.840> it's<00:02:49.080> a<00:02:49.200> perfectly<00:02:49.740> round<00:02:49.980> hole<00:02:50.270> it<00:02:51.270> went

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
see it's a perfectly round hole it went

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.410 
see it's a perfectly round hole it went
down<00:02:51.959> nice<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.500> smooth<00:02:52.770> now<00:02:53.700> I'm<00:02:53.880> gonna<00:02:54.120> do

another<00:02:55.110> couple<00:02:55.440> series<00:02:56.130> of<00:02:56.310> holes<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:56.970> the

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
another couple series of holes and the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
these holes are going to be close

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.970 
these holes are going to be close
together<00:03:05.130> so<00:03:06.050> let<00:03:07.050> me<00:03:07.170> get<00:03:07.320> to<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.620> other<00:03:07.739> side

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
together so let me get to the other side

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.600 
together so let me get to the other side
of<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.190> camera<00:03:09.470> okay<00:03:10.470> this<00:03:10.830> guy's<00:03:11.070> drilling

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
of the camera okay this guy's drilling

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:56.830 
of the camera okay this guy's drilling
the<00:03:11.850> second<00:03:12.270> hole

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.510 

these<00:03:57.840> are<00:03:58.080> not<00:03:58.230> separated<00:03:59.040> they<00:03:59.190> are<00:03:59.310> not

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
these are not separated they are not

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.460 
these are not separated they are not
broke<00:03:59.820> they're<00:04:00.390> just<00:04:00.690> two<00:04:00.870> holes<00:04:01.140> that<00:04:01.350> are

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
broke they're just two holes that are

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.470 
broke they're just two holes that are
very<00:04:01.800> close<00:04:02.130> together<00:04:02.550> there's<00:04:02.820> no<00:04:03.030> reason

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
very close together there's no reason

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.780 
very close together there's no reason
why<00:04:03.630> any<00:04:04.020> time<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:04.800> would<00:04:04.980> need<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.340> have<00:04:05.520> two

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
why any time you would need to have two

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.420 
why any time you would need to have two
holes<00:04:06.030> as<00:04:06.360> close<00:04:06.600> together<00:04:07.050> but<00:04:07.800> it's<00:04:08.010> to<00:04:08.190> show

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
holes as close together but it's to show

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.030 
holes as close together but it's to show
you<00:04:08.490> the<00:04:08.850> strength<00:04:09.180> of<00:04:09.450> Corian<00:04:09.990> and<00:04:10.140> how<00:04:10.800> these

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
you the strength of Corian and how these

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.730 
you the strength of Corian and how these
holes<00:04:11.400> can<00:04:11.790> be<00:04:12.060> drilled<00:04:12.240> and<00:04:12.750> there's<00:04:13.350> no<00:04:13.530> need

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
holes can be drilled and there's no need

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.560 
holes can be drilled and there's no need
for<00:04:14.040> anybody<00:04:14.220> to<00:04:14.460> be<00:04:14.670> scared<00:04:15.030> about<00:04:15.240> drilling

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
for anybody to be scared about drilling

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:27.260 
for anybody to be scared about drilling
a<00:04:15.750> hole<00:04:22.430> I'll<00:04:23.430> drill<00:04:24.210> a<00:04:24.240> few<00:04:24.480> more<00:04:24.540> holes<00:04:24.720> now
