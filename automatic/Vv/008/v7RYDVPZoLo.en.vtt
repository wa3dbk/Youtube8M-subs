 "The true durability of cooking oils" 

00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:07.076
 When you look at oil bottles at a grocery store 

00:00:07.076 --> 00:00:09.237
 have the expiration date specified 

00:00:09.237 --> 00:00:13.217
 which recommends to consumers when they should consume oils before they rancle 

00:00:13.217 --> 00:00:14.906
 and create oxidation products 

00:00:14.906 --> 00:00:18.505
 which can be particularly harmful to human health. 

00:00:18.505 --> 00:00:22.161
 Here are the consumption dates for eight edible oils: 

00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:26.093
 almond oil, avocado oil, hazelnut oil, macadamia, 

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:30.239
 rice bran, roasted sesame and walnuts. 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.838
 These are recommended consumption dates in months 

00:00:33.838 --> 00:00:36.017
 calculated from the date of manufacture of the oil. 

00:00:36.017 --> 00:00:40.585
 So if you make a batch of walnut oil on January 1, 2012 

00:00:40.585 --> 00:00:42.535
 the expiry date printed on the vial 

00:00:42.535 --> 00:00:47.245
 this batch will be 12 months later - 1 January 2013. 

00:00:47.245 --> 00:00:49.993
 But the precondition is to adhere to strict rules. 

00:00:49.993 --> 00:00:53.115
 The oil must be stored in the refrigerator 

00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:56.277
 in an airtight, dark container so that it is not exposed to air, 

00:00:56.277 --> 00:00:57.840
 room temperature or light - 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.284
 especially after opening. 

00:01:00.284 --> 00:01:01.993
 These scientists were skeptical about 

00:01:01.993 --> 00:01:04.717
 to what extent manufacturers state the exact terms. 

00:01:04.717 --> 00:01:06.516
 So all these oils were tested, 

00:01:06.516 --> 00:01:10.742
 to find out what their durability is. 

00:01:10.742 --> 00:01:13.039
 Does this match what manufacturers claim? 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:14.947
 They do not deliberately prolong the consumption period 

00:01:14.947 --> 00:01:18.118
 to make it look like the oils are more stable than they actually are? 

00:01:18.118 --> 00:01:20.755
 Or maybe they shorten the time, 

00:01:20.755 --> 00:01:25.464
 people buy their product more often? 

00:01:25.464 --> 00:01:28.218
 For rice bran oil, the company reported seven months. 

00:01:28.218 --> 00:01:31.999
 And the actual estimated shelf life found in the tests? 

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:33.350
 6,5 months. 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.142
 Not bad, it's close enough. 

00:01:35.142 --> 00:01:37.913
 In some cases, however, reality has been shifted in one direction; 

00:01:37.913 --> 00:01:39.844
 with others in the other direction. 

00:01:39.844 --> 00:01:41.564
 For example, almond oil. 

00:01:41.564 --> 00:01:43.406
 They said they would last more than a year 

00:01:43.406 --> 00:01:46.631
 but in fact he was only three months old. 

00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:49.375
 And remember, it was three months in the refrigerator, in the dark - 

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:53.504
 and from the date of manufacture, not after purchase. 

00:01:53.504 --> 00:01:56.871
 Walnut and macadamia oils have reached extreme values. 

00:01:56.871 --> 00:02:00.627
 Macadamia oil lasted longest; over a year. 

00:02:00.627 --> 00:02:03.753
 The manufacturer has completely underestimated its stability. 

00:02:03.753 --> 00:02:06.181
 But walnut oils gave a year 

00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:11.173
 and he only lasted two and a half weeks - 

00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:18.495
 according to rancidity testing of rancidity.
