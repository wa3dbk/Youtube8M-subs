00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.599
 hello I was once show how I mean 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.340
 I know that always tomato sauce 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.289
 all claiming they could finish 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.270
 Buy and it would be just as good and the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.220
 TV heart he is always with 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.900
 In my opinion, that is nonsense 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.420
 nothing is better if it is yourself 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.830
 made tomato sauce and just when you are 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.160
 want to lose weight is a tomato sauce 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.570
 great because it is a sauce that is not 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.020
 fat or if you have a bit of olive oil 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.210
 driving still contains very little fat and 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.399
 It's also very easy to do 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.800
 I have here as I only need me 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.090
 the tomatoes i have theme three kilo one 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.710
 I can also take more or less 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.379
 have three kilo ralf than wear again 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.239
 tried in a pot 1 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.100
 a board and as sharp as possible 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.520
 knife vending machine then equal to 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.520
 bisect 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.470
 it is very simple I cut you the 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.890
 tomatoes 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.620
 so that's through and pushing her over 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.480
 a drip that is the one 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.700
 tomato juice a bit on the ground 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.850
 that's what prevents the tomatoes from us 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:20.120
 my master apparently everything in it now 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:22.900
 a few then I can do that too 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.900
 switch on stove 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:10.690
 All are kept in it 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.230
 lid on it and 15 to 20 minutes 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.230
 let cook 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:20.340
 the tomatoes now have a good 20 minutes 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:23.160
 cooked and now you can tell 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.680
 then when the peel comes off and she 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.650
 everything seems very soft 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.360
 Now I'm looking forward to a speedy lotte 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.610
 the tomatoes come in there then then 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.950
 is counted and comes down that 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.290
 tomatoes out willi kern have the 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:46.280
 shell will stay in the vessel here 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:46.280
 purely protect the Rhine shipping in it 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.630
 all at once 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:29.129
 it stays that way, she knows below 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.700
 You can still hang tomato paste now 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.700
 still look 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.000
 That's the finished tomato sauce 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.230
 you can either use it right away 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.209
 to cook something just like in 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.470
 tomato sauce of spaghetti bolognese or 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.630
 something similar you can drink it often 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.850
 tastes extremely delicious and then too 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:01.100
 again 0 ports are only tomatoes in it 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.200
 and one or freezes them for later 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.860
 I always have a bit of a bottleneck 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.050
 deep in the freezer and is 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.850
 so as always a tomato sauce 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.480
 einkocht that shows you then in 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.480
