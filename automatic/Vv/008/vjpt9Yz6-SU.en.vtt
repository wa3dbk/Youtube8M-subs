00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.360 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.519 

well<00:00:28.360> now<00:00:28.599> you<00:00:28.660> should<00:00:28.960> be<00:00:28.989> asking<00:00:29.439> yourself

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
well now you should be asking yourself

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.249 
well now you should be asking yourself
why<00:00:30.130> for<00:00:30.700> hip<00:00:30.910> still<00:00:31.150> goes<00:00:31.300> but<00:00:31.660> they<00:00:32.200> are

battery hipster doll the same hipster
died<00:00:37.149> I<00:00:37.360> made<00:00:37.780> some<00:00:38.050> agro<00:00:38.440> and<00:00:38.649> etc<00:00:39.100> but<00:00:40.059> this

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
died I made some agro and etc but this

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.070 
died I made some agro and etc but this
door<00:00:41.280> has<00:00:42.280> something<00:00:42.820> special<00:00:43.270> let<00:00:43.660> me<00:00:43.870> show

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.080 
door has something special let me show

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.880 
door has something special let me show
you

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
you

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.520 
you
so<00:00:46.670> this<00:00:46.970> is<00:00:47.150> the<00:00:47.300> wiring<00:00:47.570> this<00:00:48.050> is<00:00:48.230> the<00:00:48.380> most

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
so this is the wiring this is the most

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.160 
so this is the wiring this is the most
compact<00:00:49.040> 2x2<00:00:49.550> hipsters<00:00:50.120> are<00:00:50.210> working<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:50.870> the

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
compact 2x2 hipsters are working and the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.060 
compact 2x2 hipsters are working and the
size<00:00:51.380> is<00:00:51.410> 5<00:00:51.950> by<00:00:52.130> 5<00:00:52.310> by<00:00:52.520> 10<00:00:52.730> or<00:00:53.650> 250<00:00:54.650> blocks<00:00:54.920> in

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
size is 5 by 5 by 10 or 250 blocks in

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.540 
size is 5 by 5 by 10 or 250 blocks in
total<00:00:55.430> not<00:00:56.000> only<00:00:56.390> that<00:00:56.600> but<00:00:56.870> it's<00:00:57.170> also<00:00:57.550> button

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
total not only that but it's also button

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.370 
total not only that but it's also button
activated<00:01:00.910> what<00:01:01.910> allowed<00:01:02.210> me<00:01:02.239> to<00:01:02.390> do<00:01:02.780> that<00:01:02.989> was

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
activated what allowed me to do that was

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.130 
activated what allowed me to do that was
the<00:01:03.590> double<00:01:03.830> box<00:01:03.950> sender<00:01:04.309> use<00:01:04.940> both<00:01:05.420> in<00:01:05.750> the

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
the double box sender use both in the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.469 
the double box sender use both in the
opening<00:01:06.560> and<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:06.890> closing<00:01:06.920> the<00:01:07.910> rest<00:01:08.150> of<00:01:08.330> the

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
opening and the closing the rest of the

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.219 
opening and the closing the rest of the
circuit<00:01:08.960> use<00:01:09.500> this<00:01:09.920> T<00:01:10.520> flip-flop<00:01:10.760> so<00:01:11.630> it<00:01:11.960> only

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
circuit use this T flip-flop so it only

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.620 
circuit use this T flip-flop so it only
activates<00:01:12.650> on<00:01:13.220> the<00:01:13.460> second<00:01:13.850> time<00:01:14.030> you<00:01:14.390> press

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
activates on the second time you press

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:31.870 
activates on the second time you press
the<00:01:14.780> button<00:01:29.740> but<00:01:30.740> now<00:01:30.950> if<00:01:31.190> you<00:01:31.369> haven't<00:01:31.729> slept

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
the button but now if you haven't slept

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.420 
the button but now if you haven't slept
with<00:01:32.180> my<00:01:32.540> bar<00:01:32.750> in<00:01:32.869> talking<00:01:33.140> let's<00:01:33.860> go<00:01:34.070> with<00:01:34.280> the
