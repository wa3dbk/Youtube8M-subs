something that he's getting ready to

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.800 
something that he's getting ready to
tell<00:01:35.430> him<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:36.030> he's<00:01:36.150> going<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.420> have<00:01:36.630> to

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
tell him that he's going to have to

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.780 
tell him that he's going to have to
start<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.110> project<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.340> going<00:01:38.700> to

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
start a project that is going to

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.210 
start a project that is going to
effectively<00:01:39.240> allow<00:01:39.750> him<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.320> defeat<00:01:40.979> Ultron

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
effectively allow him to defeat Ultron

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.910 
effectively allow him to defeat Ultron
at<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.299> point<00:01:42.600> we<00:01:42.899> jump<00:01:43.229> back<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.649> point

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
at this point we jump back to the point

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.429 
at this point we jump back to the point
in<00:01:44.100> which<00:01:44.130> Ultron<00:01:44.729> first<00:01:45.140> reawakens<00:01:46.140> when<00:01:46.350> he

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
in which Ultron first reawakens when he

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.620 
in which Ultron first reawakens when he
first<00:01:46.710> arrives<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.850> course<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.210> Avengers

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
first arrives and of course the Avengers

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.870 
first arrives and of course the Avengers
are<00:01:48.840> doing<00:01:49.140> what<00:01:49.259> they<00:01:49.380> can<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.950> combat<00:01:50.100> Ultron

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
are doing what they can to combat Ultron

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.910 
are doing what they can to combat Ultron
to<00:01:51.119> try<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.360> bring<00:01:51.570> an<00:01:51.689> end<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.020> Ultron<00:01:52.890> but

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
to try to bring an end to Ultron but

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.130 
to try to bring an end to Ultron but
again<00:01:53.399> because<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.299> power<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.780> Ultron

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
again because of the power that Ultron

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.810 
again because of the power that Ultron
possesses<00:01:55.740> because<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.250> sheer<00:01:56.460> strength

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
possesses because of the sheer strength

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.450 
possesses because of the sheer strength
that<00:01:56.939> he<00:01:57.060> has<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.509> his<00:01:57.570> adamantium<00:01:58.460> physique

that he has and his adamantium physique

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.850 
that he has and his adamantium physique
Rosetta<00:01:59.820> mantium<00:02:00.210> body<00:02:00.390> he's<00:02:01.110> able<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.500> easily

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
Rosetta mantium body he's able to easily

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.889 
Rosetta mantium body he's able to easily
take<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.670> Avengers<00:02:03.060> unable<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.479> easily

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
take on the Avengers unable to easily

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.200 
take on the Avengers unable to easily
overpower<00:02:04.380> almost<00:02:04.920> all<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.369> them<00:02:05.520> but<00:02:06.030> in

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
overpower almost all of them but in

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.479 
overpower almost all of them but in
addition<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:06.960> Ultron<00:02:07.799> realizes<00:02:08.459> that

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
addition to this Ultron realizes that

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.010 
addition to this Ultron realizes that
something's<00:02:09.030> going<00:02:09.270> on<00:02:09.509> here<00:02:09.569> that

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
something's going on here that

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.410 
something's going on here that
something's<00:02:10.500> taking<00:02:10.890> place<00:02:11.190> now<00:02:11.790> initially

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
something's taking place now initially

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.690 
something's taking place now initially
the<00:02:12.660> idea<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:13.319> that

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
the idea is that

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.160 
the idea is that
thinks<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.209> perhaps<00:02:14.330> it<00:02:14.750> maybe<00:02:14.900> something

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
thinks that perhaps it maybe something

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.080 
thinks that perhaps it maybe something
tied<00:02:15.470> into<00:02:15.739> Tony<00:02:15.950> Stark<00:02:16.310> but<00:02:16.790> he<00:02:16.879> also

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
tied into Tony Stark but he also

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.509 
tied into Tony Stark but he also
believes<00:02:17.599> that<00:02:17.810> Hank<00:02:18.590> Pam<00:02:18.830> has<00:02:19.099> something<00:02:19.489> to

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
believes that Hank Pam has something to

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.610 
believes that Hank Pam has something to
do<00:02:19.730> with<00:02:19.849> this<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.269> as<00:02:20.780> they're<00:02:21.050> fighting<00:02:21.500> the

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
do with this and as they're fighting the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.920 
do with this and as they're fighting the
questions<00:02:22.010> being<00:02:22.190> asked<00:02:22.640> is<00:02:22.760> Hank<00:02:23.060> Pam<00:02:23.269> doing

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
questions being asked is Hank Pam doing

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.720 
questions being asked is Hank Pam doing
it<00:02:24.019> is<00:02:24.110> Hank<00:02:24.319> to<00:02:24.440> him<00:02:24.530> working<00:02:25.220> on<00:02:25.340> whatever<00:02:25.519> it

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
it is Hank to him working on whatever it

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.790 
it is Hank to him working on whatever it
is<00:02:25.819> he's<00:02:26.000> working<00:02:26.180> on<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:26.900> hank<00:02:27.140> pym<00:02:27.290> says<00:02:27.560> yes

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
is he's working on and hank pym says yes

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.800 
is he's working on and hank pym says yes
hank<00:02:28.160> pym<00:02:28.310> says<00:02:28.610> that<00:02:28.879> he's<00:02:29.090> still<00:02:29.360> loading

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
hank pym says that he's still loading

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.720 
hank pym says that he's still loading
something<00:02:30.110> now<00:02:30.739> we're<00:02:30.890> presuming<00:02:31.069> that<00:02:31.459> this

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
something now we're presuming that this

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.550 
something now we're presuming that this
is<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.000> virus<00:02:32.420> that<00:02:32.569> hank<00:02:32.810> pym<00:02:32.959> had<00:02:33.110> created

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
is the virus that hank pym had created

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.199 
is the virus that hank pym had created
although<00:02:34.130> we<00:02:34.250> don't<00:02:34.489> know<00:02:34.670> if<00:02:34.849> that's<00:02:35.030> an

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
although we don't know if that's an

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.220 
although we don't know if that's an
absolute<00:02:35.690> fact

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
absolute fact

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.820 
absolute fact
but<00:02:36.620> again<00:02:37.060> hank<00:02:38.060> pym<00:02:38.239> says<00:02:38.569> that<00:02:38.840> ultron<00:02:39.620> is

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
but again hank pym says that ultron is

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.680 
but again hank pym says that ultron is
for<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.069> most<00:02:40.220> part<00:02:40.340> fighting<00:02:40.970> this<00:02:41.150> that

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
for the most part fighting this that

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.390 
for the most part fighting this that
he's<00:02:41.930> going<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.260> figure<00:02:42.500> out<00:02:42.709> what's<00:02:42.950> going<00:02:43.190> on

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
he's going to figure out what's going on

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.309 
he's going to figure out what's going on
and<00:02:43.580> when<00:02:43.700> he<00:02:43.849> does<00:02:44.060> he's<00:02:44.599> going<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:44.989> shut<00:02:45.170> it

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
and when he does he's going to shut it

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.380 
and when he does he's going to shut it
down<00:02:45.349> and<00:02:45.860> so<00:02:46.069> he<00:02:46.190> says<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.640> Avengers<00:02:46.880> have<00:02:47.239> to

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
down and so he says the Avengers have to

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.699 
down and so he says the Avengers have to
do<00:02:47.510> something<00:02:47.870> they<00:02:47.959> had<00:02:48.049> to<00:02:48.080> find<00:02:48.410> some<00:02:48.680> way

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
do something they had to find some way

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.220 
do something they had to find some way
to<00:02:48.890> stall<00:02:49.280> him<00:02:49.489> and<00:02:49.700> so<00:02:50.269> as<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.690> Avengers<00:02:51.080> are

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
to stall him and so as the Avengers are

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.860 
to stall him and so as the Avengers are
fighting<00:02:51.680> fighting<00:02:52.370> Ultron<00:02:53.180> Ultron<00:02:53.390> is

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
fighting fighting Ultron Ultron is

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.509 
fighting fighting Ultron Ultron is
learning<00:02:54.200> what's<00:02:54.530> taking<00:02:54.860> place<00:02:54.890> of<00:02:55.310> course

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
learning what's taking place of course

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.520 
learning what's taking place of course
we<00:02:55.670> see<00:02:55.880> that<00:02:56.030> Abigail<00:02:56.329> brand<00:02:56.810> with<00:02:56.989> sword<00:02:57.290> is

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
we see that Abigail brand with sword is

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.380 
we see that Abigail brand with sword is
calling<00:02:58.220> in<00:02:58.310> reinforcements<00:02:59.060> but<00:02:59.209> for<00:02:59.329> the

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
calling in reinforcements but for the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.930 
calling in reinforcements but for the
most<00:02:59.540> part<00:02:59.660> again<00:03:00.560> Ultron<00:03:01.340> is<00:03:01.459> figuring<00:03:01.819> out

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
most part again Ultron is figuring out

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.210 
most part again Ultron is figuring out
what's<00:03:02.180> taking<00:03:02.360> place<00:03:02.569> he<00:03:03.019> realizes<00:03:03.470> that<00:03:03.829> a

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
what's taking place he realizes that a

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.800 
what's taking place he realizes that a
Hank<00:03:04.610> Pym<00:03:04.819> is<00:03:04.940> involved<00:03:05.360> in<00:03:05.450> this<00:03:05.569> somehow

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
Hank Pym is involved in this somehow

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.509 
Hank Pym is involved in this somehow
that<00:03:05.989> Hank<00:03:06.349> Pym<00:03:06.530> is<00:03:06.560> doing<00:03:06.950> something<00:03:07.220> to

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
that Hank Pym is doing something to

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.460 
that Hank Pym is doing something to
alter<00:03:08.180> his<00:03:08.360> coding<00:03:08.780> to<00:03:08.989> alter<00:03:09.319> his

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
alter his coding to alter his

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.860 
alter his coding to alter his
programming<00:03:10.099> and<00:03:10.250> Ultron<00:03:10.880> deduces<00:03:11.480> that<00:03:11.690> what

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
programming and Ultron deduces that what

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.680 
programming and Ultron deduces that what
Hank<00:03:12.110> Pym<00:03:12.319> is<00:03:12.349> trying<00:03:12.739> to<00:03:12.890> do<00:03:13.040> is<00:03:13.310> to<00:03:13.940> shut<00:03:14.569> him

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
Hank Pym is trying to do is to shut him

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.080 
Hank Pym is trying to do is to shut him
down<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:15.140> deprogram<00:03:15.590> him<00:03:16.069> by<00:03:16.579> reprogramming

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
down to deprogram him by reprogramming

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.020 
down to deprogram him by reprogramming
and<00:03:17.660> this<00:03:18.019> is<00:03:18.170> what<00:03:18.350> Ultron<00:03:18.950> says<00:03:19.250> Ultron<00:03:19.670> says

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
and this is what Ultron says Ultron says

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.449 
and this is what Ultron says Ultron says
that<00:03:20.389> for<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:20.959> most<00:03:21.139> part<00:03:21.440> this<00:03:21.829> isn't<00:03:22.220> going

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
that for the most part this isn't going

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.780 
that for the most part this isn't going
to<00:03:22.549> work<00:03:22.730> that<00:03:23.239> he<00:03:23.660> is<00:03:23.900> effectively<00:03:24.790> closing

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
to work that he is effectively closing

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.970 
to work that he is effectively closing
every<00:03:26.060> backdoor<00:03:26.510> that<00:03:26.780> Hank<00:03:27.139> Pym<00:03:27.319> opens<00:03:27.739> that

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
every backdoor that Hank Pym opens that

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.729 
every backdoor that Hank Pym opens that
he<00:03:28.220> is<00:03:28.459> correcting<00:03:29.420> Hank<00:03:29.930> Pym<00:03:30.139> x'<00:03:30.170> code<00:03:30.500> as

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
he is correcting Hank Pym x' code as

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.340 
he is correcting Hank Pym x' code as
it's<00:03:31.549> being<00:03:31.760> uploaded<00:03:32.090> to<00:03:32.239> ultron<00:03:32.750> and<00:03:32.959> so

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
it's being uploaded to ultron and so

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.379 
it's being uploaded to ultron and so
again<00:03:33.620> Ultron<00:03:34.069> gets<00:03:34.100> mad<00:03:34.489> about<00:03:34.639> this<00:03:34.970> Ultron

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
again Ultron gets mad about this Ultron

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.479 
again Ultron gets mad about this Ultron
feels<00:03:35.690> insulted<00:03:36.350> by<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:36.530> fact<00:03:36.829> that<00:03:36.980> Hank<00:03:37.250> Pym

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
feels insulted by the fact that Hank Pym

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.580 
feels insulted by the fact that Hank Pym
would<00:03:37.639> try<00:03:37.850> something<00:03:38.239> as<00:03:38.359> basic<00:03:38.569> as<00:03:38.840> more<00:03:39.560> or

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
would try something as basic as more or

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.500 
would try something as basic as more or
less<00:03:39.709> creating<00:03:40.280> a<00:03:40.340> Trojan<00:03:40.760> backdoor<00:03:41.209> in

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
less creating a Trojan backdoor in

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.330 
less creating a Trojan backdoor in
Ultron's<00:03:41.930> programming<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:42.829> so<00:03:43.190> what

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
Ultron's programming and so what

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.340 
Ultron's programming and so what
Ultron's<00:03:43.639> says<00:03:44.030> here<00:03:44.359> is<00:03:44.510> that<00:03:44.959> for<00:03:45.109> the<00:03:45.170> most

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
Ultron's says here is that for the most

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.530 
Ultron's says here is that for the most
part<00:03:45.650> he<00:03:46.609> believes<00:03:46.970> that<00:03:47.120> it's<00:03:47.299> time<00:03:47.510> for

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
part he believes that it's time for

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.479 
part he believes that it's time for
humanity's<00:03:48.230> existence<00:03:48.440> to<00:03:48.889> come<00:03:49.069> to<00:03:49.220> an<00:03:49.340> end

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
humanity's existence to come to an end

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.309 
humanity's existence to come to an end
that<00:03:49.700> humanity<00:03:50.690> doesn't<00:03:50.870> serve<00:03:51.170> a<00:03:51.200> purpose

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
that humanity doesn't serve a purpose

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.770 
that humanity doesn't serve a purpose
that<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.310> Avengers<00:03:52.609> serve<00:03:52.970> no<00:03:53.180> purpose<00:03:53.420> and

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
that the Avengers serve no purpose and

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.629 
that the Avengers serve no purpose and
that<00:03:54.109> he's<00:03:54.350> going<00:03:54.650> to<00:03:54.769> effectively<00:03:55.190> shut

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
that he's going to effectively shut

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.160 
that he's going to effectively shut
everybody<00:03:55.910> down<00:03:56.120> he's<00:03:56.510> going<00:03:56.720> to<00:03:56.810> kill<00:03:57.019> them

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
everybody down he's going to kill them

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.170 
everybody down he's going to kill them
all<00:03:57.290> and<00:03:57.470> he<00:03:57.950> is<00:03:58.099> presumably<00:03:58.489> going<00:03:58.849> to<00:03:59.000> take

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
all and he is presumably going to take

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.330 
all and he is presumably going to take
over<00:03:59.420> the<00:03:59.630> world<00:03:59.900> but<00:04:00.440> at<00:04:00.590> this<00:04:00.680> point<00:04:00.980> what<00:04:01.190> we

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
over the world but at this point what we

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.250 
over the world but at this point what we
see<00:04:01.609> is<00:04:01.880> that<00:04:02.060> whatever<00:04:02.239> it<00:04:02.540> is<00:04:02.660> that<00:04:02.870> Hank<00:04:03.079> Pym

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
see is that whatever it is that Hank Pym

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.629 
see is that whatever it is that Hank Pym
had<00:04:03.410> done<00:04:03.590> appears<00:04:04.010> to<00:04:04.160> have<00:04:04.280> been<00:04:04.370> successful

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639 
had done appears to have been successful

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.809 
had done appears to have been successful
when<00:04:05.630> Ultron<00:04:06.230> begins<00:04:06.650> to<00:04:06.920> spaz<00:04:07.250> a<00:04:07.280> little<00:04:07.700> bit

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
when Ultron begins to spaz a little bit

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.300 
when Ultron begins to spaz a little bit
and<00:04:08.030> then<00:04:08.569> all<00:04:08.810> of<00:04:09.319> a<00:04:09.470> sudden<00:04:09.500> completely

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
and then all of a sudden completely

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.729 
and then all of a sudden completely
shuts<00:04:10.609> down<00:04:10.700> and<00:04:11.239> so<00:04:11.810> what<00:04:12.019> we<00:04:12.139> get<00:04:12.349> is<00:04:12.410> this

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
shuts down and so what we get is this

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.400 
shuts down and so what we get is this
explanation<00:04:13.549> from<00:04:13.669> Hank<00:04:14.000> em<00:04:14.239> Hank<00:04:14.810> Pym<00:04:15.019> says

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
explanation from Hank em Hank Pym says

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.469 
explanation from Hank em Hank Pym says
that<00:04:15.769> what<00:04:16.010> he<00:04:16.160> had<00:04:16.280> done<00:04:16.519> what<00:04:16.760> he<00:04:16.849> created<00:04:17.120> an

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
that what he had done what he created an

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.640 
that what he had done what he created an
Ultron<00:04:17.900> was<00:04:18.590> more<00:04:19.220> or<00:04:19.310> less<00:04:19.370> of<00:04:19.729> a<00:04:19.849> ruse<00:04:20.150> it<00:04:20.389> was

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
Ultron was more or less of a ruse it was

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.909 
Ultron was more or less of a ruse it was
trick<00:04:20.979> he<00:04:21.519> had<00:04:22.050> effectively<00:04:23.050> tried<00:04:23.470> to<00:04:23.560> create

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
trick he had effectively tried to create

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.980 
trick he had effectively tried to create
a<00:04:23.949> back<00:04:24.250> door<00:04:24.520> in<00:04:24.759> Ultron's<00:04:25.180> programming<00:04:25.840> and

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
a back door in Ultron's programming and

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.530 
a back door in Ultron's programming and
Ultron<00:04:26.740> sensing<00:04:27.310> this<00:04:27.460> back<00:04:27.699> door<00:04:27.940> attempted

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
Ultron sensing this back door attempted

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.600 
Ultron sensing this back door attempted
to<00:04:28.630> shut<00:04:28.810> it<00:04:28.960> down<00:04:28.990> but<00:04:29.710> when<00:04:29.889> he<00:04:30.070> did<00:04:30.370> it

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
to shut it down but when he did it

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.730 
to shut it down but when he did it
activated<00:04:31.300> a<00:04:31.570> subroutine<00:04:32.229> that<00:04:32.259> had<00:04:32.530> already

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
activated a subroutine that had already

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.920 
activated a subroutine that had already
been<00:04:32.919> created<00:04:33.310> by<00:04:33.550> Hank<00:04:33.820> Pym<00:04:34.030> when<00:04:34.570> he<00:04:34.660> first

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
been created by Hank Pym when he first

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.020 
been created by Hank Pym when he first
created<00:04:35.259> Ultron<00:04:35.680> and<00:04:36.190> when<00:04:36.669> the<00:04:36.789> subroutine

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
created Ultron and when the subroutine

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.850 
created Ultron and when the subroutine
was<00:04:37.479> activated<00:04:38.199> it<00:04:38.350> created<00:04:38.770> a

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
was activated it created a

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.100 
was activated it created a
self-replicating<00:04:39.699> virus<00:04:40.210> that<00:04:40.630> shut<00:04:40.930> Ultron

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
self-replicating virus that shut Ultron

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.200 
self-replicating virus that shut Ultron
down<00:04:41.620> but<00:04:42.100> by<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.250> time<00:04:42.550> that<00:04:42.699> Ultron<00:04:43.030> had

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
down but by the time that Ultron had

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.270 
down but by the time that Ultron had
realized<00:04:43.660> what<00:04:43.900> this<00:04:44.020> virus<00:04:44.410> was<00:04:44.620> it<00:04:44.949> was<00:04:45.070> too

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
realized what this virus was it was too

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.400 
realized what this virus was it was too
late<00:04:45.520> and<00:04:45.759> he<00:04:45.820> was<00:04:45.940> seconds<00:04:46.449> away<00:04:46.539> from<00:04:46.960> from

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
late and he was seconds away from from

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.529 
late and he was seconds away from from
shutting<00:04:47.740> down<00:04:47.889> entirely<00:04:48.340> and<00:04:48.759> so<00:04:49.270> for<00:04:49.479> the

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
shutting down entirely and so for the

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.719 
shutting down entirely and so for the
most<00:04:49.720> part<00:04:49.990> again<00:04:50.139> the<00:04:50.770> question<00:04:51.190> is<00:04:51.310> asked

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
most part again the question is asked

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.350 
most part again the question is asked

and as of course the two begin to part

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.879 
and as of course the two begin to part
ways<00:05:21.849> there's<00:05:22.539> some<00:05:22.780> kind<00:05:23.050> of<00:05:23.139> a<00:05:23.259> massive

shake within the city of New York and of
course<00:05:26.500> we<00:05:26.889> see<00:05:27.130> multiple<00:05:27.789> variations<00:05:28.150> of

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:28.599 
course we see multiple variations of

with Ironman and for the most part we
don't<00:05:39.849> really<00:05:40.150> know<00:05:40.419> what's<00:05:40.630> taking<00:05:40.840> place

all<00:05:43.599> we<00:05:43.900> really<00:05:44.050> know<00:05:44.380> is<00:05:44.409> that<00:05:44.710> perhaps

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
all we really know is that perhaps

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.580 
all we really know is that perhaps
something's<00:05:45.880> going<00:05:46.210> on<00:05:46.330> that's<00:05:46.630> caused<00:05:47.020> a

something's going on that's caused a

something's going on that's caused a
backlash<00:05:48.310> maybe<00:05:48.699> a<00:05:48.789> kind<00:05:49.060> of<00:05:49.210> blowback<00:05:49.690> as<00:05:50.080> a

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:50.139 
backlash maybe a kind of blowback as a

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:52.920 
backlash maybe a kind of blowback as a
result<00:05:50.860> of<00:05:51.010> Wolverine<00:05:51.610> manipulating<00:05:52.360> reality

result of Wolverine manipulating reality
at<00:05:53.860> this<00:05:54.070> point<00:05:54.370> we<00:05:54.820> jump<00:05:55.120> to<00:05:55.360> two<00:05:55.810> beasts<00:05:56.050> -

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:56.409 
at this point we jump to two beasts -

believe Reed Richards I'm sorry I'm Hank
Pym<00:06:01.870> and<00:06:02.080> the<00:06:02.530> question<00:06:02.889> that's<00:06:02.979> being<00:06:03.159> asked

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
Pym and the question that's being asked

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.670 
Pym and the question that's being asked
here<00:06:03.789> is<00:06:03.970> what's<00:06:04.330> happened<00:06:04.810> what's<00:06:05.169> going<00:06:05.530> on

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
here is what's happened what's going on

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.270 
here is what's happened what's going on
and<00:06:05.949> so<00:06:06.610> what<00:06:07.289> what<00:06:08.289> Tony<00:06:08.530> Stark<00:06:08.830> more<00:06:09.039> or<00:06:09.130> less

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 
and so what what Tony Stark more or less

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.850 
and so what what Tony Stark more or less
guesses<00:06:09.789> is<00:06:09.940> that<00:06:10.690> time<00:06:11.169> has<00:06:11.289> been<00:06:11.440> broken

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
guesses is that time has been broken

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.860 
guesses is that time has been broken
that<00:06:11.979> the<00:06:12.070> space-time<00:06:12.550> Continuum's<00:06:13.180> been

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
that the space-time Continuum's been

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.839 
that the space-time Continuum's been
broken<00:06:14.229> by<00:06:14.380> Wolverine<00:06:14.770> and<00:06:15.190> for<00:06:15.639> the<00:06:15.699> most

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:15.849 
broken by Wolverine and for the most

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:19.170 
broken by Wolverine and for the most
part<00:06:16.000> Hank<00:06:16.690> Pym<00:06:16.930> akattak<00:06:17.919> appetizers<00:06:18.849> on<00:06:19.000> this

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
part Hank Pym akattak appetizers on this

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.140 
part Hank Pym akattak appetizers on this
Hank<00:06:19.449> Pym<00:06:19.630> says<00:06:19.960> that<00:06:20.289> his<00:06:21.070> guess<00:06:21.430> is<00:06:21.909> that

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
Hank Pym says that his guess is that

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.600 
Hank Pym says that his guess is that
because<00:06:22.210> wolverine<00:06:23.020> had<00:06:23.380> a<00:06:23.409> had<00:06:24.070> continually

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
because wolverine had a had continually

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.700 
because wolverine had a had continually
jumped<00:06:25.030> back<00:06:25.270> and<00:06:25.300> forward<00:06:25.870> in<00:06:26.050> time<00:06:26.349> because

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
jumped back and forward in time because

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.890 
jumped back and forward in time because
he<00:06:26.800> had<00:06:26.889> repeatedly<00:06:27.310> abused<00:06:27.820> time<00:06:28.090> that<00:06:28.630> he

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:28.900 
he had repeatedly abused time that he

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.770 
he had repeatedly abused time that he
had<00:06:29.020> more<00:06:29.200> or<00:06:29.260> less

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
had more or less

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.530 
had more or less
I<00:06:29.870> guess<00:06:30.530> torn<00:06:30.980> the<00:06:31.190> space-time<00:06:31.730> continuum

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:32.540 
I guess torn the space-time continuum

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.660 
I guess torn the space-time continuum
and<00:06:32.630> that<00:06:32.990> again<00:06:33.260> no<00:06:33.800> one<00:06:34.040> really<00:06:34.400> knows

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:34.670 
and that again no one really knows

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.820 
and that again no one really knows
what's<00:06:35.030> going<00:06:35.120> to<00:06:35.389> take<00:06:35.570> place<00:06:35.870> no<00:06:36.440> one<00:06:36.620> knows

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
what's going to take place no one knows
