00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.480
 do that day we were in a new 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.780
 different video and this time I bring the 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.130
 dark pokedex 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.500
 as you all know pokemon has its side 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.089
 dark just like it has its side 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.619
 known and on that dark side it 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.029
 They resemble a lot of creepy pastas 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.689
 many pokemon among them the most 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.130
 acquaintances and my no card a2 noir avenge 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.080
 all the pokemon always have 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.000
 lots of creepy pastas for them 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.980
 but we have never seen your data 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.349
 dark we actually just see his 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.149
 story but not your image here in this 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.920
 chance let's see the appo that is 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.110
 complete of what could be the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.940
 dark pokemon the pokemon zombies or 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.890
 how do you want to call him 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.750
 these images are obviously fake are 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.190
 by an author named tim burton 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.170
 tim burton is an artist who is 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.239
 designer and designer who makes 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.620
 very good images and he has taken all 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.110
 the pokémon has taken the car that is 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.180
 complete and has transformed her to her world 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.039
 to the world of Tim Burton and this has been the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.890
 result a rather curious result 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.500
 and quite dark that gives birth to 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.760
