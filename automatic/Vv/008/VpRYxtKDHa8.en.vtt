00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.590
 there are still human needs to be addressed 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:04.919
 while oviedo 

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:08.019
 had a pension is that I barely give him up by the end of the month 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.669
 I do not think public money dares to sing 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:11.919
 so clear 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:15.399
 this what was there was that the responsibility continues to the owners 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:17.120
 millicom ago before 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.120
 three soldiers are in the political after another 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:25.189
 what is clear that you say nothing in which the man who goes but to the 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.629
 kennel to bring to another side the father of rayan in the irresponsibility of not 

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:33.300
 to be able to attend all exceeded by percent the circumstance that I know how to do very well 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.660
 hotel 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.300
 70 to 80 euros 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.609
 and with that money 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:43.109
 I can deny it for at least three months attack I think it's easier 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.730
 panorama time map evoke the adopter 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.539
 macará 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:49.639
 will be encouraged a dog does not cost now costs a ridiculous amount 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.580
 I do not know the responsibility of the owners 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.340
 the monitor buys a puppy grains of the net I burn you is not 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.780
 and when he but the coast and old problem another sick before they should appeal to 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.290
 lose watch the ministry take care of 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.000
 people 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.880
 as we have seen in the community of madrid 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.869
 a way to avoid the mass sacrifice of animals 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.310
 is to encourage adoption through the internet 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.500
 however after a quick search we realize that the 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.810
 kennel of olivenza does not have a web page 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.200
 Manoli says that it works better to work through links and that 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.789
 search online for keywords such as adoption of dogs in olivenza and 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:32.140
 we do it like this 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.830
 after looking for a good time we actually found some dogs 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.850
 of olivenza in pages of animal promotion in Spain 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.690
 but of course that does not prevent it from having an official garden where any 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.690
 person can see all these dogs that are up for adoption 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.970
 What we also find as a result of the search are some 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.380
 criticism of the management of waiting lists 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.670
 especially coming from the federation of extremadura protectors the fepaex 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.490
 This entity has filed two complaints to improve the 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.380
 conditions in which animals live in olivenza 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.570
 but at the moment none of these denunciations have been accepted by the judge 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:19.399
 p 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:22.019
 before leaving the area 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.809
 we approach to speak with a member of the federation of protectors of the appointment 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:28.809
 ex to give us your opinion about it 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.189
 first we want to be left to the animals when in those facilities 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.469
 I'm afraid you do not recover that you do not feel installation in terms of 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:42.480
 veterinary health care that does not respect its decision in what logic 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.429
 and that in general there is no 

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:50.329
 in the event does not understand that we wanted to define commune intention that those 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.239
 animals fly against one or several years the ease for which they are animals 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.079
 they use what they do for you 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.329
 we believe that if in a week we believe that crime does not go unpunished 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:03.919
 dignity and respect in your life inputs 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:06.199
 because stability is being generated 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:09.969
 good we in principle consider that the delivery the deputation of badajoz 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:11.379
 to a private company 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.590
 of service of collection of stray animals illegal since the own the 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.199
 Extremadura animal protection law specifies that equity is managed 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:22.439
 by a private company we propose the administration remains 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:25.609
 also mind the policies position at this time that what 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.970
 we believe that it is encouraging the irresponsibility of 11-s 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:31.900
 responsibility of those who raise the responsibility inconsolably 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.029
 of commuter hunters cecam permanently replenishing animals that 

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:37.579
 The activity is used as tools 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:38.669
 we propose 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:42.789
 simple jg ramirez member of the 21st century who improve have nothing better to 

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:45.669
 us as a cnn as a society education 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:49.680
 campaigns of birth control and sanction sa the law that includes a series 

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:52.309
 of sanctions for people abandoned for people who mistreat 

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:53.439
 this would reduce 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:56.129
 in a plastic way electrocution situation 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.329
 percent the number of dropouts and could make us all we can 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.669
 manage the collection of animals much more efficiently 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:07.549
 although it seems ironic there is a common point between the first and olivenza 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:08.819
 and the fepaex 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.269
 both ask for a stronger hand against abandonment but how could it act 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.729
 administration in a country where each community has its own legislation 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.779
 the peso promised to create a framework law for animal protection 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:25.360
 We wrote to the Ministry of Agriculture to give us an interview and 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.639
 explain to us when they are going to implement this proposal we try 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.059
 both by mail and by phone but the only thing we get is a great 

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:35.580
 silence for response 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.020
 we still need someone to talk to us about the situation 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.289
 legislative of companion animals in Spain 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.229
 that's why we're going to the autonomous university of Barcelona 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.560
 where, for the last year, the law school has been running 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:53.069
 first master in europe about animals right and their acid 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.970
 you think that in Spain there is no common legislation for tdt al 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.080
 of the animals 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.499
 and that depends on the autonomous communities 

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:05.139
 the approach 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:06.800
 already in a general law 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.580
 pl 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.509
 so check 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:11.729
 palahí majors with omar pumar that some minimum standards 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.879
 much needed science 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:17.930
 what happens is that at this moment find 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.809
 the agreement of what is the sixth minimum antwerp 

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:22.460
 having this one be 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.139
 dental regulatory dispersion 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.129
 in the general 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:30.750
 which is difficult to ignore what the animal suffers 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.170
 that is, the animal 7 12 an illusion that is irreparable by abandoning 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.689
 110 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:39.110
 a question 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.729
 little by little he is recognizing 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:43.180
 if I mentioned you before the sentence 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.610
 of her including the one in segovia 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.809
 the attack 

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:49.169
 the animal had been 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:51.139
 the senator was second 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.419
 7 the damage that occurs 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.419
 this is caused by the helplessness in which he finds himself 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:02.109
 what must be taken into account this exodus of dozens of countries 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:06.259
 little by little they have to be created and continue to have 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.520
 a do not suppress more maybe 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.779
 raise awareness better if cheated 

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:15.419
 educate with sanction 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:19.650
 two measures that could change the situation of abandonment in our country 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:56.930
 think that sanchez to efe 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.930
 before reaching the third 

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:15.409
 nobody does it 

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:23.599
 another difference with spain is that here we sacrifice ourselves to animals 

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:26.360
 with the arrival of the bird 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.479
 but of the too late 

00:07:59.259 --> 00:07:59.839
 lame
