00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.730
 well hi everyone 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.639
 in this video I will show you how 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:18.510
 create the character we say more typical 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:22.380
 of skyrim or the warrior with weapons 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.880
 in your hand and shield the thing you owe well 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.619
 do it just started and mind a 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.599
 take the stone as a menhir of the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.510
 warrior 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:32.969
 you all know I hope and then instead we go 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.390
 skills as you see mine 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.870
 character has the strongest armor that 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.780
 it is that dedication even if it will not be one 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.090
 more beautiful because also the flake one 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.820
 of dragon I must say that it also deserves 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.559
 this is really nice as well 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.860
 see shield and then obviously a weapon 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.989
 a weapon that in my case is the bat but it is 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.710
 specialized in the sense that in the talents 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:06.689
 then it's okay let's go and see 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.320
 now the skills of yours we have 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.930
 new level 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:17.070
 however we say final 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:21.020
 well then how do you see 350 more health 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:25.789
 that pretty and vigor has very simple 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.740
 skills briefly for all 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:30.710
 classes that you will be enchanting every 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:35.390
 those pretty basic that is 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.759
 you need therefore bisceglie have 5 points 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.439
 an enchantment also for this type of 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.909
 class to enhance mid and 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:47.450
 armor plates even more for damage and for 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:51.110
 the forging resistance as you see a 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.759
 point two points 3 points 4 points 5 points 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.130
 to get the dedication and this is it 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:59.179
 let's say a heavy armor branch 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.700
 then heavy armor and this instead 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.039
 this is where it would be for magicians 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.429
 and on the other hand instead for mature 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:09.200
 light but obviously if you are 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.720
 light 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.420
 if you make a thief you don't even have to 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.970
 hit because you have to kill at 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.530
 shoulders you make us an archer like where I have 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.470
 done the video you don't need at the end 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.609
 here serves for a sort of guess a 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:28.670
 character with two one-handed weapons that 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:31.700
 continues menard years and fast though a little 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.709
 rare as a heavy armor case here 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.620
 very simple because you have to take 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:40.209
 in other words, both the note and the scene 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.100
 take everything for various reasons 1 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.709
 this is why there is here it suffered 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.170
 half the damage and then for the fact that 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.030
 does not condition you to drink a ripe one 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.160
 heavy because therefore not really 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.109
 so obviously the fact of the 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.660
 forging was also to enhance it 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:59.870
 armor so even if you find it in 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.269
 around maybe armor from water or what 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.730
 i know anyway any other forging server 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.310
 as a skill for upgradeable then for 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.440
 let the same thing legendary come in here 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.540
 on the other side complete armor e 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.030
 also the last one that repels the blows from 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.180
 ends feels stronger than they give you 10 for 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.980
 one hundred 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:22.109
 then the shield for the shield 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.650
 there are some things obviously wall of 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:27.420
 shields here fill it of course as 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.450
 all the videos I'll put you in 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:34.889
 description the build is the build 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:38.370
 with ideal talents I will put two back already 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:41.639
 one for some things to take rest 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.500
 for let's say secondary as you see ho 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.269
 got this that time is very convenient 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.169
 slows down when it looks like an attack because 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:51.989
 really comfortable it's not fun to divert 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:55.620
 arrow you have to say guys a shield that 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.599
 the arrows do not have to have the 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.060
 possibility of diverting that you will do 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:03.419
 battles bridged by the storm against 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.780
 the legion or vice versa against forts 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:08.310
 idea arrows that is the show I go 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.859
 also see the fun you can 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.780
 then have what one could say 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.730
 who cares about the arrow the same 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.349
 but in the end this talent here 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.120
 believe me it is essential to both accounts 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:20.579
 dragons both against the evils the fact that 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.099
 when you parade damage of fire that 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.270
 50 percent electricity really 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:26.370
 much 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.229
 if you then consider that if you do a 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.510
 north warrior 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.190
 you will have a basic racial resistance 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.010
 against frost 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.680
 with this they are 50 percent plus 52 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.599
 we kind of like a nearly 100 percent 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.639
 so there's really a dragon that 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:44.400
 discuss a breath of ice makes me 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.830
 I think the remainder is very little 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.280
 they are fairly quiet in the sense that 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.639
 here is not to serve much that even 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.259
 always run when you are a warrior 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.920
 run into battle but it's not a thing 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.170
 that 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.130
 Here then are changes but these are the 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:05.280
 so many to take 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:07.700
 then 5111 as a defense then surely 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.990
 when we have nothing because obviously 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.870
 this guy grab me two hands 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:16.020
 obviously the configuration for a 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:19.110
 barbarian we say with heavy armor is 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:24.300
 a two-handed weapon is simply equal 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:27.080
 that you remove the shield talents and those 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:30.420
 lend a hand and put them here simple 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.680
 then arm a hand as you see the first 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.480
 full 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.260
 here it is in this case in short for the 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.880
 berserk to say with two arms a hand 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:42.630
 fighting posture and then you have me 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:45.840
 personally attack wild and blow 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:48.210
 paralyzing means that I have this 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.560
 eliminated because I realized that it is 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.330
 really very few times 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:57.030
 i really run and do other thing 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:06:00.720
 that you will have to do sooner or later there will be 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:04.320
 convenient is to choose a weapon then here or 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.620
 the maps or swords I sincerely for 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.540
 mine having always landed the bat 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:12.990
 spaccaossa was more suitable of course 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:15.300
 was not filled archer 0 while hand 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.190
 light 0 club and life fruit 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.600
 this is also zero I put in 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.730
 looking for let's say fun 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:26.650
 you only consider the build that 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:29.410
 I created this as much as the character e 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:32.650
 just say there is nothing else as you see 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:35.710
 let's go to the armor having it 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:37.210
 boosted really increases how many 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.430
 the ring increases the armor life 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.040
 20 points heavy 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:44.020
 idem qui corazza with the vintage that one 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.600
 hand all things that potential the 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.190
 armor dedicates legendary with 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.070
 even the enchantment and comments on the 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.450
 publishing life obviously enchantments 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.010
 as soon as you can make a better one 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:56.950
 you should replace it 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:59.800
 it was a basic thing anyway these 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:02.590
 comments all legendary the shield 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:07.180
 obviously even with all the 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:08.890
 talents we've seen of for 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.200
 shield that reduces magic even on 

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:13.690
 shield the enchantment that magic 

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.420
 the resistance is increased by 10 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.730
 hundred so the magicians don't have to do it 

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:22.080
 nothing in practice when he pressed the 

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:25.620
 right with the mouse to defend well 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:30.900
 this we say is everything for the warrior 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:33.910
 one-handed and shield of course 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:36.460
 I repeat that with a weapon two hands e 

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:38.260
 just that in this sense 

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.540
 save talents because instead of 

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:43.950
 put talents in the shield and in the arno 

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:47.290
 one hand put only one set in 

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:48.370
 arms and two hands that I truly do not 

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:51.610
 I don't even know he was even going to be 

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:54.160
 guide because the end is the same as 

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:58.180
 others that is the first and then prevails 

00:07:54.160 --> 00:08:00.450
 to the last to realize well ciao a 

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.450
 all
