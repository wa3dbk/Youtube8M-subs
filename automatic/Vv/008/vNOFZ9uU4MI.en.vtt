statue<00:02:28.220> for<00:02:28.550> a<00:02:28.580> while

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.720 

well<00:02:35.280> let's<00:02:35.519> see<00:02:35.730> hopefully<00:02:36.299> it<00:02:36.450> does

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.920 

can't<00:02:42.730> really<00:02:42.939> do<00:02:43.090> much<00:02:43.120> else<00:02:43.510> everything

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
can't really do much else everything

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:54.350 
can't really do much else everything
else<00:02:44.079> is<00:02:44.260> locked

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
it's really odd that they make you just

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:06.230 
it's really odd that they make you just
sit<00:02:57.660> here<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:57.960> wait<00:02:58.200> for<00:02:58.470> it<00:02:58.710> to<00:02:58.740> go<00:02:58.980> away
