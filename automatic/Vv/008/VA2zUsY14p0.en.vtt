frost vodka this is a vodka distilled

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.039 
frost vodka this is a vodka distilled
from<00:01:34.259> grapes<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.329> I've<00:01:36.329> been<00:01:36.509> trying<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.900> get

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
from grapes and I've been trying to get

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.289 
from grapes and I've been trying to get
this<00:01:37.110> or<00:01:37.530> I've<00:01:38.490> been<00:01:38.640> thinking<00:01:38.970> about<00:01:39.090> getting

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
this or I've been thinking about getting

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.569 
this or I've been thinking about getting
it<00:01:39.829> specifically<00:01:40.829> because<00:01:41.009> it's<00:01:41.250> distilled

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
it specifically because it's distilled

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.130 
it specifically because it's distilled
from<00:01:41.700> grapes<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.479> little<00:01:42.689> bit<00:01:42.810> sweeter

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
from grapes so it's a little bit sweeter

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.389 
from grapes so it's a little bit sweeter
but<00:01:43.320> it's<00:01:43.470> still<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.680> like<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.310> not

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
but it's still a like it so it's not

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.730 
but it's still a like it so it's not
like<00:01:44.610> that's<00:01:45.329> not<00:01:45.600> like<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.810> schnapps<00:01:46.290> it's

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
like that's not like a schnapps it's

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.130 
like that's not like a schnapps it's
just<00:01:47.159> if<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.909> were<00:01:48.390> took<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.630> pair<00:01:48.899> bond

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
just if you were took a pair bond

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.109 
just if you were took a pair bond
because<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.470> might<00:01:49.590> be<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.740> little<00:01:49.860> severe<00:01:50.119> so

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
because it might be a little severe so

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.819 
because it might be a little severe so
there<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.299> go<00:01:51.420> one-half<00:01:52.320> ounce<00:01:52.500> for<00:01:52.770> ounce

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
there you go one-half ounce for ounce

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.190

sit<00:05:09.870> your<00:05:10.050> sprite<00:05:11.210> it<00:05:12.210> is<00:05:12.450> still<00:05:12.750> sweet<00:05:13.110> but

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
sit your sprite it is still sweet but

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.280 
sit your sprite it is still sweet but
not<00:05:13.500> nearly<00:05:14.030> as<00:05:15.030> sweet<00:05:15.390> as<00:05:15.570> what<00:05:15.840> I<00:05:15.990> call<00:05:16.260> a

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
not nearly as sweet as what I call a

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.310 
not nearly as sweet as what I call a
sweet<00:05:16.770> cocktail<00:05:17.250> so<00:05:17.970> slightly<00:05:18.690> sweet<00:05:19.050> i<00:05:19.080> guess

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
sweet cocktail so slightly sweet i guess

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.140 
sweet cocktail so slightly sweet i guess
i'm<00:05:19.440> going<00:05:19.560> to<00:05:19.620> go<00:05:19.710> on<00:05:19.830> that<00:05:20.010> and<00:05:20.220> that<00:05:20.940> really

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
i'm going to go on that and that really

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.030 
i'm going to go on that and that really
i<00:05:21.300> think<00:05:21.360> it's<00:05:21.660> the<00:05:21.720> AL<00:05:21.900> of<00:05:22.110> working<00:05:22.620> itself<00:05:22.710> in

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
i think it's the AL of working itself in

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.590 
i think it's the AL of working itself in
because<00:05:23.220> these<00:05:23.370> are<00:05:23.550> not<00:05:23.700> really<00:05:23.970> super<00:05:24.419> sweet

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
because these are not really super sweet

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.150 
because these are not really super sweet
ingredients<00:05:24.720> i<00:05:25.140> guess<00:05:25.350> this<00:05:25.590> might<00:05:25.860> be<00:05:26.130> a
