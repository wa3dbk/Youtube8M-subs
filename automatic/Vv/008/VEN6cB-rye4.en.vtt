everything worked on the plane we had

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.920 
everything worked on the plane we had
about<00:00:40.730> three<00:00:41.000> or<00:00:41.030> four<00:00:41.120> flights<00:00:41.600> on<00:00:41.809> this

point we want to talk about some of the
issues<00:00:43.550> we're<00:00:43.940> having<00:00:46.810> one<00:00:47.810> of<00:00:47.900> the<00:00:47.960> problems

issues we're having one of the problems
with<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:48.740> plane<00:00:49.130> is<00:00:49.370> that<00:00:49.670> they<00:00:49.790> have<00:00:49.910> this

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
with the plane is that they have this

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.090 
with the plane is that they have this
really<00:00:50.090> cool<00:00:50.480> attractive<00:00:51.140> landing<00:00:51.650> you<00:00:51.830> and

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
really cool attractive landing you and

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.790 
really cool attractive landing you and
of<00:00:52.700> course<00:00:52.970> it<00:00:53.300> doesn't<00:00:53.510> work<00:00:55.930> this<00:00:56.930> one<00:00:57.260> has

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
of course it doesn't work this one has

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.340 
of course it doesn't work this one has
to<00:00:58.250> short<00:00:58.550> of<00:00:58.640> a<00:00:58.730> rod<00:00:58.940> we<00:00:59.570> tried<00:00:59.840> pulling<00:01:00.020> out

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
to short of a rod we tried pulling out

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.149

cheap plastic off one little crash but
the<00:01:56.520> biggest<00:01:56.729> problem<00:01:56.970> is<00:01:57.330> a<00:01:57.360> power<00:01:57.660> system<00:01:57.990> on

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
the biggest problem is a power system on

the biggest problem is a power system on
this<00:01:58.470> plane<00:01:58.740> we've<00:01:59.490> been<00:01:59.670> able<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.970> play<00:02:00.119> a

this plane we've been able to play a
good<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> couple<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:01.979> times<00:02:02.250> but<00:02:02.729> only<00:02:03.030> on<00:02:03.060> half

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
good a couple of times but only on half

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.170 
good a couple of times but only on half
power<00:02:03.780> when<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.860> fly<00:02:05.070> this<00:02:05.130> plane<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.880> can<00:02:06.030> go

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
power when you fly this plane you can go

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.630 
power when you fly this plane you can go
about<00:02:06.390> half<00:02:06.750> throttle<00:02:07.140> where<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.070> more<00:02:08.280> motor

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640

starts to miss let me show you what I

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.770 
starts to miss let me show you what I
mean<00:02:13.670> when<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:14.760> get<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.060> about<00:02:15.239> half<00:02:15.510> throttle

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780

this<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.560> big<00:02:31.709> problem<00:02:32.010> for<00:02:32.430> us<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:32.820> we

this is a big problem for us and we

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.000 
this is a big problem for us and we
don't<00:02:32.940> know<00:02:33.180> quite<00:02:33.330> what<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.600> do<00:02:33.810> this<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:34.799> one

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
learn an RC and one of the things to

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.149 
learn an RC and one of the things to
learn<00:02:48.150> is<00:02:48.360> how<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.510> solve<00:02:48.840> problems<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.620> this

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
learn is how to solve problems and this

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:59.059 
learn is how to solve problems and this
is<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.340> problem<00:02:56.900> so<00:02:57.900> where<00:02:58.109> do<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.409> begin<00:02:58.739> on<00:02:59.040> a

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
is a problem so where do you begin on a

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.640 
is a problem so where do you begin on a
problem<00:02:59.489> like<00:02:59.609> this<00:03:02.720> it<00:03:03.720> could<00:03:03.959> be<00:03:04.079> the<00:03:04.200> radio

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
problem like this it could be the radio

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.710 
problem like this it could be the radio
it<00:03:04.859> could<00:03:05.069> be<00:03:05.129> the<00:03:05.250> motor<00:03:05.489> could<00:03:05.879> be<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.090> ESC

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
it could be the motor could be the ESC

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.050 
it could be the motor could be the ESC
there's<00:03:07.290> tons<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.769> things<00:03:07.829> that<00:03:08.189> could<00:03:08.340> be<00:03:08.549> so

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
there's tons of things that could be so

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.430 
there's tons of things that could be so
