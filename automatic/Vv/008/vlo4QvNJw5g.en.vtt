00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
thought it looked pretty unique you will

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.160 
thought it looked pretty unique you will
need<00:01:59.280> some<00:01:59.820> stone<00:02:00.149> though<00:02:00.420> for<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.750> button

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
need some stone though for the button

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.249 
need some stone though for the button
and<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.590> pressure<00:02:01.979> plate<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.689> yeah<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:04.110> know

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259

it's<00:02:04.469> pretty<00:02:04.829> basic<00:02:05.240> nothing<00:02:06.240> special<00:02:06.570> and

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
it's pretty basic nothing special and

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.270 
it's pretty basic nothing special and
yeah<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.530> just<00:02:07.590> gets<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.399> job<00:02:08.610> done<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.849> guess

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:24.800 
know it looks pretty cool how has that
water<00:02:23.430> effect<00:02:23.909> even<00:02:24.090> though<00:02:24.329> it's<00:02:24.480> just<00:02:24.720> a

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
water effect even though it's just a

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.589 
water effect even though it's just a
nice<00:02:24.959> block<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.530> at<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.099> bottom<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.670> put<00:02:27.569> a

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
nice block and at the bottom I put a

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.479 
nice block and at the bottom I put a
couple<00:02:27.840> bookshelves<00:02:28.379> and<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.769> surrounded<00:02:29.340> them

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
couple bookshelves and I surrounded them

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.420 
couple bookshelves and I surrounded them
with<00:02:29.819> trap<00:02:30.510> doors<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:31.260> at<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.620> top<00:02:31.799> I<00:02:32.099> just

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
with trap doors and at the top I just

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.960 
with trap doors and at the top I just
put<00:02:32.640> in<00:02:32.760> some<00:02:33.090> wooden<00:02:34.079> slabs<00:02:34.409> and<00:02:34.769> you<00:02:35.760> know<00:02:35.879> of

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
put in some wooden slabs and you know of

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.670 
put in some wooden slabs and you know of
course<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.390> ice<00:02:36.510> they<00:02:36.900> look<00:02:37.049> pretty<00:02:37.079> cool<00:02:37.470> and

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
course the ice they look pretty cool and

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.069 
course the ice they look pretty cool and
all<00:02:38.670> right<00:02:38.849> here<00:02:39.120> this<00:02:39.329> isn't<00:02:39.659> something<00:02:39.870> I

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
all right here this isn't something I

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.110 
all right here this isn't something I
normally<00:02:40.109> do<00:02:40.709> but<00:02:40.859> this<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.189> a<00:02:41.220> carpet<00:02:41.760> design

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
normally do but this is a carpet design

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.819 
normally do but this is a carpet design
and<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.450> thought<00:02:42.689> you<00:02:43.049> know<00:02:43.079> I<00:02:43.200> might<00:02:43.439> share<00:02:43.739> it

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.770 
and I thought you know I might share it
around<00:02:43.920> with<00:02:44.159> you<00:02:44.280> guys<00:02:44.459> because<00:02:45.390> one<00:02:45.629> of<00:02:45.659> my

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
and here's another thing when you guys

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.550 
and here's another thing when you guys
requested<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.519> a<00:02:59.549> sink<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.359> I<00:03:01.079> didn't<00:03:01.470> know

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
requested is a sink and I didn't know

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.770 
requested is a sink and I didn't know
exactly<00:03:01.889> how<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.250> make<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.489> sink<00:03:02.849> but<00:03:03.269> I<00:03:03.510> did

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
exactly how to make a sink but I did

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.319 
exactly how to make a sink but I did
manage<00:03:03.989> to<00:03:04.379> make<00:03:04.530> one<00:03:04.739> that<00:03:05.400> did<00:03:05.790> balance

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
manage to make one that did balance

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.330 
manage to make one that did balance
itself<00:03:06.629> out<00:03:06.900> with<00:03:07.079> the<00:03:07.230> size<00:03:07.500> of<00:03:07.829> you<00:03:07.980> know<00:03:08.099> the

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
itself out with the size of you know the

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.610 
itself out with the size of you know the
guy<00:03:08.579> in<00:03:08.819> Minecraft<00:03:09.450> which<00:03:09.810> is<00:03:10.019> your<00:03:10.200> default

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
guy in Minecraft which is your default

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.619 
guy in Minecraft which is your default
player<00:03:10.829> and<00:03:11.129> you<00:03:11.730> know<00:03:11.849> it<00:03:11.939> wasn't<00:03:12.120> too<00:03:12.389> big

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
player and you know it wasn't too big

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.539 
player and you know it wasn't too big
wasn't<00:03:13.170> too<00:03:13.290> small<00:03:13.620> it's<00:03:13.859> just<00:03:14.069> pretty<00:03:14.310> basic

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
wasn't too small it's just pretty basic

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.849 
wasn't too small it's just pretty basic
and<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.389> me<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:15.540> think<00:03:16.019> it<00:03:16.290> gets<00:03:16.409> the<00:03:16.590> job<00:03:16.620> done

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
and to me I think it gets the job done

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.770 
and to me I think it gets the job done
it<00:03:17.250> looks<00:03:17.400> like<00:03:17.669> a<00:03:17.699> sink<00:03:18.090> it<00:03:18.299> works<00:03:18.510> like<00:03:18.720> a

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
it looks like a sink it works like a

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.539 
it looks like a sink it works like a
sing<00:03:19.079> so<00:03:19.410> can't<00:03:20.400> go<00:03:20.519> wrong<00:03:20.730> with<00:03:20.940> that<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:22.549> I

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
sing so can't go wrong with that and I

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.400 
sing so can't go wrong with that and I
guess<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.299> kind<00:03:24.540> of<00:03:24.629> wraps<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:25.079> up<00:03:25.139> for<00:03:25.199> this

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
guess that kind of wraps it up for this

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.189 
guess that kind of wraps it up for this
video<00:03:25.650> due<00:03:26.069> to<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.280> fact<00:03:26.549> that<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:27.449> didn't<00:03:28.019> have

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:28.199 
video due to the fact that I didn't have

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.899 
video due to the fact that I didn't have
much<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.709> show<00:03:28.949> because<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.459> know<00:03:29.579> you're<00:03:29.819> not

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909 
much to show because you know you're not

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.640 
much to show because you know you're not
a<00:03:29.970> lot<00:03:30.239> of<00:03:30.269> you<00:03:30.359> guys<00:03:30.389> left<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.930> lot<00:03:31.079> of<00:03:31.109> comments
