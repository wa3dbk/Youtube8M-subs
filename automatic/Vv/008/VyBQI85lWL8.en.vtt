Mayweather's legal trouble to come out

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.640 
Mayweather's legal trouble to come out
the<00:03:27.940> ring<00:03:28.090> because<00:03:28.210> he<00:03:28.930> fought<00:03:29.170> without<00:03:29.320> Roger

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
the ring because he fought without Roger

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.300 
the ring because he fought without Roger
Mayweather<00:03:29.890> before<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:31.510> so<00:03:31.810> I<00:03:32.100> just<00:03:33.100> don't

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
Mayweather before and so I just don't

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.270 
Mayweather before and so I just don't

there's<00:03:37.210> no<00:03:37.420> belt<00:03:37.690> at<00:03:37.900> stake<00:03:38.200> I<00:03:38.500> don't<00:03:39.190> know<00:03:39.280> I

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
there's no belt at stake I don't know I

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.850 
there's no belt at stake I don't know I
don't<00:03:39.580> fight<00:03:40.060> he's<00:03:40.450> not<00:03:40.630> as<00:03:40.780> he<00:03:40.900> doesn't<00:03:41.170> claim

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
don't fight he's not as he doesn't claim

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.820

a very talented boxer that's fight for

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.260 
a very talented boxer that's fight for
money<00:03:47.260> and<00:03:47.590> I<00:03:48.430> think<00:03:48.820> there<00:03:49.630> has<00:03:49.870> to<00:03:50.140> be<00:03:50.170> a<00:03:51.270> lot

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
money and I think there has to be a lot

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.430 
money and I think there has to be a lot
of<00:03:52.300> money<00:03:52.810> that<00:03:53.140> he<00:03:53.980> just<00:03:54.250> cannot<00:03:54.640> refuse<00:03:55.440> that

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
of money that he just cannot refuse that

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.160 
of money that he just cannot refuse that
that's<00:03:57.310> just<00:03:57.700> going<00:03:57.880> to<00:03:57.970> make<00:03:58.000> him<00:03:58.270> find<00:03:58.480> that

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
that's just going to make him find that

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.710 
that's just going to make him find that
that's<00:03:59.440> his<00:03:59.680> period<00:04:00.100> I<00:04:00.190> mean<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:01.480> drug

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
that's his period I mean the drug

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.470 
that's his period I mean the drug
