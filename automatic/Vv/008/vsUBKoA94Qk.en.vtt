00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.750
 very good gentlemen I will explain the 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.330
 performance that I have made the boot 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.070
 of the engine down of the two-speed and 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.680
 designing a boot type with the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.330
 possibility of a progressive start and 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.720
 a start 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.940
 to consider fast 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.990
 for it using three outputs 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.990
 and three entries 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.460
 I pulse the fast that would be the entrance 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.419
 directly at fast speed 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.419
 I watched 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.320
 do not 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.320
 there I have right now three thousand 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.320
 revolutions per minute 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.230
 I have also done 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.429
 a stop progressive progress that is of 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.429
 slower faster 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.260
 observe a common strike 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.220
 the friend is working could it be 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.590
 the slow speed 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.960
 half 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.170
 500 revolutions per second per minute 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.170
 hair 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.650
 I have returned to give him one at speed 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.650
 fast 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.940
 now I'm going to stop it always going through 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.940
 the slow speed 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.170
 because you have seen now you see in a 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.170
 progressive start 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:49.050
 from less speed to more 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.050
 would be pressing and 2 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.290
 now it is at 1,500 depressions by 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.770
 minute after a time it will go to the 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.040
 speed the stone 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:08.320
 perfect gentlemen has worked perfect 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.320
 authors of the project 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.670
 danny rodríguez 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.120
 and sayán kings kings thank you very much until 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.120
 the view
