all right so where you go a little bit
extreme<00:02:14.989> this<00:02:15.650> time<00:02:15.980> so<00:02:16.730> you<00:02:17.090> know<00:02:17.150> we<00:02:17.239> could

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
extreme this time so you know we could

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.820 
extreme this time so you know we could
just<00:02:17.480> load<00:02:17.630> an<00:02:17.780> app<00:02:17.930> or<00:02:18.080> whatever<00:02:18.350> but<00:02:18.560> there's
