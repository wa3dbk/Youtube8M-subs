forever
it<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.550> by<00:00:56.789> far<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.120> softest<00:00:57.870> board<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.589> rides

00:00:58.879 --> 00:00:58.889 
it is by far the softest board and rides

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:01.129 
it is by far the softest board and rides
lineup<00:00:59.489> so<00:00:59.909> it's<00:01:00.120> great<00:01:00.329> for<00:01:00.359> rails<00:01:00.839> it's

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:01.139 
lineup so it's great for rails it's

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:02.689 
lineup so it's great for rails it's
great<00:01:01.350> for<00:01:01.559> boxes<00:01:02.100> goofing<00:01:02.579> around

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
great for boxes goofing around

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.810 
great for boxes goofing around
everywhere<00:01:03.569> you<00:01:04.049> know<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.290> has<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.820> twin

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
everywhere you know it has that twin

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.359 
everywhere you know it has that twin
rocker<00:01:06.329> shape<00:01:06.719> to<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.200> flat<00:01:07.649> platform

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
rocker shape to it so that flat platform

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.190 
rocker shape to it so that flat platform
with<00:01:08.579> that<00:01:08.729> little<00:01:09.090> rocker<00:01:09.329> kick<00:01:09.689> on<00:01:09.899> the<00:01:10.020> nose

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200

and<00:01:10.409> tail<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.680> keep<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.040> from<00:01:11.189> hanging<00:01:11.460> up<00:01:11.790> you

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
and tail to keep you from hanging up you

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:14.030 
and tail to keep you from hanging up you
know<00:01:12.420> but<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.689> next<00:01:12.960> evolution<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.860> line

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
know but the next evolution in the line

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.100 
know but the next evolution in the line
is<00:01:14.399> another<00:01:15.030> board<00:01:15.390> that's<00:01:15.659> been<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> staple

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
is another board that's been a staple

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.620 
is another board that's been a staple
and<00:01:16.380> rides<00:01:16.590> line<00:01:16.890> up<00:01:17.100> forever<00:01:17.490> that's<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.299> D<00:01:18.479> H

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
and rides line up forever that's the D H

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.999 
and rides line up forever that's the D H
but<00:01:18.990> there's<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.229> pretty<00:01:19.409> big<00:01:19.619> difference

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
but there's a pretty big difference

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.219 
but there's a pretty big difference
between<00:01:20.159> these<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.270> D<00:01:21.450> H<00:01:21.600> still<00:01:21.899> holds

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
between these as the D H still holds

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.190 
between these as the D H still holds
true<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.770> traditional<00:01:23.430> camber<00:01:23.909> shape<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.869> if

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
true to a traditional camber shape so if

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.230 
true to a traditional camber shape so if
you're<00:01:25.350> not<00:01:25.469> really<00:01:25.740> into<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.310> rocker<00:01:26.549> but

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
you're not really into the rocker but

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.760 
you're not really into the rocker but
you<00:01:27.329> really<00:01:27.630> like<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.110> parking<00:01:28.469> design

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
you really like in the parking design

like<00:02:12.269> the<00:02:12.510> kink<00:02:12.810> is<00:02:12.989> but<00:02:13.500> it's<00:02:13.620> more<00:02:13.769> poppy

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
like the kink is but it's more poppy

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.009 
like the kink is but it's more poppy
because<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.730> has<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:15.060> carbon<00:02:15.420> array<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.840> has

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
because it has the carbon array it has

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.140 
because it has the carbon array it has
the<00:02:16.200> pop<00:02:16.409> rods<00:02:16.709> in<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.099> so<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.700> know<00:02:17.940> it's

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
the pop rods in it so you know it's

the pop rods in it so you know it's
going<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.390> help<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:18.750> still<00:02:19.590> do<00:02:19.800> all<00:02:19.950> those

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
going to help you still do all those

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
rails and boxes and jumps but it's going

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.690 
rails and boxes and jumps but it's going
to<00:02:21.989> be<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.140> little<00:02:22.319> bit<00:02:22.530> snappier<00:02:23.099> and<00:02:23.519> have

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
to be a little bit snappier and have

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.729 
to be a little bit snappier and have
that<00:02:23.909> rocker<00:02:24.239> kick<00:02:24.659> to<00:02:24.810> be<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.959> little<00:02:25.319> more

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
that rocker kick to be a little more

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.399 
that rocker kick to be a little more
forgiving<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:26.909> know<00:02:27.060> camber<00:02:27.629> is<00:02:27.930> and

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
forgiving and you know camber is and

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.630 
forgiving and you know camber is and
that's<00:02:28.530> one<00:02:28.709> of<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.860> reasons<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.370> kind<00:02:29.580> of

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
that's one of the reasons that kind of

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.160 
that's one of the reasons that kind of
rock<00:02:29.819> there<00:02:30.030> jumped<00:02:30.330> into<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.659> line

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
rock there jumped into the line

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.009 
rock there jumped into the line
the<00:02:31.980> next<00:02:32.340> evolution<00:02:32.549> though<00:02:33.360> now<00:02:33.599> is<00:02:33.840> the

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
the next evolution though now is the

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.490 
the next evolution though now is the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
brand new buck up board now the buck up

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.710 
brand new buck up board now the buck up
takes<00:02:37.860> what<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.159> buck<00:02:38.340> wild<00:02:38.640> has<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.360> it's

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
takes what the buck wild has and it's

takes what the buck wild has and it's
got<00:02:39.870> that<00:02:40.019> hybrid<00:02:40.409> twin<00:02:41.310> shape<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:41.819> so<00:02:42.090> it's

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
got that hybrid twin shape to it so it's

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.899 
got that hybrid twin shape to it so it's
flat<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:43.019> has<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.409> same<00:02:43.590> rocker<00:02:43.920> kick<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.700> it

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
flat it has the same rocker kick to it

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.509 
flat it has the same rocker kick to it
but<00:02:45.360> there's<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.569> micro<00:02:45.989> camber<00:02:46.440> infused<00:02:46.920> from

accelerated spins from those you know so

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.210 
accelerated spins from those you know so
it's<00:03:03.420> more<00:03:03.690> aggressive<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.470> if<00:03:04.650> you<00:03:04.800> like<00:03:04.980> more

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
it's more aggressive so if you like more

it's more aggressive so if you like more
response<00:03:05.670> you<00:03:05.880> like<00:03:06.060> faster<00:03:06.770> spins<00:03:07.770> and<00:03:08.220> you

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
response you like faster spins and you

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.770 
response you like faster spins and you
know<00:03:08.520> but<00:03:08.850> still<00:03:09.120> want<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.360> little<00:03:09.390> bit<00:03:09.720> of

know but still want a little bit of
playfulness<00:03:10.260> underfoot<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.280> you<00:03:11.490> would<00:03:11.730> want

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
playfulness underfoot and you would want

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.400 
playfulness underfoot and you would want
to<00:03:11.970> upgrade<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.660> buck<00:03:12.900> up

videos<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.330> decide<00:03:21.600> which<00:03:21.930> one<00:03:22.170> is<00:03:22.200> actually

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
videos and decide which one is actually

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.410 
videos and decide which one is actually

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
the right board for you so check them

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.990 
the right board for you so check them
out<00:03:24.510> this<00:03:24.750> fall
