00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:17.609
 hello friends and well measured albino of virtualization on the youtube channel with 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.489
 josé maría gonzález 

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:25.459
 like every Monday with a kid related to securitization today the 

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:29.890
 fly continue such continuity to the day of last week 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.110
 where we talk about the counters that you see on the screen 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.670
 this shy and you and cash peri 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.590
 let's have as 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.370
 transpose 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.620
 milliseconds that these two meters do not give in relative percentages 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.570
 and we go to identify 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.860
 yes yes to bottle necks 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.840
 at city ut level and how to do it well as you see here on my machine screen 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.699
 We are giving virtual by the way 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.270
 the accountants who have 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.710
 ios ice-t and huber and the windows or chords that you see on the screen 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.080
 look how you see this new in milliseconds as we transfer it to ap 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.120
 relative percentage very simple fixes we are doing with citi united 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.130
 some ma moss to put 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.240
 go with it the last counter 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.880
 the last value better than thousand 28 milliseconds how we spend ap 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.149
 relative percentages very simple let's open our favorite calculator 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.780
 We were going to put honey 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.940
 28 milliseconds divided between 20 thousand milliseconds and have wanted because 20 thousand 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.960
 seconds I think it happened to me 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.240
 peres honey 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.880
 24 between 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.900
 sell fears 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.570
 thousands seconds multiplied 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.090
 percent 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.980
 We are making a 5% use of the grape brush ja 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.850
 as bishops passively we're not doing anything right we're going to 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.060
 minimize ana guada what of the 20 thousand thousand seconds divide it by 20 thousand 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.819
 soles why this graph refreshes every 20 thousand milliseconds 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.750
 i helmut legacy percent is because they see that we believe in percentages 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.080
 ok we're going to go into the console of the virtual machine we were going to reed 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.150
 to claim it then basically 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.269
 what are we going to do this matter 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.190
 hunt written and you know is that we go every stress 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.049
 the cep and ufp 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.049
 this is going to give us opposition as to 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.569
 number of operations per second 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.510
 i in short we are going to put load the plácet and the virtual one and therefore 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.039
 link tivo 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:39.969
 physical d is me x well you're going to see the performance tab counter 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:41.320
 and let's leave it 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.710
 to stabilize a little prepare the video 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.630
 because this is a client to stabilize and let it run because at least five 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.260
 minutes today for the river 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
 we ignore now 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.449
 well then after a few minutes as you see tudela 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.340
 the measure decided to dicidiera and have risen mamos agility ficar quickly 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.269
 if we're seeing a bottleneck level city one first let's look at 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.659
 entel counter of citi gods 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.139
 as you see is doing around 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:24.200
 6000 of 7000 milliseconds famous after the relative percentage clothing we are going to 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:29.079
 go with this last value of this counter that are 6 thousand 580 we are going to spend 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.919
 tarno extra favorite calculator and let's say as before 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:36.779
 for 100 6 thousand 700 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:40.209
 divided by 20 thousand 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.519
 same 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.239
 and percent 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.669
 I was seeing that we are posing 33% d ppv 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:51.699
 but well p we do not have to stay here we continue 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:54.630
 we have to keep looking at the one 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.959
 what a counter that is not saying looking at pspv and set 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.730
 the last accountant decided king are 13 thousand thousand seconds 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.959
 let's pass it to relative percentages so if we divide 13 thousand 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.579
 thousands seconds divided by 20 thousand 

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:16.629
 multiplied by 100 is nothing 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.829
 a value of 65 percent this 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.830
 dear friends of mine is to have bottleneck anif cash 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.210
 for a period of time 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.970
 determined we are going accompanied the broken one lies mindfully with our 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.259
 famous that christ 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:38.639
 we are going to save poster clients cht and as best here I am showing lc 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:39.310
 quisto 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.040
 created he is x tobacco norm shows that the windows 2003 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.630
 is doing a rite around 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.159
 of 67 percent is to say he's friends 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:53.569
 level of bottle at the level of burial and is that ultimately how you see and if I 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:56.619
 I go to the console the way to act I am expressing with this writing 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:59.800
 the virtual machine and therefore 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.839
 I'm listening to niese's physical 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:13.699
 well, dear friends this has been all for today this is the best way and 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.050
 the same 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.170
 reliable to detect 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.510
 aesthetic level bottlenecks to remember that in one because you have is a 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.680
 counter to touch brush gods 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.919
 it means that you have a bottleneck, I take off, you have to look 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.080
 the cep iu king exceeded network and that basically tells us 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.380
 how many cycles of fp and uu I'm in, because my physical brush is 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.479
 actors I hope you've learned something, I'll summon you there's a next Monday 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.580
 so you see buy but to deliver and omp next video 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.930
 virtualisation here has been the caballito with josé maría gonzález 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.060
 see you next week enjoy i see you soon friend
