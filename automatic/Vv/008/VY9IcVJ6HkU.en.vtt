moment<00:04:01.930> what<00:04:02.930> I'm<00:04:03.020> gonna<00:04:03.140> do<00:04:03.380> now<00:04:03.620> is<00:04:04.810> again

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
moment what I'm gonna do now is again

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.580 
moment what I'm gonna do now is again
I'm<00:04:07.790> going<00:04:08.090> to<00:04:08.150> take<00:04:08.450> not<00:04:08.690> again<00:04:08.990> I'm<00:04:09.260> going<00:04:09.470> to

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
I'm going to take not again I'm going to

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.390 
I'm going to take not again I'm going to
take<00:04:09.830> some<00:04:10.160> dehydrated<00:04:10.880> mushrooms<00:04:11.120> I<00:04:12.400> got

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
take some dehydrated mushrooms I got

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.280 
take some dehydrated mushrooms I got
this<00:04:13.580> idea<00:04:14.740> from<00:04:15.740> my<00:04:15.950> beef<00:04:16.160> wellington

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
this idea from my beef wellington

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.289 
this idea from my beef wellington
because<00:04:18.290> the<00:04:18.410> beef<00:04:18.560> wellington<00:04:18.739> you<00:04:19.340> dry

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
because the beef wellington you dry

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.180 
because the beef wellington you dry
saute<00:04:20.870> them<00:04:21.080> to<00:04:21.200> get<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:21.440> moisture<00:04:21.650> out<00:04:21.859> so

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
saute them to get the moisture out so

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.810 
saute them to get the moisture out so
why<00:04:22.400> not<00:04:22.640> just<00:04:22.820> use<00:04:23.000> dehydrated<00:04:23.660> muffins<00:04:24.820> it's

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
why not just use dehydrated muffins it's

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.370 
why not just use dehydrated muffins it's
smells<00:04:26.150> so<00:04:26.360> good<00:04:26.620> that<00:04:27.620> I<00:04:27.800> am<00:04:27.980> just<00:04:28.220> going<00:04:28.460> to

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
smells so good that I am just going to

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.890 
smells so good that I am just going to
sprinkle<00:04:30.380> a<00:04:30.560> layer<00:04:32.290> of<00:04:33.290> powdered<00:04:33.740> mushrooms

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
sprinkle a layer of powdered mushrooms

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.940 
sprinkle a layer of powdered mushrooms
all<00:04:35.900> over<00:04:36.410> the<00:04:36.890> meatloaf<00:04:37.250> and<00:04:38.620> I<00:04:39.620> think<00:04:39.860> I

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
all over the meatloaf and I think I

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:47.530 
all over the meatloaf and I think I
might<00:04:40.130> just<00:04:40.280> do<00:04:40.490> a<00:04:40.520> little<00:04:40.760> bit<00:04:41.090> more<00:04:46.540> yeah

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
might just do a little bit more yeah

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.650 
might just do a little bit more yeah
that's<00:04:47.810> a<00:04:47.900> little<00:04:47.990> more<00:04:48.260> rustic<00:04:48.500> looking<00:04:49.660> and

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
that's a little more rustic looking and

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.980 
that's a little more rustic looking and
now<00:04:52.870> let's<00:04:53.870> take<00:04:54.110> our<00:04:55.120> mashed<00:04:56.120> potatoes<00:04:56.690> and

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
now let's take our mashed potatoes and

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.750 
now let's take our mashed potatoes and
this<00:04:57.560> works<00:04:57.830> really<00:04:57.919> well<00:04:58.280> if<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:58.550> mashed

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
this works really well if the mashed

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.990 
this works really well if the mashed
potatoes<00:04:59.180> are<00:04:59.300> cold<00:05:00.400> because<00:05:01.400> then<00:05:01.790> they're

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
potatoes are cold because then they're

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.430 
potatoes are cold because then they're
more<00:05:02.150> firm<00:05:02.800> now<00:05:03.800> we're<00:05:04.040> going<00:05:04.280> to<00:05:04.400> take<00:05:04.640> our

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440

like<00:05:39.740> I<00:05:39.860> did<00:05:40.040> the<00:05:40.130> beef<00:05:40.310> wellington<00:05:40.490> I<00:05:40.970> never

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
like I did the beef wellington I never

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.810 
like I did the beef wellington I never
even<00:05:41.330> thought<00:05:41.690> about<00:05:41.870> it

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
even thought about it

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.350
