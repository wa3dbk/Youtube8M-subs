00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
it's some cult so actually came up with

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.630 
it's some cult so actually came up with
a<00:00:54.809> new<00:00:54.960> method<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.649> drop<00:00:55.980> forging<00:00:56.430> which

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
a new method of a drop forging which

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.599 
a new method of a drop forging which
eliminates<00:00:57.239> pits<00:00:57.629> voids<00:00:57.930> dents<00:00:58.399> and<00:00:59.399> all

other imperfections in the steel it's

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.560 
other imperfections in the steel it's
very<00:01:02.719> seamless<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:04.170> guess<00:01:05.000> it's<00:01:06.000> made<00:01:06.210> out<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.390> a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
very seamless I guess it's made out of a

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.710 
very seamless I guess it's made out of a
sate<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.850> steel<00:01:08.850> which<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.180> cold<00:01:09.510> steel
