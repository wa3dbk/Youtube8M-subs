00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.630 
in it and it has an a7 and there's one
place<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.170> song<00:01:31.380> where<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.830> d7<00:01:32.430> would

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
place in the song where the d7 would

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.190 
place in the song where the d7 would
sound<00:01:32.909> better<00:01:33.149> but<00:01:33.240> if<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.509> play<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.720> D<00:01:33.960> it's

sound better but if you play a D it's

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.889 
sound better but if you play a D it's
okay<00:01:34.530> it's<00:01:34.710> not<00:01:34.860> very<00:01:35.280> prominent<00:01:36.030> which<00:01:36.600> means

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
okay it's not very prominent which means

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.800 
okay it's not very prominent which means
that<00:01:37.170> it's<00:01:38.070> just<00:01:38.369> not<00:01:38.430> very<00:01:38.820> loud<00:01:39.360> it's<00:01:39.630> not

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
that it's just not very loud it's not

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
that it's just not very loud it's not
very<00:01:40.100> domineering<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.560> song

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
very domineering and in the in the song

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.770 
very domineering and in the in the song
so<00:01:44.130> you'll<00:01:44.610> see<00:01:44.789> some<00:01:44.820> interpretations<00:01:45.630> with

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
so you'll see some interpretations with

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.410 
so you'll see some interpretations with
a<00:01:45.810> D<00:01:46.020> there<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.409> some<00:01:46.560> with<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.799> d7<00:01:47.330> but<00:01:48.330> you

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
a D there and some with a d7 but you

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.149 
a D there and some with a d7 but you
could<00:01:48.539> play<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.869> either<00:01:49.020> okay<00:01:51.770> real<00:01:52.770> quick<00:01:52.799> a

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
could play it either okay real quick a

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.469 
could play it either okay real quick a
little<00:01:53.250> bit<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.520> theory<00:01:53.820> because<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.179> got<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.390> go

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
little bit of theory because I got to go

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.419 
little bit of theory because I got to go
into<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.750> about<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.289> is<00:01:55.409> if<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.740> plan<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.039> D

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
into it about it is if you plan a D

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.020 
into it about it is if you plan a D
basically<00:01:56.940> a<00:01:57.600> d7<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.979> demon<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.789> demon

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
basically a d7 is a demon is a demon

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.789 
basically a d7 is a demon is a demon
jerk<00:02:00.509> or<00:02:00.690> but<00:02:00.869> it's<00:02:00.990> got<00:02:01.140> one<00:02:01.649> other

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
jerk or but it's got one other

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.249 
jerk or but it's got one other
ingredient<00:02:02.039> in<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.819> that's<00:02:03.270> why<00:02:03.539> sometimes

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
ingredient in it that's why sometimes

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.499 
ingredient in it that's why sometimes
you<00:02:04.799> can<00:02:05.009> use<00:02:05.280> chords<00:02:05.700> interchangeably

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
you can use chords interchangeably

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.910 
you can use chords interchangeably
because<00:02:06.780> one<00:02:07.590> chord<00:02:08.069> works<00:02:08.850> fine<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.869> may<00:02:10.769> not

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
because one chord works fine it may not

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.890 
because one chord works fine it may not
have<00:02:11.190> all<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.730> detail<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.330> want<00:02:12.690> but

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
have all the detail that you want but

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.240 
have all the detail that you want but
there's<00:02:13.049> nothing<00:02:13.319> about<00:02:13.530> that<00:02:13.590> specific

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
there's nothing about that specific

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.840 
there's nothing about that specific
chord<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:15.030> has<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.239> bad<00:02:15.630> note<00:02:15.989> in<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.350> okay

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
chord that has a bad note in it okay

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.160 
chord that has a bad note in it okay
well<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:17.970> seventh<00:02:18.269> chord<00:02:18.510> it's<00:02:18.750> basically<00:02:19.019> a

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
well the seventh chord it's basically a

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.600 
well the seventh chord it's basically a
D<00:02:19.380> major<00:02:19.530> chord<00:02:19.680> has<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.160> little<00:02:20.400> bit<00:02:20.489> more

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
D major chord has a little bit more

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.610 
D major chord has a little bit more
information<00:02:20.819> in<00:02:21.239> it<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.799> flatted<00:02:22.799> 7th<00:02:23.130> okay<00:02:23.640> so
