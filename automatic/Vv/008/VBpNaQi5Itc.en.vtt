chance of staying in the LCS are still
alive<00:00:34.739> depending<00:00:35.219> on<00:00:35.309> s<00:00:35.460> case<00:00:35.640> performance<00:00:36.180> as

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
alive depending on s case performance as

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.030 
alive depending on s case performance as
your<00:00:36.660> mindset<00:00:37.110> change<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.530> you're<00:00:37.680> still

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
your mindset change so you're still

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
thinking like that well personally my

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.250 
thinking like that well personally my
mindset<00:00:41.040> has<00:00:41.219> changed<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.760> lot<00:00:42.230> before<00:00:43.230> I

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
mindset has changed a lot before I

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.690 
mindset has changed a lot before I
wouldn't<00:00:43.590> really<00:00:43.680> go<00:00:43.860> for<00:00:44.040> those<00:00:44.190> risky

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
wouldn't really go for those risky

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.850 
wouldn't really go for those risky
turret<00:00:45.480> dives<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.899> stuff<00:00:46.110> like<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.500> might<00:00:46.680> may

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
turret dives and stuff like it might may

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.190 
turret dives and stuff like it might may
look<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.280> little<00:00:47.340> bit<00:00:47.640> stupid<00:00:47.850> but<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.989> more

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
look a little bit stupid but it's more

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.889 
look a little bit stupid but it's more
like<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:50.219> know<00:00:50.340> it's<00:00:50.760> loosely<00:00:51.210> loosing<00:00:51.780> up

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
like you know it's loosely loosing up

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.209 
like you know it's loosely loosing up
because<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.320> have<00:00:52.410> nothing<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.829> lose<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.129> you

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
because you have nothing to lose and you

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.520 
because you have nothing to lose and you
can<00:00:53.370> take<00:00:53.550> those<00:00:53.699> risks<00:00:53.760> because<00:00:54.390> there's<00:00:55.350> no

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
can take those risks because there's no

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.229 
can take those risks because there's no
point<00:00:55.739> playing<00:00:56.010> if<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.489> are<00:00:56.879> playing<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.210> lose

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
point playing if you are playing to lose

differently in the early game they were

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.460 
differently in the early game they were
our<00:02:45.030> head<00:02:45.239> but<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.660> feel<00:02:45.989> like<00:02:46.080> they<00:02:46.230> could<00:02:46.290> have

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
our head but I feel like they could have

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.590 
our head but I feel like they could have
gotten<00:02:46.620> even<00:02:46.950> more<00:02:47.100> head<00:02:47.370> maybe<00:02:47.519> I<00:02:47.760> felt<00:02:48.450> like

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
gotten even more head maybe I felt like

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.720 
gotten even more head maybe I felt like
shook<00:02:48.870> spent<00:02:49.260> most<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.650> game<00:02:49.830> standing<00:02:50.670> on

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
shook spent most of the game standing on

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.430 
shook spent most of the game standing on
words<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.299> that<00:02:51.420> was<00:02:51.569> partly<00:02:51.900> because<00:02:52.080> in<00:02:52.319> an

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
words and that was partly because in an

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.770 
words and that was partly because in an
upgrade<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:53.370> sweeper<00:02:53.819> at<00:02:53.940> any<00:02:54.090> point<00:02:54.269> I<00:02:54.510> like

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
upgrade to sweeper at any point I like

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.539 
upgrade to sweeper at any point I like
he<00:02:54.989> kept<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.769> warding<00:02:56.069> told<00:02:56.250> him<00:02:56.370> for<00:02:56.519> a

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
he kept the warding told him for a

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.280 
he kept the warding told him for a
really<00:02:56.760> long<00:02:57.000> time<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.660> I<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:58.019> actually

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
really long time and I I actually

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.539 
really long time and I I actually
thought<00:02:58.590> he<00:02:58.650> was<00:02:58.830> going<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.010> upgrade<00:02:59.160> it<00:02:59.400> at

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
thought he was going to upgrade it at

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:00.770 
thought he was going to upgrade it at
least<00:02:59.670> have<00:02:59.910> some<00:03:00.090> day<00:03:00.239> wishing<00:03:00.599> you<00:03:00.630> know

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
least have some day wishing you know

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.140 
least have some day wishing you know
when<00:03:00.930> Natalie<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.620> can<00:03:01.650> jump<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.130> on<00:03:02.280> word<00:03:02.489> but

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
when Natalie you can jump in on word but

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.089 
when Natalie you can jump in on word but
in<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.690> end<00:03:03.780> he<00:03:03.900> didn't<00:03:04.260> like<00:03:04.440> he<00:03:04.890> just

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
in the end he didn't like he just

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.289 
in the end he didn't like he just
swapped<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.519> sweeper<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.060> didn't<00:03:06.269> even

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
swapped to sweeper and didn't even

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.059 
swapped to sweeper and didn't even
upgraded<00:03:06.780> so<00:03:07.049> like<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.380> vision<00:03:07.620> game<00:03:07.739> was<00:03:07.890> a

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
upgraded so like the vision game was a

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.470 
upgraded so like the vision game was a
bit<00:03:08.250> weird<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:08.640> mean<00:03:08.940> I<00:03:09.030> think<00:03:09.060> that's<00:03:09.299> really

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
bit weird I mean I think that's really

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.180 
bit weird I mean I think that's really
good<00:03:09.569> play<00:03:09.720> by<00:03:09.840> cyanide<00:03:10.200> it's<00:03:10.410> okay<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:10.920> go

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
good play by cyanide it's okay to go

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.949 
good play by cyanide it's okay to go

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.190 
the deepest but at no point where cast
and<00:03:17.670> shook<00:03:17.850> kind<00:03:18.420> of<00:03:18.510> working<00:03:18.750> together<00:03:18.840> to

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
and shook kind of working together to

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.539 
and shook kind of working together to
get<00:03:19.320> that<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.590> vision<00:03:19.980> they<00:03:20.100> were<00:03:20.160> also

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
get that the vision they were also

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.880 
get that the vision they were also
warding<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.720> same<00:03:21.900> areas<00:03:22.200> very<00:03:22.290> often<00:03:22.650> at<00:03:22.769> one

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
warding the same areas very often at one

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.680 
warding the same areas very often at one
point<00:03:23.130> they<00:03:23.310> had<00:03:23.400> four<00:03:23.760> words<00:03:24.060> on<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.209> single

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
point they had four words on a single

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.690 
point they had four words on a single
say<00:03:25.320> screen<00:03:25.650> like<00:03:25.829> if<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:26.220> have<00:03:26.370> your<00:03:26.489> screen

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
say screen like if you have your screen

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.280 
say screen like if you have your screen
over<00:03:26.880> yet<00:03:27.030> four<00:03:27.359> words<00:03:27.570> even<00:03:27.780> two<00:03:27.989> in<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.140> same

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
over yet four words even two in the same

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.110 
over yet four words even two in the same
brush<00:03:28.500> so<00:03:28.620> very<00:03:28.829> inefficient<00:03:29.220> warding<00:03:29.700> the

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
brush so very inefficient warding the

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.580 
brush so very inefficient warding the
wolves<00:03:30.359> and<00:03:30.450> that's<00:03:30.600> why<00:03:30.870> this<00:03:30.930> game<00:03:31.200> kind<00:03:31.500> of

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
wolves and that's why this game kind of

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.440 
wolves and that's why this game kind of
stalled<00:03:31.829> out<00:03:32.010> until<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.700> inevitable<00:03:32.970> yeah

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
stalled out until the inevitable yeah

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.660 
stalled out until the inevitable yeah

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
instead of teleporting on a minion which

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.969 
instead of teleporting on a minion which
you<00:04:18.180> can<00:04:18.299> always<00:04:18.660> do<00:04:18.900> he<00:04:19.320> teleported<00:04:19.769> on<00:04:19.889> the

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979

really hard to come back and then

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.190 
really hard to come back and then
magically<00:06:56.970> we<00:06:57.360> managed<00:06:57.630> to<00:06:57.660> steal<00:06:57.930> it<00:06:58.080> and

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:58.200

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:01.200 
then you get this rush of confidence and

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:07.230 
then you get this rush of confidence and
you<00:07:01.290> feel<00:07:01.470> really<00:07:01.770> strong

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.240
