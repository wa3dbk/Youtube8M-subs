00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.220 
it says that it's on the Magic Mouse now
I<00:03:01.500> can<00:03:01.830> go<00:03:01.950> up<00:03:02.070> here<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:02.430> go<00:03:03.300> to<00:03:03.330> that<00:03:03.930> and

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
I can go up here and go to that and

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.140 
I can go up here and go to that and
disconnect<00:03:04.830> it<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.100> it'll<00:03:05.610> automatically

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
disconnect it and it'll automatically

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.880 
disconnect it and it'll automatically
switch<00:03:06.510> this<00:03:06.660> over<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.530> other<00:03:07.680> mouse

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
switch this over to the other mouse

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.730 
switch this over to the other mouse
that's<00:03:08.070> connected<00:03:08.550> see<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:09.840> there's<00:03:10.380> a

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
that's connected see and so there's a

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.310 
that's connected see and so there's a
button<00:03:11.070> 3<00:03:11.370> but<00:03:11.580> nothing's<00:03:11.880> set<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:12.780> so

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
button 3 but nothing's set to it and so

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.080 
button 3 but nothing's set to it and so
now<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:13.470> just<00:03:13.590> want<00:03:13.770> to<00:03:13.950> make<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.280> where<00:03:14.459> you

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
now I just want to make it to where you

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.180 
now I just want to make it to where you
know<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:15.209> can<00:03:15.480> use<00:03:15.510> it<00:03:15.810> just<00:03:15.840> like<00:03:16.050> I<00:03:16.200> did<00:03:17.040> with

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
know I can use it just like I did with

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.490 
know I can use it just like I did with
the<00:03:17.310> other<00:03:17.360> Mouse<00:03:18.360> so<00:03:18.750> I've<00:03:19.019> already<00:03:19.170> done<00:03:19.290> the

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
the other Mouse so I've already done the

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.259 
the other Mouse so I've already done the
Preferences<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.220> that<00:03:20.370> so<00:03:20.610> it's<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.060> same

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
Preferences to that so it's the same

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.840 
Preferences to that so it's the same
thing<00:03:21.540> you<00:03:21.750> just<00:03:21.780> hit<00:03:22.110> option<00:03:22.590> on<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.280> Mac<00:03:23.580> and

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
thing you just hit option on a Mac and

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.360 
thing you just hit option on a Mac and
then<00:03:23.940> holding<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.390> middle<00:03:24.630> button<00:03:25.370> and

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
then holding the middle button and

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.770 
then holding the middle button and
that's<00:03:26.910> pretty<00:03:27.060> much<00:03:27.269> it

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
that's pretty much it

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.690 
that's pretty much it
my<00:03:28.080> preference<00:03:28.560> is<00:03:28.800> still<00:03:29.040> using<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.370> Magic

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
my preference is still using the Magic

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.130 
my preference is still using the Magic
Mouse<00:03:29.880> just<00:03:30.150> because<00:03:30.390> I<00:03:30.480> like<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.750> way<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:30.900> can

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
Mouse just because I like the way I can

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.600 
Mouse just because I like the way I can
use<00:03:31.320> it<00:03:31.440> when<00:03:31.470> I'm<00:03:31.650> browsing<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:32.100> Internet<00:03:32.430> so

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
use it when I'm browsing the Internet so

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.710 
use it when I'm browsing the Internet so
I<00:03:32.670> want<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:32.910> go<00:03:33.030> back<00:03:33.180> and<00:03:33.300> forth<00:03:33.450> in<00:03:33.660> between

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
I want to go back and forth in between

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.930 
I want to go back and forth in between
them<00:03:34.110> I'll<00:03:35.100> probably<00:03:35.340> have<00:03:35.550> to<00:03:35.640> get<00:03:35.730> rid<00:03:35.880> of

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
them I'll probably have to get rid of

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.910 
them I'll probably have to get rid of
this<00:03:36.060> USB<00:03:36.510> mouse<00:03:36.720> but<00:03:37.050> maybe<00:03:37.170> I'll<00:03:37.380> find<00:03:37.769> a

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
this USB mouse but maybe I'll find a

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.740 
this USB mouse but maybe I'll find a
reason<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.250> use<00:03:38.370> it<00:03:38.489> later<00:03:38.610> but<00:03:39.330> if<00:03:39.450> you<00:03:39.570> do

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
reason to use it later but if you do

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.870 
reason to use it later but if you do
have<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.080> USB<00:03:40.350> mouse<00:03:40.680> it's<00:03:41.370> kind<00:03:41.550> of<00:03:41.580> easier

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
have the USB mouse it's kind of easier

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.449 
have the USB mouse it's kind of easier
to<00:03:42.030> use<00:03:42.239> because<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:43.680> middle<00:03:43.890> button<00:03:44.070> clicker

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
to use because the middle button clicker

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.370 
to use because the middle button clicker
is<00:03:44.760> exactly<00:03:45.390> in<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.630> middle<00:03:45.720> because<00:03:46.050> it's<00:03:46.290> a

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
is exactly in the middle because it's a

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.259 
is exactly in the middle because it's a
scroll<00:03:46.650> wheel<00:03:46.800> and<00:03:47.100> it<00:03:47.790> doesn't<00:03:48.060> get<00:03:48.120> in<00:03:48.239> the

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
scroll wheel and it doesn't get in the

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.580 
scroll wheel and it doesn't get in the
way<00:03:48.390> of<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.810> left<00:03:49.019> click<00:03:49.260> or<00:03:49.440> right<00:03:49.470> click

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
way of the left click or right click

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.770 
way of the left click or right click
because<00:03:50.370> sometimes<00:03:50.790> you<00:03:50.970> can<00:03:51.060> go<00:03:51.209> in<00:03:51.390> and

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
because sometimes you can go in and

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.940 
because sometimes you can go in and
think<00:03:51.989> that<00:03:52.140> you're<00:03:52.290> clicking<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.800> middle

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
think that you're clicking the middle

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.790 
think that you're clicking the middle
Mouse<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:53.880> it's<00:03:54.090> actually<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:55.200> left<00:03:55.650> click

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
Mouse and it's actually the left click

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.640 
Mouse and it's actually the left click
so<00:03:56.670> that's<00:03:57.120> pretty<00:03:57.300> much<00:03:57.450> it<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:57.870> links<00:03:58.560> are

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
so that's pretty much it and links are

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.470 
so that's pretty much it and links are
in<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.800> description<00:03:59.250> I<00:03:59.489> hope<00:03:59.760> that<00:04:00.060> you<00:04:00.330> guys
