00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
it's weird like I did this faction

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.319 
it's weird like I did this faction
thinking<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.560> was<00:01:40.829> like<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.369> sorcery

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
thinking that this was like the sorcery

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.590 
thinking that this was like the sorcery
faction<00:01:42.869> mm-hmm<00:01:43.439> but<00:01:44.070> it's<00:01:44.220> not<00:01:44.310> really<00:01:45.000> it's

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
faction mm-hmm but it's not really it's

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.960 
faction mm-hmm but it's not really it's
kind<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.259> mix<00:01:46.590> between<00:01:46.799> sorcery<00:01:47.640> and

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
kind of a mix between sorcery and

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.179 
kind of a mix between sorcery and
finesse<00:01:48.930> faction<00:01:50.210> because<00:01:51.210> um<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:52.130> there<00:01:53.130> a

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
finesse faction because um is there a

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.340 
finesse faction because um is there a
straight<00:01:53.579> sorcery<00:01:54.119> faction<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.869> don't<00:01:55.259> know

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
straight sorcery faction I don't know

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.410 
straight sorcery faction I don't know
yet<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.890> haven't<00:01:56.430> done<00:01:56.549> all<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.759> them<00:01:56.909> yet<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
yet I haven't done all of them yet the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.800 
yet I haven't done all of them yet the
so<00:01:57.990> um<00:01:58.430> this<00:01:59.430> isn't<00:01:59.700> even<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.090> first<00:02:00.180> faction

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
so um this isn't even the first faction

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.200 
so um this isn't even the first faction
that<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.990> come<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.469> but<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.829> hadn't<00:02:02.340> because
