00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
towards the very end we broke the

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.049 
towards the very end we broke the
gearbox<00:01:01.830> just<00:01:02.830> just<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.100> shift<00:01:03.370> linkage<00:01:03.520> so

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
gearbox just just the shift linkage so

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.690 
gearbox just just the shift linkage so
we<00:01:04.449> were<00:01:04.570> stuck<00:01:04.839> in<00:01:04.869> sixth<00:01:05.409> and<00:01:05.560> it<00:01:06.220> was<00:01:06.460> Jim

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
we were stuck in sixth and it was Jim

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.069 
we were stuck in sixth and it was Jim
there's<00:01:06.909> no<00:01:07.030> way<00:01:07.149> to<00:01:07.210> get<00:01:07.359> it<00:01:07.450> out<00:01:07.539> so<00:01:07.899> we<00:01:07.990> had

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:08.079 
there's no way to get it out so we had

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:10.319 
there's no way to get it out so we had
to<00:01:08.170> get<00:01:08.289> towed<00:01:08.499> back<00:01:08.710> in<00:01:08.979> sixth<00:01:09.340> gear<00:01:09.520> and<00:01:09.759> it

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
to get towed back in sixth gear and it

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:11.999 
to get towed back in sixth gear and it
ended<00:01:10.509> up<00:01:10.659> just<00:01:11.079> getting<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:11.439> clutch<00:01:11.590> so<00:01:11.829> hot

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
ended up just getting the clutch so hot

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:13.529 
ended up just getting the clutch so hot
that<00:01:12.159> it<00:01:12.219> sucked<00:01:12.850> together<00:01:13.090> so<00:01:13.299> the<00:01:13.390> clutch

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
that it sucked together so the clutch

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.599 
that it sucked together so the clutch
pedal<00:01:13.570> doesn't<00:01:14.320> do<00:01:14.530> its<00:01:14.679> job<00:01:14.890> as<00:01:15.130> far<00:01:15.490> as

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:15.609 
pedal doesn't do its job as far as

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.999 
pedal doesn't do its job as far as
disengaging<00:01:16.299> the<00:01:16.479> transmission<00:01:17.229> so<00:01:17.469> we're

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
disengaging the transmission so we're

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:19.950 
disengaging the transmission so we're
going<00:01:18.100> to<00:01:18.189> be<00:01:18.249> starting<00:01:18.429> this<00:01:18.700> stage<00:01:18.939> with<00:01:19.840> the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960

an issue how was it yeah the first pass
the<00:03:07.660> first<00:03:07.930> stage<00:03:08.170> is<00:03:08.440> really<00:03:08.739> good<00:03:08.890> clean<00:03:09.820> run

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
the first stage is really good clean run

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.210 
the first stage is really good clean run
there's<00:03:10.720> some<00:03:10.900> really<00:03:11.170> tight<00:03:11.560> corners<00:03:12.070> in

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
there's some really tight corners in

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.430

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
their back to first gear probably 20

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.500 
their back to first gear probably 20
times<00:03:14.680> in<00:03:14.950> there<00:03:15.130> and<00:03:15.910> it<00:03:16.060> just<00:03:16.239> felt<00:03:16.450> like

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
times in there and it just felt like

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.780 
times in there and it just felt like
what<00:03:16.840> down<00:03:17.050> on<00:03:17.230> power<00:03:17.470> because<00:03:18.010> on<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.430> rocky

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
what down on power because on the rocky

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.789 
what down on power because on the rocky
the<00:03:19.030> road<00:03:19.209> was<00:03:19.390> really<00:03:19.840> wet<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:20.260> then<00:03:20.500> now

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
the road was really wet and then now

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.289 
the road was really wet and then now
it's<00:03:21.010> all<00:03:21.250> dried<00:03:21.549> out<00:03:21.580> so<00:03:21.940> there's<00:03:22.090> a<00:03:22.120> lot<00:03:22.239> of

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
it's all dried out so there's a lot of

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.210 
it's all dried out so there's a lot of
grip<00:03:22.570> so<00:03:23.230> it<00:03:23.290> was<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.410> bit<00:03:23.560> of<00:03:23.650> a<00:03:23.709> challenge<00:03:23.920> the

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
grip so it was a bit of a challenge the

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.610 
grip so it was a bit of a challenge the
second<00:03:24.580> one<00:03:24.730> was<00:03:24.760> really<00:03:25.150> fast<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:25.900> yeah<00:03:26.470> we

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
second one was really fast and yeah we

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.590 
second one was really fast and yeah we
lost<00:03:26.739> quite<00:03:27.010> a<00:03:27.070> lot<00:03:27.190> of<00:03:27.370> time<00:03:27.610> in<00:03:27.790> there<00:03:27.970> and

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
lost quite a lot of time in there and

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.360 
lost quite a lot of time in there and
then<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:28.900> third<00:03:29.080> stage<00:03:29.380> reverse<00:03:29.920> of<00:03:30.130> stage

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
then the third stage reverse of stage

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.190 
then the third stage reverse of stage
one<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:31.060> was<00:03:31.180> good<00:03:31.360> again<00:03:31.480> we've<00:03:31.840> got<00:03:31.959> quite<00:03:32.080> a

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
one it was good again we've got quite a

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.710 
one it was good again we've got quite a
lot<00:03:32.380> of<00:03:32.500> dust<00:03:32.680> that<00:03:32.950> time<00:03:33.190> but<00:03:33.970> probably<00:03:34.420> not

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
lot of dust that time but probably not

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.360 
lot of dust that time but probably not
as<00:03:34.900> bad<00:03:35.200> as<00:03:35.380> some<00:03:35.500> of<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.680> other<00:03:35.860> competitors

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
as bad as some of the other competitors

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.610 
as bad as some of the other competitors
fair<00:03:37.209> enough<00:03:37.480> so<00:03:38.019> a<00:03:38.049> lot<00:03:38.200> of<00:03:38.230> people<00:03:38.380> in<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.590> US

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
fair enough so a lot of people in the US

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.670 
fair enough so a lot of people in the US
