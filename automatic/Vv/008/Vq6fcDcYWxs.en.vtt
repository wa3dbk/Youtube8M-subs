serve relaxation and Sochi it's going to

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.330 
serve relaxation and Sochi it's going to
be<00:00:41.870> the<00:00:41.960> opposite<00:00:42.320> we<00:00:42.469> have<00:00:42.590> to<00:00:42.739> travel<00:00:42.980> a<00:00:43.190> long

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
be the opposite we have to travel a long

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.440 
be the opposite we have to travel a long
ways<00:00:43.579> you<00:00:43.760> have<00:00:43.879> to<00:00:43.910> go<00:00:44.030> through<00:00:44.180> a<00:00:44.270> lot<00:00:44.420> of

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
ways you have to go through a lot of

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.630 
ways you have to go through a lot of
security<00:00:44.780> checks<00:00:45.170> the<00:00:45.800> ski<00:00:46.040> rooms<00:00:46.219> are<00:00:46.430> all

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
security checks the ski rooms are all

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.540 
security checks the ski rooms are all
constrained<00:00:47.210> to<00:00:47.329> one<00:00:47.510> area<00:00:47.980> and<00:00:48.980> then<00:00:49.370> there's

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
constrained to one area and then there's

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.590 
constrained to one area and then there's
the<00:00:49.670> weather<00:00:49.820> you<00:00:50.030> know<00:00:50.149> we're<00:00:50.300> dealing<00:00:50.390> with

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
the weather you know we're dealing with

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.299 
the weather you know we're dealing with
weather<00:00:50.870> here<00:00:51.200> but<00:00:51.410> Sochi<00:00:51.649> I<00:00:51.829> think<00:00:52.070> is<00:00:52.160> gonna

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
weather here but Sochi I think is gonna

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.000 
weather here but Sochi I think is gonna
be<00:00:52.399> a<00:00:52.550> challenge<00:00:52.940> with<00:00:53.239> weather<00:00:53.480> also<00:00:54.010> you

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
be a challenge with weather also you

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.610 
be a challenge with weather also you
know<00:00:55.129> for<00:00:55.309> me<00:00:55.430> it's<00:00:55.610> probably<00:00:55.969> better<00:00:56.620> we

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
know for me it's probably better we

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.020 
know for me it's probably better we
dealt<00:00:57.860> with<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.039> same<00:00:58.219> thing<00:00:58.430> in<00:00:58.520> Vancouver<00:00:59.000> I

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
dealt with the same thing in Vancouver I

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.490 
dealt with the same thing in Vancouver I
have<00:00:59.270> a<00:00:59.300> lot<00:00:59.449> of<00:00:59.539> experience<00:01:00.020> that's<00:01:00.230> kind<00:01:00.440> of

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
have a lot of experience that's kind of

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.639 
have a lot of experience that's kind of
I<00:01:00.739> know<00:01:01.100> how<00:01:01.489> to<00:01:01.750> to<00:01:02.750> be<00:01:02.899> ready<00:01:03.109> and<00:01:03.320> prepared

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
I know how to to be ready and prepared

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.170 
I know how to to be ready and prepared
for<00:01:03.800> a<00:01:03.859> race<00:01:04.009> and<00:01:04.280> then<00:01:04.399> when<00:01:04.610> it's<00:01:04.729> canceled

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
for a race and then when it's canceled

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.630 
for a race and then when it's canceled
just<00:01:06.050> relax<00:01:06.410> and<00:01:06.710> wait<00:01:06.830> and<00:01:07.100> then<00:01:07.160> be<00:01:07.369> ready<00:01:07.550> to

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
just relax and wait and then be ready to

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.800 
just relax and wait and then be ready to
the<00:01:07.700> next<00:01:07.910> day<00:01:08.030> and<00:01:08.180> a<00:01:08.210> lot<00:01:08.330> of<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:08.509> young<00:01:08.630> guys

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
the next day and a lot of the young guys

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.290 
the next day and a lot of the young guys
I<00:01:09.020> think<00:01:09.229> over<00:01:10.220> time<00:01:10.250> that<00:01:10.700> really<00:01:10.789> wears<00:01:11.090> them

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
I think over time that really wears them

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.670 
I think over time that really wears them
out<00:01:11.360> because<00:01:11.600> they're<00:01:11.869> there<00:01:12.110> to<00:01:12.259> read<00:01:12.440> each

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
out because they're there to read each

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.400 
out because they're there to read each
day<00:01:12.950> so<00:01:13.450> you<00:01:14.450> know<00:01:14.539> I<00:01:14.599> think<00:01:14.840> it's<00:01:15.110> gonna<00:01:15.229> be<00:01:15.380> a

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
day so you know I think it's gonna be a

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.880 
day so you know I think it's gonna be a
challenge<00:01:15.800> but<00:01:15.979> it<00:01:16.099> sets<00:01:16.340> up<00:01:16.520> well<00:01:16.640> for<00:01:16.849> me

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.510 

my<00:01:20.880> goals<00:01:21.150> are<00:01:21.470> pretty<00:01:22.470> high<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.100> suppose

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
my goals are pretty high I suppose

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.800 
my goals are pretty high I suppose
especially<00:01:24.000> considering<00:01:24.360> we<00:01:24.420> haven't<00:01:24.570> won<00:01:24.780> a

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
especially considering we haven't won a

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.350 
especially considering we haven't won a
race<00:01:24.900> yet<00:01:25.230> this<00:01:25.380> year<00:01:25.620> but<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:26.580> go<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.210> there

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
race yet this year but I go in there

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.690 
race yet this year but I go in there
hoping<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.050> win<00:01:28.230> in<00:01:28.500> four<00:01:29.190> events<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.670> think

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
hoping to win in four events I think

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.090 
hoping to win in four events I think
giant<00:01:30.330> slalom<00:01:30.510> super-g<00:01:31.380> downhill<00:01:31.980> and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
giant slalom super-g downhill and

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.040 
giant slalom super-g downhill and
combined<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.730> we're<00:01:33.300> gonna<00:01:33.420> go<00:01:33.600> practice

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
combined and we're gonna go practice

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.090 
combined and we're gonna go practice
some<00:01:34.200> small<00:01:34.410> them<00:01:34.530> right<00:01:34.650> now<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.950> hopefully

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
some small them right now and hopefully

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.330 
some small them right now and hopefully
bring<00:01:35.550> that<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.880> five<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.360> five<00:01:36.540> events<00:01:37.340> slalom

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
bring that to five to five events slalom

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.460 
bring that to five to five events slalom
is<00:01:38.490> one<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.820> one<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:39.600> Olympic<00:01:39.780> medals

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
I don't have and you know obviously I'd

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.649 
I don't have and you know obviously I'd
love<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.530> complete<00:01:43.890> set

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.709 

you<00:01:47.530> know<00:01:47.649> the<00:01:47.799> Olympics<00:01:48.159> especially<00:01:48.700> for<00:01:48.969> an

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
you know the Olympics especially for an

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:52.139 
you know the Olympics especially for an
American<00:01:50.259> is<00:01:50.439> the<00:01:50.920> pinnacle<00:01:51.280> of<00:01:51.579> sports<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:52.060> I

American is the pinnacle of sports and I

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.450 
American is the pinnacle of sports and I

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
think it is for everyone but for us when

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.370 
think it is for everyone but for us when
we<00:01:54.579> race<00:01:54.729> World<00:01:55.030> Cup<00:01:55.270> we<00:01:55.479> have<00:01:55.689> the<00:01:56.200> most

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
we race World Cup we have the most

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.770 
we race World Cup we have the most
difficult<00:01:56.920> field<00:01:57.310> in<00:01:57.700> a<00:01:58.090> regular<00:01:58.420> World<00:01:58.630> Cup
