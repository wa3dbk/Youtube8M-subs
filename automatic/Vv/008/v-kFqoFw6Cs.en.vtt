00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.730
 Hello 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.529
 he designed it and well this is a very good 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.360
 option that as moms or dads we can 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.070
 do to decorate now that the 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.779
 folders of our children to leave us 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.930
 Ramiro's is going to tell us how to go forward 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.670
 thank you friends like you here in 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.439
 design shop let's go practicing 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.010
 with our airbrush our brush 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.110
 air 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.910
 now let's apply it for a 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.370
 decorative and personalized question a 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.050
 school folder good school folder 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.400
 you know there are times when 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.920
 they come already with certain prints 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.230
 printed the question is that we 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.820
 we personalize it that is with something 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.379
 with some reason that we like and about 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.089
 everything we can say we did it with 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.589
 our airbrush because we have been 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.920
 practicing watching design store 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.720
 now what I recommend a lot of that 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.070
 obviously the material I have always 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.500
 commented that the material has to be 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.760
 of quality I already have here traced what 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.860
 It is my pencil what we're going to make a 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.330
 work in third dimension first thing 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.729
 I have already done once because of 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.619
 have drawn the pencil cut it cut the 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.619
 mask we are going to lift it 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.890
 and what we are going to do is put a 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.179
 small white tone base that's going to 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.920
 allow the next tone 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:22.920
 obviously look a little more intense 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.900
 we do our depression test here 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.070
 and we started to put a white base 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.189
 what follows is to put a tone base 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.689
 ocher or even yellow simulating the 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.689
 pencils that sell the stationeries 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.590
 in this way 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.770
 here what they are going to do is already support 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.020
 to be with another sheet of paper or with the 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.460
 same pencil face mask we are going to make 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.950
 a little what is the shadow since the 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.350
 pencils have a form this as a 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.069
 pentagon or a hexagon what are we going to 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.179
 to do is put a line a bit more 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.179
 intense more marked 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.250
 that's what is going to start giving us 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.880
 peace on the size of the pencil 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.200
 pencil shadow and key 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.480
 let's mark a little bit here you can see 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.739
 a little bit Czech but not a 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.360
 problem 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.940
 remember that here they remember that 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.270
 here there is no such mistake is just a couple of 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.800
 small accidents accidents this 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.810
 casual is that we can occupy it for 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.420
 to be able to make our design a little more 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.790
 fun if you realize I already have here 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.239
 a base and what is the pencil what 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.239
 let's do 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.739
 is to lift that mask 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.140
 let's lift it 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.250
 and what we're going to do is put this 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.080
 other 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.210
 again trying to plant the most 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.010
 which can 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.690
 and what we are going to do now with a tone 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.330
 dark can be a dark gray even 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.880
 until black here are you going to control 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.930
 the pulse will sit the line more 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.340
 as thin as you can and what they are going to 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.630
 to do is put the trachea in a small 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.630
 shadow on the outside 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.030
 when they are removed they will see that it is already seen as a 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.580
 object on post as the folder that 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.019
 we saw a while ago now look at me from 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.340
 done I was also properties of 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.810
 that apart from the pencil they could 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.860
 put on a blog page as if 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.209
 they would have ripped a sheet from a 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.489
 notebook they have put it on top of the 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.269
 folder that we will do the same 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:44.209
 we cut one a leaf cut out this 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:47.780
 what is part of our sheet of 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.670
 folder we paste it this way even 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.900
 If they saw the court irregularly 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.670
 that looks like they ripped it 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.670
 you the notebook 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.989
 suppose a little more airbrush the 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.989
 black ink residue 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.430
 here maybe you realize that 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.050
 the steps are a bit quick but they 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.120
 I invite you to enter a very useful dotcom 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.660
 they will be able to see with a little more detail 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.400
 the works 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.290
 and above all remember that they have to 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.600
 practice here there is no pattern to follow 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.600
 you encourage yourself to do your 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.600
 decorations 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.190
 and there says the saying that throwing 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.169
 to lose is learned thus we initiate all 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.090
 it has even happened to me that I do not know 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.979
 concerned the question is of you 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.630
 encourage this continue to send our 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.060
 photos return to email for 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.650
 can give more or less tips and 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.300
 can you tell them what is there 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.710
 past or that one what was the error so 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.900
 what do you maybe work 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.190
 it's not that they were not satisfied 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.710
 but it does not matter here the question is 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:47.100
 practice and above all that you are 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:49.930
 encourage you to make your own designs 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.449
 we have here a base already of the sheet 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.800
 others we are going to put them on and we are going to 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.479
 proceed to do the same thing that we did 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.780
 with the pencil we will try to put a 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.520
 shadow 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.980
 there is work with the dimensions 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.350
 remember that the decoration should not 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.750
 to be totally flat has to be a 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.250
 work that you see that has been done with 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.410
 the airbrush but with the objects 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.990
 apparently they are put there but not 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.520
 they are everything is a dimension of the paper 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.650
 but we are trying to carry 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.240
 towards a third dimension here we go 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.740
 Here what I can recommend is that 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.930
 can even detail what is the 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.910
 pencil gum the part of the pencil 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.460
 we can put a rubber like on the letter 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.770
 I have here 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.509
 if You see her 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.460
 the apex of the stem lakes was detailed 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:32.650
 even with the red lines as if 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.539
 out a blog page and here the rubber 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.009
 here they could have also put a 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:38.289
 clip you can do everything you 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.509
 everything you can imagine can paint it 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:43.030
 with his airbrush and above all it is 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:44.949
 that impress our friends 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.050
 it really looks in third dimension 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:49.990
 above all what that being says as the 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.710
 Clear relief looks like this post a 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.280
 object 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.280
 exactly 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.240
 a little in doing so is that if 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.770
 done the detail obviously, well, not what 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.270
 will be giving according to experience 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.680
 have one and one conscious enough 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.150
 sure will it take things a 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.830
 hyperrealism practically that yes 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.510
 what do you think if now we go conscious 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:15.180
 here we are going to now that the 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:15.180
 glazing techniques forward yes
