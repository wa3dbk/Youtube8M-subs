00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.910 

I<00:00:44.820> think<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> go-kart<00:00:46.260> really<00:00:46.589> is<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
I think the go-kart really is the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.979 
I think the go-kart really is the
closest<00:00:47.489> thing<00:00:47.699> that<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.390> can<00:00:48.539> get<00:00:48.750> to

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
closest thing that you can get to

00:00:48.989 --> 00:01:02.950 
closest thing that you can get to
driving<00:00:49.289> an<00:00:49.559> Indy<00:00:49.710> car

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.329 

driving<00:01:03.960> them<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.379> very<00:01:04.589> similar<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.159> mean

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
driving them it's very similar I mean

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.800 
driving them it's very similar I mean
they<00:01:05.460> feel<00:01:05.870> really<00:01:06.870> the<00:01:06.990> same<00:01:07.229> as<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:08.159> champ<00:01:08.580> car

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.240 

it's<00:01:12.810> just<00:01:13.050> a<00:01:13.140> lot<00:01:13.320> lighter<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> little<00:01:14.100> bit

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
it's just a lot lighter so a little bit

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.330 
it's just a lot lighter so a little bit
more<00:01:14.430> forgiving

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.520 

as<00:01:20.340> far<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:20.640> setups<00:01:21.150> up<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.720> mean<00:01:22.050> what<00:01:22.229> these

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
as far as setups up I mean what these

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.580 
as far as setups up I mean what these
kids<00:01:22.800> and<00:01:23.040> young<00:01:23.490> guys<00:01:23.700> are<00:01:23.909> learning<00:01:24.590> driving

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
kids and young guys are learning driving

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.930 
kids and young guys are learning driving
go-karts<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.010> setting<00:01:26.310> them<00:01:26.370> up<00:01:26.490> it's<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
go-karts and setting them up it's the

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.190 
go-karts and setting them up it's the
same<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.390> champ<00:01:27.630> car<00:01:27.810> it's<00:01:27.990> just<00:01:28.140> you

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
same as the champ car it's just you

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.430 
same as the champ car it's just you
don't<00:01:28.380> have<00:01:28.470> shots<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:29.160> you<00:01:29.670> know

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:02:08.450 

it's<00:01:33.830> very<00:01:34.070> similar<00:01:34.370> it's<00:01:34.670> just<00:01:34.850> a<00:01:34.970> mini

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:35.990
