simple<00:01:06.470> workspace<00:01:08.180> if<00:01:09.180> we<00:01:09.299> go<00:01:09.450> into<00:01:09.570> Windows

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
simple workspace if we go into Windows

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.499 
simple workspace if we go into Windows
we<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.560> modify<00:01:11.009> by<00:01:11.369> going<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.790> workspace<00:01:12.270> and

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
we can modify by going to workspace and

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.029 
we can modify by going to workspace and
switch<00:01:12.930> for<00:01:13.200> example<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.680> Advanced<00:01:14.100> Mode<00:01:14.460> or

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:16.039 
switch for example to Advanced Mode or

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:20.870 
switch for example to Advanced Mode or
you<00:01:17.039> can<00:01:17.219> also<00:01:17.490> going<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.829> avoid<00:01:19.829> it<00:01:20.039> or<00:01:20.219> save

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
you can also going and avoid it or save

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.719 
you can also going and avoid it or save
workspace<00:01:21.179> after<00:01:21.810> your<00:01:21.929> customized<00:01:22.579> and<00:01:23.579> it

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
workspace after your customized and it

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.480 
workspace after your customized and it
will<00:01:23.909> use<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.420> some<00:01:24.659> pre<00:01:25.140> created<00:01:25.439> at<00:01:25.889> once<00:01:26.219> and

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
will use it some pre created at once and

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.669 
will use it some pre created at once and

to the errors we have it

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.379 
to the errors we have it
Ballu<00:01:49.079> kind<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.889> colors<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.310> we<00:01:50.639> can<00:01:50.819> talk<00:01:51.149> to

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:51.389 
Ballu kind of colors so we can talk to

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:54.590 
Ballu kind of colors so we can talk to
this<00:01:51.509> place<00:01:51.780> as<00:01:52.289> well<00:01:52.829> some<00:01:53.219> will<00:01:54.090> appear<00:01:54.420> like

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
this place as well some will appear like

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.349 
this place as well some will appear like
on<00:01:54.630> our<00:01:54.869> side<00:01:55.109> right<00:01:55.289> here<00:01:55.649> additional<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:57.060> it

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:57.359 
on our side right here additional so it

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:59.449 
on our side right here additional so it
this<00:01:57.539> is<00:01:57.749> kind<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.109> showing<00:01:58.529> where<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.219> can

00:01:59.449 --> 00:01:59.459 
this is kind of showing where you can

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:01.190 
this is kind of showing where you can
place<00:01:59.819> and<00:02:00.179> don't<00:02:00.359> so<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.659> can<00:02:00.840> Rick

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
place and don't so you can Rick

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.529 
place and don't so you can Rick
customize<00:02:01.799> them<00:02:02.039> for<00:02:02.609> example<00:02:02.819> I<00:02:03.060> can<00:02:03.329> take

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
customize them for example I can take

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.260 
customize them for example I can take
this<00:02:04.350> animation<00:02:04.950> go<00:02:05.130> on<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.340> top<00:02:05.609> and<00:02:05.880> put

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
this animation go on the top and put

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.020 
this animation go on the top and put
maybe<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:07.079> know<00:02:07.229> just<00:02:07.469> on<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.280> back<00:02:08.490> regular

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
maybe you know just on the back regular

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.650 
maybe you know just on the back regular
side<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:10.050> there<00:02:10.380> I<00:02:10.619> added<00:02:11.190> them<00:02:11.370> if<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.420> want

they<00:02:12.840> can<00:02:13.020> undock<00:02:13.980> them<00:02:14.220> again<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.120> click<00:02:15.420> on

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
they can undock them again a click on

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.150 
they can undock them again a click on
the<00:02:15.690> side<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.230> can<00:02:16.260> notice<00:02:16.530> all<00:02:16.740> right

bit flexible this way as well we can

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
bit flexible this way as well we can
readjust<00:02:44.780> extend<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:46.250> decreasing<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.600> one
