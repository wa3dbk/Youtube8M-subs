and hopefully it'll be easy to get to

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:17.060 
and hopefully it'll be easy to get to
run<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.940> doors<00:02:15.180> still<00:02:15.420> shut<00:02:15.630> like<00:02:15.780> new<00:02:16.070> so

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
run the doors still shut like new so

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.340 
run the doors still shut like new so
first<00:02:18.060> step<00:02:18.329> in<00:02:18.510> getting<00:02:18.540> an<00:02:18.870> old<00:02:18.959> motor<00:02:19.170> like

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
first step in getting an old motor like

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.560 
first step in getting an old motor like
this<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:20.160> run<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:21.090> make<00:02:21.209> sure<00:02:21.329> it<00:02:21.450> turns

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
this is to run to make sure it turns

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.650 
this is to run to make sure it turns
over<00:02:21.810> one<00:02:22.170> we<00:02:22.350> did<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:24.180> change<00:02:24.480> the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
over one we did that to is to change the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.910 
over one we did that to is to change the
oil<00:02:24.690> so<00:02:25.140> we're<00:02:25.230> going<00:02:25.320> to<00:02:25.410> go<00:02:25.530> ahead<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.769> do

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
oil so we're going to go ahead and do

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.050 
oil so we're going to go ahead and do
that<00:02:25.950> I'm<00:02:26.220> not<00:02:26.370> going<00:02:26.489> to<00:02:26.579> record<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:27.030> just

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
that I'm not going to record that just

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.090 
that I'm not going to record that just
because<00:02:27.570> you<00:02:28.410> guys<00:02:28.590> should<00:02:28.799> know<00:02:28.920> how<00:02:29.040> to

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
because you guys should know how to

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.580 
because you guys should know how to
change<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.489> oil

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.790 

so<00:02:34.190> we<00:02:34.760> changed<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.510> oil<00:02:35.599> the<00:02:36.319> next<00:02:36.470> thing<00:02:36.739> I

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
so we changed the oil the next thing I

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.740 
so we changed the oil the next thing I
like<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:37.010> do<00:02:37.250> is<00:02:37.370> pull<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.790> spark<00:02:38.030> plugs<00:02:38.390> and

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
like to do is pull the spark plugs and

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.740 
like to do is pull the spark plugs and
take<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.290> look<00:02:39.560> so<00:02:39.739> I<00:02:39.770> pulled<00:02:40.069> this<00:02:41.000> one<00:02:41.209> out<00:02:41.270> and

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
take a look so I pulled this one out and

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.610 
take a look so I pulled this one out and
if<00:02:41.870> you<00:02:41.989> look<00:02:42.230> at<00:02:42.440> it<00:02:42.620> I<00:02:42.830> mean<00:02:43.819> it's<00:02:43.940> not<00:02:44.090> oily

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
if you look at it I mean it's not oily

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.380 
if you look at it I mean it's not oily
but<00:02:45.620> it's<00:02:45.770> in<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.459> know<00:02:46.550> pretty<00:02:46.819> decent<00:02:47.209> shape

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
but it's in you know pretty decent shape

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.630 
but it's in you know pretty decent shape
for<00:02:47.630> what<00:02:47.750> it<00:02:47.840> is<00:02:47.989> but<00:02:48.260> yes<00:02:48.980> new<00:02:49.190> plugs<00:02:49.489> are

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
for what it is but yes new plugs are

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.070 
for what it is but yes new plugs are
definitely<00:02:50.030> in<00:02:50.150> order<00:02:51.010> so<00:02:52.450> just<00:02:53.450> pull<00:02:53.660> out<00:02:53.690> of

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
definitely in order so just pull out of

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.720 
definitely in order so just pull out of
a<00:02:54.170> mountain<00:02:54.349> and<00:02:54.680> check<00:02:54.890> them<00:02:55.069> out<00:02:55.220> make<00:02:55.550> sure

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
a mountain and check them out make sure

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.940 
a mountain and check them out make sure
there's<00:02:55.970> no<00:02:56.090> oil<00:02:56.470> you<00:02:57.470> know<00:02:57.530> they<00:02:57.650> don't<00:02:57.739> look

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
there's no oil you know they don't look

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.620 
there's no oil you know they don't look
that<00:02:58.099> I<00:02:58.190> found<00:02:58.550> nothing<00:02:58.790> like<00:02:59.060> that<00:02:59.269> so

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
that I found nothing like that so

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.750 
that I found nothing like that so
there's<00:02:59.840> that<00:03:00.050> one<00:03:00.260> also<00:03:00.830> another<00:03:01.310> thing<00:03:01.550> you

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
there's that one also another thing you

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.330 
there's that one also another thing you
can<00:03:01.880> do<00:03:02.060> is<00:03:02.180> check<00:03:02.739> between<00:03:03.739> your<00:03:04.010> old<00:03:04.160> ones

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
can do is check between your old ones

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.580 
can do is check between your old ones
new<00:03:04.580> ones<00:03:04.790> these<00:03:05.090> ones<00:03:05.150> there's<00:03:06.049> a<00:03:06.140> little<00:03:06.470> bit

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
new ones these ones there's a little bit

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.759 
new ones these ones there's a little bit
of<00:03:06.620> difference<00:03:07.069> between<00:03:08.110> the<00:03:09.110> new<00:03:09.380> one<00:03:09.620> and

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
of difference between the new one and

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.380 
of difference between the new one and
the<00:03:09.890> old<00:03:09.920> one<00:03:10.220> but<00:03:10.610> honestly<00:03:11.030> I<00:03:11.120> don't<00:03:11.209> think

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
the old one but honestly I don't think

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.570 
the old one but honestly I don't think
they<00:03:11.630> make<00:03:11.810> these<00:03:11.989> anymore

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
they make these anymore

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.289 
they make these anymore
they<00:03:13.580> look<00:03:13.730> pretty<00:03:14.030> old<00:03:15.069> so<00:03:16.069> but<00:03:16.940> they'll<00:03:17.090> fit

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
they look pretty old so but they'll fit

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.320 
they look pretty old so but they'll fit
and<00:03:17.569> then<00:03:18.250> make<00:03:19.250> sure<00:03:19.280> your<00:03:19.519> gaps<00:03:19.730> correct<00:03:20.090> I

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
and then make sure your gaps correct I

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.320 
and then make sure your gaps correct I
believe<00:03:20.390> these<00:03:20.840> are<00:03:20.900> 0.35<00:03:21.650> for<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.310> gap<00:03:22.519> but

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
believe these are 0.35 for the gap but

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.539 
believe these are 0.35 for the gap but
I'm<00:03:23.420> gonna<00:03:23.540> go<00:03:23.690> ahead<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:23.900> do<00:03:24.080> all<00:03:24.310> all<00:03:25.310> eight

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
I'm gonna go ahead and do all all eight

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.990 
I'm gonna go ahead and do all all eight
of<00:03:25.700> them<00:03:25.849> and<00:03:26.090> then<00:03:26.840> after<00:03:27.170> that<00:03:27.610> we'll<00:03:28.610> get

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
of them and then after that we'll get

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.610 
of them and then after that we'll get
the<00:03:29.180> battery<00:03:29.510> itseif<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.019> motorized<00:03:30.319> spark

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
the battery itseif the motorized spark

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.550 
the battery itseif the motorized spark
turn<00:03:30.830> it<00:03:30.920> over<00:03:31.069> and<00:03:31.220> then<00:03:31.459> add<00:03:31.880> some<00:03:32.180> gas<00:03:32.560> also

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
turn it over and then add some gas also

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.380 
turn it over and then add some gas also
the<00:03:33.890> carburetor<00:03:34.370> down<00:03:34.880> there<00:03:35.120> already

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
the carburetor down there already

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.420 
the carburetor down there already
rebuilt<00:03:36.069> so<00:03:37.069> that<00:03:37.430> should<00:03:37.700> be<00:03:37.850> ready<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.239> go
