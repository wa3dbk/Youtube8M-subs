00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:10.790
 hertie is in march 22 02 and now with 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:13.099
 a ww2 likes yes it's about the day and 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.770
 Surroundings 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:19.970
 Let's say World War II sixth 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.380
 June 1944 Normandy 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.160
 and here you can see the landing craft of the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.279
 allied chiefly americans here 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.189
 the one with her long offers to the beach 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.780
 come and I have not only time now 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.380
 built the beach but also that 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.489
 behind you now let's see just everything 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.149
 that's the moc and then I'll start 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.760
 here at 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.750
 here is just a landing craft is there 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.450
 also in there 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.390
 The Allies are still in the boat here 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.739
 they all ran out and stuff like that 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.300
 that is synonymous damaged is a movie yes 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.860
 On the side of these things this is still 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.859
 all 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.390
 and then here the beach with armor 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.770
 barricade beach is a bit too 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.799
 succeeded but I had none 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.270
 You can see sandstones more on your people 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.930
 then here's one of his gun 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.270
 after loading here is a dead here 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.830
 This one has just two grenades 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.509
 This one here has taken one here 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.630
 weapon 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:25.040
 he chooses the same on the types in 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.350
 bunker shoot like salad after too 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.210
 I already had this one here 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.060
 Paramedic of the craft has this 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.759
 hurt then the position of the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.490
 German here is just such a 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.259
 ridge the bunker consists of 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.750
 a divorced more in it 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.220
 then there's a machine gun down here 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.130
 and because several German railway 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.890
 German soldiers is one dead 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.240
 there is just one so haphazard the 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.890
 I do not really believe whatg he did 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.960
 to do 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.640
 this hunt has got the chain from that 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.049
 you like hand and visa closes 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.520
 you also have a pot here 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.610
 Still grenades are very good for that 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.800
 quite appropriate and behind it 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.630
 thanks high goal but driveway 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.930
 so to speak, and now the error 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.180
 do away 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.540
 here should also drive and so on 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.280
 small house and right here is like that 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.440
 a small red wanted to pay where one 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.890
 howitzer is standing there empty again 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.410
 just after and then I'll do it now 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.820
 first left and over grass 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.100
 so stumps because the trees 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.650
 just like the wood 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.020
 needed and thus also clearer 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.850
 here are then as ammunition boxes 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.580
 put this machine on mg and wait 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.280
 the enemy then here is a small one 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:50.489
 bell tower otherwise there is one 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:55.140
 German sniper in there and then here 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:58.230
 a tank in the bushes hides the 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.650
 think pretty cool in the plane 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:05.370
 times yes because you come here to the 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.320
 the other side is right here 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.930
 Once a meadow there are dead animals 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.430
 it but they were even a fence the 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.310
 Wehrmacht soldiers have the animals 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.640
 That's why the blood falls as well 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.620
 is right here are two moerser with 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.930
 grenade two or the hot ones 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.610
 here goes on digging on there 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.170
 down there you are in the bunker 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.530
 there is also an mmg as you can see 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.260
 can 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.250
 there left of the house and then flower here 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.190
 crates are under one 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.790
 Supply items for the tank so 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.030
 here is a bucket 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.380
 then here is a siren and come 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.380
 we now in the interior of the house 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:51.450
 yes, it is built in the room 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.950
 There is a table with a croissant 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.970
 French a bottle and a radio 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:03.690
 for funk and so if I have a lounger 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:05.660
 window is very good even here 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:10.490
 then you run a grave 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:13.250
 I'll probably make it out of it 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.440
 time I'll show you show such a connection 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.600
 but me this is a swastika 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.540
 that's no, that 's normal cross 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.400
 was wanted now just simply all depends 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:27.920
 definitely make his rewards 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:30.560
 lok was just out, I still say 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.510
 just the roof here is also one 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.020
 I can show you the chimney again 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.970
 it has built up from below so there can 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.360
 you see, that's the one 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.960
 both of them will be in this and yes that 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:50.780
 it was actually with this mob 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:53.000
 See you in the next video and me 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.010
 would say thanks for seeing and 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.840
 always that then or if you me 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.840
