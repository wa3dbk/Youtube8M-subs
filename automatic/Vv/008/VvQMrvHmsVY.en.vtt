00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.830
 70 good afternoon dear colleagues 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.950
 professionals and lovers of beautiful nails 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.700
 Today I want to show and tell you 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.240
 about alignment of the nail plate under 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.349
 gel polish 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:23.100
 this is not building this is not modeling 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:25.590
 when faced with working with clients 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.070
 which have a flat nail plate or 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.020
 there are some deformations of the bumps that 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.870
 we can make it possible to align 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.239
 I do not cut off the nail plate 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.839
 so that in no case can you do for 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:45.030
 to make it even in my 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:47.460
 hands favorite suite it is for the eyes 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.620
 i.e. a finish with a sticky layer 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:56.600
 now I want to show you the texture 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:59.459
 bang and from gel polish here it is so thick 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.979
 that is, it can be almost even 

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:06.990
 lengthen the nail a little if you want 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:09.240
 aft and here I have gloss to finish 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.370
 with a sticky layer, he, too, is such 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.670
 thick ie can be leveled 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:17.700
 as a base for gel polish and upper 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.060
 coated already to make perfect highlights 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.490
 bring out add them top coat and 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.240
 I want to add volume to the nail 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.460
 attention here on the flat nail on 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.640
 dark background well riga we do not have here 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.670
 nor the highest point is not the volume that is, he 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.950
 does not have a springboard shaped 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.460
 there is he does not grow up but he is enough 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.520
 flat our client wants it to be 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.900
 volumetric form and we have everything 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.410
 opportunities for that 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.410
 looked like 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.619
 after drying the first layer we play 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.800
 a little bit 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:16.630
 material and put on the center ie in 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.600
 zone of the highest point where we want 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.959
 add volume and fix plane 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.959
 the nail 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:30.140
 go through all 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.790
 stretch along the perimeter slightly if 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.330
 you liquid material is not so thick 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.750
 tight comfortable like mine 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.170
 already 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:43.120
 the shape of the nail change a little bit i 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:48.050
 Threads here and so stretch and 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.690
 we distribute we form a nail 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:55.460
 if you watched liquid turn over 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.740
 hand like this upside down for speaking 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.040
 let the material flow into the brush itself 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:04.810
 help material you send with a brush and 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.420
 the slope of the finger is the area where 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.580
 it is necessary that he was 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.200
 then turn over wait for him 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.110
 distributed completely across 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:21.040
 surface with the help of you look at 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.040
 glare reflected on the nail 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.680
 around the perimeter here we have turned 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.990
 new let's see what we have 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.830
 It came out of our flat lot. at 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:39.080
 we have almost perfect shape 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.580
 natural nail with 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.770
 in the right place by the highest points and 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.870
 ready to apply decorative 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.720
 cover 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:54.170
