00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:04.940
 the forward steps are entirely made of aisi 304 steel and the 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.940
 latest rock n roll news. of the evening 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:25.779
 the machine is equipped with a speed variator to optimize the jam 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:26.739
 of hazelnuts 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.739
 almonds and any product 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.840
 the intake of air into the cavity of the rotation tank and how it went 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.930
 thun high speed refrigerating unit re the swelling of confetti by 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.590
 the issue of chocolate 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.110
 the next phase of enlargement 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.460
 is the so-called product wording 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.050
 for this reason the machine is equipped with a heating element that heats up 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.050
 the air during product rolling 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.800
 the third and final stage of processing the confit 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.140
 and lactate invoice and polishing of the confetti that will be carried out 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.140
 following our strict manual instruction 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.020
 the hot air is also used for the final cleaning of the pasta 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.880
 confit is entirely managed by a microprocessor LCD control 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.260
 that during the processing phases 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.130
 or check 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.740
 hot cold air temperature rotation area 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.740
 penultimate the percentage of a soldier 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.800
 the pork inside is rolled away 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.120
 it can come manually by means of a bag to cook a ladle or in today 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.830
 completely automatic 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.810
 with the appropriate left spray 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.950
 the spray system consists of a thermoregulated container on its own 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.940
 mounted on a wheeled steel structure to facilitate the 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.390
 positioning in front of the machine 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.790
 the most equipped accessory with a special more pulverized venturimeter 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.530
 inside the tub cavity 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.560
 the amounts of protein are train posted through the keyboard of 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.729
 command 

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:15.059
 thus allowing the machine to work independently 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.129
 with considerable savings in time and labor 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:24.269
 use of the spray system and glued to the commission of an air source 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:25.469
 tablet 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:30.229
 at no less than four trade fairs with fake foodstuffs is a consumption of 100 

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:33.229
 liters of compressed air minutoli 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:43.299
 andrea new to show some examples of sip account processing 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:47.400
 first of all we have to put our own inside the cavity 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.400
 product 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:52.959
 Polo shirt 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.959
 rootslush 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.139
 plum 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:04.650
 woman we follow the rotation of the tub was regulate have speed not 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:06.479
 less than 40 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:09.479
 and not more than 50% of laps 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:16.110
 immediately after the cold air and also my abba adjusted to a temperature of 6-8 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:17.319
 sloth 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.569
 this to speed up the red-bingo bingo operation then 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.009
 product 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:26.539
 we adjust the monster spray system we position it perfectly and 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:29.169
 we tend to 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:32.169
 Yup 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.959
 myself 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.060
 with regard 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.820
 here now after 45 minutes of processing how our product looks 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:47.749
 echo the product reached the optimal caliber with the right amount of 

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:48.949
 chocolate 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:52.559
 at this point we can proceed to smoothing the product 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:58.930
 we exclude the spray system we turn on the hot air at a temperature of 45 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.220
 ahahah d we restart the rotation of the tank and after 20 minutes the product 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:07.219
 will acquire a plastic consistency 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.969
 at this point the operator chosen to customize the product 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:15.679
 lowering the coluccio giving it 

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:19.949
 to polish the product is necessary estradiol to clean axis with the 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:20.699
 charity 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.699
 let's go and see now the cleanliness of the easter 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.750
 after the cleaning of the charity re-insert boh inside our product 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.479
 still soft 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.300
 reposition a tube 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.839
 we have the speed to turn on the cold air 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:52.409
 after about 40 minutes we could see the beginning of polishing 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:56.409
 this product is called glossy 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:02.730
 if we wish to test the product 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.499
 it will be enough to insert inside the ancient hollow tank 

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:11.219
 obviously maintaining a rotation speed much slower than the tank 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:16.279
 let the product rest for at least ten minutes after its 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:19.189
 processing echo wholesale finished products
