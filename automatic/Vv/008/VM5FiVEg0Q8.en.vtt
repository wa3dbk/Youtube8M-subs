00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.599
 free reference eagles in description 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.640
 Good day friends with you 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.160
 alkala yesterday and today is so unusual 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.640
 video why because i wanted 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.309
 to show 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.829
 very unusual situation for both 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.260
 stories so in principle for the game 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.589
 which though is not itself 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.570
 historically authentic nonetheless 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.050
 something reflects in general what i'm talking about 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.960
 what 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.050
 battleships other cruisers just 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.379
 cruisers suffered very severely from 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.879
 air raids from aircraft carriers and in 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.859
 nothing serious 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.410
 to oppose them because they could not and did not 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.840
 went to the real distance battle 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.220
 such happened rarely for example such 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.259
 happened in 1044 with the Japanese 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.630
 battlecruisers and cruisers 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.970
 battleships in Leyte Gulf 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.039
 but the Japanese could not realize and for 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.560
 well set smoke screen 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:25.110
 their advantage their principle 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.470
 American carriers were not injured but 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.900
 especially here if we talk about the game 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.520
 then of course everything is very, very 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.350
 sad if you try daisy 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.130
 speak competently to the aircraft carrier 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.740
 then along the way you will be 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.990
 constantly target and bomb better 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.420
 would actually bombed later torpedoes 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.030
 it's just giving away tin not only 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.770
 they do horrific damage 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.799
 so also very often they lead to 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.719
 flooding to some unreal explosion 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.670
 bombs are in principle not so scary and 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.579
 but at the edges it is for such armored 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.039
 ships like a battleship in truth 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.039
 Of course Konka is not entirely without a slide 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.410
 This is a battle cruiser and I probably 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.230
 I'll tell you all the story it was 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.870
 car month there are records of the nation risks in 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.270
 fights and if it will be interesting to you 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.240
 respectively 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:23.380
 likes will be and so on but today 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.390
 we and a friend we can talk about something 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.030
 do all the same to theoretically give at least 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.800
 battleship nasal up to can if they are not 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.860
 cleaning and you have them clogged end 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.710
 cards and if your wincor is pretty 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.200
 fast car a conga is very 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.790
 very fast to be honest it 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.220
 nautical characteristics more 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.120
 remind what perry heavy versions 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:49.380
 in the version of the cruiser rather than how the battleship was 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.270
 in principle, such a cruiser he is 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.250
 okay I will not run about the story in 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.780
 total crush now on horizon two 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.270
 aircraft carriers who have crouched in a corner and 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.150
 who are just frantically trying 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.460
 launch torpedo bombers against me 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.250
 probably doing the right thing but payback 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.930
 already close to three hundred and fifty six 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.320
 millimeter guns of the main caliber 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.690
 already firing at them I recharged 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.000
 as you can see on high-explosive shells 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.140
 because it is high-explosive 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 shells with a high probability 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:24.700
 causes fire and in case of deck fire 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.300
 enemy aircraft carriers can not say 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.680
 so run airplanes against me and 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.709
 cannot land planes already 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.420
 soaring in general, only one pros 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.790
 it remains only to destroy them on their 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.180
 after all, the two of them have quite a lot more 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.280
 survivability and constantly flying alongside 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.140
 I torpedo just makes me 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.010
 the brain with the fact that my car is pretty 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.110
 the old 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.209
 anti-aircraft weapons are not many and 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.440
 so although the planes are gradually 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.530
 are knocked down by the enemy 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.220
 but also fast enough for me 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.430
 wanted to 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.870
 what are you on the left and the aircraft carrier is burning principle 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.230
 especially I am not yet dangerous 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.780
 represents and I already see how well my my 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.020
 mine caliber that is not the main 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.280
 and there guns caliber 152 millimeters 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:13.570
 mixing exactly this was left on 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.400
 conga already working on the aircraft carrier on the left I 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.070
 I will call a fire from the one who was 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.850
 is right from me or what 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.130
 fire 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.400
 practical flow on what is 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.800
 on the left, what I see I see him go to 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.410
 landing a plane and therefore taking 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.080
 the solution is still to carry all the power 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.630
 his fire on him along with 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.050
 auxiliary artillery and yet 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.870
 destroy him with some powerful salvos 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.510
 his side and basically he goes 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:47.230
 and say hello to spongebob in this 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:50.080
 time I catch another torpedo here 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.720
 honestly it hurts and see that the same 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.330
 the torpedoes that run me go to 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.470
 side of the enemy heat nose which 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:01.090
 I started them and yes in general the situation 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.550
 tough i'm doing a little wrong 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.040
 because I shoot first on our 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.440
 severe damage and if i had them 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.800
 It caused most likely would looseness 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.840
 drowned like at the moment up on 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.670
 in fact , this situation is strange but 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.980
 learning to drown myself 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:21.580
 although you understand that literally another 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:23.890
 two volleys and I would have sent him to the bottom 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.320
 sea â€‹â€‹or ocean in this case 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.510
 it no longer matters to 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.940
 him the situation is quite rare when 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.100
 battleship still makes its way to all 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.550
 makes its way in conditions when your 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.840
 the team doesn't say so wins happens 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.820
 of course to have left two 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.140
 the aircraft carrier you have there she is awesome 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.650
 the connection is clear that you are up to them 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.930
 will get 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.790
 but situations when you stayed 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.590
 almost alone against a few 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:51.070
 opponents 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.900
 it certainly is quite rare so 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.900
 here are guys if you like unusual 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.210
 the video is not the usual such an approach 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:01.090
 likes and of course we write in the comments about 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.950
 tom would you like to see the story of this 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.620
 the ship that itself represented in 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:08.020
 real life and look at his 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:11.320
 the gameplay in the game will be a lot of likes 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:13.930
 views of course i'm of course i'm on 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.890
 it will react especially as the record u 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.860
 i am good 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.460
 there is everything good for you a day thanks for 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.070
 viewing 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:24.210
 Sam was windows after and until new meetings 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.210
 bye bye friends
