back

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.589

make<00:02:39.780> I<00:02:40.370> ran<00:02:41.370> Payton<00:02:42.890> value<00:02:43.890> can<00:02:44.760> be<00:02:44.790> good<00:02:45.150> but

so<00:02:46.170> basically<00:02:46.620> enough<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:46.980> fight<00:02:47.250> back<00:02:47.959> it's<00:02:48.959> a

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
so basically enough to fight back it's a

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.500 
so basically enough to fight back it's a
lot<00:02:49.770> better<00:02:49.980> than<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.430> simple<00:02:50.819> sleeves<00:02:51.300> that

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510

will<00:06:51.199> be<00:06:51.319> pretty<00:06:51.500> cool<00:06:51.860> if<00:06:51.919> i<00:06:52.250> can<00:06:52.430> get<00:06:52.520> it

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:52.669 
will be pretty cool if i can get it

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:56.140 
will be pretty cool if i can get it
running<00:06:52.759> out<00:06:52.969> of<00:06:53.000> here<00:06:53.240> i<00:06:54.189> got<00:06:55.189> about<00:06:55.219> 120<00:06:55.789> gig

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.150 
running out of here i got about 120 gig

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.300 
running out of here i got about 120 gig
hard<00:06:56.360> drive<00:06:56.419> in<00:06:56.719> here<00:06:56.900> so<00:06:57.139> it<00:06:57.680> should<00:06:57.889> be<00:06:57.919> big

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.310 
hard drive in here so it should be big

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.420 
hard drive in here so it should be big
enough<00:06:58.810> for<00:06:59.810> all<00:06:59.840> asses<00:07:00.379> and<00:07:00.680> naturally

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:03.469 
parallels it's really cool because it

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:04.929 
parallels it's really cool because it
only<00:07:03.650> uses<00:07:03.889> the<00:07:04.189> amount<00:07:04.400> of<00:07:04.490> space<00:07:04.669> on<00:07:04.819> the

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:06.699 
hard drive that it needs doesn't use any

hard drive that it needs doesn't use any
extra<00:07:07.699> space<00:07:07.969> so<00:07:08.800> you<00:07:09.800> know<00:07:09.949> even<00:07:10.699> if<00:07:10.879> I

00:07:10.989 --> 00:07:10.999 
extra space so you know even if I

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:12.730 
extra space so you know even if I
reserved<00:07:11.300> 30<00:07:11.569> gig<00:07:11.779> for<00:07:11.960> it<00:07:12.080> it'll<00:07:12.289> only

in<00:07:15.050> the<00:07:15.139> case<00:07:15.259> of<00:07:15.319> XP<00:07:15.800> it's<00:07:15.949> like<00:07:16.129> six<00:07:16.580> gig<00:07:16.819> or

00:07:16.959 --> 00:07:16.969 
in the case of XP it's like six gig or

in the case of XP it's like six gig or
something<00:07:17.029> it's<00:07:17.719> pretty<00:07:17.900> cool<00:07:18.139> and<00:07:18.560> it<00:07:18.650> gets

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:18.830 
something it's pretty cool and it gets

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.059 
something it's pretty cool and it gets
bigger<00:07:19.189> as<00:07:19.460> it<00:07:19.610> needs<00:07:19.879> some<00:07:20.210> girls<00:07:21.080> if<00:07:21.830> my

00:07:22.059 --> 00:07:22.069 
bigger as it needs some girls if my

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:23.589 
bigger as it needs some girls if my
opinions<00:07:22.520> definitely<00:07:23.180> the<00:07:23.330> way<00:07:23.449> to<00:07:23.479> go

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599 
opinions definitely the way to go

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:26.330 
opinions definitely the way to go
instead<00:07:23.990> of<00:07:24.139> boot<00:07:24.379> camp

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.340 
instead of boot camp

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.610 
instead of boot camp
it's<00:07:26.880> really<00:07:27.389> a<00:07:27.540> nice<00:07:27.750> machine<00:07:28.050> what<00:07:28.410> can<00:07:28.530> i

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:28.620 
it's really a nice machine what can i

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:33.020 
it's really a nice machine what can i
say<00:07:28.830> i<00:07:28.860> also<00:07:29.100> got<00:07:29.430> a<00:07:29.510> smc<00:07:30.510> fan<00:07:31.169> control<00:07:32.030> which

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:33.030 
say i also got a smc fan control which

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.860 
say i also got a smc fan control which
basically<00:07:33.919> just<00:07:35.120> speed<00:07:36.120> of<00:07:36.270> the<00:07:36.330> fans<00:07:36.570> in<00:07:36.780> the

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:36.870 
basically just speed of the fans in the

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.439 
basically just speed of the fans in the
mac<00:07:37.050> so<00:07:37.470> it<00:07:38.160> doesn't<00:07:38.460> get<00:07:38.550> to<00:07:38.729> a<00:07:38.760> hot<00:07:39.030> but<00:07:39.330> it'll

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:39.449 
mac so it doesn't get to a hot but it'll

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:41.300 
mac so it doesn't get to a hot but it'll
get<00:07:39.540> slightly<00:07:39.840> louder<00:07:40.169> to<00:07:40.530> compromise<00:07:41.010> but

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:41.310 
get slightly louder to compromise but

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.040 
get slightly louder to compromise but
have<00:07:41.520> you<00:07:41.669> have<00:07:41.910> the<00:07:42.030> option<00:07:42.240> of<00:07:42.479> you<00:07:42.900> know

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.050 
have you have the option of you know

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.439 
have you have the option of you know

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:45.449 
choosing that and whenever I use it on

00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:47.270 
choosing that and whenever I use it on
the<00:07:45.510> bed<00:07:45.810> it<00:07:45.990> does<00:07:46.020> get<00:07:46.350> a<00:07:46.410> bit<00:07:46.470> clots<00:07:46.860> I'd<00:07:47.100> like

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 
the bed it does get a bit clots I'd like

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.890 
the bed it does get a bit clots I'd like
to<00:07:47.400> turn<00:07:47.550> up<00:07:47.669> the<00:07:47.790> fans<00:07:47.970> ahead<00:07:48.330> of<00:07:48.449> time<00:07:48.630> so

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:54.810 
that it doesn't have to wrap up and down

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.110 
that it doesn't have to wrap up and down
anyway<00:07:55.770> I'm<00:07:56.130> going<00:07:56.430> to<00:07:56.490> cut<00:07:56.669> it<00:07:56.760> about<00:07:56.850> that

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 
anyway I'm going to cut it about that
