weeks<00:00:10.920> ago<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.370> think<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:12.559> this<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.860> going<00:00:14.219> to

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
weeks ago I think and this is going to

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.519 
weeks ago I think and this is going to
be<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.429> pretty<00:00:14.610> short<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:15.150> sweet<00:00:15.599> test<00:00:15.990> because

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
be a pretty short and sweet test because

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.490 
be a pretty short and sweet test because
it<00:00:16.920> flies<00:00:17.100> exactly<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.000> same<00:00:18.210> as<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:19.350> regular

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
it flies exactly the same as the regular

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.820 
it flies exactly the same as the regular
metal<00:00:20.130> monarch<00:00:20.490> am<00:00:20.720> just<00:00:21.720> balance<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.710> the

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
metal monarch am just balance is the

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.769 
metal monarch am just balance is the
same<00:00:23.039> flies<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.550> same<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:24.180> i'm<00:00:24.539> just<00:00:24.689> posting

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
same flies the same so i'm just posting

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.170 
same flies the same so i'm just posting
this<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:25.949> can<00:00:26.070> see<00:00:26.220> but<00:00:26.490> yeah<00:00:26.939> basically

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
this so you can see but yeah basically

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.259 
this so you can see but yeah basically
the<00:00:27.449> same<00:00:27.539> thing<00:00:28.010> and<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.730> one<00:00:29.849> exception<00:00:30.060> is

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
the same thing and the one exception is

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.030 
the same thing and the one exception is
you<00:00:30.539> have<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.750> fold<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.050> feet<00:00:31.199> up<00:00:31.320> because

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
you have to fold the feet up because

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.650 
you have to fold the feet up because
this<00:00:32.189> version<00:00:32.489> has<00:00:32.520> feet<00:00:32.820> your<00:00:32.940> own<00:00:33.059> didn't<00:00:33.329> so

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
this version has feet your own didn't so

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.330 
this version has feet your own didn't so
you<00:00:34.260> have<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.469> fold<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.829> feet<00:00:35.010> up<00:00:35.130> because

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
you have to fold the feet up because

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.670 
you have to fold the feet up because
otherwise<00:00:35.520> if<00:00:36.030> they<00:00:36.510> move<00:00:36.719> out<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.350> if<00:00:37.530> they're

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
otherwise if they move out of if they're

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.670 
otherwise if they move out of if they're
spread<00:00:38.010> out<00:00:38.040> if<00:00:38.370> they<00:00:38.760> move<00:00:38.940> out<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.210> position

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
spread out if they move out of position

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.229 
spread out if they move out of position
then<00:00:40.680> it'll<00:00:41.309> change<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.700> balance<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.180> you

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
then it'll change the balance so you

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.850 
then it'll change the balance so you
just<00:00:42.390> fold<00:00:42.780> them<00:00:42.899> up<00:00:42.989> an<00:00:43.230> elastic<00:00:43.620> band<00:00:43.770> around

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
just fold them up an elastic band around

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.360 
just fold them up an elastic band around
it<00:00:44.100> done<00:00:46.579> so<00:00:47.579> as<00:00:48.300> usual<00:00:49.110> same<00:00:49.620> location<00:00:49.770> same

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
it done so as usual same location same

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.720 
it done so as usual same location same

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
course and as always i'm not going to

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.599 
course and as always i'm not going to
cut<00:01:00.690> out<00:01:00.890> anything<00:01:01.890> just<00:01:02.160> going<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.340> sort<00:01:02.460> of

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
cut out anything just going to sort of

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.700 
cut out anything just going to sort of
the<00:01:03.359> only<00:01:03.510> thing<00:01:03.629> i<00:01:03.690> might<00:01:03.840> cut<00:01:04.049> out<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.350> if<00:01:04.589> i

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
the only thing i might cut out is if i

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.310 
the only thing i might cut out is if i
have<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.830> break<00:01:05.040> or<00:01:05.189> something<00:01:06.260> but<00:01:07.260> basically

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
have a break or something but basically

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.140 
have a break or something but basically
flies<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.560> same<00:01:10.890> nice<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.580> easy<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:12.030> aim<00:01:12.689> and

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
flies the same nice and easy to aim and

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.210 
flies the same nice and easy to aim and
nice<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.299> easy<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:16.100> pretty<00:01:17.100> nice

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
nice and easy to do pretty nice

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.429 
nice and easy to do pretty nice
controlled<00:01:17.729> moves

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:43.470 

same<00:01:26.439> at<00:01:26.560> this<00:01:26.710> thing

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.030 

you

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:02:12.580 

and<00:01:47.960> random<00:01:49.220> shop<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.400> Roley

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.590 

as<00:02:13.590> always<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.130> have<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.310> remember<00:02:14.490> that<00:02:14.640> wide

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
as always you have to remember that wide

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.630 
as always you have to remember that wide
angle<00:02:15.870> lens<00:02:16.050> like<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.230> makes<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:17.040> lot

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
angle lens like this makes it a lot

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.700 
angle lens like this makes it a lot
easier<00:02:17.820> to<00:02:18.060> aim<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:18.720> you're<00:02:19.380> going<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.560> try<00:02:19.680> and

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
easier to aim so you're going to try and

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.950 
easier to aim so you're going to try and
fly<00:02:19.920> this<00:02:20.100> with<00:02:20.310> well<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.390> longer<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.780> lens

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
fly this with well the longer the lens

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.940 
fly this with well the longer the lens
the<00:02:22.170> more<00:02:22.320> difficult<00:02:22.710> is<00:02:22.770> going<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:22.950> be<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.130> aim

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
the more difficult is going to be to aim

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
the more difficult is going to be to aim
oops

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.199 

and<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:41.290> did<00:02:41.980> change<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.489> oil<00:02:42.549> here<00:02:42.909> because<00:02:43.120> I

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
and I did change the oil here because I

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.059 
and I did change the oil here because I
found<00:02:43.420> that<00:02:43.569> the<00:02:44.319> one<00:02:44.439> that<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.650> shipped<00:02:44.829> with

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
found that the one that it shipped with

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.130 
found that the one that it shipped with
was<00:02:45.489> a<00:02:45.519> bit<00:02:45.670> too<00:02:45.790> thick<00:02:46.120> so<00:02:46.629> there<00:02:46.870> was<00:02:46.959> a<00:02:46.989> bit

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
was a bit too thick so there was a bit

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.009 
was a bit too thick so there was a bit
too<00:02:47.319> much<00:02:47.730> left<00:02:48.730> right<00:02:48.970> movement<00:02:49.329> went<00:02:49.810> so

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
too much left right movement went so

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.140 
too much left right movement went so
when<00:02:50.170> you<00:02:50.260> turn<00:02:50.530> handle<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.700> stabilizer

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
when you turn handle the stabilizer

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.479 
when you turn handle the stabilizer
would<00:02:52.329> turn<00:02:52.569> a<00:02:52.840> little<00:02:53.140> bit<00:02:53.319> as<00:02:53.500> well<00:02:53.799> which

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
would turn a little bit as well which

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.130 
would turn a little bit as well which
for<00:02:54.700> me<00:02:54.790> is<00:02:54.819> an<00:02:55.030> ideal<00:02:55.329> and<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.930> lot<00:02:56.109> of

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
for me is an ideal and a lot of

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.530 
for me is an ideal and a lot of
stabilizers<00:02:56.680> do<00:02:56.799> that<00:02:56.920> so<00:02:57.250> whenever<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.329> don't

video about how to do that it's really
really<00:03:03.819> easy<00:03:03.849> to<00:03:04.269> disassemble<00:03:04.690> this<00:03:05.069> clean

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
really easy to disassemble this clean

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.910 
really easy to disassemble this clean
out<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.280> oil<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:07.260> replace<00:03:08.260> it<00:03:08.290> with<00:03:08.409> the<00:03:08.709> some

smoother<00:03:09.549> well<00:03:10.209> it's<00:03:10.359> smoother<00:03:10.720> but<00:03:10.870> oil<00:03:11.530> with

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
smoother well it's smoother but oil with

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.759 
smoother well it's smoother but oil with
less<00:03:12.069> drag<00:03:12.579> basically<00:03:13.269> like<00:03:13.620> lighter<00:03:14.620> oil

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
less drag basically like lighter oil
