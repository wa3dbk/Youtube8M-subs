 the result is vitamin C deficiency in 56

 useful the risks of buckwheat cereals and millet and 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.950
 we remove the semolina from the diet 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.960
 low biological value and 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.780
 sure vegetables carrots 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.290
 turnip turnouts and especially beets there are many

 of fibers 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:58.170
 Dietary fiber is the undigested part 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.670
 our diet is not digested but 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.800
 they are needed to properly 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.170
 well worked intestines for motility 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.860
 intestines and they are absolutely necessary 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:10.080
 for functioning not fed that is 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.450
 intestinal microorganisms are useful which 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.020
 synthesize vitamins introduced blue 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.660

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.270
 but we exclude tomatoes and cucumbers there 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.790
 almost no vitamins no season for and driven 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.470
 vegetables as a rule from a dietitian 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.350
 importing is generally a complicated relationship 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.510
 after this statistic compared the quality 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.650

 vitamin b1 however to our meat is 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.160
 claims but not on vitamins but on time 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.930
 and storage conditions repeatedly 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.970
 frozen 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.430
 give lose vitamins better 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.590
 buy fresh meat and don't forget about 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.870
 fish there are a lot of polysaturated fatty 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.060
 acids and not responsible for intelligence 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.430
 for the youth of the body and protection from

 the diet of dairy products 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.460
 but not fat but oils and sweets 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.710
 better and completely eliminate 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.840
 nutritionists helped us make up a diet 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.270
 nutrition for one day on 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.840
 breakfast cereal oatmeal on 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.419

 drink no more than one percent 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:29.630
 straight-pressed juice is the most useful 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:32.090
 Chicken breast broth for lunch 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.099
 for example with rice but for dinner well 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.669
 eat fresh vegetable salad 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:39.979
 fruits and yogurts but even if correct 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:41.960
 eat warn dietitians it's all 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:44.180
 Equally not saved Petersburgers have disappeared
