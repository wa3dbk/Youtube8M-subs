00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 so dear facebook friends now it will be 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.160
 again really hard, we are always 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.799
 still at ferrari but we are now 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.970
 no longer my california at 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:09.920
 but deal with this vehicle 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.740
 here 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.120
 it is not quite finished that here 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.690
 maybe the smallest one or the other 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.570
 this is going to be a la ferrari 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.460
 just like all the ideals are 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.150
 So that here the production is 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.490
 ferrari la ferrari and here we are allowed one 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.960
 The assets went home exclusively 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.780
 pizza and pasta and allow her one 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.800
 I 'll see what they do 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.960
 Incredibly honest, what's it all about 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.860
 is to look then exhausts have 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.860
 I'm in the front 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:49.610
 that 's the battery pack that stands here 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.610
 even so hire it is that here 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.320
 underneath it all the way out of the 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.110
 is then installed here so it was 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.850
 not even a la ferrari 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.980
 so completely finished is alone again 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.259
 she looks from below 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:12.320
 I really think so and this gap there 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:14.600
 fits exactly the battery pack 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.810
 here and there is already the next la 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.720
 Ferrari is not tangible so the farther 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.670
 we come to the front the more 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.680
 the equipment finished 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.380
 Here you can see the engine this red 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.710
 dinger everything was so tarpaulins 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.450
 he does not get any scratches on it and this 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.680
 color here that come now find the 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.680
 but I blatantly 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.470
 I'm really complete braid I leave 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.390
 that just run now and I am 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.369
 curious how he finds that and how that 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.570
 interesting or not like 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.170
 maybe again he will get a lot 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.689
 interesting are also these rims here 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.159
 so of course, only in the alternative wheels the 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.490
 roll through the production here 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.429
 rubbers are not there on it 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.600
 but that's sure to happen 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:06.250
 Now we're gonna make someone stand there 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.420
 Now three more are almost done and 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.290
 but before that we go here again 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.500
 over in the engines assembly temple 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.500
 1 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.910
 that 's such a la ferrari engine 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:34.080
 really alone here 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.800
 Now you right here very briefly so 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.280
 we'll see that from the top 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.280
 that's for a bit 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.000
 just the finest of the whole vehicle 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:55.910
 is the finest and it is no wonder 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:59.500
 that it is so expensive so yes 1 2 3 4 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:03.590
 5 6 7 8 9 are then still manufactured 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.190
 who is there, there are still going 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.190
 once around 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.940
 I 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.209
 yes I'm missing the words right here 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.209
 look 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.210
 Battery is fortunate to come now 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:42.170
 sometimes the steering wheel and the rear 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:44.980
 but have the steering wheel bit kabul 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.980
 again installed in it 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.280
 really 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.900
 that's just to freak out people i do 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.650
 I think I sleep today so that was 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.900
 ferrari's production line i 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.370
 say goodbye and say thank you Ferrari 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.880
 and I may thank you someday 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.880
 for this visit
