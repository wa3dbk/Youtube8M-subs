much<00:02:12.790> hair<00:02:13.090> my<00:02:13.720> hair<00:02:13.930> would<00:02:14.110> grow<00:02:14.320> a<00:02:14.410> few

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
much hair my hair would grow a few

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.490 
much hair my hair would grow a few
inches<00:02:14.980> maybe<00:02:15.430> after<00:02:15.940> so<00:02:16.299> in<00:02:16.570> or<00:02:16.959> just

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
inches maybe after so in or just

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.100 
inches maybe after so in or just
whatever<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:18.130> then<00:02:18.760> when<00:02:19.239> I<00:02:19.269> go<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:19.480> wash<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:20.019> I

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
whatever and then when I go to wash it I

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.870 
whatever and then when I go to wash it I
will<00:02:20.290> lose<00:02:20.440> all<00:02:20.650> those<00:02:20.799> inches<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.489> I<00:02:21.549> had

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
will lose all those inches that I had

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.710 
will lose all those inches that I had
gained<00:02:23.519> and<00:02:24.519> I'm<00:02:24.760> not<00:02:24.910> necessarily<00:02:25.060> blaming

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
gained and I'm not necessarily blaming

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.740 
gained and I'm not necessarily blaming
the<00:02:25.810> comb<00:02:26.080> but<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.920> think<00:02:27.400> I<00:02:27.580> think<00:02:28.209> that<00:02:28.630> my

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
the comb but I think I think that my

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.539 
the comb but I think I think that my
hair<00:02:28.959> is<00:02:29.110> weak<00:02:29.350> maybe<00:02:29.739> and<00:02:30.070> it<00:02:30.160> breaks<00:02:30.430> very

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
hair is weak maybe and it breaks very

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.039 
hair is weak maybe and it breaks very
easily<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:32.200> since<00:02:32.560> I<00:02:32.709> think<00:02:32.830> that<00:02:33.160> of<00:02:33.580> course

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
easily and since I think that of course

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.479 
easily and since I think that of course
eliminating<00:02:35.049> the<00:02:35.140> comb<00:02:35.350> made<00:02:35.650> sense<00:02:35.950> I<00:02:36.250> didn't

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
eliminating the comb made sense I didn't

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.009 
eliminating the comb made sense I didn't
think<00:02:36.549> I<00:02:36.700> could<00:02:36.730> do<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.030> I<00:02:37.269> didn't<00:02:37.840> think<00:02:37.900> I

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
think I could do it I didn't think I

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.560 
think I could do it I didn't think I
could<00:02:38.049> go<00:02:38.290> without<00:02:38.440> product<00:02:38.950> especially

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
could go without product especially

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.630 
could go without product especially

didn't<00:02:42.790> think<00:02:42.850> I<00:02:43.000> could<00:02:43.030> go<00:02:43.269> without

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
didn't think I could go without

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.870 
didn't think I could go without
