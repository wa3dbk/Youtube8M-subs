00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
walk about two years into writing it my

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.190 
walk about two years into writing it my
employer<00:02:08.610> found<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.959> they<00:02:10.050> were<00:02:10.110> very

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
employer found it and and they were very

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.890 
employer found it and and they were very
unhappy<00:02:10.470> with<00:02:10.739> some<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
unhappy with some of the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.270 
unhappy with some of the
content<00:02:12.200> I<00:02:12.470> mean<00:02:12.680> I<00:02:12.739> hadn't<00:02:12.950> really<00:02:13.159> written

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
content I mean I hadn't really written

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.520 
content I mean I hadn't really written
about<00:02:13.489> work<00:02:13.700> very<00:02:13.970> often<00:02:14.120> but<00:02:14.629> I<00:02:14.870> think<00:02:15.500> I

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
about work very often but I think I

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.929 
about work very often but I think I
described<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:16.069> couple<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.370> people<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:16.879> I'd

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:16.939 
described a couple of people and I'd

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:18.670 
described a couple of people and I'd
mentioned<00:02:17.299> somebody<00:02:17.510> sock<00:02:17.870> suspenders<00:02:18.049> and<00:02:18.470> I

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
mentioned somebody sock suspenders and I

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.679 
mentioned somebody sock suspenders and I
think<00:02:18.860> I<00:02:18.920> probably<00:02:19.099> bruised<00:02:19.549> some<00:02:19.909> egos<00:02:20.269> and

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:20.689 
think I probably bruised some egos and

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:22.030 
think I probably bruised some egos and
did<00:02:20.870> they<00:02:20.989> try<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.200> sack<00:02:21.409> you<00:02:21.439> as<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.680> result
