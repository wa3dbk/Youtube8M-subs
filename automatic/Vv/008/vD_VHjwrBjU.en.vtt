because I like the clean smell using

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.309 
because I like the clean smell using
this<00:04:01.000> alone<00:04:01.389> it<00:04:01.829> does<00:04:02.829> not<00:04:02.980> give<00:04:03.370> the<00:04:04.319> the

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
this alone it does not give the the

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.680 
this alone it does not give the the
washing<00:04:05.829> smell<00:04:06.639> if<00:04:06.940> you<00:04:07.090> like<00:04:07.269> that<00:04:07.449> on<00:04:07.569> your

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
washing smell if you like that on your

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.770 
washing smell if you like that on your

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
clothes so you can't it is okay to use

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.500

fabric<00:04:11.019> softener<00:04:11.379> with<00:04:11.709> it<00:04:11.919> I<00:04:12.239> think<00:04:13.239> this<00:04:13.359> is

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
fabric softener with it I think this is

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.740 
fabric softener with it I think this is
a<00:04:13.540> good<00:04:13.780> product<00:04:14.079> I<00:04:14.909> wouldn't<00:04:15.909> buy<00:04:16.090> a<00:04:16.479> whole

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
a good product I wouldn't buy a whole

deformed has looks like it's starting to
separate<00:04:34.740> there<00:04:34.979> and<00:04:35.220> I've<00:04:35.400> maybe<00:04:36.240> use<00:04:36.570> it<00:04:36.810> for

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
separate there and I've maybe use it for
