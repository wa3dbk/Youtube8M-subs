00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.450
 jo people what is now bastian miss 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.880
 germany with the sixth step from 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.340
 easter egg of max is side and left 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.349
 to ring the bell 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.330
 Although there are three locations where each 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.529
 three are ringing and the first one here 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.970
 in the barn there you already have the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.820
 first sounds seen 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.780
 here on the plan is the next one 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.660
 bell and the last blade is behind 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.470
 this wooden beam now also there 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.649
 is and how that gives just three locations 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.690
 where three are each ring and there 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.210
 it is just a player, it goes to 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.540
 a location and the fourth player 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.540
 go into the haunted house and there he has to 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.430
 in such a place go to such a box where 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.730
 then light up and then light up 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.440
 So keys do not have to press there and so 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.210
 here in kendo glory above is not one 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.410
 in the room but in the next like 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.470
 another stair goes up 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.450
 There are three more doorbells 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.720
 I have not shown it now but the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.900
 finds it easy here and the last one 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.350
 ringing are here in this in the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.479
 kitchen but the judge's room 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.180
 They are relatively easy to find 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.080
 a diaz holder is in its corner 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.650
 Now I'm standing around here a bit 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.759
 but you see money immediately 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.159
 the step is a bit difficult 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.590
 there you are also the good communication 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.700
 but if you can do it then it works 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.759
 actually relatively easy 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.040
 Now I'm just showing the killer what where 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.750
 The gongs are here on the table 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:48.270
 a bell then they just out the 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.460
 already the next blade at the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.170
 judge table still on it so that the 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.820
 next jingle have the last blade 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.400
 We did not find it at the beginning but then 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.280
 we see that's how it is when you go 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.400
 this in the judge is pure 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.750
 right around the corner is pretty 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.310
 hidden because it's pretty dark 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.390
 but if you go long you can see it too 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.700
 this they hold it over but around the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.570
 to use things 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.630
 You'll see that when 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.340
 every cross-country skiing is everybody 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.230
 player a location and one in the 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.050
 haunted house 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.840
 now you can see the picture of this one 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.500
 This switch port is called the and 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.470
 though you keep seeing new lights and 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.620
 every light of it is a blade of that 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.900
 are always assigned differently 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.720
 and indeed sees the left here 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.420
 column is fame for the caddy 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.800
 So where the ski over the next 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.700
 load where I said that's yes 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.180
 not received 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:53.100
 the second column is for the barn 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:57.240
 and the last column is for the 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.860
 judge room quite easy actually and 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.370
 then I numbered you so 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.959
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.180
 and then it is actually quite simple 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.700
 it already once one is engaged in 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.370
 this whiteboard then goes on a light 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.700
 then, for example, in the first one 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.560
 split the second light so who is it then 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.830
 after numbering the number two 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.080
 and there it is that it stops 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.600
 always find it in the game room 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.190
 is then you say for example ever 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.910
 whoever stands says that 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:33.330
 first friend yes you in the cellar room presses 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.070
 times any key then he pressed the 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.930
 keys, for example, the third one lies 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.090
 then say that's okay, that's it third 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.910
 light noticed that is that that 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.330
 third light then he presses one more 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.549
 ring and then, for example, is the first light 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.290
 then you know directly the first third 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.220
 and the second light is the must then 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.690
 keep everyone in mind 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.160
 you walk on the side of his 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.750
 spot is something to the fourth fifth 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.400
 sixth light is 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.680
 So now only for his spot 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.860
 then notice the presses on this 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.900
 board is pressed once just looks iks 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.930
 then a light comes on and then says 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.090
 yes the number 5 and then one knows 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.010
 the two in games now in the barn 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.470
 is white direct 8 the number 5 must 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.709
 I push with me and then it will 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.989
 not green and then new light on and 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.329
 then you say the number 7 again 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.120
 I know in the judge's room 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.040
 pressing number 7 is that easy 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.230
 actually once you understand it 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.160
 it works if you still have problems 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:34.200
 then just write in the comments 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:36.090
 if you still have questions and yes if 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.380
 you have activated that then it works 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.050
 Continue with the next step today 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.340
 again such a tune then that should be 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.320
 whole boat to be green 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.430
 and as I said, it continues with the 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.020
 next step if I'm video 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.180
 has fallen a thumbs up 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.370
 and if you do not take the next steps 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.650
 want to miss the end of the seventh 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.120
 Then subscribe and see you 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.120
 in the next video house purely
