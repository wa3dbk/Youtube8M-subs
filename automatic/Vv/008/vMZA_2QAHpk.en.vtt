00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.820
 hi girls then we are synonymous in 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.710
 part we have 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.620
 a picnic because today it came out 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.570
 this beautiful sun is by god yes 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.100
 could also be short-sleeved e 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.950
 I wanted to take advantage of this beautiful 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.230
 panorama to let you see the look a little 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.420
 since day i'm wearing in 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.100
 practically every day such as york 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.750
 because we really walk a lot 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.820
 then from morning to evening then 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.650
 casual and comfortable and almost occult 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.300
 I took all the clothes in a 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.309
 shop that I discovered by chance a 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.440
 given day if you saw the block 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.020
 I would know what rate this store has 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.660
 some very nice things some a lot 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.220
 details and also low enough 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.710
 cost because the prices are those of doing 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.190
 died in to one so then I put it 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:19.240
 this is this kind of sweater like that 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.520
 or transparent very light gray then 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.110
 these pants also between these from 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.550
 mind in an alleged store and me 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.540
 they liked it so much for all of these 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:32.380
 tears on the thighs and another thing 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:35.290
 very pretty in the back pocket 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.490
 left there are all these studs 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:42.079
 golden and too cute too 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.990
 and underneath these sports shoes 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.640
 the bone that I am not very good at 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.619
 heels aren't even dancers 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.619
 on sports shoes though 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.020
 then when you travel you have to be 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.810
 also because here especially a 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.350
 and my france sucks 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.259
 all this video 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.759
 when especially when new york la 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.069
 it is beautiful to walk 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.830
 so much to get lost in the whites 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:11.629
 because we have so many beautiful things 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.000
 we saw that we worried 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:16.610
 and so around by chance going into the 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.040
 where we should not have gone 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.480
 so really be walking 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.860
 lot all day around the 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.980
 day from morning to evening then 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.140
 sports shoes are the only choice 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.920
 the only choice I have of these in 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:35.430
 these days these trips and how many 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.379
 this is also tactics 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.599
 these many who have always taken that 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.400
 shop with all these stars 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.799
 let's try though 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.450
 in the case you take some fresh cases 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.590
 pull a little cool because I'm al 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.600
 cold lona crazy and the cute thing about 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.700
 this is what we do 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.849
 and that in front 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.849
 or 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.850
 and basically this is a bit and everything 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.370
 the out today is extremely high 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.920
 simple and very very comfortable 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.920
 the inevitable glasses and of course 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.410
 obviously the usual black bag that though 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.220
 always for convenience 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:24.700
 so we believe nothing of us now 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:28.110
 let's do we hate our g20 stops 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.110
 we have vaccinated feet 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.980
 I can also see some down 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.500
 photo because it is beautiful there is this view 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.840
 spectacular of manhattan this is the 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.870
 throat there is a bridge and this is wonderful 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.560
 part is not a wonder at all 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.260
 maybe it is 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.830
 and it will not be imposed that I prefer 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.680
 of 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.310
 new york what a horn you hear here 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.260
 we are 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.940
 very close to the city but barely 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.260
 going a little further they heard 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.260
 plus nothing all very much 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.799
 nothing so I salute you I send you a 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.490
 big face and see you next 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.780
