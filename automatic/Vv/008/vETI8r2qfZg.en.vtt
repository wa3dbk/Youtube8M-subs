00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.570
 because that's where everyone knows what we 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.279
 rise to dedication I want well 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.320
 today I find you on cycling 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.420
 of apps for you presents a big mac to 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.529
 lodge and covered so we risk then 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.180
 that it will remain there below all 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.170
 the tares really held the whole earth 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.250
 of stephen so it's really 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.410
 unbelievable 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.340
 to do this it's really very simple 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.350
 you will have to go to the place 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.790
 I am under the video as I am 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.380
 just show on the map 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.969
 because I have a little to play next 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.500
 why because I had a mission 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.840
 but if you do not have it it's 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.980
 really not serious at all so like 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.809
 you may have noticed that I 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.160
 am on the sea you need 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.300
 of a boat 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.090
 time is at the controls of size 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.579
 average because it's not too big fan of 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.010
 36 holes and other pieces you can 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.449
 not jump at all because then once 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.340
 that you will put your boat on average 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.039
 should go sill we have to 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.660
 maintain or so that you can nothing 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.939
 your end boss if you take your 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.770
 boat on the wall so I do not have you 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.080
 have seizures you will only have 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.360
 find the right place to keep your 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.130
 motorcycle a month here's the time I'm going 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.290
 miss because I'm going to skip a little bit 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.000
 too much but second time I'm going back 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.590
 at the end of the second time it was the 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.790
 sixth time actually I had at least 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.500
 five six times to succeed 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.900
 so all that could have lasted two very well 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.790
 minutes that ten minutes it only depends on 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.280
 of you will wear it place games 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.409
 conceded see the videos for you 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.970
 spot a little bit 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.439
 that's it then once you 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.470
 will have found the right place 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.420
 you will have to go in front of the wall finally 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.150
 in front of the wall and you will have to 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.920
 to jump silent objects are silent do you 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.810
 stop at all and that is everything 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.479
 okay you're new wybrecht the 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.100
 wall went behind that goes next 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.630
 sorry you will have an effect really 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.540
 super nice that you will see 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.520
 not really not very long yeah 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.680
 the facts I do not know of anything that 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.240
 do not foams there then once 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.640
 that the neighbor do this you did 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.479
 half of glick really the most 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.170
 big half I think 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.490
 then you will have to pass 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.679
 you can see your head are you going 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.420
 go over the wall so if you do not see 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.250
 I do not advise you to move a little 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.780
 little do you play stick for a little bit 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.750
 on what and finally it should 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.400
 walk then then once here you 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.160
 go see a little bit a little wall at 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.840
 Left really why we need the 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.300
 others do not work you're going to have to 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.400
 watch it do not stop and 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.980
 move or juricic forward towards him because 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.600
 normally you will have one thing you will 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.860
 you want is what you want to skip 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.690
 to close 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.150
 you wished you will pass 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.860
 behind the wall m be completely under 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.230
 the map the pole tomorrow I'm trying 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.390
 to walk you're seeing that soon I 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.470
 will be in the water I do not know 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.569
 why they all have the map a 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.459
 ask why and you will be 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.100
 below a certain it's really 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.600
 nice enough to go everywhere I 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.350
 power over the cat and backs up towards 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.640
 giggs who was a little like this 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.230
 between the charter but you can not 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.610
 finally you will see a spa this shy and 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.130
 have to be solid you know a 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.080
 unlimited space and you can go where 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.360
 you want then in front of you to see 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.470
 that there is a black hole 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.180
 so at first I also believed that 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.170
 I was going to fall but not actually the name 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.390
 this black hole is the same thing ago 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.430
 water could very well and go and 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.900
 you will be in look the sweet look you 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.400
 do not see it sir not the most serious 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.989
 so then once you have 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.850
 does this would like to finish the blick 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.590

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.459
 to be very very long because you were typing you 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.910
 will not be able to go there by boat or 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.380
 car 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.420
 it can be a little long is 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.560
 maybe still great fun realized 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.540
