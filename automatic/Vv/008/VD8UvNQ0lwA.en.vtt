this is an armor plate from AR 500 armor

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.580 
this is an armor plate from AR 500 armor
comm<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.070> it's<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.849> 500<00:00:12.269> steel<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:13.200> noticed

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
comm and it's a 500 steel and I noticed

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.079 
comm and it's a 500 steel and I noticed
when<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.799> hit<00:00:14.040> it<00:00:14.099> with<00:00:14.309> armor<00:00:14.639> penetrating

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
when I hit it with armor penetrating

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.060 
when I hit it with armor penetrating
rounds<00:00:15.389> they<00:00:15.509> were<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:15.870> hot<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:16.859> caused

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
rounds they were so hot that it caused

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.060 
rounds they were so hot that it caused
this<00:00:17.340> plastic<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.390> kind<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:19.080> smoke<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.770> bubble

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
this plastic to kind of smoke and bubble

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.620 
this plastic to kind of smoke and bubble
a<00:00:20.160> little<00:00:20.279> bit<00:00:20.580> because<00:00:20.820> those<00:00:21.240> bullets<00:00:21.539> are

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
a little bit because those bullets are

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.509 
a little bit because those bullets are
so<00:00:21.750> hot<00:00:21.960> they<00:00:22.109> just<00:00:22.289> heated<00:00:22.500> up<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.980> rubber

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
so hot they just heated up this rubber

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.700 
so hot they just heated up this rubber
excuse<00:00:23.880> me<00:00:24.029> not<00:00:24.180> plastic<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.900> this<00:00:25.380> this

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
excuse me not plastic and this this

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.060 
excuse me not plastic and this this
rubber<00:00:25.980> coating<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.609> probably<00:00:27.029> about<00:00:28.070> 1/2

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
rubber coating is probably about 1/2

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.650 
rubber coating is probably about 1/2
inch<00:00:29.279> thick<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.699> mean<00:00:29.910> it's<00:00:30.060> really<00:00:30.300> thick

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
inch thick I mean it's really thick

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.930 
inch thick I mean it's really thick
stuff<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.170> it's<00:00:31.529> made<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:31.949> when<00:00:32.130> bullets<00:00:32.430> hit

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
stuff and it's made so when bullets hit

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.970 
stuff and it's made so when bullets hit
this<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:34.320> know<00:00:34.410> if<00:00:34.500> they<00:00:34.590> hit<00:00:34.710> just<00:00:34.920> a

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
this and you know if they hit just a

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.200 
this and you know if they hit just a
flat<00:00:35.160> piece<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.370> steel<00:00:35.489> they'll<00:00:35.940> kind<00:00:36.180> of

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
flat piece of steel they'll kind of

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.090 
flat piece of steel they'll kind of
splatter<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.020> they<00:00:37.140> break<00:00:37.290> apart<00:00:37.440> they<00:00:37.980> can

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
splatter and they break apart they can

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.740 
splatter and they break apart they can
go<00:00:38.160> into<00:00:38.280> your<00:00:38.370> arms<00:00:38.700> or<00:00:38.850> your<00:00:38.969> neck<00:00:39.149> it's<00:00:39.510> made

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
go into your arms or your neck it's made

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.510 
go into your arms or your neck it's made
to<00:00:39.780> catch<00:00:40.170> all<00:00:40.410> those<00:00:40.559> those<00:00:40.920> fragments<00:00:41.160> as

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
to catch all those those fragments as

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.830 
to catch all those those fragments as
well<00:00:41.670> as<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.969> mean<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.300> catches<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.629> entire

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
well as I mean it catches the entire

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.139 
well as I mean it catches the entire
bullet<00:00:43.489> you<00:00:44.489> know<00:00:44.610> except<00:00:44.940> for<00:00:44.969> these

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
bullet you know except for these

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.580 
bullet you know except for these
armor-piercing<00:00:45.809> rounds<00:00:46.020> we're<00:00:46.200> shooting<00:00:46.440> but

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
armor-piercing rounds we're shooting but

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.660 
armor-piercing rounds we're shooting but
what<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.250> wonder<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:48.800> what<00:00:49.800> I'll<00:00:49.920> do<00:00:50.070> with<00:00:50.460> a

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
what I wonder is what I'll do with a

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.850 
what I wonder is what I'll do with a
tracer<00:00:51.180> round<00:00:51.480> these<00:00:51.780> are<00:00:51.960> tracer<00:00:52.469> bullets

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
tracer round these are tracer bullets

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.639 
tracer round these are tracer bullets
and<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.190> lit<00:00:53.610> some<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.940> these<00:00:54.030> out<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.989> shell

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
and I lit some of these out of the shell

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.040 
and I lit some of these out of the shell
the<00:00:55.829> other<00:00:55.980> day<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.460> could<00:00:56.640> see<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.629> it's

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
the other day so you could see that it's

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.720 
the other day so you could see that it's
you<00:00:58.350> know<00:00:58.410> has<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> really<00:00:58.980> bright<00:00:59.160> brilliant

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
you know has a really bright brilliant

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.790 
you know has a really bright brilliant
glow<00:01:00.420> when<00:01:00.660> it's<00:01:00.809> burning<00:01:01.020> it's<00:01:01.260> burning<00:01:01.320> very

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
glow when it's burning it's burning very

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.200 
glow when it's burning it's burning very
hot<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.340> compound<00:01:02.760> that's<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.059> back<00:01:03.180> of

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
hot that compound that's on the back of

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.490 
hot that compound that's on the back of
the<00:01:03.359> bullet<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:04.080> want<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.260> see<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.379> video

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
the bullet you want to see that video

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.310 
the bullet you want to see that video
link<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.129> right<00:01:05.159> here<00:01:05.810> but<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.869> wonder<00:01:07.200> what

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
link is right here but I wonder what

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.500 
link is right here but I wonder what
will<00:01:07.439> happen<00:01:07.470> when<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.310> thick<00:01:08.820> rubberized

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
will happen when this thick rubberized

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.780 
will happen when this thick rubberized
coating<00:01:09.750> catches<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.979> burning<00:01:11.430> bullet<00:01:11.700> so

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
coating catches that burning bullet so

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.010 
coating catches that burning bullet so
I'm<00:01:11.850> going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> fire<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.180> few<00:01:12.360> tracers<00:01:12.780> into

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
I'm going to fire a few tracers into

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.390 
I'm going to fire a few tracers into
this<00:01:13.110> I'm<00:01:13.260> going<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.409> go<00:01:13.500> set<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.770> down<00:01:13.860> over

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
this I'm going to go set it down over

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.670 
this I'm going to go set it down over
there<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.060> put<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> camera<00:01:16.290> real<00:01:16.470> close<00:01:16.650> and

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
there and put a camera real close and

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.380 
there and put a camera real close and
we'll<00:01:17.159> see<00:01:17.280> what<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.400> does<00:01:17.580> here<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.119> tracer

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
we'll see what it does here the tracer

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.630 
we'll see what it does here the tracer
bullets<00:01:18.659> have<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.900> air<00:01:19.020> 500<00:01:19.590> armor<00:01:20.040> plate<00:01:20.250> set

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
bullets have the air 500 armor plate set

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.480 
bullets have the air 500 armor plate set
up<00:01:20.729> down<00:01:20.909> there<00:01:21.090> I'm<00:01:21.659> going<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.840> fire<00:01:22.369> just<00:01:23.369> a

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
up down there I'm going to fire just a

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.980 
up down there I'm going to fire just a
few<00:01:23.640> rounds<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.330> then<00:01:24.600> we'll<00:01:24.720> go<00:01:24.780> check

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
few rounds in it and then we'll go check

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:45.770 
few rounds in it and then we'll go check
it<00:01:25.110> out

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.570 

too<00:01:46.780> much<00:01:46.930> tracing<00:01:47.470> action<00:01:47.920> and<00:01:48.430> that's

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
too much tracing action and that's

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.580 
too much tracing action and that's
because<00:01:48.729> we're<00:01:48.909> only<00:01:49.000> probably<00:01:49.479> about<00:01:49.590> forty

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
because we're only probably about forty

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.889 
because we're only probably about forty
yards<00:01:50.740> in<00:01:51.040> that<00:01:51.159> plate<00:01:51.479> but<00:01:52.479> I<00:01:52.540> did<00:01:52.720> see

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
yards in that plate but I did see

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.539 
yards in that plate but I did see
something<00:01:53.140> kind<00:01:53.770> of<00:01:53.799> igniting<00:01:54.250> when<00:01:54.369> it<00:01:54.460> hit

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
something kind of igniting when it hit

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:45.780 
something kind of igniting when it hit
there<00:01:54.759> I'll<00:01:55.270> go<00:01:55.420> see<00:01:55.630> if<00:01:55.659> it's<00:01:55.930> smoking<00:01:56.680> or<00:01:56.799> not

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790
