00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 hi this is nicolas today we're going 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.200
 see how to work from lifting 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.300
 earth to work the lifted from 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.820
 earth we need a bar so a 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.290
 Olympic bar which is 20 kg and 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.630
 additional charges that you can 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.150
 add on each side and if we have 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:24.510
 taken as an example 15 kg each side 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:26.730
 so on tour a 50 kg bar you 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.949
 have already worked on the placement 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.420
 you 're going to spread your legs 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.410
 here wider than the hips so 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.750
 shoulder width 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.050
 we slightly open the toes you 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.570
 go down here the basin so two 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.820
 choice at the level of taking bars either 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.160
 you choose a mango probation and 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.690
 tomorrow beg nation so if you 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.820
 Feel more comfortable here on this take 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.960
 to favor that one otherwise you 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.629
 go keep both hands here in 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.750
 pronation me personally I chose 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.160
 rather this posture so you have good 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.780
 the hands that are inside the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.320
 people push us young people to 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.420
 Outside 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.420
 and if you have placed your back your 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.850
 back must be well straight forbidden to 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.100
 lift the load if you have a round back 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.590
 so here we keep our back straight and 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.040
 by blowing you go to lift the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.979
 charge here up to stretch your legs 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.840
 then I go down the back straight and I 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.720
 come back here so I'm going to show you 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.909
 the exercise of profiles in order to see well 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.460
 the posture so always you spread 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:32.340
 well feet we open at 10:10 on 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.030
 goes down there then placement of the doubs one has 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.100
 the right back 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.970
 you have to push hard in your heels 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.470
 and then straightened the bust so here 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.770
 you really have the bar close to 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.880
 shins and there you go so all 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.420
 talents and then straightened the bust and 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.420
 I come again 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.200
 the deadlift is an exercise 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.150
 integration that is to say it is 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.070
 very complete and will solicit a lot 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.380
 of muscle groups just like a 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.920
 big work on the lower body the 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.710
 adductors 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.440
 the thighs the glutes but also 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.380
 on the lumbar spine to straighten and 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.090
 abdominals maintain here the column 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.090
 vertebral and bear the load 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.810
 the first mistake we can see 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.840
 often it is to desynchronize the 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.890
 movement so when you are going to be here 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.570
 some people go first up 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.750
 push the festivals to and then 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.790
 have a too big load in 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.260
 lifting up with the back here really 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.340
 maybe work on loads 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.080
 much lighter but good 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.870
 synchronized movement between 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.850
 legs and back one pushes all at the same 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.280
 time if I push in the legs and I 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:45.320
 right back at the same time and I 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.060
 go back down so we'll see a little 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.340
 variant of the deadlift that we are going 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.380
 perform with a quintal beautiful watch 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.840
 that beautiful apple is just a weight with 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.060
 a little years here that will allow to 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.709
 handle it more fluidly 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.820
 we will take some news from 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.920
 this way we will spread our legs 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.450
 as consul had to land the goal that 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.820
 is going to be pushing the glutes away 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.160
 behind by keeping his back straight and 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.190
 back up so I push the glutes 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.280
 far behind and I go back the mistake 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.530
 frequent is to see the knees here 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.910
 come forward then when we go forward from 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.790
 with us we will do a job a 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.590
 slightly higher on the quadriceps above 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.780
 wanted to beef up the chain a little more 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.750
 poster ie the glutes and the 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.280
 hamstring ischio you go you go 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.300
 have to push your pelvis away 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.370
 behind here and watch my knees well 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.670
 yes they do not move forward so there is 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.430
 a lot more about a job on the 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.130
 posterior chain so also think about 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.410
 keep it so perfectly right if 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.050
 you go down the round back pay attention to 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.950
 pain at the lumbar level a 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.780
 very important thing 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:58.730
 hop and I go back inspired on the 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.730
 descent is blown on the climb 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.890
 keep a full amplitude 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.870
 that is, when you go 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.870
 go back up to the top 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.120
 if you do that and go back 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.130
 here and as you go down you have 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.569
 always lumbar who are against 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.099
 attack suddenly you go very fast 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.430
 feel pain at the level of 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.690
 lumbar 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:22.470
 so feel free to right here 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:28.139
 your spine and we are tightening 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:29.760
 glutes will be mounted if you want 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.380
 work more muscle volume 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.540
 you will leave on more charges 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.610
 consequent and reduce the number 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.750
 of repetitions therefore from 8 to 12 hours 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.130
 repetition 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.660
 if you want to work more force 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.100
 we will further reduce the number of 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.310
 repetitions and increase loads 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.840
 so that is between 6 to u and 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.340
 repetitions now if you want 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.380
 work more muscular endurance 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.030
 we're going to start on a series of 15 to 20 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.800
 repetitions do not forget the number of 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.060
 repetitions depend directly on the 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.160
 load that you will lift 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.110
 if you have not done your number 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.860
 of rehearsals it is necessary to lower 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.060
 load 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.000
 if you are too comfortable on 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.100
 the exercise will increase the load 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.690
 so I hope these tips have you 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.880
 been helpful and I give you an appointment 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:12.830
 for a next video 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:16.320
 the little horn sound before the clap 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:19.789
 I have 5 apples do not hesitate to 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.789
 send me your questions will bombard
