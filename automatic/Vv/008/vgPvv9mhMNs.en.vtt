you're<00:02:26.950> not<00:02:27.070> just<00:02:27.340> going<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:27.490> be<00:02:27.610> able<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.850> pull

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
you're not just going to be able to pull

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
you're not just going to be able to pull
it<00:02:28.150> off<00:02:28.650> because<00:02:29.650> see<00:02:29.950> how<00:02:30.040> it<00:02:30.160> kind<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:31.080> hits

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
it off because see how it kind of hits

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.240 
it off because see how it kind of hits
it<00:02:32.260> there<00:02:32.500> um<00:02:33.990> so<00:02:34.990> you<00:02:35.080> just<00:02:35.320> kind<00:02:35.530> of<00:02:35.560> got<00:02:36.130> to

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
it there um so you just kind of got to

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.110 
it there um so you just kind of got to
work<00:02:36.430> your<00:02:36.610> way<00:02:36.790> around<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:39.250> can<00:02:39.280> get<00:02:39.640> another

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
work your way around you can get another

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.550 
work your way around you can get another
screwdriver<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:41.260> get<00:02:42.070> it<00:02:42.160> in<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.370> crack<00:02:43.560> and

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
screwdriver and get it in the crack and

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.900 
screwdriver and get it in the crack and
kind<00:02:44.860> of<00:02:44.950> start<00:02:45.690> working<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:46.810> out<00:02:46.900> that<00:02:47.230> way

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.940 

but<00:02:51.910> eventually<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:53.440> will<00:02:54.390> come<00:02:55.390> off<00:02:55.950> like

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
but eventually it will come off like

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.390 
but eventually it will come off like
that<00:02:58.080> so<00:02:59.080> this<00:02:59.410> you<00:02:59.710> can<00:02:59.740> just<00:03:00.130> set<00:03:00.310> down<00:03:00.990> and

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
that so this you can just set down and

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.790 
that so this you can just set down and
this<00:03:03.400> is<00:03:03.640> how<00:03:03.850> I<00:03:03.880> had<00:03:04.300> my<00:03:04.480> camera<00:03:04.990> when<00:03:05.590> I<00:03:05.620> was

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
this is how I had my camera when I was

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.920 
this is how I had my camera when I was
broken<00:03:06.250> right<00:03:06.460> um<00:03:09.030> really<00:03:10.030> at<00:03:10.360> this<00:03:10.570> point

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
broken right um really at this point

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.690

not going to say it's going to work for
everybody<00:03:14.140> but<00:03:14.410> you<00:03:14.860> know<00:03:14.980> it's<00:03:15.190> worth<00:03:15.340> a<00:03:15.520> shot

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
everybody but you know it's worth a shot

was<00:03:17.200> I<00:03:17.440> just<00:03:17.470> stuck<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.370> battery<00:03:18.700> back<00:03:18.880> in<00:03:18.910> at

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
was I just stuck the battery back in at

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.690 
was I just stuck the battery back in at
this<00:03:19.300> point<00:03:19.600> and<00:03:20.040> I<00:03:21.330> blew<00:03:22.710> some<00:03:23.710> canned<00:03:24.460> air

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700

this point and I blew some canned air
that<00:03:25.240> air<00:03:25.540> you<00:03:25.690> can<00:03:25.870> spray<00:03:26.200> everywhere<00:03:26.440> to

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
that air you can spray everywhere to

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.300 
that air you can spray everywhere to
clean<00:03:27.310> up<00:03:27.430> all<00:03:27.550> the<00:03:27.700> dust<00:03:27.910> and<00:03:28.710> made<00:03:29.710> sure<00:03:29.740> that

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
clean up all the dust and made sure that

the lens was not stuck or broken and

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.760 
the lens was not stuck or broken and
then<00:03:34.480> I<00:03:34.570> just<00:03:34.810> pushed<00:03:35.020> the<00:03:35.170> power<00:03:35.350> button

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
then I just pushed the power button

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.500 
then I just pushed the power button
right<00:03:35.800> here<00:03:36.340> it's<00:03:37.150> this<00:03:37.330> little<00:03:37.780> brass<00:03:38.050> thing

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.170 
right here it's this little brass thing
and<00:03:40.510> it<00:03:41.290> cycled<00:03:41.740> the<00:03:41.800> lens<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.430> that's<00:03:42.940> when<00:03:43.150> I

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
and it cycled the lens and that's when I

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.320 
and it cycled the lens and that's when I
knew<00:03:43.390> I'd<00:03:43.540> gotten<00:03:43.840> somewhere<00:03:44.350> so<00:03:45.030> at<00:03:46.030> that

knew I'd gotten somewhere so at that

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.290 
knew I'd gotten somewhere so at that
point<00:03:46.720> I<00:03:46.959> just<00:03:46.990> turned<00:03:47.560> it<00:03:47.680> off<00:03:47.850> you<00:03:48.850> can<00:03:49.000> see

point I just turned it off you can see

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.300 
point I just turned it off you can see
who's<00:03:49.660> working<00:03:50.080> I<00:03:52.470> turned<00:03:53.470> it<00:03:53.620> off<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:54.040> then

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.180 
who's working I turned it off and then
just<00:03:54.340> reassembled<00:03:55.209> it<00:03:55.570> so<00:03:58.740> take<00:03:59.740> this<00:03:59.890> battery

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:48.490

make sure it works yep it's on and
that's<00:04:49.430> all<00:04:49.820> I<00:04:49.850> did<00:04:50.000> so<00:04:50.890> I'm<00:04:52.210> not<00:04:53.210> going<00:04:53.720> to<00:04:53.810> say

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
that's all I did so I'm not going to say

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.860 
that's all I did so I'm not going to say
that<00:04:54.080> it<00:04:54.320> would<00:04:54.650> work<00:04:54.890> for<00:04:55.250> you<00:04:55.550> but<00:04:56.270> you<00:04:56.750> know

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
that it would work for you but you know

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.490 
that it would work for you but you know
if<00:04:57.169> your<00:04:57.560> camera<00:04:58.040> is<00:04:58.220> doing<00:04:58.640> this<00:04:58.790> thing<00:04:59.090> where

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
if your camera is doing this thing where

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.890 
if your camera is doing this thing where
it<00:05:00.500> just<00:05:01.070> won't<00:05:01.220> turn<00:05:01.580> on<00:05:01.730> it<00:05:01.970> clicks<00:05:02.330> on<00:05:02.540> then

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
it just won't turn on it clicks on then

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.820 
it just won't turn on it clicks on then
clicks<00:05:03.229> off<00:05:03.440> right<00:05:03.770> away<00:05:04.810> this<00:05:05.810> might<00:05:06.200> be

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
clicks off right away this might be

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.780 
clicks off right away this might be
worth<00:05:07.550> trying<00:05:07.910> it's<00:05:09.070> worth<00:05:10.070> that<00:05:10.340> or<00:05:10.490> I<00:05:10.520> mean

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
worth trying it's worth that or I mean

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.490 
worth trying it's worth that or I mean
if<00:05:10.910> you<00:05:11.030> can<00:05:11.180> return<00:05:11.360> it<00:05:11.570> you<00:05:11.900> can<00:05:12.050> always<00:05:12.169> just

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
if you can return it you can always just

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.379 
if you can return it you can always just
do<00:05:12.680> that<00:05:12.830> if<00:05:13.160> you<00:05:13.400> if<00:05:13.639> you<00:05:13.910> can't<00:05:14.180> and<00:05:14.360> you

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389

don't you can't just do a warranty or
something<00:05:19.210> that's<00:05:20.210> worth<00:05:20.660> doing<00:05:20.900> that<00:05:21.169> and

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
something that's worth doing that and

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.640 
something that's worth doing that and
not<00:05:21.800> buy<00:05:22.010> a<00:05:22.040> new<00:05:22.250> camera<00:05:22.690> so<00:05:23.690> that's<00:05:24.290> what<00:05:24.620> I
