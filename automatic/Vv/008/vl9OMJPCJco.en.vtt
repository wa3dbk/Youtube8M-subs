00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.710
 welcome I had two to a new 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.890
 tutorial 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.199
 in this tutorial I will teach you how 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.880
 reestablish or install the route 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:32.160
 original of the 210 huawei 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.090
 because you have to reset because 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:40.060
 we would have to reset or 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:42.590
 install this this recovery for when 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.860
 install the chrome 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.740
 with recovery has many advantages but 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.780
 there is a disadvantage that many consider 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.420
 big that is that you can not load your 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.260
 phone off if it's over 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.170
 to modify the phone or use the 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.480
 group recovery and you want to go back to 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.210
 original to be able to load it off the 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.410
 steps that we will have to follow are the 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:13.970
 next first we'll have to have 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:17.479
 the file or folder Official 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.450

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.210
 inside the file that lets see link in 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.210

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.030
 mobile cover good we go to official 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.660
 recovery for web today of 210 and we leave it 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.420
 aside once we have found this one 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:39.789
 the verified file that we have it 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.789
 Well, let's go to our phone 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.390
 all applications 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.920
 settings 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.280
 applications and uncheck the start 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.280
 Quick 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.700
 we turn off the phone 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.709
 good one time 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.709
 phone is off 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.980
 we removed the battery about 5 seconds 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.349
 we put it back on 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.780
 If the phone does not turn on a logo 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.670
 because we have removed it 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.520
 and on the drums and we have done well what 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.780
 previous good if you do not have to put 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.850
 remove the battery for a longer time 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.550
 we will go to Frankfurt mode in the 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.040
 phone for that we put the button 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.730
 volume down and the power on 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.730
 Same time 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.890
 the phone must be in the logo of 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.250
 huawei 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:55.790
 for a time when you consider that 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.750
 it will no longer happen from the huawei logo what 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.750
 connect to the computer 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.980
 once it is connected to the computer 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:17.290
 execute recoverable huawei of 210 points 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.270
 normally press the enter key 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.360
 and if you are on track and you see this number a 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:27.230
 serial number and send a quantity 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.510
 mb accurate head that is your 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.780

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:36.290
 original and it will turn on automatically 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:41.260
 so we press a key to close 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:43.450
 the window once the phone turns on 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.610
 well 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.069
 does that because I have it connected to 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.930
 recorded to the screen grabber of 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.640

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.480
 and the phone will power on 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.480
 completely normal 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:05.700
 and to check that it can be loaded 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:08.300
 off you can turn off the phone 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.300

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.750
 and we will see the cargo logo 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.080
 of the telephone 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.190
 and there it is 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.440
 the phone 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.220
 it's charging off 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.440
