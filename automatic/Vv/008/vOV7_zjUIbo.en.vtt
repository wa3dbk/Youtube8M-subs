measures and records weight of an

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:13.160 
measures and records weight of an
ambulatory<00:00:11.219> client<00:00:11.969> but<00:00:12.510> before<00:00:12.900> we<00:00:12.990> do<00:00:13.139> that

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
ambulatory client but before we do that

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.690 
ambulatory client but before we do that
why<00:00:13.559> don't<00:00:13.740> we<00:00:13.830> take<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.010> look<00:00:14.250> at<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.459> scale

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
why don't we take a look at the scale

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.880 
why don't we take a look at the scale
that<00:00:14.879> we<00:00:15.030> have<00:00:15.240> here<00:00:15.660> we<00:00:16.260> need<00:00:16.439> to<00:00:16.590> get<00:00:16.740> the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
that we have here we need to get the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.820 
that we have here we need to get the
scale<00:00:17.160> balance<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.880> zero

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
scale balance to zero

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.220 
scale balance to zero
you<00:00:19.830> need<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.279> move<00:00:20.519> a<00:00:20.850> larger<00:00:21.539> weight<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.990> zero

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
you need to move a larger weight to zero

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.550 
you need to move a larger weight to zero
the<00:00:22.949> smaller<00:00:23.340> weight<00:00:23.700> to<00:00:24.210> zero<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.840> you're

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
the smaller weight to zero and you're

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.290 
the smaller weight to zero and you're
going<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.800> check<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.190> this<00:00:26.340> balance<00:00:26.550> beam<00:00:27.030> is

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
going to check that this balance beam is

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.640 
going to check that this balance beam is
in<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.890> center<00:00:29.930> next<00:00:30.930> thing<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.110> you<00:00:31.500> want

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
in the center next thing that you want

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.029 
in the center next thing that you want
to<00:00:31.800> take<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.980> look<00:00:32.219> at<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.730> your<00:00:33.210> numbers<00:00:34.039> you'll

00:00:35.029 --> 00:00:35.039 
to take a look at is your numbers you'll

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:38.869 
to take a look at is your numbers you'll
see<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.730> numbers<00:00:36.059> here<00:00:36.300> are<00:00:36.539> even<00:00:37.140> in<00:00:37.879> between

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
see the numbers here are even in between

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.469 
see the numbers here are even in between
is<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:40.229> odd<00:00:40.409> now<00:00:41.370> we<00:00:41.429> have<00:00:41.729> shorter<00:00:42.210> lines

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:42.479 
is the odd now we have shorter lines

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:47.930 
is the odd now we have shorter lines
that<00:00:43.319> first<00:00:43.649> line<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.329> 1/4<00:00:45.329> 1/2<00:00:46.199> and<00:00:46.859> the<00:00:47.670> last

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
that first line is 1/4 1/2 and the last

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.039 
that first line is 1/4 1/2 and the last
one<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.420> 3/4<00:00:49.170> pound<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.729> take<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> look<00:00:51.749> at<00:00:51.870> your

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:52.049 
one is 3/4 pound so take a look at your

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:55.039 
one is 3/4 pound so take a look at your
scale<00:00:52.319> before<00:00:52.589> you<00:00:53.039> wear<00:00:53.339> your<00:00:53.639> client<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.719> why

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:55.049 
scale before you wear your client so why

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:56.619 
scale before you wear your client so why
don't<00:00:55.229> we<00:00:55.319> go<00:00:55.469> do<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.889> right<00:00:56.129> now

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
don't we go do that right now
