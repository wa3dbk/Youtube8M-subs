00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
number of drawbacks to using table based

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.509 
number of drawbacks to using table based
layouts<00:00:23.820> but<00:00:24.150> one<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.109> them<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.619> table

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
layouts but one of them is that table

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.939 
layouts but one of them is that table
based<00:00:26.730> layouts<00:00:27.269> don't<00:00:27.810> have<00:00:28.080> any<00:00:28.320> semantic

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
based layouts don't have any semantic

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.769 
based layouts don't have any semantic
understanding<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.090> different<00:00:30.539> areas

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
understanding to the different areas

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.030 
understanding to the different areas
that<00:00:31.199> are<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.470> them<00:00:32.360> with<00:00:33.360> html5<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.559> can<00:00:34.710> add

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
that are in them with html5 you can add

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.729 
that are in them with html5 you can add
the<00:00:35.399> semantic<00:00:36.000> tags<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.930> your<00:00:36.960> table<00:00:37.410> based

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.889 
the semantic tags to your table based
layouts<00:00:38.250> though<00:00:38.579> let's<00:00:39.480> go<00:00:39.600> ahead<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.780> see

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
layouts though let's go ahead and see

layouts though let's go ahead and see
how<00:00:40.140> we<00:00:40.200> would<00:00:40.440> do<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.969> we've<00:00:41.969> actually<00:00:42.239> got

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
how we would do that we've actually got

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.560 
how we would do that we've actually got
two<00:00:42.930> headers<00:00:43.200> here<00:00:43.370> we've<00:00:44.370> got<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.610> main<00:00:45.059> header

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
two headers here we've got a main header

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.010 
two headers here we've got a main header
for<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.079> entire<00:00:46.500> site<00:00:47.010> up<00:00:47.370> here<00:00:47.730> at<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.910> top

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
for the entire site up here at the top

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.959 
for the entire site up here at the top
then<00:00:49.020> we<00:00:49.140> also<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.770> header<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:50.550> area

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
then we also have a header in this area

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.319 
then we also have a header in this area
for<00:00:51.180> each<00:00:51.660> individual<00:00:52.230> page<00:00:52.850> we<00:00:53.850> also<00:00:54.059> have<00:00:54.210> a

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
for each individual page we also have a

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.119 
for each individual page we also have a
couple<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.690> navigation<00:00:55.350> areas<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:55.920> have<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
couple of navigation areas we have the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.400 
couple of navigation areas we have the
navigation<00:00:56.280> area<00:00:56.910> here<00:00:57.449> as<00:00:57.600> well<00:00:58.230> as<00:00:58.379> a

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
navigation area here as well as a

navigation area here as well as a
navigation<00:00:59.100> area<00:00:59.280> here<00:01:00.170> we<00:01:01.170> have<00:01:01.379> two<00:01:01.590> footers

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
navigation area here we have two footers

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.380 
navigation area here we have two footers
one<00:01:03.000> here<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.570> one<00:01:03.660> here<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:05.010> we<00:01:05.970> may<00:01:06.150> say

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
one here and one here and we may say

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.050 
one here and one here and we may say
that<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.689> entire<00:01:06.960> area<00:01:07.560> here<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.400> section

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
that this entire area here is a section

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.969 
that this entire area here is a section
or<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.810> could<00:01:09.960> just<00:01:09.990> say<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.680> an

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
or we could just say that this is an

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.359 
or we could just say that this is an
article<00:01:12.049> so<00:01:13.049> let's<00:01:13.229> go<00:01:13.350> ahead<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.619> add<00:01:13.950> those

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
article so let's go ahead and add those

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.359 
article so let's go ahead and add those
two<00:01:14.670> html5<00:01:15.630> tags<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.799> table<00:01:17.040> based

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
two html5 tags to this table based

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.640 
two html5 tags to this table based
layout<00:01:17.960> for<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.140> I'm<00:01:19.320> going<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.500> go<00:01:19.560> ahead

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
layout for that I'm going to go ahead

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.270 
layout for that I'm going to go ahead
and<00:01:19.740> go<00:01:19.890> into<00:01:20.009> split<00:01:20.490> view<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:21.060> you'll<00:01:21.869> see

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
and go into split view here you'll see

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.020 
and go into split view here you'll see
advantage<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.369> using<00:01:23.549> something<00:01:23.909> like

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
advantage of using something like

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.330 
advantage of using something like
Dreamweaver<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.530> fact<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.159> can

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
Dreamweaver is the fact that you can

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.340 
Dreamweaver is the fact that you can
very<00:01:26.580> easily<00:01:26.670> highlight<00:01:27.630> something<00:01:27.960> in

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
very easily highlight something in

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.920 
very easily highlight something in
design<00:01:29.340> view<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:30.450> highlights<00:01:30.630> a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
design view and it highlights a

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.170 
design view and it highlights a
corresponding<00:01:31.920> area<00:01:32.130> here<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.030> your<00:01:34.040> in<00:01:35.040> your

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
corresponding area here in your in your

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.920 
corresponding area here in your in your
own<00:01:36.409> code<00:01:37.409> view<00:01:37.820> so<00:01:38.820> what<00:01:38.939> I'm<00:01:39.090> going<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.450> do<00:01:39.659> is
