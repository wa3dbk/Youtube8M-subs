00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.010
 hello dear friends my name is 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.740
 constantin genius welcome you to 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:20.160
 bookmaker rating blog site 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:23.760
 Well, we still have a good streak 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.840
 positive results and were on the river 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.689
 what are the same results your submissive 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.780
 the servant will continue to show 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:36.300
 after the cup of course we skip 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.570
 to the championship of Spain and the next round 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.270
 the second lap opens and it opens 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.989
 for Seville valencia Valencia 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.020
 full-time confrontation in places 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.550
 teams neighbors tour table team 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.980
 which pretend of course on 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.550
 getting into the top four for now 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.649
 Seville and slightly better than 39 points from the 38 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.120
 Valencia but do not forget that 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.559
 Valencia for one match created more 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.930
 difficult match for predictions because 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.729
 team unpredictable can be expected 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:15.350
 just about anything from valencia and seville 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.340
 here she had such an all expressive 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.950
 exalted very excited and u 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.009
 the edge of the field here is the same from seville where 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.159
 his leadership is late but how 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.400
 said repeatedly for a bad game 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.710
 should be good sevil and frankly was 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.040
 bad in the match against Spain shafts cup 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.689
 and meetings and I think that two matches 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.909
 in a row here at this level of Seville 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.430
 most likely they did not allow themselves to play 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.670
 the more you understand the status and 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.610
 importance this game is definitely worth 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.899
 apart for 7 individuals but because the game is with 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.759
 direct competitor but what can be done here 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.040
 to be guided by those and others is very 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.869
 good group of course valencia 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.759
 the tavern plays which said that if 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.710
 noticeably the scars will not be happy 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.110
 of course while the alcazar of course yes 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.050
 not a rush of course it's generally all 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.420
 attack group 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.100
 so let's say dismissed sets of strengthen the same 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.620
 the most carlos bacca that scores 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.150
 fairly regular and melon suarez and 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.470
 guzzled files it all pluses but is 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.640
 undoubtedly a minus and at those and others it 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.980
 of course the game is in defense 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.760
 as with the standards at their gates and 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.680
 through the opponent's positional attack or 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.330
 through fast or exit defense in 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.930
 the attack of the opponent therefore it seems to me 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.510
 given the speed 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.090
 valencia sireli moments in this meeting 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.560
 must be and goals 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.180
 of course in this meeting we must 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.530
 The first thing I ask for is 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.750
 of course both will score 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:50.300
 good coefficient 175 why not 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:54.380
 but I have suspicions I have 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:58.490
 such a chuyka that only that on this team 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.630
 not stop and not than results in 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.760
 this meeting will not likely 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.920
 someone looks and if someone wins a 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.910
 most likely through the top through option 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.550
 both will score 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.880
 I can not say who Valencia strengthened but 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:14.890
 something suggests option 21 in one way or 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:18.200
 the other side may be 31 therefore 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.940
 I offer pledged for 175 and both will score 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.459
 and total more than two and a half is 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.630
 match with a factor of 2 and 3 very 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:28.070
 good numbers on site Velche 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.250
 We see that God will play good 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.570
 good sign and it will be that our successful 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.600
 the series is projected to continue not 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.520
