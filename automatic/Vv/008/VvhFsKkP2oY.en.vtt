00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
only be used in escalation mode so you

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.180 
only be used in escalation mode so you
can<00:02:25.310> use<00:02:25.459> them<00:02:26.170> people<00:02:27.170> about<00:02:27.620> an<00:02:27.739> escalation

mode if you like a lock of character in

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.430 
mode if you like a lock of character in
sinclair<00:02:31.850> guess<00:02:32.180> I<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:32.989> can<00:02:33.110> use<00:02:33.230> them<00:02:33.380> an

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
game for the Rings um that's basically

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.350 
game for the Rings um that's basically
you<00:04:49.430> just<00:04:49.460> go<00:04:49.790> and<00:04:49.910> capture<00:04:51.760> control<00:04:52.760> points

you just go and capture control points

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.510 
you just go and capture control points
but<00:04:54.020> in<00:04:54.230> the<00:04:54.380> game<00:04:54.590> it's<00:04:54.830> called<00:04:54.980> control

but in the game it's called control

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.310 
but in the game it's called control
nodes<00:04:56.740> so<00:04:57.740> you<00:04:57.800> win<00:04:58.340> you<00:04:59.030> have<00:04:59.660> control<00:05:00.260> of
