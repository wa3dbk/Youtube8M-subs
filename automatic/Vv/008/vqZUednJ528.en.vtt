you could be anywhere and have a dot-com
so<00:02:54.769> so<00:02:55.769> this<00:02:56.070> is<00:02:56.100> this<00:02:56.489> is<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.880> traceroute

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
so so this is this is the traceroute

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.030 
so so this is this is the traceroute
feature<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.920> can<00:02:59.100> really<00:02:59.340> find<00:02:59.970> anything

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
feature and you can really find anything

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.980 
feature and you can really find anything
this<00:03:03.040> will<00:03:03.220> take<00:03:03.370> me<00:03:03.550> to<00:03:03.700> digg<00:03:03.880> com<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:04.720> of

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
this will take me to digg com and of

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.630 
this will take me to digg com and of
course<00:03:05.020> this<00:03:05.350> will<00:03:05.440> also<00:03:05.590> go<00:03:05.830> through<00:03:06.040> Chicago

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
course this will also go through Chicago

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.430 
course this will also go through Chicago
it'll<00:03:07.360> probably<00:03:07.570> go<00:03:07.750> back<00:03:07.990> through<00:03:08.230> Los

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
it'll probably go back through Los

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.980 
it'll probably go back through Los

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.789 
Chicago and that's sure where cg Cilla's
it's<00:03:56.390> an<00:03:56.510> AT&amp;T<00:03:56.810> thing<00:03:57.200> so<00:03:57.319> it's<00:03:57.440> going<00:03:57.650> through

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
it's an AT&amp;T thing so it's going through

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.680 
it's an AT&amp;T thing so it's going through
AT&amp;T<00:03:58.160> routers<00:03:58.879> and<00:04:01.000> then<00:04:02.000> it's<00:04:02.180> going<00:04:02.360> to<00:04:02.450> lead

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
AT&amp;T routers and then it's going to lead

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.289 
AT&amp;T routers and then it's going to lead
to<00:04:04.690> PHX<00:04:05.690> that<00:04:05.959> could<00:04:06.140> be<00:04:06.319> Phoenix<00:04:07.299> possibly

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
to PHX that could be Phoenix possibly

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.250 
to PHX that could be Phoenix possibly
and<00:04:09.519> then<00:04:10.519> it's<00:04:10.640> gotta<00:04:10.790> stop<00:04:10.970> right<00:04:11.209> there<00:04:11.360> so

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
and then it's gotta stop right there so

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.839 
and then it's gotta stop right there so
that's<00:04:12.769> the<00:04:12.920> one<00:04:13.069> problem<00:04:13.280> with<00:04:13.430> trace<00:04:13.670> route

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
that's the one problem with trace route

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.280 
that's the one problem with trace route
is<00:04:14.480> every<00:04:14.690> now<00:04:14.810> and<00:04:14.959> then<00:04:15.049> it<00:04:15.200> will<00:04:15.410> stop<00:04:15.470> and

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
is every now and then it will stop and

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:24.370 
is every now and then it will stop and
timeout<00:04:18.430> so<00:04:19.430> hey<00:04:20.000> norm<00:04:20.239> tech<00:04:20.419> by<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:20.630> way<00:04:23.380> and

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
timeout so hey norm tech by the way and

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
timeout so hey norm tech by the way and
it's<00:04:25.040> probably<00:04:25.220> gonna<00:04:25.570> time<00:04:26.570> out<00:04:26.750> from<00:04:26.960> there

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
it's probably gonna time out from there

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.560 
it's probably gonna time out from there
so<00:04:28.630> this<00:04:29.630> is<00:04:29.870> the<00:04:30.080> traceroute<00:04:30.560> feature<00:04:31.330> and<00:04:32.330> of

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
so this is the traceroute feature and of

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.940 
so this is the traceroute feature and of
course<00:04:32.600> you<00:04:32.840> can<00:04:32.960> do<00:04:33.080> it<00:04:33.200> on<00:04:33.260> any<00:04:33.530> machine<00:04:33.680> I

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
course you can do it on any machine I

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.740 
course you can do it on any machine I
know<00:04:34.220> you<00:04:34.580> can<00:04:34.729> do<00:04:34.820> it<00:04:34.850> on<00:04:35.000> a<00:04:35.030> mac<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:35.300> you<00:04:35.570> can

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
know you can do it on a mac and you can

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.779 
know you can do it on a mac and you can
do<00:04:35.870> it<00:04:35.960> on<00:04:36.050> a<00:04:36.080> pc<00:04:36.530> slightly<00:04:37.460> different

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
do it on a pc slightly different

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:39.640 
do it on a pc slightly different
nomenclature<00:04:37.910> maybe<00:04:38.630> for<00:04:39.050> the<00:04:39.080> mac<00:04:39.320> if<00:04:39.500> i

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
nomenclature maybe for the mac if i

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.600 
nomenclature maybe for the mac if i
remember<00:04:39.860> correctly<00:04:40.340> maybe<00:04:40.699> I'm<00:04:40.850> miss

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
remember correctly maybe I'm miss

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.510 
remember correctly maybe I'm miss
remembering<00:04:43.610> but<00:04:43.880> uh<00:04:44.260> ok<00:04:45.260> now<00:04:45.800> this<00:04:46.039> ended<00:04:46.400> up

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
remembering but uh ok now this ended up

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.420 
remembering but uh ok now this ended up
and<00:04:46.729> it<00:04:47.030> actually<00:04:47.240> went<00:04:47.539> to<00:04:47.810> a<00:04:48.320> secure<00:04:49.220> server

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
and it actually went to a secure server

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.210 
and it actually went to a secure server
and<00:04:49.760> that's<00:04:50.720> which<00:04:51.410> is<00:04:51.440> probably<00:04:51.830> going

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
and that's which is probably going

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.650 
and that's which is probably going
somewhere<00:04:52.639> else<00:04:52.789> which<00:04:53.090> we<00:04:53.270> won't<00:04:53.479> know

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
somewhere else which we won't know

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.589 
somewhere else which we won't know
because<00:04:54.020> it's<00:04:54.169> a<00:04:54.350> secure<00:04:54.860> server<00:04:55.039> so<00:04:55.940> that<00:04:56.150> is

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:56.599 
because it's a secure server so that is

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:00.820 
because it's a secure server so that is
basically<00:04:56.630> in<00:04:57.440> a<00:04:57.470> nutshell<00:04:58.090> the<00:04:59.090> whole
