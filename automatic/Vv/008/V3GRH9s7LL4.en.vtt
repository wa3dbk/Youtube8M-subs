of going to just watch a movie and you

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.550 
of going to just watch a movie and you

know nothing about how but I don't think

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.410 
know nothing about how but I don't think
it's<00:01:07.740> worth<00:01:07.979> your<00:01:08.220> effort<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.909> terms<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.240> one

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
it's worth your effort in terms of one

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.730 
it's worth your effort in terms of one
the<00:01:09.540> Harry<00:01:09.720> Potter<00:01:09.990> movies<00:01:10.049> think<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:10.619> one

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the Harry Potter movies think it's one

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.219 
the Harry Potter movies think it's one
of<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> better<00:01:11.130> ones<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:11.640> got<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> lot<00:01:12.150> more

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
it there were moments in the movie where

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.300 
it there were moments in the movie where
it<00:01:39.479> was<00:01:39.600> just<00:01:39.750> plodding<00:01:40.229> along<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.799> lot<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
it was just plodding along a lot of the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.889 
it was just plodding along a lot of the
scenes<00:01:41.520> where<00:01:41.820> they're<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.210> forest<00:01:42.630> and

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
scenes where they're in the forest and

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.620 
scenes where they're in the forest and

trying to figure stuff out I felt it was

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.840 
trying to figure stuff out I felt it was
very<00:01:45.840> very<00:01:46.259> slow<00:01:46.740> but<00:01:47.040> that's<00:01:47.250> because<00:01:47.520> I'm

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
very very slow but that's because I'm

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.639 
very very slow but that's because I'm
not<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.090> Harry<00:01:48.360> Potter<00:01:48.479> fan<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.170> felt<00:01:49.439> like<00:01:49.530> I
