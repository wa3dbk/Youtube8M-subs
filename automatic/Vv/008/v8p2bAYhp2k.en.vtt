00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
as you can get your files and programs

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.800 
as you can get your files and programs
off<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.340> there<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.610> some<00:01:26.939> external<00:01:27.360> media

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
off of there on some external media

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.660 
off of there on some external media
because<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.950> know<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.100> could<00:01:29.310> run<00:01:29.490> into

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
because you know you could run into

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.399 
because you know you could run into
problems<00:01:30.210> while<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.600> format<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.170> going

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
problems while this format is going

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.260 
problems while this format is going
through<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.979> great<00:01:32.250> idea<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.670> backup

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
through so it's a great idea to backup

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.840 
through so it's a great idea to backup
your<00:01:33.540> files<00:01:33.869> before<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:35.100> do<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.490> but<00:01:35.759> the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
your files before you do this but the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.020 
your files before you do this but the
command<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.240> need<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.479> run<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:37.380> format<00:01:38.030> and

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
command you need to run this format and

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.490 
command you need to run this format and
then<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.299> give<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.570> drive<00:01:39.869> letter<00:01:40.110> I'm

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
then you give it a drive letter I'm

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.270 
then you give it a drive letter I'm
gonna<00:01:40.740> do<00:01:40.829> my<00:01:41.009> C<00:01:41.310> colon<00:01:42.259> space<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.710> then<00:01:44.250> a

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
gonna do my C colon space and then a

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.469 
gonna do my C colon space and then a
forward<00:01:44.970> leaning<00:01:45.390> slash<00:01:46.220> FS<00:01:47.220> which<00:01:48.000> which<00:01:48.450> is

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
forward leaning slash FS which which is

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.139 
forward leaning slash FS which which is
short<00:01:48.869> for<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.110> file<00:01:49.320> system<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.399> then<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.820> colon

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
short for a file system and then a colon

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:59.389 
short for a file system and then a colon
and<00:01:52.009> then<00:01:53.240> fat<00:01:54.240> it's<00:01:54.869> 30<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:56.299> replace<00:01:58.250> now<00:01:59.250> this
