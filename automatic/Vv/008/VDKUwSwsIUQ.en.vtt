00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
why do I do it phrase getalife springs

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.039 
why do I do it phrase getalife springs
to<00:02:16.659> mind<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:19.739> yes<00:02:20.739> a<00:02:21.069> bit<00:02:21.400> of<00:02:21.430> an<00:02:21.610> experiment

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
to mind and yes a bit of an experiment

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:35.000 
to mind and yes a bit of an experiment
cause<00:02:23.049> we're<00:02:23.260> gonna<00:02:23.349> go<00:02:23.530> over<00:02:23.709> here<00:02:24.069> mind<00:02:24.640> the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.539 

pond<00:02:36.010> it's<00:02:36.400> froze<00:02:37.590> did<00:02:38.590> that<00:02:38.769> bit<00:02:38.950> in<00:02:39.069> Swedish

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
pond it's froze did that bit in Swedish

pond it's froze did that bit in Swedish
so<00:02:39.760> you'd<00:02:39.909> understand<00:02:43.409> how<00:02:44.409> this<00:02:44.769> is<00:02:44.889> working

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
so you'd understand how this is working

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.699 
so you'd understand how this is working
this<00:02:46.060> only<00:02:46.480> put<00:02:46.659> up<00:02:46.750> two<00:02:46.959> days<00:02:47.139> ago

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709

birds do tend to take a few days to get
used<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.519> a<00:02:51.579> feeder<00:02:51.909> some<00:02:52.299> times<00:02:52.510> longer<00:02:52.870> than

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
used to a feeder some times longer than

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.679 
used to a feeder some times longer than
people<00:02:53.319> get<00:02:53.590> this<00:02:54.310> discourage<00:02:55.090> but<00:02:55.389> just

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:55.689 
people get this discourage but just

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:58.199 
people get this discourage but just

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
stick it out for a while so and the

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.690 
stick it out for a while so and the
reason<00:02:58.540> is<00:02:58.659> that<00:02:58.930> I've<00:02:59.049> got<00:02:59.260> that<00:02:59.519> you<00:03:00.519> see
