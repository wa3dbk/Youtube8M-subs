00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.340
 hello friends and welcome to my channel I am 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.830
 black and go before orion anime as 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.170
 you know the channel would change but I'll leave it 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.330
 in this way with anime movies and 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.430
 TV series I hope you like 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.590
 this proposal well let's start with the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.800
 today's video that will be with a criticism to 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.080
 the last sleeves of naruto more news 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.270
 the last sleeves of naruto in me 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.190
 opinion for me have dropped quality 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.920
 with a lot of nonsense that has happened 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.140
 as it is possible that out already a goddess 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.750
 it will cost you less to defeat the one you love 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.089
 give that it cost them even more at all times 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.430
 they give them powers from nowhere almost 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.260
 it was so that they left him without his eye 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.900
 of sharing and but there is no back and if 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.760
 motorbike to give it again something else that does not 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.159
 I liked it was when Naruto used his 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.769
 great secret jutsu the sexy against 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:01.049
 cabuya and it easily fell into that 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.299
 nonsense that hood his only was for 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.610
 funny moments and not to be used in 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:08.220
 a fight that displeased me 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.740
 it has become too predictable before 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.050
 I was looking forward to the manga now 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.000
 I feel the same when reading the manga as 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.100
 before, I also get tired of the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.680
 couples if they are going to give it either the 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.810
 every time brings more and more returned 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.580
 crazy people with that subject already bored 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.590
 he wants to give you a closing at the end of 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.690
 Naruto with those couples that no longer 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.150
 convinces at least me and I'm fed up 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.950
 with that theme plus the last sleeves 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.110
 It has been pure talk and talk about the 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.940
 Naruto's Hitachi Himself Convincing 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.950
 to sas that of not to peel and blah blah blah blah 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.050
 blah in the last manga at least we saw 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.570
 it seems that finally the fight 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.310
 expected to finally start and so 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.890
 I want to see her and finally 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.140
 kishimoto try to finish his work well 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.600
 since he has disappointed me in his last 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.060
 sleeves maybe he lost interest not what 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.729
 I know we hope and it is not of those manga that 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.800
 they are hated by lousy endings and naruto 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.050
 is one of the animes that I most defend 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.149
 but now I do not know how to help him since he 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.979
 has messed up Naruto many times 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.350
 So you want to give that 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.540
 battle for a long time but 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.370
 it was not given for one reason or another at the end 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.300
 parce that if it is going to give but I 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.030
 I ask the 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.160
 al will cause the same impact this battle 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.800
 as has been speculated I hope so 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.690
 because if not Naruto will be buried 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.640
 by itself he has lost many fans by 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.890
 so much nonsense that he has committed to what 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.280
 throughout his publications we hope and 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.560
 took a huge turn now I understand all 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.170
 those people who little by little have moved away 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.720
 to read Naruto's manga has become 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.910
 tedious started as a great manga but 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.400
 little by little its quality has decreased 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.380
 reason only kishimoto knows it I'll finish 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.960
 clear of seeing it since it was the anime that 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.570
 He invited me to see more animes and I have a 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.670
 huge appreciation but lately I just 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.100
 I have felt that this manga has fallen under 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.040
 so blabla powers of nothing 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.320
 delay in the fights and finally that 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.360
 enemies that one would say are going to give a lot 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.250
 what to talk about and not like I told you 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.110
 it glares a goodbye to be defeated more 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.540
 easy to kill or in less time 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.430
 he hoped that at least he would kill 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.680
 someone is not and you kill a priest or 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.230
 any other but it also distracts her 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.570
 a stupid fair but in the end I do not want 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.060
 do more courage is good that was the 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.930
 criticism now let's move on with the news that 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.269
 and many 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.760
 avn but I want to give my opinion about that 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.890
 it seems Naruto will come to an end on the 10th 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.260
 November I will not go into much depth 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.180
 about this but if this at the end it 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.579
 takes place and naruto shippuden yes 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.859
 end that day let's hope that its final 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.319
 be epic or at least good for 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.569
 have a good memory about him since 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.670
 if it does not end and another saga continues I think 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.349
 that you would see her but it would be like 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.719
 ask that lemon is a tree of 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.969
 guavas where can you get another 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:50.189
 enemy on my part I think it's time 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:52.590
 that it comes to a good end I want its 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:55.049
 opinion in the comments box as 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.819
 They have seen the last sleeves of Naruto and 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.069
 that they expect from the battle of those that 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.989
 against Naruto and as you see the news 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.120
 of Naruto's end they would like that 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.939
 end or I'm not good firing 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.739
 black go you already know how to subscribe 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.750
 I will leave my twitter so that I 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.959
 continue and there ask your questions and 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.959
 suggestions
