the camera I've got that 10 to 17
fisheye<00:00:37.219> zoom<00:00:37.579> which<00:00:37.790> is<00:00:37.910> a<00:00:37.940> great<00:00:38.180> lens<00:00:38.360> for

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
fisheye zoom which is a great lens for

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.610 
fisheye zoom which is a great lens for
shooting<00:00:38.780> skateboarding<00:00:39.290> and<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:39.469> great

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
shooting skateboarding and the great

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.549 
shooting skateboarding and the great
lens<00:00:39.800> for<00:00:39.980> a<00:00:40.129> video<00:00:40.820> handheld<00:00:41.530> basically<00:00:42.530> a

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
lens for a video handheld basically a

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.100 
lens for a video handheld basically a
what<00:00:42.739> I'm<00:00:42.829> doing<00:00:43.129> is<00:00:43.719> sent<00:00:44.719> my<00:00:44.780> white<00:00:44.960> balance

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
what I'm doing is sent my white balance

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.189 
what I'm doing is sent my white balance
to<00:00:45.469> daylight<00:00:45.829> and<00:00:46.070> I<00:00:46.820> set<00:00:47.030> my<00:00:47.180> color<00:00:47.660> profile

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
to daylight and I set my color profile

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:49.510 
to daylight and I set my color profile
to<00:00:48.500> natural<00:00:48.920> so<00:00:49.100> it<00:00:49.219> wouldn't<00:00:49.370> be<00:00:49.460> too

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
to natural so it wouldn't be too

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.310 
to natural so it wouldn't be too
saturated<00:00:49.850> so<00:00:50.600> I<00:00:50.629> can<00:00:50.780> work<00:00:50.899> with<00:00:51.050> it<00:00:51.140> a<00:00:51.170> little

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
saturated so I can work with it a little

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.080 
saturated so I can work with it a little
bit<00:00:51.440> in<00:00:51.559> post<00:00:51.770> I<00:00:52.129> give<00:00:52.520> it<00:00:52.610> a<00:00:52.699> color<00:00:52.820> correction

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
bit in post I give it a color correction

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.729 
bit in post I give it a color correction
that<00:00:53.239> I<00:00:53.360> want<00:00:53.570> make<00:00:53.809> those<00:00:53.989> decisions<00:00:54.500> later

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
that I want make those decisions later

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.920 
that I want make those decisions later
I'm<00:00:55.190> using<00:00:55.489> that<00:00:55.789> the<00:00:56.090> auto<00:00:56.420> exposure<00:00:56.600> lock

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
I'm using that the auto exposure lock

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.639 
I'm using that the auto exposure lock
button<00:00:57.559> to<00:00:58.070> lock<00:00:58.370> my<00:00:58.640> f-stop<00:00:59.120> at<00:00:59.840> four<00:01:00.320> and

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
button to lock my f-stop at four and

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.950 
button to lock my f-stop at four and
then<00:01:01.250> just<00:01:01.519> dialing<00:01:01.879> in<00:01:02.059> just<00:01:02.300> tweaking<00:01:02.629> it<00:01:02.780> by

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
then just dialing in just tweaking it by

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.810 
then just dialing in just tweaking it by
using<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:03.590> exposure<00:01:03.859> compensation<00:01:04.100> here

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
using the exposure compensation here

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.550 
using the exposure compensation here
just<00:01:05.390> dropped<00:01:05.630> it<00:01:05.750> like<00:01:05.780> a<00:01:06.110> little<00:01:06.410> bit<00:01:06.530> a

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
just dropped it like a little bit a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.140 
just dropped it like a little bit a
little<00:01:06.710> bit<00:01:06.830> of<00:01:06.950> negative<00:01:07.070> gain<00:01:07.430> there<00:01:07.670> once

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
little bit of negative gain there once

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.430 
little bit of negative gain there once
that's<00:01:08.360> all<00:01:08.510> locked<00:01:08.750> in<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.080> lights<00:01:09.260> stay

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
that's all locked in the lights stay

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.350 
that's all locked in the lights stay
nice<00:01:09.620> and<00:01:09.650> consistent<00:01:10.100> I'm<00:01:10.820> really<00:01:11.060> trying<00:01:11.300> to

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
nice and consistent I'm really trying to

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.240 
nice and consistent I'm really trying to
get<00:01:11.570> like<00:01:12.140> cool<00:01:12.410> things<00:01:12.440> in<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:12.920> foreground

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
get like cool things in the foreground

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.820 
get like cool things in the foreground
keep<00:01:14.000> the<00:01:14.120> camera<00:01:14.510> moving<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.410> just<00:01:15.590> really

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
keep the camera moving and just really

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.260 
keep the camera moving and just really
capture<00:01:16.190> the<00:01:16.280> energy<00:01:16.430> of<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:16.790> skateboarders

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
capture the energy of the skateboarders

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:25.690 
capture the energy of the skateboarders
in<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.480> park<00:01:23.710> so<00:01:24.710> when<00:01:25.250> we<00:01:25.370> were<00:01:25.430> working<00:01:25.490> with

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
in the park so when we were working with

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.160 
in the park so when we were working with
the<00:01:25.820> wide<00:01:25.970> lens<00:01:26.270> it<00:01:26.420> was<00:01:26.510> very<00:01:26.690> easy<00:01:26.870> to<00:01:27.050> keep

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
the wide lens it was very easy to keep

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.260 
the wide lens it was very easy to keep
things<00:01:27.380> in<00:01:27.530> focus<00:01:27.560> because<00:01:28.280> you<00:01:29.060> know<00:01:29.150> just

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
things in focus because you know just

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.060 
things in focus because you know just
the<00:01:29.570> nature<00:01:29.750> of<00:01:29.870> the<00:01:29.930> lens<00:01:30.230> and<00:01:30.560> it's<00:01:30.800> a<00:01:30.920> great

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
the nature of the lens and it's a great

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.830 
the nature of the lens and it's a great
lens<00:01:31.250> for<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:31.490> action<00:01:31.790> that<00:01:31.910> way<00:01:32.030> but<00:01:32.720> you

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
lens for the action that way but you

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.300 
lens for the action that way but you
know<00:01:32.930> also<00:01:33.170> it's<00:01:33.440> fun<00:01:33.620> to<00:01:33.710> use<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.010> depth<00:01:34.190> of

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
know also it's fun to use the depth of

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.460 
know also it's fun to use the depth of
field<00:01:34.520> of<00:01:34.730> these<00:01:35.150> cameras<00:01:35.570> so<00:01:36.110> right<00:01:36.260> now<00:01:36.380> I'm

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
field of these cameras so right now I'm

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.620 
field of these cameras so right now I'm
using<00:01:36.530> a<00:01:36.800> 200<00:01:37.190> millimeter<00:01:37.490> lens<00:01:37.580> and<00:01:38.390> what<00:01:38.510> I'm

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
using a 200 millimeter lens and what I'm

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.560 
using a 200 millimeter lens and what I'm
doing<00:01:38.930> is<00:01:39.050> I'm<00:01:39.230> a<00:01:39.260> pre<00:01:39.770> setting<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.310> focus<00:01:40.790> on

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
doing is I'm a pre setting the focus on

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.010 
doing is I'm a pre setting the focus on
a<00:01:41.630> point<00:01:42.050> and<00:01:42.380> letting<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:42.950> action<00:01:43.340> come<00:01:43.610> in

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
a point and letting the action come in

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.540 
a point and letting the action come in
into<00:01:45.020> that<00:01:45.170> point<00:01:45.410> so<00:01:45.800> I<00:01:45.830> have<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:46.160> skaters

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
into that point so I have the skaters

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.190 
into that point so I have the skaters
kind<00:01:46.940> of<00:01:47.000> hitting<00:01:47.180> a<00:01:47.270> very<00:01:47.300> particular<00:01:47.810> part

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
kind of hitting a very particular part

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.020 
kind of hitting a very particular part
of<00:01:48.230> this<00:01:48.350> rail<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:49.130> they'll<00:01:49.280> come<00:01:49.490> into<00:01:49.760> a<00:01:49.820> very

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
of this rail so they'll come into a very

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.700 
of this rail so they'll come into a very
narrow<00:01:50.210> depth<00:01:50.570> of<00:01:50.690> field<00:01:50.930> and<00:01:51.440> so<00:01:51.560> we're<00:01:51.680> using

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
narrow depth of field and so we're using

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.500 
narrow depth of field and so we're using
focus<00:01:52.280> in<00:01:52.460> that<00:01:52.610> way

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
focus in that way

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:10.490 
focus in that way
it's<00:01:53.720> uh<00:01:53.840> I<00:01:53.990> think<00:01:54.020> it's<00:01:54.200> looking<00:01:54.470> really<00:01:54.560> well

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.630 

one<00:02:11.500> of<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.650> great<00:02:11.890> things<00:02:12.130> about<00:02:12.250> shooting

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
one of the great things about shooting

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.060 
one of the great things about shooting
with<00:02:12.850> a<00:02:12.910> DSLR<00:02:13.450> is<00:02:13.750> how<00:02:14.200> easy<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.740> is<00:02:14.770> to<00:02:14.950> get

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
with a DSLR is how easy it is to get

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.310 
with a DSLR is how easy it is to get
some<00:02:15.220> camera<00:02:15.580> movement<00:02:16.000> right<00:02:16.960> here<00:02:16.990> we<00:02:17.230> have

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
some camera movement right here we have
