00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.970
 good have given us the toyota 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:07.670
 tundra 2014 this is the platinum edition 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.839
 to do a test in carp see 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.400
 trees sexting 

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:11.929
 let's tell you then then 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.879
 what have been my impressions of 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.879
 Handling of the Toyota Tundra 2014 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.390
 in his attempt to get into the tough 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.060
 fight of toyota pick-up trucks 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.829
 has redesigned the contra to offer a 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.590
 product surely attract the 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.809
 attention of many is an effort that 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.370
 is making the toyota by trying to 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.559
 gain ground in a segment that is 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.210
 traditionally dominated by cars 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.579
 Americans the pickup next merican 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.980
 are the trucks of this nation 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.899
 really the competition is not easy 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.579
 because if we look closely at the toyota 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.470
 Tundra ranks fourth or fifth 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.409
 place in that ladder of the vans 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.780
 there is not the dispute between the f-150 of 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.059
 fort the chevy silverado then comes the 2 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.839
 rambla james and sierra but good that has 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.680
 made the toyota tundra for 2014 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.360
 mechanically or at the engineering level 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.119
 there really are not many changes are 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.710
 mostly at a cosmetic level at the level of 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.560
 that what can happen in the environment 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.900
 of the toyota to submit an offer 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.540
 a solid selling argument to their 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.250
 buyers and changes are appreciated 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.799
 mostly on your front grill that 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.869
 now projects more aggressiveness no longer 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.640
 It has so many semi-round terminations 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.859
 like the previous model and this shows 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.420
 in every detail the headlights by 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:29.030
 example have one more aspect 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.340
 Angular and small lcd lights 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.090
 they light up during the day now they are 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.219
 more square 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.369
 the power of the toyota tundra was not 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:40.950
 altered continues with its same 381 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.049
 horsepower and 400 a pound for 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.039
 linear torsional foot from its 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.289
 5.7-liter v8 engine its capacity 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.230
 trailer can transport up to 10,000 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.120
 weight pounds 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.220
 inside we find a cabin 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.470
 quite wide and comfortable also very 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.870
 ideal for a very quiet trip 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.360
 long the passengers of the second row 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.340
 they enjoy a very generous space for 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.050
 stretch your legs and materials 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.720
 they were improved in addition to the appearance 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.700
 The console is very contemporary 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.890
 central comes with prominent buttons 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.450
 that operate the air conditioning and has 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.700
 a digital screen with system 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.280
 navigation and connectivity through 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.930
 system on turn that offers a variety 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.150
 of services that are activated with a 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.460
 smartphone as the internet search engine 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.070
 bing the musical application pandora 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.890
 warning about traffic sports news 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.350
 and information about the stock exchange 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.140
 at the level of the fuel consumption 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.810
 Toyota tundra of 2014 records levels 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.490
 of 15 miles per gallon on average this 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.150
 it's three seeds per gallon in the city 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.250
 and 17 on the highway the basic price 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.500
 suggested for the platinum edition is 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.500
 48 thousand 315 dollars
