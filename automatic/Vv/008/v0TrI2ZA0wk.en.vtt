older<00:04:29.710> Subarus<00:04:30.130> used<00:04:30.310> to<00:04:30.400> put<00:04:30.550> the<00:04:30.640> spare<00:04:30.850> tire

right<00:04:31.330> here<00:04:31.540> which<00:04:32.110> I<00:04:32.230> thought<00:04:32.410> was

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
right here which I thought was

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.160 
right here which I thought was
interesting<00:04:32.710> because<00:04:33.700> this<00:04:34.240> engine<00:04:34.540> is<00:04:34.900> what

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
interesting because this engine is what

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.290 
interesting because this engine is what
they<00:04:35.290> call<00:04:35.530> laterally<00:04:36.280> impose<00:04:36.790> meaning

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
they call laterally impose meaning

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.600 
they call laterally impose meaning
instead<00:04:38.080> of<00:04:38.320> the<00:04:38.410> Pistons<00:04:38.800> going<00:04:39.040> up<00:04:39.310> and<00:04:39.490> down

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
instead of the Pistons going up and down

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.100 
instead of the Pistons going up and down
or<00:04:40.090> in<00:04:40.450> a<00:04:40.510> v-shape<00:04:40.960> there<00:04:41.650> side<00:04:41.950> to<00:04:42.130> side<00:04:42.370> so

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
or in a v-shape there side to side so

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.570 
or in a v-shape there side to side so
Pistons<00:04:44.110> actually<00:04:44.470> move<00:04:44.650> it's<00:04:45.280> a<00:04:45.400> four

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
Pistons actually move it's a four

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.640 
Pistons actually move it's a four
cylinder<00:04:45.850> so<00:04:46.030> good<00:04:46.180> two<00:04:46.930> cylinders<00:04:47.350> on<00:04:47.500> this

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
cylinder so good two cylinders on this

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.040 
cylinder so good two cylinders on this
side<00:04:47.860> two<00:04:48.550> cylinders<00:04:49.000> on<00:04:49.150> this<00:04:49.300> side<00:04:49.510> and<00:04:49.720> they

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
side two cylinders on this side and they

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.530 
side two cylinders on this side and they
move<00:04:50.230> in<00:04:50.590> and<00:04:50.770> out<00:04:51.060> like<00:04:52.060> that<00:04:52.240> so<00:04:52.450> the

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
move in and out like that so the

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.210 
move in and out like that so the
cylinder<00:04:52.810> head<00:04:53.050> is<00:04:53.230> actually<00:04:53.560> on<00:04:53.770> there

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
cylinder head is actually on there

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.240 
cylinder head is actually on there
sideways<00:04:54.720> it's<00:04:55.720> a<00:04:55.780> little<00:04:55.990> weird<00:04:56.200> plus<00:04:56.920> like<00:04:57.190> I

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
sideways it's a little weird plus like I

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.080 
sideways it's a little weird plus like I
said<00:04:57.460> it's<00:04:57.730> got<00:04:57.880> all-wheel-drive<00:04:58.950> so<00:05:00.090> it

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
said it's got all-wheel-drive so it

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.630 
said it's got all-wheel-drive so it
should<00:05:01.390> be<00:05:01.420> good<00:05:02.290> in<00:05:02.470> the<00:05:02.850> snow<00:05:03.850> and<00:05:04.090> ice<00:05:05.640> but

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
should be good in the snow and ice but

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.810 
should be good in the snow and ice but
it<00:05:07.240> doesn't<00:05:07.570> look<00:05:07.770> too<00:05:08.770> bad<00:05:08.800> you<00:05:09.430> only<00:05:09.580> body

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
it doesn't look too bad you only body

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.800 
it doesn't look too bad you only body
