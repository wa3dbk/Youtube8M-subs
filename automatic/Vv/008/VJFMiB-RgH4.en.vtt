00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
mainly it's for decks it like to send a

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.070 
mainly it's for decks it like to send a
lot<00:05:23.460> because<00:05:24.460> I<00:05:24.729> put<00:05:25.210> this<00:05:25.360> card<00:05:25.630> in<00:05:25.840> so<00:05:26.020> I

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
lot because I put this card in so I

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.779 
lot because I put this card in so I
could<00:05:26.139> take<00:05:26.349> their<00:05:26.500> monster<00:05:26.919> and<00:05:27.130> since<00:05:27.729> I

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
could take their monster and since I

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:29.969 
could take their monster and since I
head<00:05:27.940> do<00:05:28.030> it<00:05:28.150> with<00:05:28.270> a<00:05:28.330> few<00:05:28.479> tuners<00:05:28.810> um<00:05:29.080> I<00:05:29.500> can

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
head do it with a few tuners um I can

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.580 
head do it with a few tuners um I can
synchro<00:05:30.280> or<00:05:30.610> just<00:05:31.270> overlay<00:05:31.630> because<00:05:32.440> this

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
synchro or just overlay because this

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:33.990 
synchro or just overlay because this
deck<00:05:32.740> has<00:05:32.889> many<00:05:33.159> different<00:05:33.250> levels<00:05:33.490> it's<00:05:33.820> very

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
deck has many different levels it's very

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.140 
deck has many different levels it's very
versatile<00:05:34.449> and<00:05:34.720> its<00:05:35.289> level<00:05:35.590> choices<00:05:36.000> so<00:05:37.000> it's

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
versatile and its level choices so it's

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.760 
versatile and its level choices so it's
not<00:05:37.240> really<00:05:37.300> hard<00:05:37.599> for<00:05:37.720> me<00:05:37.780> to<00:05:37.900> take<00:05:38.050> car<00:05:38.500> just

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
not really hard for me to take car just

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.350 
not really hard for me to take car just
overlay<00:05:39.220> with<00:05:39.400> it<00:05:39.520> or<00:05:39.610> synchro<00:05:40.530> the<00:05:41.530> third<00:05:41.740> MST

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
overlay with it or synchro the third MST
