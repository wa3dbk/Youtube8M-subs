00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.640
 for fantastic this evening begins with an investigation into flying saucers 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.430
 an ordinance of the Brazilian air force published this week in the official diary 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.589
 of marriage 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:16.660
 according to the necessity of archiving the reports on the so-called 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.730
 about this 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.730
 unidentified flying objects 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.439
 but do flying saucers really exist? 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.060
 what about ports like these 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.669
 and the famous case of the actor who would have appeared in varginha 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.050
 truth or lie 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.180
 a new destination had access to old documents that had already been released 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.180
 aeronautics are in the national archive in Brasilia. 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.770
 drês is considered the number 1 case of Brazil, there are five votes from one disc 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.070
 flying in the bar of tijuca in rio de janeiro in 1952 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.850
 they were taken by the pet photographer who is his of the extinct magazine the cruise 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.320
 circulated in one edition and this year have had a major impact on 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.130
 Brazil and the world ran 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.300
 the photos were presented to the military authorities and many 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.960
 researchers have 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.899
 this would ultimately prove that aliens visit the earth 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.740
 really 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.150
 the researcher claudeir covo finds out that 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.160
 if there is no photo 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.160
 we see that the object 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.540
 2 in note to right beam in the inner environment from right to left 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.450
 clearly shows that the only 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.720
 there's no sense in the southern part of Christmas, the singing show 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.400
 100% with mounting 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.270
 another document that was stored for decades in the 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.580
 aeronautics is the dossier of the so-called adult operation conducted by 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.540
 aeronautics officials in the northeast region of 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.660
 in 1977 are hundreds of reports and many photos of alleged UFOs 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.310
 the commander of the operation bradesco who already died 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.909
 appear here in an interview with the fantastic in 1997 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.259
 were there 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:16.199
 we do not believe 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:19.199
 we soon went 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.219
 Ford reported 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:25.680
 but three years ago 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.509
 a revelation because in doubt operation dish 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:32.419
 known as the most formidable collection of documents on disks 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.299
 flying saucers already collected in Brazil 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.609
 fernando costa who signs the blog on the internet as fernando da doble era 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:42.950
 son of the aeronautical officer responsible for the documentation of 

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:44.179
 dish operation 

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:47.849
 and had been tasked by his father to reveal the photos taken by the 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.929
 aeronautics 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:51.030
 in an interview 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.549
 currently he directs 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.180
 specialized in furniture 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.789
 time has closed 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:56.980
 but patience 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.780
 the area preventing any minute point stuck in the film practices look like a 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.989
 flying saucer 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.290
 the meeting very productive news published by sbpc 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:10.129
 son of a bbc journalist 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.129
 the closest friends 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.239
 huambo the nets of varginha in minas gerais' 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.659
 he would have appeared in 1996 to three witness second girls caught 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:27.659
 by the army he always denied history 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:32.619
 at the time the case was investigated and disclosed by the researcher as a general rule 

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:36.609
 that we anticipated we will not abandon the case recently that not all 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.059
 information is welcome 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:44.289
 models will travel back to the place where the two he loves would have been captured 

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:47.999
 after falling to 11 years of study he says that nothing has been proven 

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:51.449
 the existence of a series of reports 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:55.480
 d alleged appearances of affected flying objects 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.199
 were rare in the case 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:00.299
 the testimonies of people of the most diverse levels 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.810
 sociocultural there are dozens of 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.159
 but which are not at all 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.910
 So that we can leave the sea. 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:07.779
 in varginha 

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:08.959
 something happened 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.750
 involving a spacecraft from another planet there is no evidence or evidence 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:14.709
 of this 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.739
 the archives of aeronautics also kept a famous sequence of photos 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.329
 made of trinity island 1200 miles off the coast of holy spirit 

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:29.539
 the photos were taken by palairo baraúna who already died and appears here 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.539
 in images made by the fantastic 13 years 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:37.599
 to date these photos are considered authentic by many researchers of the 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:40.779
 Brazil and abroad despite a detail 

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:45.279
 of these two photos the image of the disk is identical only that upside down 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.620
 now for the first time the fantastic disclosed the entity on the avenue 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.330
 tridade trindade a friend of the family of baraúna reports what she heard from the mouth 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.509
 the photographer himself 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:01.879
 he forced these images was a montage 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.539
 with the dollar 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:06.939
 in comex christmas kitchen 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:09.400
 came back 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.159
 a term or a spacecraft 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:18.360
 one dead with a firearm in his house refrigerator he photographed a 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.659
 refrigerator 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:23.499
 with a remuneration 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:28.259
 made by the apple as a whole is a silly world demo 

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:33.349
 the city of barauna is with a niece of him who did not want to record 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:36.349
 interview but confirms fraud 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:40.029
 but they are in the flying saucers do not exist 

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:43.920
 this at least one important case in the archives of aeronautics 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.009
 was never explained 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:51.969
 in 1986 the Air Force jets were fired to chase 21 objects 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:56.419
 lights that appeared on the radar screens on São Paulo 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:58.780
 São José dos Campos, rio de janeiro 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.289
 and that were seen by the pilots 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.039
 it's a very strong light 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:06.240
 that's how the fantastic news case 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.090
 this week other Brazilian military authorities have publicly acknowledged 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.810
 first time at the risk of certain unidentified flying 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.129
 was 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:21.199
 said by the bank itself having objects can not be attentive 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:24.789
 that is, they did not have many technical explanations 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.410
 to define what is one of these objects is today we explained
