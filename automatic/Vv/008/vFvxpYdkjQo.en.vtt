Thunder<00:00:29.039> now<00:00:29.580> those<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.210> don't<00:00:30.449> know

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
Thunder now those that don't know

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.310 
Thunder now those that don't know
difference<00:00:31.140> Thunder<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.989> actually<00:00:33.989> a

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
difference Thunder is actually a

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.470 
difference Thunder is actually a
triggered<00:00:34.800> event<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.340> happens<00:00:35.700> following<00:00:36.120> a

triggered event that happens following a
lightning<00:00:36.780> flash<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.770> actually<00:00:38.719> when

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
lightning flash so it is actually when

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.799 
lightning flash so it is actually when
Thunder<00:00:40.140> should<00:00:40.559> naturally<00:00:41.250> occur<00:00:41.550> if<00:00:42.360> you

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
Thunder should naturally occur if you

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.119 
Thunder should naturally occur if you
wish<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.410> could<00:00:43.590> use<00:00:43.800> thunder<00:00:44.250> storm<00:00:44.809> set<00:00:45.809> as

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
wish you could use thunder storm set as

a continual file say an hour-long mp3 of
a<00:00:51.449> thunderstorm<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.590> wanted<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.640> run

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
a thunderstorm that you wanted to run

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.639 
a thunderstorm that you wanted to run
the<00:00:54.000> entire<00:00:54.300> duration<00:00:54.690> at<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.110> store<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.530> you

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
the entire duration at the store and you

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.700 
the entire duration at the store and you
could<00:00:55.800> use<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.190> but<00:00:56.489> for<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.420> purpose<00:00:57.809> I

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
could use that but for this purpose I

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.920 
could use that but for this purpose I
wanted<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.550> try<00:00:59.760> something<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.239> little<00:01:00.750> bit

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
wanted to try something a little bit

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.939 
wanted to try something a little bit
more<00:01:00.960> finicky<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.390> it's<00:01:03.390> not<00:01:03.570> perfect<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.530> I

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
more finicky so it's not perfect but I

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.300 
more finicky so it's not perfect but I
figured<00:01:05.820> I'd<00:01:06.030> give<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.479> shot<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:07.170> will<00:01:07.770> start

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
figured I'd give it a shot I will start

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.600 
figured I'd give it a shot I will start
