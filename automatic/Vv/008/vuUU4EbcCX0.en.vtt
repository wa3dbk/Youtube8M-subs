00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.210
Canon Document Scanner

00:00:06.981 --> 00:00:12.280
actually use it in an office

00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:18.050
I visited the office of the "Six Apart".

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:25.530
Mrs. Takahashi has difficulty treating many papers.

00:00:30.101 --> 00:00:32.680
Too many papers!

00:00:32.681 --> 00:00:36.980
You can solve them with the scanner.

00:00:36.981 --> 00:00:38.420
"Yes"

00:00:38.421 --> 00:00:46.020
I wanted something to compare the speed of the scanner.

00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:51.560
So I asked Mr.Ito to fight the scanner.

00:00:51.561 --> 00:01:00.750
Mr.Ito can type very quickly. Because he was a editor for over 10 years.

00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:03.180
Ready Go!

00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:08.369
Very fast. "I'm a professional"

00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:14.400
The scanner is much faster

00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:18.330
How many? "1 page"

00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:22.350
Very fast. "Can I rest?"

00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:29.930
Thick paper. It can scan both side.

00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:38.740
Finished?

00:01:41.241 --> 00:01:44.410
"185 documents"

00:01:44.411 --> 00:01:48.020
"about 20"

00:01:48.021 --> 00:01:50.590
We won!

00:01:50.591 --> 00:01:54.360
"Very very fast"

00:01:54.361 --> 00:02:00.130
"I felt little delay to read data to the PC"

00:02:00.131 --> 00:02:02.630
"I want it."

00:02:02.631 --> 00:02:09.980
I was surprised by Mr.Ito's typing speed.

00:02:09.981 --> 00:02:18.750
But this scanner is much faster than him.

00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:28.630
Mrs.Takahashi said "I want it". So I hope her boss will buy this for her.
