shield you'll notice that there's a

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.650 
shield you'll notice that there's a
shine<00:00:38.129> coming<00:00:38.520> off<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.730> back<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.390> Illuma

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
shine coming off the back of the Illuma

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.940 
shine coming off the back of the Illuma
shell<00:00:39.870> what's<00:00:40.200> because<00:00:40.440> we<00:00:40.559> went<00:00:40.710> with<00:00:40.829> an

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
shell what's because we went with an

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.459 
shell what's because we went with an
anodized<00:00:41.520> aluminum<00:00:42.030> plate<00:00:42.300> over<00:00:42.960> ABS<00:00:43.320> plastic

anodized aluminum plate over ABS plastic

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.160 
anodized aluminum plate over ABS plastic
the<00:00:44.370> reason<00:00:44.640> we<00:00:44.730> went<00:00:44.879> with<00:00:45.090> aluminum<00:00:45.719> mail<00:00:46.020> is

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the reason we went with aluminum mail is

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.290 
the reason we went with aluminum mail is
because<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:47.010> finish<00:00:47.550> we<00:00:47.760> wanted<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.059> stay

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
because the finish we wanted to stay

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.940 
because the finish we wanted to stay
true<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.899> what<00:00:48.930> Apple<00:00:49.410> originally<00:00:49.829> had

true to what Apple originally had

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.889 
true to what Apple originally had
intended<00:00:50.340> for<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.700> tablet<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.629> if<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.780> feel

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
intended for the tablet so if you feel

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.180 
intended for the tablet so if you feel
the<00:00:52.050> back<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.199> your<00:00:52.410> iPad<00:00:52.770> you'll<00:00:52.920> feel<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
the back of your iPad you'll feel the

sentient texture we wanted to mimic that

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.529 
sentient texture we wanted to mimic that
