I<00:02:11.550> think<00:02:11.880> it's<00:02:12.030> probably<00:02:12.240> I<00:02:12.630> think<00:02:13.080> it's<00:02:13.230> uh

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
I think it's probably I think it's uh

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.430 
I think it's probably I think it's uh
it's<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.910> same<00:02:15.180> donor<00:02:15.450> base<00:02:15.750> is<00:02:15.960> basically

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
it's the same donor base is basically

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.780 
it's the same donor base is basically
what<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.620> comes<00:02:16.710> down<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.250> they<00:02:17.580> have<00:02:17.670> the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
what it comes down to they have the

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.150 
what it comes down to they have the
stand<00:02:18.000> they<00:02:18.210> get<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.450> same<00:02:18.660> bit<00:02:18.960> you<00:02:19.230> know<00:02:19.260> new

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
stand they get the same bit you know new

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.600 
stand they get the same bit you know new
jersey<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:21.240> know<00:02:21.330> those<00:02:21.540> it's<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.410> same<00:02:22.710> same

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
jersey you know those it's the same same

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.150 
jersey you know those it's the same same
donor<00:02:23.910> base<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.690> you<00:02:25.110> write<00:02:25.380> like<00:02:25.770> sort<00:02:26.130> of

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
donor base that you write like sort of

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.490 
donor base that you write like sort of
like<00:02:26.310> how<00:02:26.460> andrew<00:02:27.270> Cuomo<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:27.930> chris<00:02:28.110> christie

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
like how andrew Cuomo and chris christie

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.810 
like how andrew Cuomo and chris christie
are<00:02:28.590> supported<00:02:28.950> by<00:02:28.980> all<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.250> same<00:02:29.460> yes

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
are supported by all the same yes

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.270 
are supported by all the same yes
absolutely<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.380> think<00:02:31.440> that's<00:02:31.800> definitely

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
absolutely and I think that's definitely

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.010 
absolutely and I think that's definitely
it<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:32.970> look<00:02:33.240> here's<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.570> bottom<00:02:33.810> line

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
it and and look here's the bottom line

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.590 
it and and look here's the bottom line
where<00:02:34.740> we<00:02:34.890> are<00:02:35.040> with<00:02:35.280> Iran<00:02:35.640> just<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.210> remind

it<00:05:41.909> to<00:05:42.000> be<00:05:42.120> then<00:05:42.300> it<00:05:42.389> became<00:05:42.569> a<00:05:42.629> regular<00:05:42.839> thing

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:44.909 
and now it's a part of the process

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:47.059 
and now it's a part of the process
that's<00:05:45.419> how<00:05:45.569> they<00:05:45.750> do<00:05:45.810> it<00:05:45.930> somebody<00:05:46.770> breaks

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:47.069 
that's how they do it somebody breaks

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:49.040 
that's how they do it somebody breaks
that<00:05:47.339> across<00:05:47.940> that<00:05:48.210> line<00:05:48.389> and<00:05:48.690> then<00:05:48.810> it

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
that across that line and then it

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.450 
that across that line and then it
happens<00:05:49.409> a<00:05:49.500> little<00:05:49.589> more<00:05:49.860> a<00:05:49.889> little<00:05:50.009> more<00:05:50.219> than

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
happens a little more a little more than

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.070 
happens a little more a little more than
it<00:05:50.550> becomes<00:05:50.789> normal<00:05:51.180> and<00:05:51.690> if<00:05:51.810> that<00:05:51.960> happens

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
it becomes normal and if that happens

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.809 
it becomes normal and if that happens
with<00:05:52.409> this<00:05:52.560> you<00:05:53.069> know<00:05:53.159> i<00:05:53.190> mean<00:05:53.219> you<00:05:53.580> just<00:05:53.759> can't
