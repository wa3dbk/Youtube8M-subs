before<00:00:17.670> reviewing<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.300> laptop<00:00:18.570> let's<00:00:19.140> see

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
before reviewing this laptop let's see

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.140 
before reviewing this laptop let's see
what<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.650> inside<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.460> first<00:00:20.730> thing<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:21.060> will

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
what is inside the first thing you will

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.450 
what is inside the first thing you will
see<00:00:21.210> before<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:21.990> assembling<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.920> the

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
see before this assembling it is the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.490 
see before this assembling it is the
lack<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.000> same<00:00:24.390> sturdiness<00:00:24.810> we<00:00:25.109> use<00:00:25.320> to

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
lack of the same sturdiness we use to

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.170 
lack of the same sturdiness we use to

it<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.630> still<00:00:27.900> ok<00:00:28.410> but<00:00:28.710> applying<00:00:29.279> more

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
it is still ok but applying more

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.519 
it is still ok but applying more
pressure<00:00:29.580> on<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.240> case<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.750> will<00:00:30.840> easily<00:00:30.990> see

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
pressure on the case you will easily see

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
nothing like a cooling vents on bottom

both<00:00:44.010> cooling<00:00:44.460> fans<00:00:44.700> are<00:00:44.910> supposed<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.539> suck

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
both cooling fans are supposed to suck

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.440 
both cooling fans are supposed to suck
air<00:00:46.079> from<00:00:46.469> those<00:00:46.710> small<00:00:47.070> holes<00:00:47.100> right<00:00:48.090> beneath

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
air from those small holes right beneath

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.540 
air from those small holes right beneath
the<00:00:48.600> keyboard<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.289> take<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.010> away<00:00:50.100> from<00:00:50.430> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
the keyboard and take it away from the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.729 
the keyboard and take it away from the
laptop<00:00:50.789> throughout<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.020> cooling<00:00:52.410> vents

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
laptop throughout the cooling vents

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.560 
laptop throughout the cooling vents
located<00:00:53.190> between<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.640> keyboard<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
located between the keyboard and the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.630 
located between the keyboard and the
screen<00:00:54.600> hinge<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.770> we<00:00:55.920> probably<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:56.520> to

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
screen hinge so we probably have to

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.639 
screen hinge so we probably have to
reconsider<00:00:57.120> our<00:00:57.270> habit<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.840> eating<00:00:58.170> chips

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
reconsider our habit of eating chips

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.650 
reconsider our habit of eating chips
over<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.039> laptop<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.640> case<00:01:00.000> we<00:01:00.180> want<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.480> keep

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
over the laptop in case we want to keep

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.930 
over the laptop in case we want to keep
it<00:01:00.809> cool<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.440> what<00:01:01.620> else<00:01:01.800> inside<00:01:02.250> two<00:01:02.609> cooling

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
it cool but what else inside two cooling

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.000 
it cool but what else inside two cooling
vents<00:01:03.270> as<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.570> just<00:01:03.809> said<00:01:04.049> both<00:01:04.350> working<00:01:04.769> for

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
vents as I just said both working for

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.429 
vents as I just said both working for
cooling<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.400> GPU<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.119> CPU<00:01:06.420> together<00:01:07.200> but

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
cooling the GPU and the CPU together but

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.710 
cooling the GPU and the CPU together but
not<00:01:07.860> separately<00:01:08.369> there<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.909> only<00:01:09.090> one<00:01:09.479> RAM

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
not separately there is only one RAM

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.570 
not separately there is only one RAM
slot<00:01:10.049> where<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.290> can<00:01:10.560> remove<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.130> memory<00:01:11.430> and

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
slot where you can remove the memory and

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.789
