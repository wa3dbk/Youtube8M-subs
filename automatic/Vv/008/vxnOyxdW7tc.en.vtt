I'm only using the bottom half of the
piece<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.210> paper<00:00:45.450> because<00:00:46.170> at<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.469> end<00:00:46.559> I'm

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
piece of paper because at the end I'm

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:58.040 
piece of paper because at the end I'm
going<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.070> fold<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.820> create<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.300> car

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.290

remember that the watercolor is

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.709 
remember that the watercolor is
transparent<00:01:12.409> therefore<00:01:13.310> you<00:01:13.850> can<00:01:14.090> do<00:01:14.270> a<00:01:14.299> good

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
transparent therefore you can do a good

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:31.370 
transparent therefore you can do a good
drawing<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:15.380> you<00:01:15.829> will<00:01:15.979> always<00:01:16.430> show

if you want to conserve a white margin
on<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.130> sides<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:35.700> painting<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.390> can

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
on the sides of the painting you can

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.270 
on the sides of the painting you can
cover<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.560> paper<00:01:37.830> with<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> masking<00:01:38.880> tape<00:01:40.280> in

cover the paper with a masking tape in
this<00:01:41.549> case<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.940> will<00:01:42.119> mix<00:01:42.299> different<00:01:42.810> groups<00:01:44.299> to

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
this case I will mix different groups to

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.590 
this case I will mix different groups to
paint<00:01:45.570> what<00:01:45.720> will<00:01:45.930> be<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.350> snow<00:01:46.619> or<00:01:46.890> earth<00:01:47.600> we

paint what will be the snow or earth we

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.130 
paint what will be the snow or earth we
do<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.869> on<00:01:49.049> dry<00:01:49.320> paper<00:01:50.090> mostly<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.539> as<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.899> keep

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
do it on dry paper mostly so as to keep

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.070 
do it on dry paper mostly so as to keep
a<00:01:52.320> sharp<00:01:52.350> saw<00:01:52.920> rice<00:01:53.070> on<00:01:53.280> line<00:01:53.659> then<00:01:54.659> we<00:01:54.840> wait

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
a sharp saw rice on line then we wait

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.320 
a sharp saw rice on line then we wait
until<00:01:55.440> the<00:01:55.770> whole<00:01:56.009> thing<00:01:56.250> dries<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:57.180> they

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
until the whole thing dries so they

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.130 
until the whole thing dries so they
paint<00:01:57.630> fixes<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:59.000> then<00:02:00.000> we<00:02:00.600> get<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.899> paper

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
paint fixes and then we get the paper

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.950 
paint fixes and then we get the paper
wet<00:02:01.289> again<00:02:01.920> this<00:02:02.759> part<00:02:03.090> ended<00:02:03.420> up<00:02:03.539> a<00:02:03.659> little

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
wet again this part ended up a little

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.840 
wet again this part ended up a little
bit<00:02:04.080> darker<00:02:04.530> than<00:02:04.560> what<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:04.979> originally<00:02:05.280> wanted

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
bit darker than what I originally wanted

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.719 
bit darker than what I originally wanted
so<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:06.869> scrub<00:02:07.259> some<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.679> paint<00:02:08.039> off<00:02:08.190> to

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
so I scrub some of the paint off to

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.199 
so I scrub some of the paint off to
lighten<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.679> keep<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.830> paper<00:02:11.069> wet<00:02:11.459> except

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
lighten it keep the paper wet except

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.080 
lighten it keep the paper wet except
where<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.630> owl<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:13.459> since<00:02:14.459> we<00:02:14.610> don't<00:02:14.760> want<00:02:14.970> the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
where the owl is since we don't want the

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.460 
where the owl is since we don't want the
paint<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.450> go<00:02:15.600> on<00:02:15.930> it

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
paint to go on it

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:30.820 
paint to go on it
I<00:02:19.100> love<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.340> watercolor<00:02:20.819> effect

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.250 

we<00:02:31.830> wait<00:02:32.069> once<00:02:32.550> more<00:02:32.940> for<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.390> paints<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:34.080> get

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
we wait once more for the paints to get

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.880 
we wait once more for the paints to get
dry

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
dry

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.670 
dry
and<00:02:35.819> once<00:02:36.090> it's<00:02:36.330> dry<00:02:36.450> this<00:02:37.080> time<00:02:37.319> we<00:02:37.500> get

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
and once it's dry this time we get

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.149 
and once it's dry this time we get
everything<00:02:38.400> wet<00:02:38.849> I<00:02:39.290> am<00:02:40.290> going<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.620> scrub<00:02:40.980> this

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
everything wet I am going to scrub this

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:49.470 
everything wet I am going to scrub this
a<00:02:41.190> little<00:02:41.459> bit<00:02:41.640> more<00:02:41.849> to<00:02:42.120> get<00:02:42.299> it<00:02:42.420> later

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.630 

while<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.690> purpose<00:02:50.900> is<00:02:51.260> still<00:02:51.350> done<00:02:51.710> we<00:02:52.490> can

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
while the purpose is still done we can

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.900 
while the purpose is still done we can
apply<00:02:52.970> some<00:02:53.030> rain<00:02:53.540> for<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:54.320> shadows<00:02:54.910> this

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
apply some rain for the shadows this

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:17.809 
apply some rain for the shadows this
will<00:02:56.120> be<00:02:56.270> a<00:02:56.300> nice<00:02:56.600> soft<00:02:57.260> effect

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:31.309 

I<00:03:18.439> think<00:03:19.439> the<00:03:19.560> shadows<00:03:19.950> could<00:03:20.189> be<00:03:20.370> darker

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.319
