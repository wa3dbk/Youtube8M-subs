00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.810
 the right foot has to be parallel 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.820
 to the shore 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.970
 and forward forward 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:28.550
 so that we can make our 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.550
 weight on him like this 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.940
 the left instead to this 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.680
 delayed more or less at this distance 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.600
 although you can put it further back if 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.650
 you want 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.590
 yes more or less 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.100
 you choose 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.440
 the more comfortable for example and 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.210
 instead of being totally parallel 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.340
 with the right foot 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.470
 has to turn a little 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.470
 towards the shore of the beach like this 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.039
 this space here 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.040
 and the right is parallel 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.670
 this way it will be easier to move 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.670
 the weight 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.310
 of the foot of the right leg 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.760
 to the left leg and face towards 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.760
 the beach 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.060
 well I repeat 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.520
 we put the right foot 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.950
 we separated it more or less like this 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:40.120
 we turn them diagonally 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.950
 then in this position 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.670
 we throw the weight of my body towards 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.670
 go ahead like this 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.210
 and the left one we raised it a little bit 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.890
 bit 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.230
 this will allow us 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.080
 gain a little height and avoid 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.380
 the tip of the cane rubs with the sand 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.750
 in the century 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.830
 especially in those surfaces that 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.250
 they are not totally flat 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.520
 many times we launch on beaches that 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.460
 they present irregularities coarse sand 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:16.310
 with mountain highs and lows 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.160
 and then yes we are very flat in the 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.380
 moment of the turn 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.970
 the toe hits with the sand and there's 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.880
 that avoid it a good way to 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.150
 to achieve it is precisely in this 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.370
 position stays with the foot 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.909
 tipped left 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.909
 A) Yes 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:39.939
 the arm up 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.920
 and already move the body weight to 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:44.370
 right arm and once we're in 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.370
 that position 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.850
 we move the body weight 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.700
 to the left leg 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.270
 and here we already prepare for the 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.270
 discharge 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:06.959
 although it can be that way or so 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.959
 this is the basics 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.300
 well here ends the tutorial of piety 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.300
 plus
