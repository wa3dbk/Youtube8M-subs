00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.780 
around the front of it but running the
fan<00:01:31.259> all<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> time<00:01:31.829> used<00:01:32.130> up<00:01:32.310> too<00:01:32.460> much<00:01:32.490> energy

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
fan all the time used up too much energy

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.700 
fan all the time used up too much energy
so<00:01:33.240> I'm<00:01:33.329> using<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.630> water<00:01:33.810> power<00:01:34.020> turbine<00:01:34.500> just

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
so I'm using a water power turbine just

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.260 
so I'm using a water power turbine just
to<00:01:34.770> keep<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.070> fan<00:01:35.250> spinning<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.759> cooling<00:01:36.090> ice

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
to keep the fan spinning and cooling ice

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.030 
to keep the fan spinning and cooling ice
from<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.630> freezer<00:01:36.750> made<00:01:37.229> my<00:01:37.350> power<00:01:37.560> go<00:01:37.829> higher

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
from the freezer made my power go higher

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.100 
from the freezer made my power go higher
so<00:01:38.280> I've<00:01:38.369> made<00:01:38.520> another<00:01:38.820> turbine<00:01:39.299> using<00:01:39.869> parts

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
so I've made another turbine using parts

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.630 
so I've made another turbine using parts
from<00:01:40.229> my<00:01:40.290> dryer<00:01:40.590> with<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.159> water<00:01:41.369> reservoir

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640
