 Hello dear friends Swami channel 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.090
 dmitry orehogo and in today's video we 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.789
 before your eyes we will test the leg and 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.779
 revolutionary technology with wild for 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.539
 ios devices 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.490
 x touch the help of this technology you 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.669
 can turn any surface 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.690
 touch for example your what's the details in 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.690
 this video went 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.079
 in fact almost now 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.790
 each user and you device 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.739
 may try revolutionary 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.250
 technology and by the way on your device 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.949
 and for this he will be helped by two houses 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.280
 application from the developer type fraks and 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.200
 maggie xylophone you start 1 and on your 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.210
 eyes we calibrate this application 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.280
 first you have to make sure that 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.500
 your iphone and ipad or ipod device 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.810
 touch lies on a flat surface and 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.509
 after this, by such actions you 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.270
 must calibrate every frog and 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.580
 after that voila what becomes 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.310
 sensory literally 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.789
 words and actually technology 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.320
 so cool that it is not only 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:33.409
 precisely in due time and correctly 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.280
 appreciates in clicking on the table and and for 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.890
 this does not need any special 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.810
 sensors but also technology allows 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.440
 recognize exactly the place on which 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.450
 on which I hit on the table and understanding 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.330
 this application uses this or that 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.200
 the frog is in this case but agree 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.940
 isn't that cool mobile lab 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.130
 toronto university application 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.140
 getting ready to introduce your children 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.750
 able to turn any surface 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.500
 control panel their work they 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.679
 have called 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.170
 and by the way blogs and become used by Olga 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.209
 microphone and flags recognize any beats 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.550
 fingers of the surface on which lies 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.500
 devices and depending on the location in 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:18.440
 who have hit the app 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:20.870
 perform the necessary actions site nine to 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.360
 five night made out the principle of work from 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.550
 children he can work absolutely on 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.920
 any existing device is equipped 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.230
 we at least one one mic we 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.819
 know that there are more that the iphone 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.640
 for sure positive effect on 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.290
 quality of work xh no 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.480
 no additional sensors required 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.080
 technology perceives unique 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.200
 finish 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.599
 acoustic change 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.030
 not obtained by touching the surface 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.459
 nolina different places after fast 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.170
 calibration and by the way is capable of unmistakably 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:56.640
 determine the place in which it was 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:58.260
 committed touch such a method know a 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.870
 action with the device opens 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.360
 completely new features for games and 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.400
 other applications more immediately 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.330
 several people can manage one 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.830
 device but isn't it the future 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.170
 creators promises to publish 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.970
 of children in the second quarter of this year and 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.250
 many applications can 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.890
 unambiguously transformed amore this 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.840
 Leave a push for new products and you 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.120
 know in my opinion even the technology 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.610
 still quite damp and it can and 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.069
 I think, too, to finish this 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.920
 technology is possible to implement iphone 6 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:34.290
 or even possibly, and what could 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.870
 realize and in galaxy s5 because 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.090
 technology circuit on the classroom and the future 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.769
 She's a colossal one, but Cylon 3 banks 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.989
 I hope the video was interesting for you as well 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.700
 also join from our 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.859
 subscribers and make sure that the channel 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.139
 lady 3 ru tv is interesting 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:51.840
 and informative about gadgets new 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:54.739
 generations of games and much more to all
