00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.790
 it's a game left in norway 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.609
 a few weeks ago between 

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:10.159
 john duthie range 

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:12.019
 and the Hungarian champion 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:13.489
 hypo respect 

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:16.640
 this position did not appear on the board 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.500
 the signs of a break in the world 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.160
 that both players had calculated 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.460
 precisely 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.880
 Julie Hogwarts 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.230
 maybe get this position with the blacks 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.489
 we see 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:31.849
 that the white king and really in danger 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:33.990
 since the threat with america 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.470
 the follow-up of damages 2 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.080
 seems a laptop 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.200
 but to do this 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.200
 abandon the black king to his sad fate 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.220
 first he is also endangering 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.140
 since the king will be able to take shelter 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.100
 behind the pawn and 7 and behind the pawn of justice 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.839
 we do not see how the whites 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.080
 to succeed organized by the club of always 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.730
 and well yet there is a failure and dull 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.940
 that I propose to discover together 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.070
 you can put in the pot 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.180
 I obviously like it if you wish 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.200
 look for the front position 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.990
 to discover the solution 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.820
 also 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.380
 Of course 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.610
 filming 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.760
 we are going to do a small series of chess 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.480
 to repackage parts 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.000
 we see now 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.440
 as the white lady to the debtor and much better placed 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.370
 since it prevents the king 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.170
 if we have 4 and 6 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.170
 the idea of ​​this maneuver 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.250
 touched him 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.820
 forcillo black king 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.050
 to settle on the column 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.200
 there is of course 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.210
 two possibilities 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.480
 the first at 23:10 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.540
 that we must reject immediately 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.930
 since there are not so many shots 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.820
 like leaks 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.310
 two ladies g7 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.760
 so this morning 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.080
 and of course 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.330
 to avoid 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.950
 the main windpatch airwatch 7 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.320
 and now that the king and on the highest step 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.770
 the classic benefits 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.559
 in this kind of position 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:11.029
 since the king 

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:12.239
 behind the pieces 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.239
 well we are going to make a demolition sacrifice 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.089
 tourcoing h5 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:22.219
 and get rid of the puy-en-velay justice 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:24.679
 we will see that the opening of the colony g 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:27.999
 it is a very important element in this case by case 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:31.149
 there are two possibilities here 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:32.469
 black people 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:33.879
 try 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.879
 the single currency is defenseless with the approval of justice 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:39.349
 this label does not save them 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:40.529
 there is a match 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:42.999
 very eclectic with 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:44.289
 right now 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:45.669
 why did I do 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:48.680
 eric we have a sacrifice the evacuation of four 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:50.720
 on the other hand, this failure 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.689
 tower 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:54.359
 leave the box free for the white lady 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:55.790
 courroye take forced 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:56.869
 and after 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:58.909
 Why 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.529
 there is not in all variants 

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:03.589
 addition takes at 6 o'clock 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:04.529
 thereafter 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:05.739
 Of course 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.819
 and we have the same time 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.989
 that's done 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.989
 ould abbas el fassi 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:15.929
 Ovono 

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:17.789
 to possession 

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:19.659
 35 hours tour 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:21.239
 the best defense 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.239
 is accepted the sacrifice 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:26.299
 but now 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:27.549
 We have 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.409
 a way 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:30.310
 4:30 p.m. 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.889
 iter on the column g 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:33.709
 why am I affected 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.919
 why did I do 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:37.459
 of ingenuity check 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.019
 why swiss 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.989
 and the tip of the combination of a g5 the king of kings 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:44.800
 I can not anymore 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.369
 made in the corner 

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:48.869
 he has to go to the center 

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:51.169
 why is he so strong 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:52.519
 and here we have 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.719
 amap 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:56.819
 everything rolls fast failure 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.769
 three of six for three losses 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.719
 no matter 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.949
 herself from a p 6 checkmate 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:07.799
 I found this combination very pretty with a sacrifice 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:12.929
 to demolish the king's month defenses 

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:14.069
 Thank you 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.879
 to have followed me 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.349
 I wish you 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:20.120
 a good continuation and see you soon
