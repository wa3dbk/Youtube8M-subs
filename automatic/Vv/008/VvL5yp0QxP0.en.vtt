I thought for these it would be great to
put<00:03:19.620> lots<00:03:19.950> of<00:03:20.160> different<00:03:20.430> kinds<00:03:20.489> of<00:03:20.760> stuff

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
is what it says so I thought these could

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.500 
is what it says so I thought these could
come<00:04:19.260> in<00:04:19.440> useful<00:04:20.040> friend<00:04:20.459> lots<00:04:20.850> of<00:04:21.060> stuff<00:04:21.239> now

I<00:04:21.750> thought<00:04:22.200> one<00:04:22.590> out<00:04:22.950> on

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
I thought one out on

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.020 
I thought one out on
um<00:04:25.720> copy<00:04:26.720> area<00:04:27.230> for<00:04:27.920> tea<00:04:28.310> bags<00:04:28.520> and<00:04:28.850> stuff

um copy area for tea bags and stuff

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.930 
um copy area for tea bags and stuff

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
would be really nice and then I thought

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.350 
would be really nice and then I thought
well<00:04:32.860> we<00:04:33.860> can<00:04:34.010> certainly<00:04:34.190> use<00:04:34.490> these<00:04:34.850> for<00:04:35.060> so

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
well we can certainly use these for so

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.750 
well we can certainly use these for so
many<00:04:35.900> things<00:04:36.050> in<00:04:36.590> the<00:04:36.710> pantry<00:04:37.070> we<00:04:37.580> could<00:04:37.730> use

many things in the pantry we could use

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.400

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
these for more tea because I have a

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.980

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
for utensils that we don't use every day

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.630 
for utensils that we don't use every day
they<00:04:45.650> could<00:04:45.710> definitely<00:04:46.040> stay<00:04:46.340> in<00:04:46.370> one<00:04:46.610> of

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
took them all over and I'm hoping again

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.860 
took them all over and I'm hoping again
that<00:04:58.550> they<00:04:58.700> will<00:04:58.850> make<00:04:59.090> things<00:04:59.360> a<00:04:59.630> little

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870
