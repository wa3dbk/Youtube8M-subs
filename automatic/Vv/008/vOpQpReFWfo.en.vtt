00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.809 
get extra points added to your score so
basically<00:02:06.319> you<00:02:06.529> just<00:02:06.799> jump<00:02:07.069> where<00:02:07.489> there's<00:02:07.700> a

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
basically you just jump where there's a

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.240 
basically you just jump where there's a
gap<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:08.569> you<00:02:09.170> would<00:02:09.319> slide<00:02:09.560> when<00:02:09.950> there<00:02:10.129> is

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
gap and you would slide when there is

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.940 
gap and you would slide when there is
something<00:02:10.489> blocking<00:02:11.180> your<00:02:11.540> way<00:02:11.620> that<00:02:12.620> the

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
something blocking your way that the

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:13.280 
something blocking your way that the
only

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
only

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.440 
only
to<00:02:13.379> pass<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.769> is<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.159> go<00:02:14.250> under<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.969> you'll

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
to pass it is to go under it and you'll

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.949 
to pass it is to go under it and you'll
see<00:02:15.689> an<00:02:15.780> example<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:16.319> that<00:02:16.379> later<00:02:17.750> it's<00:02:18.750> as<00:02:18.870> you

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
see an example of that later it's as you

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.550 
see an example of that later it's as you
can<00:02:19.079> see<00:02:19.200> we<00:02:19.319> just<00:02:19.349> moved<00:02:19.739> into<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.099> new<00:02:20.430> scenery

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
can see we just moved into a new scenery

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.910 
can see we just moved into a new scenery
and<00:02:22.730> it<00:02:23.730> does<00:02:23.909> get<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.390> little<00:02:24.689> bit<00:02:24.840> faster<00:02:25.439> -<00:02:25.680> as

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
and it does get a little bit faster - as

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.240 
and it does get a little bit faster - as
you<00:02:26.459> progress<00:02:26.700> through<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.480> game<00:02:27.599> as<00:02:28.079> you<00:02:29.040> can

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
you progress through the game as you can

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.670 
you progress through the game as you can
see<00:02:29.430> there<00:02:30.030> was<00:02:30.239> a<00:02:30.299> glass<00:02:30.900> hanging<00:02:31.409> from<00:02:31.560> the

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
see there was a glass hanging from the

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.770 
see there was a glass hanging from the
ceiling<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.159> I<00:02:32.189> had<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.640> slide<00:02:32.909> under<00:02:35.689> so<00:02:36.689> it

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
ceiling that I had to slide under so it

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.809 
ceiling that I had to slide under so it
is<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.900> very<00:02:37.170> simple<00:02:37.409> game<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:38.010> also<00:02:38.640> there

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
is a very simple game and also there

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.059 
is a very simple game and also there
will<00:02:38.939> be<00:02:39.000> some<00:02:39.420> gaps<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:40.200> are<00:02:40.260> too<00:02:40.560> big<00:02:40.799> to

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
will be some gaps that are too big to

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.399 
will be some gaps that are too big to
jump<00:02:41.549> over<00:02:41.849> that<00:02:42.329> you<00:02:42.450> will<00:02:42.569> need<00:02:42.719> to<00:02:42.780> swing

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
jump over that you will need to swing

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.530 
jump over that you will need to swing
over<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.400> combination<00:02:44.969> for<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:45.299> is

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
over and the combination for that is

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.490 
over and the combination for that is
jump<00:02:46.200> slide<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:47.810> hopefully<00:02:48.810> we'll<00:02:49.019> get<00:02:49.170> to

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
jump slide and hopefully we'll get to

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.099 
jump slide and hopefully we'll get to
that<00:02:49.739> so<00:02:50.189> I<00:02:50.280> can<00:02:50.519> demonstrate<00:02:50.730> that<00:02:51.209> so<00:02:51.930> as<00:02:52.019> you

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
that so I can demonstrate that so as you

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.229 
that so I can demonstrate that so as you
can<00:02:52.200> see<00:02:52.260> I'm<00:02:52.470> in<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.650> new<00:02:52.769> world<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.189> I<00:02:53.849> had<00:02:54.030> to

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
can see I'm in a new world and I had to

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.690 
can see I'm in a new world and I had to
do<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:54.989> double<00:02:55.470> jump<00:02:55.739> which<00:02:56.099> is<00:02:56.129> kind<00:02:56.639> of

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
do a double jump which is kind of

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.610 
do a double jump which is kind of
confusing<00:02:56.939> I<00:02:57.569> believe<00:02:58.169> you're<00:02:58.290> supposed<00:02:58.379> to

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
confusing I believe you're supposed to

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.429 
confusing I believe you're supposed to
jump<00:02:58.919> slide<00:02:59.189> slide<00:02:59.549> but<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.720> hardly<00:03:01.290> ever

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
jump slide slide but it hardly ever

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:05.270 
jump slide slide but it hardly ever
works<00:03:02.010> as<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.489> can<00:03:02.639> see<00:03:03.500> so<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:04.530> did<00:03:04.829> just<00:03:04.859> die

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
works as you can see so I did just die

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.140 
works as you can see so I did just die
twice<00:03:05.849> and<00:03:06.329> I<00:03:07.019> died<00:03:07.230> again<00:03:07.489> so<00:03:08.489> game<00:03:08.819> over

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
twice and I died again so game over

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.720 
twice and I died again so game over
tells<00:03:09.659> me<00:03:09.810> my<00:03:09.989> score<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:10.560> says<00:03:10.799> my<00:03:11.430> grade

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
tells me my score and it says my grade

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.940 
tells me my score and it says my grade
see<00:03:12.299> you<00:03:12.659> can<00:03:12.870> do<00:03:12.959> better<00:03:13.169> try<00:03:13.560> again<00:03:13.769> or

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
see you can do better try again or

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.839 
see you can do better try again or
mainmenu<00:03:14.599> gonna<00:03:15.599> go<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.139> main<00:03:16.290> menu<00:03:16.470> and

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
mainmenu gonna go to the main menu and

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.300 
mainmenu gonna go to the main menu and
that<00:03:17.849> is<00:03:18.150> Oven<00:03:18.690> break<00:03:18.900> I<00:03:19.199> believe<00:03:19.979> that<00:03:20.190> this

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
that is Oven break I believe that this

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.189 
that is Oven break I believe that this
application<00:03:20.909> is<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.090> dollar<00:03:21.540> ninety-nine<00:03:22.169> in

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199 
application is a dollar ninety-nine in

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:25.069 
application is a dollar ninety-nine in
the<00:03:22.440> App<00:03:22.560> Store<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:23.180> I<00:03:24.180> would<00:03:24.479> recommend<00:03:24.959> it

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
the App Store and I would recommend it

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.479 
the App Store and I would recommend it
even<00:03:25.260> though<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.590> is<00:03:25.709> a<00:03:25.769> dollar<00:03:26.010> ninety-nine

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
even though it is a dollar ninety-nine

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.569 
even though it is a dollar ninety-nine
because<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.299> highly<00:03:28.139> addicting<00:03:29.129> I<00:03:29.310> find

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
because it is highly addicting I find

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.330 
because it is highly addicting I find
myself<00:03:29.729> playing<00:03:30.120> this<00:03:30.299> all<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:31.199> time<00:03:31.440> it<00:03:31.739> is
