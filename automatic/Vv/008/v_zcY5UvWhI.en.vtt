00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello i'm at the rich ass and this is a new video series 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.720
 about prayer 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.289
 it's not a Bible study on prayer how to pray 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.289
 why efficiency and prayer and so on 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.810
 e 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.949
 or you already knew these things 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.859
 if you do not know them find out where the ideas the 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.859
 books ask a pastor go on the internet 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.020
 this video series and earlier 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.590
 a series of practices 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.410
 we will see particular topics you will repeat after me 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.750
 prayers 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.600
 % 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.600
 a prayer it would not be just words 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.720
 it's not about magic prayers will ask you 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.840
 it's not just about repeating words or not understanding them 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.940
 because he would have no he fit case 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.050
 I can already read you prayer books 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.270
 and that you have all confessed 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.960
 and you tell yourself that he has had no change in my life 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.790
 because for a prayer to be effective 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.970
 it must be understood 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.030
 p must make decisions and take positions 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.520
 in relation to this 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.210
 prayer that we know 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.090
 you have to take authority 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.580
 there are people they ask me but what does it mean to take 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.680
 thorities 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.780
 for example if dressed 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.550
 you are in a place are a lot of children they make noise 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.210
 you're fed up telling them 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.430
 shut up 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.300
 and continues to talk you again say that shut up 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.410
 and continue to talk to you harder shut up shut up 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.930
 and continues for a while you got really fed up and you say that 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:44.610
 it's you 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.040
 and stop talking 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.660
 what was the difference 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.320
 stanley my word 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.460
 maybe the same level of sound 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.820
 but you took to the authorities they felt 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.800
 that you for the mans pressed the tension 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.590
 to take 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.350
 as for them authority 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.060
 there would be consequences that do not stop 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.500
 to speak without it and at the spiritual level it's the same if you have a 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.979
 problem 

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:16.329
 oppression or enemy attacks 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:17.519
 you can 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.629
 do all the prayers that you do what you want we will see their 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.789
 hell of the spirits 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:27.679
 but if you do not take a position and you do not take the authority 

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:30.679
 these are words that go off in the grass and you waste your time 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:33.929
 e it's not about 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:36.790
 of three countries has for everything and no matter how 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.790
 and unfortunately there are too many believers 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:44.159
 who spend their days 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.319
 if I dare to say they waste their time and lose their energy in hitting 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.299
 ghosts if I dare to say people who are not there 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.589
 and who say 

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:54.300
 but why is this happening 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.989
 in fact they are hitting him in the air 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.439
 while the enemy 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.559
 and just behind them by train 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:01.939
 to attack them 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.699
 so you really have to 

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:04.939
 e 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:06.819
 do it with 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:07.849
 comprehension 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.419
 and the authorities 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:12.370
 I often tell men the copy also 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.759
 that if there is to solda 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:16.579
 who is shooting you arrows 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:17.819
 above 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.679
 it's very good to learn 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:22.139
 alizÃ©e avoid or protect yourself 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.170
 but the best 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.539
 and to learn 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:26.279
 to kill 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:27.679
 this soldier 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:30.219
 and like that the arrows seem too 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:32.529
 in em 

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:34.559
 suddenly come on 

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:37.309
 another thing it's important that you 

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:40.309
 e use them bible 

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:45.479
 and that you learn yourself appropriate 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:46.489
 the verses 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.950
 for example in the isjo dojo 54 17 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.359
 yes the 10% e minute no weapon forget 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.359
 against you will flourish 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:58.769
 it is necessary that the 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:03:59.679
 she 

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:01.079
 do it your others 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.339
 and instead of saying no weapon forged against you 

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:05.919
 will not flourish 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:08.459
 you can address a spirit 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.169
 or to someone who 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:14.589
 threats and say that no offensive weapon against me 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:16.939
 will not flourish 

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:21.769
 you have to appropriate the verses of the Bible as for example if you are 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.120
 someone you approve with fear 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.469
 babouche you have to look for verses 

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:29.469
 in relation to fear 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.559
 as a weapon in prayer 

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:38.199
 for example as an opponent who says 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:39.529
 God 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:42.749
 did not give you a esprit de corps 

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:46.039
 so there you have to say in prayer 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:47.020
 % 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.240
 I did not receive an esprit de corps so I refuse the door 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.770
 so esprit de corps 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.770
 go away because god did not give me an esprit de corps 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.259
 this video also introduction 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:02.260
 to the video series on different topics 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.400
 of prayer 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.490
 the first will be the recovery is underway 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:08.889
 of salvation 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.240
 if you are already saved you are Christian 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.240
 this agreement puts a month as a base it can not hurt you 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.800
 if you are unbelievers 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.800
 it is imperative that you do it before you do the others 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.479
 if you do not know at all what it is and find out what 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:27.809
 ask 

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:31.089

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.990
 why you need to be saved 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.719
 and when you have m 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:42.930
 you feel the need 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.309
 to do it first do this prayer 

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:48.309
 because otherwise the other roms ineffective 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:52.180
