00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.940 
leggings and they just show a lot of
skin<00:01:41.940> so<00:01:42.149> I<00:01:42.209> put<00:01:42.420> another<00:01:42.840> legging<00:01:43.380> underneath

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
skin so I put another legging underneath

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.979 
skin so I put another legging underneath
which<00:01:44.429> are<00:01:44.580> these<00:01:44.700> like<00:01:44.880> sheer<00:01:45.270> sort<00:01:45.899> of

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:45.989 
which are these like sheer sort of

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:47.990 
which are these like sheer sort of
floral<00:01:46.500> leggings<00:01:46.679> so<00:01:47.039> it<00:01:47.130> kind<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.399> just<00:01:47.580> ties

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
floral leggings so it kind of just ties

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.760 
floral leggings so it kind of just ties
it<00:01:48.239> all<00:01:48.300> together<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:48.899> really<00:01:49.259> do<00:01:49.380> like<00:01:49.410> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
it all together and I really do like the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.680 
it all together and I really do like the
look<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.190> there<00:01:50.580> it<00:01:50.670> peeks<00:01:50.940> out<00:01:51.119> this

really<00:01:51.959> subtle<00:01:52.259> way<00:01:52.619> instead<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:52.950> just

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
really subtle way instead of just

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.919 
really subtle way instead of just
showing<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.580> lot<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.729> skin<00:01:54.119> especially<00:01:54.479> at<00:01:54.869> a

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:56.120 
showing a lot of skin especially at a
hockey<00:01:55.080> game<00:01:55.229> because<00:01:55.500> it's<00:01:55.619> kind<00:01:55.739> of<00:01:55.830> cold
