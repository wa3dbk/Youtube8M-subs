not<00:01:47.610> actually<00:01:48.090> exploded<00:01:48.750> like<00:01:49.100> TNT<00:01:50.100> block

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
not actually exploded like TNT block

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.219 
not actually exploded like TNT block
would<00:01:50.490> do<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:51.149> most<00:01:51.390> blocks<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.840> was

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
would do to most blocks so that was

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.810 
would do to most blocks so that was
really<00:01:52.259> interesting<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.890> me<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.280> went<00:01:53.759> and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
really interesting to me I went and

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.340 
really interesting to me I went and
tried<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.060> out<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.869> didn't<00:01:55.110> get<00:01:55.200> too<00:01:55.320> far

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
tried it out and I didn't get too far

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.039 
tried it out and I didn't get too far
with<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.909> just<00:01:57.270> tried<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.600> with<00:01:57.719> like<00:01:57.840> one

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
with it I I just tried it with like one

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.319 
with it I I just tried it with like one
block<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.530> sand<00:01:58.799> try<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.549> time<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.820> right<00:01:59.969> but

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
block of sand try to time it right but

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.310 
block of sand try to time it right but
things<00:02:00.479> didn't<00:02:00.719> work<00:02:00.840> out<00:02:00.930> too<00:02:01.049> well<00:02:01.079> so

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
things didn't work out too well so

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.840 
things didn't work out too well so
that's<00:02:01.439> when<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.680> ran<00:02:01.829> across<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.549> I

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
that's when I ran across this and I

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.160 
that's when I ran across this and I
thought<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.090> review<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.750> give<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.140> guys

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
thought I review it and give you guys

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.410 
thought I review it and give you guys
the<00:02:04.500> info<00:02:04.619> about<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:05.759> really<00:02:06.000> really<00:02:06.240> cool

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
the info about this really really cool

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.540 
the info about this really really cool
technique<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.560> let's<00:02:07.770> go<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.039> jump<00:02:08.250> right<00:02:08.340> in

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
technique so let's go and jump right in

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.180 
technique so let's go and jump right in
so<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.179> was<00:02:09.479> even<00:02:09.629> see<00:02:09.869> we<00:02:10.080> have<00:02:10.349> AT&amp;T<00:02:10.770> block

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
so I was even see we have AT&amp;T block

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.619 
so I was even see we have AT&amp;T block
here<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.550> middle<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.849> there's<00:02:12.270> loads<00:02:12.540> of

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
here in the middle and there's loads of

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.610 
here in the middle and there's loads of
loads<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.930> signs

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
loads of signs

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.199 
loads of signs
around<00:02:13.890> here<00:02:14.129> and<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.670> would<00:02:14.819> just<00:02:14.909> walk<00:02:15.090> you

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
around here and I would just walk you

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.309 
around here and I would just walk you
through<00:02:15.390> here<00:02:15.569> really<00:02:15.810> quickly<00:02:15.989> were<00:02:16.200> these

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
through here really quickly were these

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.280 
through here really quickly were these
guys<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:16.769> here<00:02:17.459> there's<00:02:18.239> like<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.989> think<00:02:19.170> it's

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
guys so here there's like a I think it's

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.440 
guys so here there's like a I think it's
a<00:02:19.379> nine<00:02:19.799> by<00:02:20.010> nine<00:02:20.159> by<00:02:20.220> two<00:02:20.810> tall<00:02:23.239> rectangle<00:02:24.239> of

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
a nine by nine by two tall rectangle of

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.559 
a nine by nine by two tall rectangle of
sand<00:02:24.989> and<00:02:25.140> gravel<00:02:25.260> here<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:27.269> TNT

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
sand and gravel here so the the TNT

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.030 
sand and gravel here so the the TNT
block<00:02:27.810> is<00:02:27.989> right<00:02:28.140> there<00:02:28.379> connecting<00:02:28.890> with

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
block is right there connecting with

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.039 
block is right there connecting with
signs<00:02:29.370> all<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.849> way<00:02:29.940> up<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.120> here<00:02:30.450> which

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
signs all the way up to here which

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.530 
signs all the way up to here which
shoots<00:02:31.379> over<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.040> little<00:02:32.099> side<00:02:32.790> I<00:02:33.090> would

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
shoots over to this little side I would

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.640 
shoots over to this little side I would
I<00:02:33.569> would<00:02:33.720> actually<00:02:33.870> call<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.349> timer

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
I would actually call this a timer

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
I would actually call this a timer
because<00:02:34.920> he<00:02:35.700> basically<00:02:36.650> is<00:02:37.650> so<00:02:38.040> perfect<00:02:38.579> with

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
because he basically is so perfect with

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.280 
because he basically is so perfect with
this<00:02:38.819> that<00:02:39.030> he<00:02:39.360> gets<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.599> right<00:02:39.840> on<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.110> dot

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
this that he gets it right on the dot

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.800 
this that he gets it right on the dot
where<00:02:40.560> as<00:02:40.950> soon<00:02:41.610> as<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.819> TNT<00:02:42.150> explodes<00:02:42.540> these

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
where as soon as the TNT explodes these

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.420 
where as soon as the TNT explodes these
are<00:02:42.959> falling<00:02:43.200> at<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.379> perfect<00:02:43.680> time<00:02:44.010> the

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
are falling at the perfect time the

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.670 
are falling at the perfect time the
perfect<00:02:44.459> place<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.209> be<00:02:45.329> exploded<00:02:45.959> out<00:02:46.109> and<00:02:46.560> the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
perfect place to be exploded out and the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.479 
perfect place to be exploded out and the
best<00:02:47.840> formation<00:02:48.840> of<00:02:48.989> fireworks<00:02:49.440> ever<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.340> it's

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
best formation of fireworks ever so it's

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.069 
best formation of fireworks ever so it's
really<00:02:50.819> really<00:02:51.060> great<00:02:51.209> anyway<00:02:51.780> when<00:02:51.989> this

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
really really great anyway when this

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.300 
really really great anyway when this
comes<00:02:52.319> over<00:02:52.530> here<00:02:52.680> when<00:02:52.829> you<00:02:52.890> actually<00:02:53.010> like

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
comes over here when you actually like

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.089 
comes over here when you actually like
the<00:02:53.459> T&amp;T<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:54.109> guys<00:02:55.109> may<00:02:55.440> have<00:02:55.470> may<00:02:55.859> or<00:02:55.980> may<00:02:56.069> not

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
the T&amp;T you guys may have may or may not

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.289 
the T&amp;T you guys may have may or may not
have<00:02:56.310> noticed<00:02:56.430> this<00:02:56.670> but<00:02:56.849> when<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.180> actually

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
have noticed this but when you actually

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:58.759 
have noticed this but when you actually
light<00:02:57.629> it<00:02:57.750> actually<00:02:58.019> kind<00:02:58.170> of<00:02:58.200> shifts<00:02:58.590> off

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
light it actually kind of shifts off

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.460 
light it actually kind of shifts off
block<00:02:59.190> or<00:02:59.700> off<00:02:59.909> position<00:03:00.599> it<00:03:00.989> shifts<00:03:01.260> over<00:03:01.440> a

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
block or off position it shifts over a

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.770 
block or off position it shifts over a
couple<00:03:01.739> pixels<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.129> it<00:03:02.250> does<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.609> I<00:03:02.790> am<00:03:03.569> not

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
couple pixels and it does that I am not

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.500 
couple pixels and it does that I am not
sure<00:03:03.870> why<00:03:04.019> just<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.650> guess<00:03:05.099> show<00:03:06.090> that<00:03:06.390> has

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
sure why just to I guess show that has

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.110 
sure why just to I guess show that has
actually<00:03:06.810> been<00:03:06.900> lit<00:03:07.170> but<00:03:07.769> it<00:03:07.950> break<00:03:08.489> any<00:03:08.760> signs

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
actually been lit but it break any signs

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.360 
actually been lit but it break any signs
that<00:03:09.269> are<00:03:09.450> on<00:03:09.540> top<00:03:09.750> of<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:10.019> so<00:03:10.049> using<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:10.709> he

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
that are on top of it so using that he

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.309 
that are on top of it so using that he
these<00:03:11.790> will<00:03:11.970> all<00:03:12.090> break<00:03:12.480> whenever<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:13.019> actually

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
these will all break whenever I actually

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.830 
these will all break whenever I actually
like<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.829> tnc<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.549> it'll<00:03:15.120> drop<00:03:15.299> this<00:03:15.480> gravel

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
like the tnc and it'll drop this gravel

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.089 
like the tnc and it'll drop this gravel
here<00:03:15.959> you<00:03:16.170> guys<00:03:16.290> want<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.500> say<00:03:16.590> why<00:03:16.829> the<00:03:16.890> heck

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
here you guys want to say why the heck

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.430 
here you guys want to say why the heck
did<00:03:17.489> he<00:03:17.519> not<00:03:17.700> just<00:03:17.940> you<00:03:18.239> know<00:03:18.389> add<00:03:18.569> this<00:03:19.139> ad

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
did he not just you know add this ad

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.589 
did he not just you know add this ad
then<00:03:20.280> add<00:03:20.549> another<00:03:20.579> sign<00:03:21.000> on<00:03:21.120> top<00:03:21.269> of<00:03:21.359> this<00:03:21.419> and

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
then add another sign on top of this and

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.180 
then add another sign on top of this and
continue<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.109> change<00:03:22.319> well<00:03:22.769> I'm<00:03:22.889> sure<00:03:23.069> it<00:03:23.160> has

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
continue the change well I'm sure it has

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.650 
continue the change well I'm sure it has
something<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.609> do<00:03:23.700> with<00:03:23.819> timing<00:03:23.970> purposes<00:03:24.239> and

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
something to do with timing purposes and

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.870 
something to do with timing purposes and
all<00:03:24.750> that<00:03:24.930> so<00:03:25.500> he<00:03:25.769> got<00:03:25.919> it<00:03:26.069> purchased<00:03:26.639> just

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
all that so he got it purchased just

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.550 
all that so he got it purchased just
perfect<00:03:27.209> so<00:03:27.359> anyway<00:03:27.630> when<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.290> comes<00:03:28.440> over

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
perfect so anyway when it comes over

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.589 
perfect so anyway when it comes over
here<00:03:28.769> it'll<00:03:28.950> let<00:03:29.129> this<00:03:29.280> water<00:03:29.609> flow<00:03:30.030> down<00:03:30.239> this

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
here it'll let this water flow down this

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.080 
here it'll let this water flow down this
nice<00:03:30.959> little<00:03:31.109> glass<00:03:31.379> tube<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.940> breaking<00:03:32.940> this

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
nice little glass tube and breaking this

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.309 
nice little glass tube and breaking this
torch<00:03:33.419> down<00:03:33.629> here<00:03:33.780> at<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.900> bottom<00:03:33.959> which<00:03:34.290> is

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
torch down here at the bottom which is

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.470 
torch down here at the bottom which is
holding<00:03:34.680> up<00:03:34.739> a<00:03:34.799> grab<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.010> piece<00:03:35.250> with<00:03:35.849> a<00:03:35.879> sign<00:03:36.180> in

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
holding up a grab a piece with a sign in

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.879 
holding up a grab a piece with a sign in
with<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:36.840> sign<00:03:37.079> with<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.290> sign<00:03:37.530> and<00:03:37.709> so<00:03:37.799> these

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
with a sign with a sign and so these

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.500 
with a sign with a sign and so these
will<00:03:38.040> basically<00:03:38.340> all<00:03:38.609> just<00:03:38.879> fall<00:03:39.060> down<00:03:39.090> in

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
will basically all just fall down in

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.199 
will basically all just fall down in
order<00:03:40.139> breaking<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.129> massive<00:03:41.790> sign<00:03:41.970> chain

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
order breaking the massive sign chain

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.689 
order breaking the massive sign chain
back<00:03:42.599> here<00:03:42.959> which<00:03:43.530> actually<00:03:43.769> holds<00:03:44.370> up<00:03:44.519> the

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699 
back here which actually holds up the

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.610 
back here which actually holds up the
entire<00:03:45.269> firework<00:03:46.109> that's<00:03:46.260> going<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.530> be

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
entire firework that's going to be

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.610 
entire firework that's going to be
getting<00:03:47.400> shot<00:03:47.790> here<00:03:48.030> so<00:03:48.329> if<00:03:48.930> we<00:03:49.199> go<00:03:49.319> in<00:03:49.440> like

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
getting shot here so if we go in like

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.860 
getting shot here so if we go in like
this<00:03:49.760> basically<00:03:50.760> what's<00:03:51.150> going<00:03:51.269> to<00:03:51.329> happen<00:03:51.599> is

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
this basically what's going to happen is

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.439 
this basically what's going to happen is
is<00:03:52.169> it's<00:03:52.739> going<00:03:52.889> to<00:03:52.949> break<00:03:53.669> that<00:03:53.879> sign<00:03:54.180> chain

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:54.449 
is it's going to break that sign chain

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.270 
is it's going to break that sign chain
activate<00:03:54.959> that<00:03:55.079> time<00:03:55.319> over<00:03:55.590> there<00:03:55.769> which<00:03:56.250> is

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
activate that time over there which is

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.369 
activate that time over there which is
perfectly<00:03:56.730> timed<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.480> come<00:03:57.690> back<00:03:57.870> around<00:03:58.019> and

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
perfectly timed to come back around and

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.680 
perfectly timed to come back around and
allow<00:03:59.069> these<00:03:59.310> to<00:03:59.489> fall<00:03:59.730> as<00:03:59.940> soon<00:04:00.180> as<00:04:00.329> this<00:04:00.449> is

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
allow these to fall as soon as this is

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.110 
allow these to fall as soon as this is
exploding<00:04:01.199> so<00:04:01.319> let's<00:04:01.470> go<00:04:01.590> ahead<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:02.040> do<00:04:02.819> it<00:04:02.970> as

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
exploding so let's go ahead and do it as

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.789 
exploding so let's go ahead and do it as
you<00:04:03.269> can<00:04:03.449> see<00:04:03.720> things<00:04:04.049> are<00:04:04.319> working<00:04:04.470> out

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
you can see things are working out

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.180 
you can see things are working out
perfectly<00:04:05.639> and<00:04:05.959> just<00:04:06.959> look<00:04:07.560> at<00:04:07.739> that<00:04:07.769> that<00:04:08.129> is

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
perfectly and just look at that that is

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.369 
perfectly and just look at that that is
so<00:04:08.430> cool-looking<00:04:08.699> and<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.690> all<00:04:09.810> lands<00:04:10.019> down<00:04:10.230> at

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
so cool-looking and it all lands down at

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.949 
so cool-looking and it all lands down at
the<00:04:10.470> bottom<00:04:10.650> in<00:04:10.980> a<00:04:11.040> nice<00:04:11.400> awesome<00:04:11.959> looking

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
the bottom in a nice awesome looking

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.720 
the bottom in a nice awesome looking
formation<00:04:13.470> now<00:04:13.560> i'm<00:04:13.769> pretty<00:04:14.069> sure<00:04:14.220> changes<00:04:14.609> up

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
formation now i'm pretty sure changes up

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.849 
formation now i'm pretty sure changes up
every<00:04:14.940> single<00:04:15.180> time<00:04:15.329> because<00:04:15.629> the<00:04:16.139> system<00:04:16.590> in

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
every single time because the system in

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.640 
every single time because the system in
Minecraft<00:04:17.400> like<00:04:17.579> with<00:04:17.910> with<00:04:18.209> blowing<00:04:18.900> up<00:04:19.169> TT

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
Minecraft like with with blowing up TT

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.860 
Minecraft like with with blowing up TT
things<00:04:20.370> like<00:04:20.519> that<00:04:20.609> it's<00:04:20.789> not<00:04:21.030> always<00:04:21.209> it's

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
things like that it's not always it's

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:22.820 
things like that it's not always it's
not<00:04:21.959> always<00:04:22.079> the<00:04:22.200> same<00:04:22.409> so<00:04:22.530> it's<00:04:22.650> kind<00:04:22.800> of

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
not always the same so it's kind of

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.260 
not always the same so it's kind of
random<00:04:23.070> and<00:04:23.400> that's<00:04:23.700> what<00:04:23.820> I<00:04:23.880> really<00:04:24.090> liked

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
random and that's what I really liked

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.420 
random and that's what I really liked
when<00:04:24.419> I<00:04:24.450> first<00:04:24.810> figure<00:04:25.169> out<00:04:25.320> this<00:04:25.500> was<00:04:25.770> this

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
when I first figure out this was this

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.850 
when I first figure out this was this
was<00:04:26.490> actually<00:04:26.789> a<00:04:26.940> thing<00:04:27.180> in<00:04:27.300> this<00:04:27.390> connection

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
was actually a thing in this connection

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.429 
was actually a thing in this connection
you<00:04:27.919> work<00:04:28.250> I<00:04:28.520> wanted<00:04:29.090> to<00:04:29.180> try<00:04:29.419> to<00:04:29.479> do<00:04:29.689> kind<00:04:30.169> of<00:04:30.289> a

00:04:30.429 --> 00:04:30.439 
you work I wanted to try to do kind of a

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:34.270 
you work I wanted to try to do kind of a
a<00:04:30.580> random<00:04:31.580> be<00:04:32.539> able<00:04:32.719> to<00:04:32.840> make<00:04:33.229> a<00:04:33.259> random<00:04:33.889> system

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
a random be able to make a random system

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.499 
a random be able to make a random system
or<00:04:34.400> a<00:04:34.430> random<00:04:34.759> generator<00:04:35.120> or<00:04:35.270> something

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
or a random generator or something

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:37.330 
or a random generator or something
because<00:04:35.629> these<00:04:36.199> don't<00:04:36.469> always<00:04:36.770> go<00:04:36.919> the<00:04:36.949> same

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
because these don't always go the same

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.429 
because these don't always go the same
way<00:04:37.370> but<00:04:38.150> I<00:04:38.389> I<00:04:38.539> really<00:04:38.960> didn't<00:04:39.139> get<00:04:39.229> to<00:04:39.289> that

00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:39.439 
way but I I really didn't get to that

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:41.469 
way but I I really didn't get to that
and<00:04:39.800> I<00:04:40.099> thought<00:04:40.219> this<00:04:40.370> was<00:04:40.550> pretty<00:04:40.639> much<00:04:40.939> this

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
and I thought this was pretty much this

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.080 
and I thought this was pretty much this
is<00:04:41.659> just<00:04:41.840> as<00:04:41.960> cool<00:04:42.250> anyway<00:04:43.250> so<00:04:43.310> I'm<00:04:43.639> so<00:04:43.909> glad

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
is just as cool anyway so I'm so glad

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.480 
is just as cool anyway so I'm so glad
that<00:04:44.419> this<00:04:44.990> guy<00:04:45.169> actually<00:04:45.469> came<00:04:45.770> up<00:04:45.800> with<00:04:46.099> some

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
that this guy actually came up with some

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.709 
that this guy actually came up with some
of<00:04:46.580> these<00:04:46.669> awesome<00:04:47.000> bills<00:04:47.330> I've<00:04:47.449> been<00:04:47.539> going

00:04:47.709 --> 00:04:47.719 
of these awesome bills I've been going

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:49.929 
of these awesome bills I've been going
over<00:04:47.810> lately<00:04:48.110> hopefully<00:04:48.680> in<00:04:49.189> the<00:04:49.250> near<00:04:49.819> future

00:04:49.929 --> 00:04:49.939 
over lately hopefully in the near future

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:52.089 
over lately hopefully in the near future
he<00:04:50.419> will<00:04:50.509> be<00:04:50.629> doing<00:04:50.870> some<00:04:51.050> more<00:04:51.379> really<00:04:51.919> cool

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
he will be doing some more really cool
