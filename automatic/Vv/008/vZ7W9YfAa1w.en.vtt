00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.350
 There is a gay teen who has signed on some Bible pages 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.090
 As a form of protest against intolerance against homosexuals 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.139
 And he was suspended from his Texas school at Huffington Post I wrote about this 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.690
 American Humanitarian Association officially sent a complaint 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.010
 For Birdville Independent School District in Texas 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.109
 Saying that the first amendment rights this young man has been violated 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.599
 His last name was Smith that he was a gay Christian 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.910
 He tells him time and time again that it is cold that being gay is a sin and that 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.030
 Gays go to hell 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.030
 As a form of protest he brought his own Bible in the school 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.989
 He signed some pages of Leviticus which is the part which 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:42.860
 it contains 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.660
 Aya is very popular that gay fanatics like to use 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.160
 He was sent to the manager's office 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.730
 He was told that he could continue carrying around his torn Bible 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.180
 But it can not tear any more pages into it that should not do so 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.230
 Then finally brought back down 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.790
 About the Bible tearing the office of the manager was asked 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.240
 How Muslims feel if the student has been ripped off the Koran 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.580
 Then suspended for three days the Bible was confiscated 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.240
 According to the first character divall is when 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.970
 Since when is how Muslims will feel anything standards in Texas schools 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.110
 Which sounds like a stranger 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.619
 Barometer me but well there now 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.170
 The Federation of Civil Liberties and the American Humanity League are participating in 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.070
 There are saying listening you have either you 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.900
 I allow students to do whatever they want with their books 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.000
 Or you have to ban all religious books from the school period 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.290
 But this really looks like you are specifically recognizing this choice because 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.720
 It is the Christian Bible 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.979
 And because this is the stuff about homosexuality is writing 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.159
 Right for Soto Lewis we could have one of two scenarios 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.820
 If the policy is that you can afford 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.770
 Religious texts can carry them regardless of whether the pages are ripped if they are 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.420
 is yours 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.640
 But if the policy is you can not afford a religious tax 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.840
 There should be no Gospels at all in school and I do not see that happening 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.610
 Any time soon 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.920
 Now the first and second do not understand how a kinetic person 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.959
 Get the arm or reprimand 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.770
 Suspended for the destruction of their personal property in a manner detrimental 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.900
 No one hates 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.440
 Pretty amazing what's going on here
