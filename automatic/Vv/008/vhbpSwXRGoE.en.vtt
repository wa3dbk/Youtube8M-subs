00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 hello to all survivors and 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.710
 welcome to a new video blog of my 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.420
 channel today I want to recommend you the second 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.550
 classic of this new section that I started 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.019
 in February and that basically consists of 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.090
 that every month I want to recommend you a 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.650
 classic last month I recommended jeiner 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.570
 from charlotte brontÃ« and this month I want 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.340
 recommend a novel that although it is 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.660
 framed within realism has 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.130
 appeared in many collections of 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.660
 science fiction and fantasy 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.730
 precisely for being extreme realism 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.260
 for that cruelty that comes off and because 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.910
 has inspired many genre authors 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.470
 these novels of course the Lord of 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.740
 the flies' written by william ward 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.239
 was the Nobel prize in 1973 any 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.469
 thing that comes from this novel as of 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.329
 all the classics that appear in 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.920
 our section will already be said for that 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.200
 I say all these reviews that I do 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.760
 are based on my personal opinion and 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.770
 certainly the Lord of the Flies' to me 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.210
 It marked me a lot when I read it with 14 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.410
 or 15 years first of all I want 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.149
 tell you a little bit about what goes for those 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.829
 that you do not know the argument this is the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.239
 story of a group of evacuated children 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.829
 of the war that traveling by plane is 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.350
 star on a desert island only 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.420
 are alive 15 or 20 and the oldest has 13 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.800
 years and the smallest 6 or 7 between 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.989
 all the children of friends will have to 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.550
 organize to try to stay with 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.620
 life organize a small society 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.390
 until they are rescued and have 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.800
 some that hunt others that keep the 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.240
 fire on for them to see you and 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.340
 others will have to take care that 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.720
 can live in some kind of house or that 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.800
 nothing happens to them when this happens 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.840
 two well-differentiated groups will appear 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.610
 and a war will begin to develop 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.380
 that will take them not only to survive 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.790
 to the island but also to themselves 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.530
 this novel to me marked me very much 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.760
 because it was the first one I read I'm 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.260
 sure that many others have 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.760
 happened the same thing in which children 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.500
 when adults disappear they 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.790
 They start behaving like savages 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.350
 normal in all these stories in the 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.670
 that parents disappear in children 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.110
 and left alone is that children 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.850
 they behave even better than adults 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.220
 in fact they always manage to solve 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.350
 some crime or saving someone or what 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.580
 be in a much more adult way than 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.410
 normal behavior of any 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.910
 kid and yet be careful when you 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.650
 laugh at all of that in particular from a 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.630
 novel that is titled the island of coral 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.070
 written by valentino there are also some 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.810
 children who disappear on an island 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.220
 deserted and that are also called equal 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.810
 that the protagonists of his story and 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.370
 write a story so cruel and real 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.780
 as life itself as I say all the 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.760
 characters that appear in the novel are 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.190
 guys some kids between 6 and 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.990
 13 years and the protagonists are in that 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.460
 fringe between 11 and 13 and each 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.440
 of them plays a key role in 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.119
 the story one is the ine another is the 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.190
 smartest boy another is the 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.049
 stronger and somehow william 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.060
 mom is capable of all the archetypes and 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.590
 prototypes that you can imagine and create 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.060
 real human characters and with a few 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.650
 incredible dialogues there may be 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.000
 fragments that come out a bit dense 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.620
 but I assure you that all the paragraphs 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.150
 they are there for a reason and that is 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.409
 novel beyond the story that 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.360
 account beyond the characters that 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.709
 presents speech of symbols speak of the 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.510
 loss of innocence speaks of the 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.549
 cruelty talks about the power of fantasy 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.290
 high of the power to create something new from 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.819
 zero and that human nature itself what 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.319
 corrupts why I recommend that you read 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.879
 this novel the youngest possible 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.170
 to then be able to read it in the future and 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.430
 discover that those fragments that those 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.109
 they have done heavier because they have 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.609
 seemed more bored they have grown up with 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.900
 you and you can discover many more 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.400
 details that had escaped you before 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.959
 so I definitely recommend 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.950
 very much the Lord of the Flies' because 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.510
 I assure you that it is a book that has 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.040
 influenced not only adult authors 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.900
 but also of juvenile itself 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.670
 michael grant with his forgotten saga 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.989
 has a wide influence of the Lord of 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.790
 the flies' why they are a handful 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.799
 of children who have to survive in 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.299
 an island deserted in that case in a 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.159
 closed dome where they have to 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.299
 create from making a partnership and if already 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.079
 you have read the book you have seen 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.030
 any of the adaptations 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.590
 cinematic that there is of the novel not 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.720
 hesitate to tell me in the comments that 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.580
 It has seemed to you and if you liked it 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.740
 they are games I like and all these 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.540
 nice things that I appreciate very much and 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.640
 see you in the next biologist 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.140
