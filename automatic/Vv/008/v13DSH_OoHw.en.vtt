 special attention women paid eye

 so they shone under the admired

 a specialist in our expert heading 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.940
 that is photochromic lenses, photochromic 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.110
 lenses are a special type of lenses which 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.150
 react to 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.220
 ultraviolet radiation and thanks 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.010
 this may be obscured 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.450
 depending on radiation intensity 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.360
 either brightens if intensity 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.640
 radiation falls the room they 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.739
 transparent you use them like normal 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.890
 reading glasses for work behind

 lenses are affected 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.620
 ultraviolet radiation and 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.690
 obscure so they start 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.210
 perform the role of sunglasses 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.510
 novelties in the area under the huge lines 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.970
 new in the field of huge photo lenses 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.190
 lenses called transition extra 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.080
 assets that offer french 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.540
 manufacturers these lenses 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.890
 react not just to ultraviolet these 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.560
 The lens responds to the visible spectrum 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.659
 light radiation meaning they 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.600
 ability to black out to a certain 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.000
 degrees even if acted upon 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.020
 ultraviolet indirect and just 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.240
 solar radiation affects the lens 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.180
 so these lenses work in 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.550
 number and behind the windshield of the car and 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.710
 they can even work the room 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.890
 for example where are very large stained glass windows 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.820
 big windows besides 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.580
 photo noisy linz manufacturers 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.890
 have prepared for users one more 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.370
 surprise is photochromic lenses transition 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.610
 new generation is already 7 in a row by 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.950
 to a large extent this is an improved version

 allow these lenses faster 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.159
 enlighten in the room and faster 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.390
 respond to sunlight that is 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:14.390
 darken faster
