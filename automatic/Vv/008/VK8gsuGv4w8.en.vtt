inches<00:00:07.020> as<00:00:07.379> far<00:00:07.589> as<00:00:07.710> I<00:00:07.830> believe<00:00:08.210> put<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.330> two

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
inches as far as I believe put the two

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.430 
inches as far as I believe put the two
together<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:11.059> how<00:00:12.059> much<00:00:12.240> bigger<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:12.840> it<00:00:13.110> well

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
together and how much bigger is it well

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.870 
together and how much bigger is it well
