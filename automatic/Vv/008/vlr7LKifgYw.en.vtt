00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.520
 jo hey people and welcome to 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.570
 a new comment familia here on 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.969
 There is a channel of weapons in the background 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.099
 it's a gameplay of mine for the first time 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.590
 so in the beginning you see a few 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.060
 Other guys care about it because I first 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.730
 by separately I do not know I 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.730
 believe after about one to two minutes 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.539
 I do not know exactly how it looks so yes 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.390
 the others are only amrum traffic lights 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.340
 is a 30 24 just on raid is now 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.020
 not the crudest gameplay i mean 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.430
 know me yes but I'm 30 4's 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.100
 Alright at the beginning with you 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.480
 right kaka yes and otherwise that 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.149
 Gameplay is really not a highlight 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.059
 yes I could do better now 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.950
 say something but 30 4 still is 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:54.059
 a very quite acceptable score 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.800
 Let's ok and the gameplay as I said 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.449
 has two minutes you see me and me 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.230
 would first about such a few others 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.469
 talk about things 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.049
 on the one hand, thanks to yoga, there I am now 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.610
 also, so to speak, yes partner or something 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.260
 you can in the description of the 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.119
 open the first link and then you see 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.439
 the whole games right now not 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.990
 connected here after a minute ten 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.330
 seconds or so about there you will find 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.080
 link that forwards you to play 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.549
 from mmo even and yes if he has something about it 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.100
 then I buy a small one 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.540
 percent off so who really cool 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.009
 if you buy my game anyway 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.080
 just go over the link with it 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.470
 who support me and as you know 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.000
 go my complete youtuber money and 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.170
 really wants to look complete too 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.420
 in new equipment pure 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.159
 that you see the most part on my 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.790
 second channel tv games is also in 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.380
 the description 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.700
 and yes we just great if that's me 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.530
 would support if you anyway 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.270
 Buying games then puts that down there 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.790
 my link the games are not more expensive 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.009
 as otherwise therefore really cheap 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.479
 prices there annoying there I have myself 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.880
 right now even here just blatantly 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.140
 mistakes in the background well anyway 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.549
 In the beginning my cellphone was pretty 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.740
 cold and that was the first game or 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.990
 but alright I want to go 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.610
 do not finish 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.200
 So first of all that to a burka like 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.990
 said games could buy who right 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.770
 cool is not a secret that there 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.819
 some youtube 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.250
 co- earn their coal or at least 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.150
 something about coal or somehow you 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.610
 understand what I mean 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.769
 and there I thought you come apply 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.330
 you there and then makes the link 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.670
 underneath that can not hurt 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.560
 as I said with me so far everyone 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.410
 single euro back and youtube 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.459
 went 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.330
 that is exactly what is in my setup 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.340
 video for example that happened now yes 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.910
 four five days house at least so on 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.110
 sunday came out on sunday 20 o'clock approx 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.670
 who has not seen it yet 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.700
 said second channel in the description 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.190
 that's right the first video or that 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.630
 Last video is the latest, so to speak 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.299
 also as a state video 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.829
 linked necessarily looks over when 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.030
 you want to know how my gaming like that 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.239
 setup from you can see a complete 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.160
 room my pc what kind of microphone i have 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.230
 monitor everything so that will be complete 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.739
 everything in it all linked and so on 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.980
 and so on 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.569
 so be sure to stop by as 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.329
 I actually have today's topic 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.220
 something completely different and that work or 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.840
 school so very briefly the topic that 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.049
 gameplay is still three minutes approx 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.970
 so short topic and what is 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.190
 horny work or school ask 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.410
 me yes many because yes I'll say something 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.410
 younger ones know at most one 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.150
 internship and just do not know how 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.609
 it is to work or if it is now 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.090
 is better than school and then ask 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:34.850
 we can do that a bit yes 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.230
 forward or not what it 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.239
 better, what is worse 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.819
 and then I just want to be very short 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.280
 to you the pros and cons say that 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.079
 I'm counting on me now 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.180
 Personally , I would have the opinion 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.680
 always that is and that comes on the 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.049
 That's why it's here now 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.209
 So be a very touchy subject because it 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.590
 is from profession to profession and school too 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.319
 school different but i say 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.069
 my opinion I think now 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.989
 work horny in most cases 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.519
 You have to work longer than 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.980
 you go to school that means what knows 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.419
 I work half at least seven 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:13.569
 hours a day or eight hours depending on 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:15.579
 You usually go to school and to school 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:19.359
 We're six to eight like that 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:20.109
 but hours only hours ak 45 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.880
 minutes 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.539
 that means, for example, with me is the 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:28.240
 school from the morning of eight, I think 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.560
 until half three yes- and just three that is 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.940
 no time after that can still 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.500
 what can you do after that? 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.949
 meet buddies or go to the cinema or 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.410
 What ever 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:36.669
 so you still have enough time and 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.400
 If you work now, I'll tell you 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:45.580
 I always start at 8 o'clock at 8 o'clock 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:47.860
 to work and then about 15 o'clock 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.349
 30 when things are going well 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.570
 So if that's really so if I am now 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:54.400
 can leave some things or something 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.400
 or even if it is not urgent now 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.740
 there is somehow time dependent 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.240
 then maybe 15 30 and otherwise it can 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.979
 also be much later 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.099
 I also have representation 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.389
 I did in one week 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:09.880
 built up many hours overtime 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.289
 that was four days representations there 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:16.150
 a holiday in between and there I have 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:18.430
 then every day until about 18 or 19 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:22.570
 clock worked that is over ten 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:24.340
 hours and yet I would say 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:28.720
 that my work is more fun and so 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.159
 why work or time at the 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.400
 work is much faster 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:34.599
 because I have a very good one 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.570
 training so I'm doing one 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.800
 training as an industrial clerk and me 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.449
 I also got a very good company 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.759
 I say now because I have 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:44.199
 actually always what to do so now 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:46.030
 In most cases there are of course 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:48.970
 Days were a bit boring , though 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:52.690
 I'll say 95 percent or more 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.860
 I always have something to do and there passes 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.720
 the time just really fast though 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.889
 you actively do what you do not look 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.580
 then on the time does not own in the 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:05.650
 school and kurjo passed two minutes 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:06.639
 yes horny two minutes have passed 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.669
 to endure a bit 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:12.190
 No, that's right, anyway 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:16.360
 Buck and now the gameplay is already 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.800
 over but I'm still on time 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.060
 just passes much faster and at 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.680
 I have to say that's the school 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.060
 is partially right it everything 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.650
 theory you can not do it yourself 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.260
 that's it all on the control panel and 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.480
 that's just my opinion 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.010
 So very short opinions like I said 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.810
 It could talk about the topic for a longer time 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.640
 you can also suggest topics 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.170
 in the comments that I read me 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.020
 every single comment by that 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:38.520
 I always do that and so would 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.900
 I say a nice rest of the week 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.100
 and have a nice weekend and see you soon 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.100
 for the next time people look 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:03.199
 a
