run<00:01:02.430> away<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.989> get<00:01:03.989> why<00:01:04.110> she<00:01:04.320> did<00:01:04.500> it

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
run away I get why she did it

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.380 
run away I get why she did it
I've<00:01:04.890> thought<00:01:05.250> about<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:06.060> my<00:01:06.180> initial

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
I've thought about this and my initial

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.300 
I've thought about this and my initial
reaction<00:01:06.600> when<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.320> was<00:01:07.530> reading<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.890> script<00:01:08.010> I

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
reaction when I was reading the script I

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.899 
reaction when I was reading the script I
was<00:01:08.460> like<00:01:08.670> what<00:01:09.570> why<00:01:10.500> why<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.220> then<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.610> thought

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
was like what why why and then I thought

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.550 
was like what why why and then I thought
about<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.750> kind<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.020> makes<00:01:13.200> sense<00:01:13.260> to

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
about it and it kind of makes sense to

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.210 
about it and it kind of makes sense to
me<00:01:13.710> she<00:01:14.070> has<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:15.210> kind<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.960> um<00:01:17.659> this<00:01:18.659> sort<00:01:18.960> of

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
me she has this kind of um this sort of

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.010 
me she has this kind of um this sort of
fight-or-flight<00:01:20.220> reaction<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.450> think<00:01:21.720> where

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
fight-or-flight reaction I think where

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.499 
fight-or-flight reaction I think where
you<00:01:22.470> know<00:01:22.860> she's<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.460> had<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.119> much<00:01:24.210> going<00:01:24.450> on

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
you know she's just had so much going on

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.600 
you know she's just had so much going on
in<00:01:24.630> her<00:01:24.720> life<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.080> she's<00:01:25.530> dealt<00:01:25.770> with<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.400> many

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
in her life and she's dealt with so many

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.999 
in her life and she's dealt with so many
like<00:01:26.820> setbacks<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.080> disappointments

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
like setbacks and and disappointments

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.760 
like setbacks and and disappointments
and<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:30.210> think<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.659> her<00:01:30.930> reaction<00:01:31.290> when

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
and and I think that her reaction when

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.950 
and and I think that her reaction when
something<00:01:32.130> goes<00:01:32.250> wrong<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.090> just<00:01:33.299> run<00:01:33.600> run

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
something goes wrong is to just run run

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.590 
something goes wrong is to just run run
away<00:01:34.049> from<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.619> um<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:35.970> understand<00:01:36.420> why

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
away from it and um so I understand why

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.910 
away from it and um so I understand why
she<00:01:36.720> did<00:01:36.840> she<00:01:37.020> thinks<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.380> she's<00:01:37.590> doing<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
she did she thinks that she's doing the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.469 
she did she thinks that she's doing the
right<00:01:38.040> thing<00:01:38.220> for<00:01:38.490> everyone<00:01:38.729> she's<00:01:39.060> trying<00:01:39.420> to

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
right thing for everyone she's trying to

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.390 
stylish I think um no yeah I think what
kind<00:03:27.720> of<00:03:27.840> in<00:03:28.019> essence<00:03:28.440> what<00:03:28.620> kind<00:03:28.859> of<00:03:28.980> similar

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
kind of in essence what kind of similar

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.039 
kind of in essence what kind of similar
and<00:03:29.609> I<00:03:29.669> think<00:03:29.909> the<00:03:30.030> ease<00:03:30.209> we'll<00:03:30.540> start<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:31.019> see

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
and I think the ease we'll start to see

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.649 
and I think the ease we'll start to see
that<00:03:31.470> more<00:03:32.129> in<00:03:32.159> Callie's<00:03:32.760> so<00:03:33.030> you'll<00:03:33.209> see<00:03:33.419> her

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
that more in Callie's so you'll see her

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:35.569 
that more in Callie's so you'll see her
kind<00:03:34.319> of<00:03:34.409> when<00:03:34.530> you<00:03:34.620> take<00:03:34.859> away<00:03:35.010> all<00:03:35.159> of<00:03:35.370> the

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
kind of when you take away all of the

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.189 
kind of when you take away all of the
context<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.209> what<00:03:36.329> she's<00:03:36.480> been<00:03:36.659> through<00:03:36.690> and

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199 
context and what she's been through and

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:39.099 
context and what she's been through and
all<00:03:37.349> of<00:03:37.500> her<00:03:37.590> like<00:03:37.769> heartache<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.699> and

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
all of her like heartache and and

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.379 
all of her like heartache and and
torture<00:03:40.109> use<00:03:40.709> is<00:03:40.980> just<00:03:41.280> like<00:03:41.400> a<00:03:41.430> really<00:03:41.909> like

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
obviously quite different in a little

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.909 
obviously quite different in a little
ways<00:03:49.769> but<00:03:50.040> um<00:03:50.220> but<00:03:51.030> yeah<00:03:51.900> she's<00:03:52.500> just<00:03:52.680> she's
