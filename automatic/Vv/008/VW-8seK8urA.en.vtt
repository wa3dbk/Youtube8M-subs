00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
whiskey too in my opinion because it's a

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.729 
whiskey too in my opinion because it's a
little<00:02:47.600> bit<00:02:47.780> sweeter<00:02:48.049> and<00:02:48.140> it<00:02:48.320> doesn't<00:02:48.590> have

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
little bit sweeter and it doesn't have

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.520 
little bit sweeter and it doesn't have
all<00:02:49.010> that<00:02:49.070> cake<00:02:49.609> then<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:51.049> fireball<00:02:51.380> whiskey
