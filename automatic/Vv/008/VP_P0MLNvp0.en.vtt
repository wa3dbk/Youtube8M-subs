00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
what part of winter is bad for car audio

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.460 
what part of winter is bad for car audio
I<00:00:12.530> see<00:00:13.530> all<00:00:13.650> this<00:00:13.799> right<00:00:14.040> here<00:00:15.049> turn<00:00:16.049> my<00:00:16.260> heater

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
I see all this right here turn my heater

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.130 
I see all this right here turn my heater
on<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.980> garage<00:00:17.220> for<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.670> little<00:00:17.910> bit<00:00:18.140> it

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
on in the garage for a little bit it

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.450 
on in the garage for a little bit it
causes<00:00:19.560> all<00:00:19.710> this<00:00:19.859> condensation<00:00:22.369> here's<00:00:23.369> a

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
causes all this condensation here's a

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.269 
causes all this condensation here's a
real<00:00:23.699> bad<00:00:23.939> spot<00:00:24.300> right<00:00:24.330> here<00:00:24.890> you<00:00:25.890> can<00:00:26.070> see<00:00:26.099> all

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
real bad spot right here you can see all

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.470 
real bad spot right here you can see all
this<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.730> all<00:00:26.910> wet<00:00:28.910> actually<00:00:29.910> go<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.269> on<00:00:30.449> my

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
this is all wet actually go in on my

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.200 
this is all wet actually go in on my
amplifiers<00:00:31.640> you<00:00:32.640> can<00:00:32.790> see<00:00:32.940> all<00:00:33.059> this

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
amplifiers you can see all this

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.780 
amplifiers you can see all this
condensation<00:00:33.630> building<00:00:34.380> up<00:00:34.579> this<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.670> all

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
condensation building up this is all

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.700 
condensation building up this is all
water<00:00:36.000> starting<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.630> build<00:00:36.780> up<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:37.170> my<00:00:37.320> amps

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
water starting to build up on my amps

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.190 
water starting to build up on my amps
and<00:00:38.180> this<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.270> about<00:00:39.390> any<00:00:39.600> other<00:00:39.780> piece<00:00:40.050> of

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
and this is about any other piece of

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.369 
and this is about any other piece of
metal<00:00:41.149> so<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.210> know<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.809> condensation

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
metal so you know that that condensation

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.740 
metal so you know that that condensation
is<00:00:43.860> building<00:00:44.219> up<00:00:44.340> inside<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.820> amplifier<00:00:45.120> too

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
is building up inside the amplifier too

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.330 
is building up inside the amplifier too
so<00:00:46.379> that's<00:00:46.559> all<00:00:46.739> I'm<00:00:46.800> going<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.950> be<00:00:47.010> pulling

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
so that's all I'm going to be pulling

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.869 
so that's all I'm going to be pulling
them<00:00:47.489> out<00:00:47.579> right<00:00:47.789> now

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
them out right now

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.610 
them out right now
like<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.969> said<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.329> other<00:00:51.360> video<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:52.320> cold

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
like I said in the other video the cold

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.770 
like I said in the other video the cold
is<00:00:52.949> not<00:00:53.129> bad<00:00:53.420> but<00:00:54.420> going<00:00:54.750> from<00:00:54.989> cold<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.680> hot<00:00:56.780> or

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
is not bad but going from cold to hot or

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.410 
is not bad but going from cold to hot or
cold<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.320> warm<00:00:58.699> or<00:00:59.699> anything<00:00:59.969> that's<00:01:00.239> going<00:01:00.359> to

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
cold to warm or anything that's going to

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.119 
cold to warm or anything that's going to
cause<00:01:00.480> condensation<00:01:00.870> or<00:01:01.530> moisture<00:01:01.920> inside

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
cause condensation or moisture inside

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.319 
cause condensation or moisture inside
your<00:01:02.280> amps<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.609> gonna<00:01:02.789> be<00:01:02.910> bad<00:01:03.090> because

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
your amps is gonna be bad because

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.670 
your amps is gonna be bad because
obviously<00:01:03.480> electricity<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.379> moisture

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
obviously electricity and moisture

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.980 
obviously electricity and moisture
doesn't<00:01:04.920> mix<00:01:05.150> pretty<00:01:06.150> frustrated<00:01:06.810> with

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
doesn't mix pretty frustrated with

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.250 
doesn't mix pretty frustrated with
winter<00:01:07.350> at<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.710> point<00:01:08.270> so<00:01:09.270> if<00:01:09.540> winter<00:01:09.990> if

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
winter at this point so if winter if

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.160 
winter at this point so if winter if
you're<00:01:10.409> listening<00:01:11.540> get<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.840> out<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.049> my

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
you're listening get the out of my

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.999 
you're listening get the out of my
state<00:01:14.210> ok<00:01:15.240> winter<00:01:16.020> cold

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
state ok winter cold

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.480 
state ok winter cold
not<00:01:17.820> bad<00:01:18.150> for<00:01:18.180> car<00:01:18.630> audio<00:01:19.490> condensation

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
not bad for car audio condensation

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.820 
not bad for car audio condensation
moisture<00:01:21.320> bad<00:01:22.320> for<00:01:22.590> car<00:01:22.740> audio<00:01:24.170> you<00:01:25.170> can<00:01:25.200> see<00:01:25.619> I

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
moisture bad for car audio you can see I

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.370 
moisture bad for car audio you can see I
brought<00:01:26.040> these<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.400> house<00:01:26.549> now<00:01:27.080> how<00:01:28.080> wet

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
brought these in the house now how wet

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.929 
brought these in the house now how wet
they<00:01:28.590> are<00:01:29.509> that's<00:01:30.509> just<00:01:30.630> from<00:01:31.850> turning<00:01:32.850> my

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
they are that's just from turning my

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.590 
they are that's just from turning my
heater<00:01:33.180> on<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.600> my<00:01:33.720> garage<00:01:34.549> so<00:01:35.549> if<00:01:36.060> you're

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
heater on in my garage so if you're

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.649 
heater on in my garage so if you're
going<00:01:36.780> from<00:01:37.140> extreme<00:01:37.829> cold<00:01:38.329> below<00:01:39.329> freezing

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
going from extreme cold below freezing

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.630 
going from extreme cold below freezing
conditions<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:42.680> warm<00:01:43.680> conditions<00:01:44.040> you're

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
conditions to warm conditions you're

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.429 
conditions to warm conditions you're
going<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.820> get<00:01:44.970> condensation<00:01:45.329> just<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.320> the

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
going to get condensation just like the

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.789 
going to get condensation just like the
outside<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.040> soda<00:01:47.280> can<00:01:48.439> it's<00:01:49.439> gonna<00:01:49.530> cost

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
outside of a soda can it's gonna cost

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.340 
outside of a soda can it's gonna cost
moisture<00:01:50.310> moistures<00:01:50.759> not<00:01:51.000> good<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:52.110> I'm<00:01:52.229> going

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
moisture moistures not good so I'm going

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.690 
moisture moistures not good so I'm going
to<00:01:52.409> set<00:01:52.619> these<00:01:52.829> out<00:01:53.009> I'm<00:01:53.250> going<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.430> let<00:01:53.520> these

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
to set these out I'm going to let these

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.039 
to set these out I'm going to let these
dry<00:01:54.350> for<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.380> very<00:01:55.740> long<00:01:56.040> time<00:01:56.719> they<00:01:57.719> should<00:01:57.780> be

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
dry for a very long time they should be

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.530 
dry for a very long time they should be
okay<00:01:58.140> once<00:01:58.530> they're<00:01:58.770> dry<00:01:58.920> but<00:01:59.479> because<00:02:00.479> I

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
okay once they're dry but because I

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.870 
okay once they're dry but because I
never<00:02:00.600> turned<00:02:01.020> them<00:02:01.170> on

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
never turned them on

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.749 
never turned them on
it's<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.969> bad<00:02:03.119> thing<00:02:03.570> about<00:02:04.670> turning<00:02:05.670> these

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
it's the bad thing about turning these

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.990 
it's the bad thing about turning these
on<00:02:06.060> with<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.110> moisture<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.429> moisture<00:02:08.879> is

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
on with the moisture is the moisture is

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.990 
on with the moisture is the moisture is
going<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.270> get<00:02:09.509> it's<00:02:10.349> going<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.590> cause<00:02:11.000> stuff

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
going to get it's going to cause stuff

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.850 
going to get it's going to cause stuff
to<00:02:12.180> conduct<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.629> less<00:02:12.750> electricity

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
to conduct a less electricity

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.680 
to conduct a less electricity
that's<00:02:14.160> not<00:02:14.400> supposed<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.940> be<00:02:15.150> conducting

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
that's not supposed to be conducting

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.590 
that's not supposed to be conducting
electricity<00:02:17.030> because<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.150> have<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.330> lot<00:02:18.570> of

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
electricity because you have a lot of

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.370 
electricity because you have a lot of
stuff<00:02:19.380> inside<00:02:19.560> your<00:02:19.890> amps<00:02:20.310> that's<00:02:21.380> connected

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
stuff inside your amps that's connected

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.190 
stuff inside your amps that's connected
but<00:02:22.530> separated<00:02:23.340> by<00:02:23.910> stuff<00:02:24.510> that's<00:02:24.720> not<00:02:24.900> a

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
but separated by stuff that's not a

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.620 
but separated by stuff that's not a
conductor<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.880> moisture<00:02:27.240> is<00:02:27.300> going<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.480> be<00:02:27.600> a

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
conductor the moisture is going to be a

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.760 
conductor the moisture is going to be a
conductor<00:02:27.960> and<00:02:28.260> that's<00:02:28.440> when<00:02:28.560> you're<00:02:28.680> gonna

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
conductor and that's when you're gonna

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.400 
conductor and that's when you're gonna
get<00:02:29.010> shortages<00:02:29.820> and<00:02:29.970> stuff<00:02:30.210> so<00:02:30.720> if<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:31.050> do<00:02:31.200> get

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
get shortages and stuff so if you do get

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.900 
get shortages and stuff so if you do get
condensation<00:02:31.740> like<00:02:32.190> this<00:02:32.340> do<00:02:32.520> not<00:02:32.550> turn<00:02:32.880> your

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
condensation like this do not turn your

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.630 
condensation like this do not turn your
amps<00:02:33.270> on<00:02:33.530> do<00:02:34.530> not<00:02:34.680> try<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.040> see<00:02:35.400> if<00:02:35.490> they're

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
amps on do not try to see if they're

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.900 
amps on do not try to see if they're
gonna<00:02:35.730> work<00:02:36.000> let<00:02:36.810> them<00:02:36.900> dry<00:02:37.700> know<00:02:38.700> that

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
gonna work let them dry know that

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.190 
gonna work let them dry know that
they're<00:02:39.060> gonna<00:02:39.150> work<00:02:39.360> before<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:39.930> see<00:02:40.140> if

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
they're gonna work before you see if

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.080 
they're gonna work before you see if
they're<00:02:40.350> gonna<00:02:40.440> work<00:02:40.650> okay<00:02:41.610> I'm<00:02:41.820> gonna<00:02:41.910> do<00:02:42.060> a

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
they're gonna work okay I'm gonna do a

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.949 
they're gonna work okay I'm gonna do a
little<00:02:42.209> reminiscing<00:02:42.930> with<00:02:43.080> you<00:02:43.230> guys<00:02:43.610> a<00:02:44.959> while

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
little reminiscing with you guys a while

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.630 
little reminiscing with you guys a while
back<00:02:46.230> when<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:46.560> was<00:02:46.680> like<00:02:46.830> 17

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
back when I was like 17

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.020 
back when I was like 17
so<00:02:48.450> like<00:02:48.630> six<00:02:48.900> years<00:02:49.110> ago<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.950> used<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.700> run<00:02:50.880> this

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
so like six years ago I used to run this

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.970 
so like six years ago I used to run this
amp<00:02:51.240> right<00:02:51.390> here<00:02:51.600> they'd<00:02:52.350> blow<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.650> up<00:02:52.739> on<00:02:52.890> the

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
amp right here they'd blow it up on the

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.930 
amp right here they'd blow it up on the
Internet

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
Internet

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.870 
Internet
I<00:02:54.140> don't<00:02:55.140> have<00:02:55.320> it<00:02:55.440> anymore<00:02:56.040> it's<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.340> ma<00:02:56.580> audio

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
I don't have it anymore it's a ma audio

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.610 
I don't have it anymore it's a ma audio
HD<00:02:57.390> 4000<00:02:58.350> -<00:02:58.640> its<00:02:59.640> 4000<00:03:00.239> watts<00:03:00.390> at<00:03:00.570> one<00:03:00.720> ohm<00:03:00.900> this

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620

is<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.800> amp<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.100> I<00:03:02.190> used<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.520> run<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:03.750> I

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
is the amp that I used to run and I

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.170 
is the amp that I used to run and I
didn't<00:03:04.200> run<00:03:04.320> that<00:03:04.470> old<00:03:04.620> guy<00:03:04.830> but<00:03:05.190> that's<00:03:05.940> the

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
didn't run that old guy but that's the

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.740 
didn't run that old guy but that's the
amp<00:03:06.600> that<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:06.870> used<00:03:07.080> to<00:03:07.200> have<00:03:07.459> I<00:03:08.480> had<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.600> mounted

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
amp that I used to have I had it mounted

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.910 
amp that I used to have I had it mounted
in<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.110> bed<00:03:10.260> of<00:03:10.380> my<00:03:10.470> truck<00:03:11.450> years<00:03:12.450> ago<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:12.989> it

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
in the bed of my truck years ago and it

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.460 
in the bed of my truck years ago and it
rained<00:03:14.220> one<00:03:14.370> night<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:15.720> I<00:03:15.810> lifted<00:03:16.110> up<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.350> lid

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
rained one night and I lifted up the lid

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.470 
rained one night and I lifted up the lid
of<00:03:16.620> my<00:03:16.709> truck<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.280> bunch<00:03:17.670> of<00:03:17.820> water<00:03:17.970> went<00:03:18.239> in<00:03:18.360> the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
of my truck a bunch of water went in the

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.270 
of my truck a bunch of water went in the
amp<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:20.360> I<00:03:21.360> made<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.140> mistake<00:03:22.500> of<00:03:22.769> like<00:03:23.100> oh

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
amp and I made the mistake of like oh

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.000 
amp and I made the mistake of like oh
 there's<00:03:24.570> water<00:03:24.840> in<00:03:24.989> my<00:03:25.110> amp<00:03:25.320> is<00:03:25.620> it<00:03:25.890> gonna

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
 there's water in my amp is it gonna

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.320 
 there's water in my amp is it gonna
work<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:26.670> I<00:03:27.390> turned<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.750> amp<00:03:27.930> on<00:03:28.140> and<00:03:29.330> the

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
work and I turned the amp on and the

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.390 
work and I turned the amp on and the
status<00:03:30.720> light<00:03:30.900> was<00:03:31.080> green<00:03:31.350> for<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.709> few<00:03:31.920> seconds

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
status light was green for a few seconds

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.340 
status light was green for a few seconds
and<00:03:32.489> then<00:03:32.580> it<00:03:32.730> went<00:03:32.820> red<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.360> it<00:03:33.959> was<00:03:34.140> never

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
and then it went red and it was never

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.660 
and then it went red and it was never
green<00:03:34.680> again<00:03:35.480> so<00:03:36.480> like<00:03:36.660> I<00:03:36.780> said<00:03:37.340> what<00:03:38.340> I<00:03:38.370> made

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
green again so like I said what I made

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.789 
green again so like I said what I made
the<00:03:38.730> mistake<00:03:39.060> there<00:03:39.299> of<00:03:39.540> testing<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.680> see

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
the mistake there of testing it to see

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.110 
the mistake there of testing it to see
if<00:03:41.010> it<00:03:41.100> was<00:03:41.160> gonna<00:03:41.340> work<00:03:41.430> while<00:03:41.850> there<00:03:42.000> was

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
if it was gonna work while there was

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.020 
if it was gonna work while there was
still<00:03:42.209> moisture<00:03:42.540> inside<00:03:43.080> of<00:03:43.230> it<00:03:43.370> bad<00:03:44.370> idea

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
still moisture inside of it bad idea

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.199 
still moisture inside of it bad idea
shorted<00:03:45.420> out<00:03:45.540> never<00:03:46.019> worked<00:03:46.260> again<00:03:47.209> it

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
shorted out never worked again it

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.610 
shorted out never worked again it
probably<00:03:48.780> would<00:03:48.930> have<00:03:48.959> worked<00:03:49.140> if<00:03:49.320> I<00:03:49.440> woulda

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
probably would have worked if I woulda

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.810 
probably would have worked if I woulda
dis<00:03:49.799> unhooked<00:03:50.220> it<00:03:50.400> remove<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.120> polar<00:03:51.450> source

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
dis unhooked it remove the polar source

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.539 
dis unhooked it remove the polar source
let<00:03:53.820> it<00:03:53.940> dry<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:54.860> make<00:03:55.860> sure<00:03:56.040> it's<00:03:56.190> completely

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
let it dry and make sure it's completely

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.259 
let it dry and make sure it's completely
dry<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:57.030> then<00:03:57.150> try<00:03:57.330> it<00:03:57.390> so<00:03:58.170> just<00:03:59.090> it's<00:04:00.090> like<00:04:00.150> a

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
dry and then try it so just it's like a

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.120 
dry and then try it so just it's like a
cell<00:04:00.570> phone<00:04:00.780> if<00:04:00.959> you<00:04:00.989> drop<00:04:01.230> it<00:04:01.260> in<00:04:01.470> a<00:04:01.530> lake<00:04:01.769> or

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
cell phone if you drop it in a lake or

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.789 
cell phone if you drop it in a lake or
you<00:04:02.760> get<00:04:02.940> it<00:04:03.030> wet<00:04:03.239> remove<00:04:04.080> the<00:04:04.260> power<00:04:04.470> source

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
you get it wet remove the power source

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.130 
you get it wet remove the power source
remove<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.280> battery<00:04:05.700> let<00:04:06.390> it<00:04:06.510> dry<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:07.019> it'll

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
remove the battery let it dry and it'll

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.660 
remove the battery let it dry and it'll
probably<00:04:07.440> work<00:04:07.680> again<00:04:08.070> nine<00:04:08.250> times<00:04:08.459> out<00:04:08.640> of

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
probably work again nine times out of
