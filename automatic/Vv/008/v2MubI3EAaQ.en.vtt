00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
from one of the one of the one of a

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.830 
from one of the one of the one of a
cardboard<00:01:54.860> shape<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.159> i<00:01:56.189> already<00:01:56.460> had<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.689> i

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
cardboard shape that i already had and i

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.289 
cardboard shape that i already had and i
followed<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.189> trace<00:01:59.520> out<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.180> i

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
followed the the trace out and i

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.560 
followed the the trace out and i
basically<00:02:00.479> cut<00:02:01.079> free<00:02:01.590> hand<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.640> yeah<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.420> this

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
basically cut free hand so yeah so this

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.870 
basically cut free hand so yeah so this
slight<00:02:04.200> imperfections<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.189> pattern<00:02:05.640> but

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
slight imperfections to the pattern but

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.999 
slight imperfections to the pattern but
i<00:02:05.909> think<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.630> gives<00:02:06.810> more<00:02:07.079> character<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.649> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
i think it gives more character to the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.150 
i think it gives more character to the
