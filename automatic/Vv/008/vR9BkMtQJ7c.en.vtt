 dueling in art we walked 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.220

 the tree the barrel friendly spaces 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:23.270
 in short a goal not less than I like a 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.160
 arrow so if the lighthouse had stolen 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.470
 since it happened that sfr more 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.590
 stuffed to one cold shot that 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.960
 I won at Lorient remains a bag or 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.550
 very strong with in eighth position son 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.750
 explain who makes you a beautiful part 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:42.380
 wharves or wait there is 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:51.100
 passage in force there that does not attempt anything 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:51.100
 has nothing there stuff down his fall 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.530
 you wanted to fight you had it 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.850
 Finally, I do not know if you are 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.080
 what were you wanting when but when 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.479
 even wanted to lock up at the seventh 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.250
 position we find kim 09 hunger 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.240
 games and he will introduce us as the 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.240
 use her boyfriend 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.720
 if I do not have it's the disappointment of the 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.910
 world 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.760
 I'm kidding of course we 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.220
 let's bathe then I'll always be able to 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.770
 bow trophy but that's what I do not 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.790
 not going to do it because I'm scared that 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.210
 flows if I do while they get 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.140
 return 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:39.110
 he hits me with the sword and an expense then 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:45.650
 I can not take my sword 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:47.990
 he'll tell me he was fine and that's it 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.520
 in 16th position we find this 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:54.110
 atrix that makes us a series of kiel 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.030
 rather honorable in aggression agree 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.500
 he's there, we'll try to get on well 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.450
 do it we'll go we 'll try to 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.100
 not to burst and go away is it 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:06.850
 saw me no he did not see me if he saw me 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:09.560
 but not actually there not see me here it 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.270
 okay bomb to him it was vitreens I 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.540
 do not know he was in the west it was nothing 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.540
 seen coming 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:22.520
 that's where she enchants her 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:24.590
 it's practical and if I'm doing it ok 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.060
 not doing it right we will quickly enjoy it 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.770
 I still have some time in 28 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.000
 seconds maybe I'll be there 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.000
 had mud once he had the food 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.720
 in fifth position we find 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.120
 siegel who makes us a presentation of the 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.670
 new wild pb spawn of the season 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.970
 8 mess on the spawn is more 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.130
 access to these bumps to tell all where 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.440
 that in the water yes I confess you were there 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.390
 less people 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.040
 how it starts but we can not 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.250
 for now I said there there 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.120
 there is trianon to shit 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.420
 so yes so here we will just 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.680
 cover the season 8 2 pcf for what they 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.569
 polluted but it will be interesting 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.469
 since you do not know her yet 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.090
 and for others and well it's not 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:08.569
 serious we fuck you there we can go out 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.980
 we can go out then or there and that's it 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.930
 which fixes that we find at the bottom of the 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.129
 podium with a video anyway wars 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.129
 with reindeer the red panda 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:21.820
 under the boot actually deserved 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:38.770
 he's going to die it's the eu27 you're in 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.460
 to decide he's a guy but 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:45.040
 he went up to paou at the khimki est 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.920
 fell game hurt me very much I will die 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.410
 and so we start this top 3 with at the 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.480
 third position must azerty who 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.740
 we present the mini joucla peeters which 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.970
 is unfortunately no longer available 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:02.930
 on the server we have in hand the 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.800
 feather of flapi and try to move on to 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.780
 through the obstacles 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.490
 so I warn you right away the video 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.470
 she's really not going to be long 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.140
 what jeremy catastrophic level 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.970
 it's pretty dramatic I'm struggling to 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.800
 pass the first man 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.810
 and here I touched that's what I 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.160
 you told me my record for the moment 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.230
 it's 4.1 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.610
 it's not very high at youtube has spent the 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.880
 second what happens to pass the 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.919
 third one believes in yes the medal 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.650
 of money goes back to mastaing vince 75 who 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:33.380
 we present the b's so we have to 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:36.560
 find on a bed see ben here so 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:39.800
 the new game that is on pc m on that 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.600
 wholesale world it's a rush on mappy 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.520
 is pretty cool I hope they go 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.620
 not just stop on this map and who 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.450
 are going to do several maps because 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.890
 frankly the map is very very nice 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.440
 there are several possibilities of 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:56.360
 strategy that is really interesting 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:57.800
 so an interesting strategy and so 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.450
 I think that's fine 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.030
 could be really nice not the goal 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.500
 it's to be a run adac not you 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.770

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:14.870

 between a small handset 5 3 in any case 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.140

 we hope you will appreciate 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:24.340

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.610
