00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
three days after the first day I'm when

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.209 
three days after the first day I'm when
it's<00:00:58.020> on<00:00:58.109> console<00:00:58.530> that's<00:00:58.949> when<00:00:59.100> all<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
it's on console that's when all the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.920 
it's on console that's when all the
packs<00:00:59.550> have<00:00:59.730> died<00:00:59.910> down<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> markets<00:01:00.780> died

packs have died down on the markets died
down<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.170> bit<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.920> think<00:01:02.160> he'll<00:01:02.309> be<00:01:02.460> 35<00:01:02.850> k

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
down a bit and I think he'll be 35 k

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.200 
down a bit and I think he'll be 35 k
250k<00:01:03.809> because<00:01:04.049> last<00:01:04.229> year<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.680> paid<00:01:05.250> um<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.820> think

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
250k because last year I paid um I think

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.640 
250k because last year I paid um I think
three<00:01:06.479> days<00:01:06.510> after<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.020> game<00:01:07.170> come<00:01:07.380> out<00:01:07.500> I

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
three days after the game come out I

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.609 
three days after the game come out I

that's<00:01:10.799> going<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.979> be<00:01:11.100> similar<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.670> time

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
that's going to be similar this time

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.030 
that's going to be similar this time
round<00:01:12.150> okay<00:01:13.049> next<00:01:13.229> up<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.590> gonna<00:01:13.710> be<00:01:13.830> probably

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
history of fee for a nice David Luiz now

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.210 
history of fee for a nice David Luiz now
he's<00:01:18.299> got<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> PhD<00:01:18.990> card<00:01:19.530> or<00:01:19.650> his<00:01:19.770> card<00:01:20.040> make

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
he's got a PhD card or his card make

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.280 
he's got a PhD card or his card make
sure<00:01:20.369> will<00:01:20.520> be<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> psg<00:01:21.000> therefore<00:01:21.930> he'll<00:01:22.110> get

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
sure will be a psg therefore he'll get

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.289 
sure will be a psg therefore he'll get
the<00:01:22.409> triple<00:01:22.650> link<00:01:22.979> with<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.729> Thiago<00:01:24.270> Silva

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
now I think he'll be about 10k on the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.020 
now I think he'll be about 10k on the
web<00:01:27.420> app<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> first<00:01:28.439> day<00:01:28.799> maybe<00:01:29.790> even

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
web app and on the first day maybe even

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.719

a<00:01:51.840> really<00:01:52.350> really<00:01:52.530> weird<00:01:53.040> one<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.579> fifa<00:01:54.030> 13<00:01:54.060> i

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
a really really weird one on fifa 13 i

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.800 
a really really weird one on fifa 13 i
think<00:01:55.740> on<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.950> web<00:01:56.130> app<00:01:56.280> /<00:01:57.090> release<00:01:57.479> he<00:01:57.659> was

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
think on the web app / release he was

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.889 
think on the web app / release he was
about<00:01:58.020> 10k<00:01:58.649> now<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.250> them<00:01:59.399> i<00:01:59.700> think<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.689> couple

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
about 10k now of them i think a couple

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.149 
about 10k now of them i think a couple
of<00:02:01.079> days<00:02:01.170> off<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.500> game<00:02:01.680> was<00:02:01.799> released<00:02:01.829> he

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
of days off the game was released he

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.660 
of days off the game was released he
shot<00:02:02.520> up<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.869> 40,000<00:02:03.869> coins<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.380> i<00:02:05.130> invested

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
shot up to 40,000 coins and i invested

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.910 
shot up to 40,000 coins and i invested
in<00:02:05.759> quite<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:05.969> few<00:02:06.030> on<00:02:06.780> fifa<00:02:07.140> 14<00:02:07.350> at<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.560> stocks

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
in quite a few on fifa 14 at the stocks

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.229 
in quite a few on fifa 14 at the stocks
i<00:02:08.099> thought<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.399> same<00:02:08.580> was<00:02:08.759> going<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:08.940> happen

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
i thought the same was going to happen

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.199 
i thought the same was going to happen
there's<00:02:09.869> going<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.050> be<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.140> 40k<00:02:10.679> left-back<00:02:11.220> but

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
there's going to be a 40k left-back but

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.340 
there's going to be a 40k left-back but
obviously<00:02:12.480> he<00:02:12.750> was<00:02:12.870> not

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
obviously he was not

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.660 
obviously he was not
at<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.740> most<00:02:13.980> upset<00:02:14.460> I'd<00:02:15.000> say<00:02:16.070> 15k<00:02:17.070> but

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
at the most upset I'd say 15k but

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.510 
at the most upset I'd say 15k but
hopefully<00:02:18.630> I<00:02:18.660> wish<00:02:19.020> or<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.560> wish<00:02:19.830> default<00:02:20.280> gold

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
hopefully I wish or I wish default gold

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.370 
hopefully I wish or I wish default gold
cards<00:02:20.910> are<00:02:21.300> gonna<00:02:21.510> be<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.720> lot<00:02:21.930> more<00:02:21.990> this<00:02:22.320> year

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
cards are gonna be a lot more this year

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.810 
cards are gonna be a lot more this year
which<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.710> why<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.190> think<00:02:23.550> it's<00:02:23.640> gonna<00:02:23.730> be

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
which is why I think it's gonna be

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.960 
which is why I think it's gonna be
around<00:02:24.060> 5k<00:02:24.390> 26<00:02:25.140> k<00:02:25.380> on<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.650> web<00:02:26.220> app<00:02:26.370> /<00:02:26.670> released

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
around 5k 26 k on the web app / released

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.440 
around 5k 26 k on the web app / released
and<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.180> think<00:02:27.420> he'll<00:02:27.570> go<00:02:27.810> above<00:02:28.710> 15k<00:02:29.430> on<00:02:29.700> after

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
and I think he'll go above 15k on after

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.310 
and I think he'll go above 15k on after
release<00:02:30.690> which<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:30.960> think<00:02:31.140> will<00:02:31.200> be<00:02:31.290> really

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
release which I think will be really

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.950 
release which I think will be really
cool<00:02:31.680> because<00:02:32.670> remember<00:02:32.910> on<00:02:33.150> fifa<00:02:33.420> 13<00:02:33.450> when

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.180 
doesn't have those high high work rates
this<00:03:03.600> year<00:03:03.660> I<00:03:04.050> could<00:03:04.470> definitely<00:03:04.650> see<00:03:04.890> him

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
this year I could definitely see him

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.760 
this year I could definitely see him
being<00:03:05.610> around<00:03:05.820> 35<00:03:06.570> k<00:03:06.870> after<00:03:07.110> release<00:03:07.590> because

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
being around 35 k after release because

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:08.900 
being around 35 k after release because
he'll<00:03:08.010> be<00:03:08.100> such<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.340> good<00:03:08.520> player<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:08.790> it's

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
he'll be such a good player and it's

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.090 
he'll be such a good player and it's
probably<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.660> best<00:03:09.690> strike<00:03:10.260> in<00:03:10.470> Syria<00:03:10.860> now

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
probably the best strike in Syria now

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.740 
probably the best strike in Syria now
