00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.120 
like it at macro is because when you
don't<00:03:18.570> have<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.780> way<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:19.410> get<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.740> survivor

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
don't have a way to get to survivor

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.700 
don't have a way to get to survivor
macro<00:03:20.820> to<00:03:21.360> get<00:03:21.600> a<00:03:21.630> little<00:03:21.870> dicey<00:03:22.140> you<00:03:22.380> can<00:03:22.530> feel

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
macro to get a little dicey you can feel

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.140 
macro to get a little dicey you can feel
like<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:22.980> decks<00:03:23.220> kind<00:03:23.460> of<00:03:23.550> falling<00:03:23.790> apart<00:03:24.060> but

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
like the decks kind of falling apart but

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.270 
like the decks kind of falling apart but
if<00:03:24.270> you<00:03:24.390> have<00:03:24.630> this<00:03:24.810> card<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:25.410> stop<00:03:26.100> those

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
if you have this card to stop those

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.430 
if you have this card to stop those
opening<00:03:26.850> you<00:03:27.000> know<00:03:27.090> strato<00:03:27.540> sand<00:03:28.170> saber

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
opening you know strato sand saber

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.380 
opening you know strato sand saber
swords<00:03:28.950> attacks<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.430> stuff<00:03:29.550> like<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:29.760> that

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
swords attacks and stuff like that that

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.090 
swords attacks and stuff like that that
can<00:03:30.420> at<00:03:30.660> least<00:03:30.810> sit<00:03:31.080> on<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.380> field<00:03:31.620> install

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
can at least sit on the field install

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.040 
can at least sit on the field install
for<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.400> couple<00:03:32.700> of<00:03:32.790> turns<00:03:33.030> then<00:03:33.630> you're<00:03:33.840> buying

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
for a couple of turns then you're buying

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.780 
for a couple of turns then you're buying
yourself<00:03:34.260> more<00:03:34.530> time<00:03:34.680> it's<00:03:34.860> like<00:03:34.920> even<00:03:35.670> though

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
yourself more time it's like even though

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.670 
yourself more time it's like even though
this<00:03:35.970> car<00:03:36.210> transitions<00:03:36.870> defense<00:03:37.350> too<00:03:37.500> often

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
this car transitions defense too often

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.800 
this car transitions defense too often
so<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.040> don't<00:03:38.310> have<00:03:38.550> to<00:03:38.820> instantly<00:03:39.420> exceed

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
so you don't have to instantly exceed

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.930 
so you don't have to instantly exceed
like<00:03:39.930> you<00:03:40.050> can<00:03:40.200> just<00:03:40.230> sit<00:03:40.620> on<00:03:40.740> this<00:03:40.890> and<00:03:41.130> no<00:03:41.670> I

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
like you can just sit on this and no I

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.030 
like you can just sit on this and no I
mean<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.420> probably<00:03:42.810> have<00:03:43.170> a<00:03:43.200> couple<00:03:43.530> of<00:03:43.620> turns<00:03:43.830> I

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
mean I probably have a couple of turns I

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.610 
mean I probably have a couple of turns I
actually<00:03:44.970> really<00:03:45.540> like<00:03:45.720> this<00:03:45.870> card<00:03:46.140> in<00:03:46.320> chaos

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
actually really like this card in chaos

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.440 
actually really like this card in chaos
dragons<00:03:47.070> and<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.640> reason<00:03:47.970> I<00:03:48.060> like<00:03:48.240> it<00:03:48.270> is

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
dragons and the reason I like it is

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.390 
dragons and the reason I like it is
because<00:03:48.510> when<00:03:49.260> you<00:03:49.380> set<00:03:49.620> in<00:03:49.710> chaos<00:03:49.980> dragons

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
because when you set in chaos dragons

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.400 
because when you set in chaos dragons
ninety<00:03:51.150> percent<00:03:51.270> of<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.630> time<00:03:51.810> I'm<00:03:52.020> gonna<00:03:52.170> put

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
ninety percent of the time I'm gonna put

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.990 
ninety percent of the time I'm gonna put
you<00:03:52.440> on<00:03:52.560> right<00:03:52.860> go<00:03:53.070> I<00:03:53.100> mean<00:03:53.310> what<00:03:53.610> else<00:03:53.640> can<00:03:53.940> you

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
you on right go I mean what else can you

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.670 
you on right go I mean what else can you
possibly<00:03:54.390> set<00:03:54.690> in<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.810> deck<00:03:54.990> like<00:03:55.200> saying<00:03:55.530> in

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
possibly set in the deck like saying in

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.000 
possibly set in the deck like saying in
maybe<00:03:55.890> you<00:03:56.520> know<00:03:56.640> if<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.300> set<00:03:57.600> this<00:03:58.010> chances

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
maybe you know if you set this chances

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.650 
maybe you know if you set this chances
are<00:03:59.160> you<00:03:59.460> know<00:03:59.580> i'm<00:03:59.790> gonna<00:04:00.030> summon<00:04:00.300> something

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
are you know i'm gonna summon something

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.840 
are you know i'm gonna summon something
that<00:04:01.170> i<00:04:01.200> want<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.710> die<00:04:01.950> like<00:04:01.980> I<00:04:02.250> say<00:04:02.520> again<00:04:02.580> or

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
that i want to die like I say again or

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.790 
that i want to die like I say again or
something<00:04:03.000> run<00:04:03.750> into<00:04:04.080> it<00:04:04.230> and<00:04:04.380> then<00:04:04.560> it's<00:04:04.710> like

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
something run into it and then it's like

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.160 
something run into it and then it's like
oh<00:04:05.190> wait<00:04:05.790> you<00:04:06.090> know<00:04:06.210> it<00:04:06.390> wasn't<00:04:06.570> it<00:04:06.960> wasn't

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
oh wait you know it wasn't it wasn't

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.770 
oh wait you know it wasn't it wasn't
saying<00:04:07.500> in<00:04:07.740> it<00:04:07.890> was<00:04:08.010> a<00:04:08.040> DK<00:04:08.400> it<00:04:09.240> was<00:04:09.390> a<00:04:09.420> decays<00:04:09.750> by

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
saying in it was a DK it was a decays by

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.660 
saying in it was a DK it was a decays by
and<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.440> reason<00:04:10.740> that<00:04:10.770> it<00:04:10.980> works<00:04:11.160> well<00:04:11.460> in

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
and the reason that it works well in

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.310 
and the reason that it works well in
chaos<00:04:11.940> dragons<00:04:12.330> is<00:04:12.450> not<00:04:12.870> only<00:04:13.050> does<00:04:13.260> it

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
chaos dragons is not only does it

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.960 
chaos dragons is not only does it
actually<00:04:13.590> give<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.040> deck<00:04:14.190> solid<00:04:14.610> defense

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
actually give the deck solid defense

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.560 
actually give the deck solid defense
which<00:04:15.210> it<00:04:15.360> basically<00:04:16.170> has<00:04:16.440> never<00:04:16.739> had<00:04:17.010> but<00:04:17.609> you

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
which it basically has never had but you

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.060 
which it basically has never had but you
have<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:18.750> surprise<00:04:19.230> element<00:04:19.410> and<00:04:19.799> it<00:04:19.890> works

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
have the surprise element and it works

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.890 
have the surprise element and it works
perfectly<00:04:20.340> with<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:21.000> whole<00:04:21.180> chaos<00:04:21.420> engine<00:04:21.720> I

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
perfectly with the whole chaos engine I

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.480 
perfectly with the whole chaos engine I
mean<00:04:22.020> you<00:04:22.200> just<00:04:22.230> randomly<00:04:22.590> throw<00:04:22.980> three<00:04:23.250> spies

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
mean you just randomly throw three spies

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.190 
mean you just randomly throw three spies
in<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:23.730> deck<00:04:23.970> and<00:04:24.180> you're<00:04:24.870> pretty<00:04:25.110> much

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
in the deck and you're pretty much

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.630 
in the deck and you're pretty much
covered<00:04:25.800> like<00:04:25.950> you<00:04:26.100> don't<00:04:26.250> really<00:04:26.370> lose

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
covered like you don't really lose

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.430 
covered like you don't really lose
anything<00:04:26.700> but<00:04:27.600> it<00:04:27.690> also<00:04:27.870> gives<00:04:28.200> you<00:04:28.320> the

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
anything but it also gives you the

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.380 
anything but it also gives you the
ability<00:04:28.530> to<00:04:28.950> exceed<00:04:29.670> in<00:04:29.790> to<00:04:29.940> rank<00:04:30.120> for<00:04:30.180> us

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
ability to exceed in to rank for us

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.050 
ability to exceed in to rank for us
because<00:04:30.890> Kerrigan's<00:04:31.890> has<00:04:32.190> a<00:04:32.220> really

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
because Kerrigan's has a really

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.360 
because Kerrigan's has a really
time<00:04:33.540> doing<00:04:33.960> that<00:04:34.110> I<00:04:34.169> mean<00:04:34.380> they<00:04:34.560> don't<00:04:35.010> run

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
time doing that I mean they don't run

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.159 
time doing that I mean they don't run
outside<00:04:36.090> of<00:04:36.240> equip<00:04:36.510> swagger<00:04:36.750> and<00:04:36.930> you've<00:04:37.050> got

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
outside of equip swagger and you've got

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:38.390 
outside of equip swagger and you've got
like<00:04:37.380> a<00:04:37.410> while<00:04:37.650> and<00:04:37.889> that's<00:04:38.040> pretty<00:04:38.160> much<00:04:38.280> it

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
like a while and that's pretty much it

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.460 
like a while and that's pretty much it
the<00:04:39.000> last<00:04:39.210> thing<00:04:39.389> I<00:04:39.540> really<00:04:39.840> like<00:04:39.990> it<00:04:40.169> in<00:04:40.260> is

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
the last thing I really like it in is

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.129 
the last thing I really like it in is
plants<00:04:40.950> and<00:04:41.630> pretty<00:04:42.630> much<00:04:42.660> for<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:42.990> same

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
plants and pretty much for the same

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.080 
plants and pretty much for the same
reason<00:04:43.169> you<00:04:43.680> know<00:04:43.800> plant<00:04:44.160> those<00:04:44.490> plants<00:04:44.760> don't

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
reason you know plant those plants don't

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.360 
reason you know plant those plants don't
run<00:04:45.419> a<00:04:45.720> lot<00:04:45.990> of<00:04:46.320> good<00:04:46.530> defense<00:04:46.889> monsters<00:04:47.340> I

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
run a lot of good defense monsters I
