interviewed some gamers and decided that

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.560 
interviewed some gamers and decided that
gamers<00:01:26.280> don't<00:01:26.430> like<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.759> when<00:01:26.880> they<00:01:26.970> lag<00:01:27.180> which

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
gamers don't like it when they lag which

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.810 
gamers don't like it when they lag which
is<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:28.350> guess<00:01:28.619> anyone<00:01:29.310> could<00:01:29.460> have<00:01:29.549> told<00:01:29.670> them

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
is I guess anyone could have told them

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.219 
is I guess anyone could have told them
that<00:01:29.939> but<00:01:30.090> they<00:01:30.630> interviewed<00:01:30.900> some<00:01:31.049> gamers

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
that but they interviewed some gamers

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.380 
that but they interviewed some gamers
they<00:01:31.829> support<00:01:32.400> team<00:01:32.579> complexity<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.299> they

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
they support team complexity so they

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.760 
they support team complexity so they
probably<00:01:33.630> interviewed<00:01:33.960> them<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.290> they

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
probably interviewed them and they

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.929 
probably interviewed them and they
decided<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.310> might<00:01:35.400> be<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.549> good<00:01:35.579> idea<00:01:35.729> to

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
decided that it might be a good idea to

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.670 
decided that it might be a good idea to

they've done here is they put five
Thunderbolt<00:06:17.050> drives<00:06:17.800> in<00:06:18.130> here<00:06:18.400> and<00:06:18.610> hooked<00:06:19.000> up

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
Thunderbolt drives in here and hooked up

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.180 
Thunderbolt drives in here and hooked up
a<00:06:19.210> thunderbolt<00:06:19.690> monitor<00:06:20.169> all<00:06:20.560> these<00:06:20.979> are

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
a thunderbolt monitor all these are

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.469 
a thunderbolt monitor all these are
linking<00:06:21.550> together<00:06:21.729> you<00:06:21.970> see<00:06:22.090> all<00:06:22.180> the<00:06:22.270> crazy

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 
linking together you see all the crazy

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:24.029 
linking together you see all the crazy
cables<00:06:23.080> hopefully<00:06:23.409> if<00:06:23.590> you're<00:06:23.740> going<00:06:23.860> to<00:06:23.919> do

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039 
cables hopefully if you're going to do

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:25.260 
cables hopefully if you're going to do
something<00:06:24.220> like<00:06:24.370> this<00:06:24.520> you<00:06:24.669> can<00:06:24.760> get<00:06:24.880> shorter

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
something like this you can get shorter

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.360 
something like this you can get shorter
cables<00:06:25.630> because<00:06:25.780> that's<00:06:25.990> just<00:06:26.169> nuts<00:06:26.620> and<00:06:26.919> the

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
cables because that's just nuts and the

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.969 
cables because that's just nuts and the
cable<00:06:28.060> management<00:06:28.240> enthusiast<00:06:28.990> in<00:06:29.139> me<00:06:29.470> just

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:29.979 
cable management enthusiast in me just

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:31.770 
cable management enthusiast in me just
cries<00:06:30.430> when<00:06:30.880> he<00:06:31.000> sees<00:06:31.180> this<00:06:31.300> although<00:06:31.630> the

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780 
cries when he sees this although the

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.300 
cries when he sees this although the
loops<00:06:31.960> are<00:06:32.169> quite<00:06:32.440> nice<00:06:32.620> I<00:06:32.830> would<00:06:33.130> like

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
loops are quite nice I would like

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.950 
loops are quite nice I would like
shorter<00:06:33.700> cables<00:06:34.000> and<00:06:34.090> tie<00:06:34.210> down<00:06:34.419> anyways<00:06:34.779> it

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
shorter cables and tie down anyways it

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.010 
shorter cables and tie down anyways it
goes<00:06:35.289> out<00:06:35.500> the<00:06:35.680> back

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.020 
goes out the back

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.200 
goes out the back
here<00:06:36.169> plugged<00:06:36.680> into<00:06:36.860> this<00:06:37.160> machine<00:06:37.400> and<00:06:37.849> then

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 
here plugged into this machine and then

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.270 
here plugged into this machine and then
this<00:06:38.360> machine<00:06:38.780> is<00:06:38.960> reporting<00:06:39.800> and<00:06:39.949> showing

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 
this machine is reporting and showing

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.920 
this machine is reporting and showing
how<00:06:40.460> fast<00:06:40.729> the<00:06:40.910> transfer<00:06:41.270> speeds<00:06:41.509> are<00:06:41.629> going

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930 
how fast the transfer speeds are going

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.499 
how fast the transfer speeds are going
now<00:06:42.710> I<00:06:42.740> asked<00:06:43.430> them<00:06:43.580> which<00:06:43.940> drive<00:06:44.270> they're

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:44.509 
now I asked them which drive they're

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:47.110 
now I asked them which drive they're
actually<00:06:44.810> reporting<00:06:45.199> this<00:06:45.289> from<00:06:45.560> and<00:06:46.120> they

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 
actually reporting this from and they

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.270 
actually reporting this from and they
did<00:06:47.419> not<00:06:47.599> tell<00:06:47.960> me<00:06:47.990> but<00:06:48.379> it's<00:06:48.530> I<00:06:48.710> ohmmeter<00:06:49.009> so

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 
did not tell me but it's I ohmmeter so

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.890 
did not tell me but it's I ohmmeter so
i'm<00:06:49.370> assuming<00:06:49.490> it's<00:06:49.759> an<00:06:49.909> overall<00:06:50.330> that<00:06:50.810> i'm

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:50.900 
i'm assuming it's an overall that i'm

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:51.850 
i'm assuming it's an overall that i'm
not<00:06:51.020> sure<00:06:51.169> if<00:06:51.259> they're<00:06:51.379> transferring<00:06:51.710> data

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
not sure if they're transferring data

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.230 
not sure if they're transferring data
are<00:06:52.069> doing<00:06:52.250> anything<00:06:52.430> interesting<00:06:52.669> like<00:06:53.030> that

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 
are doing anything interesting like that

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.119 
are doing anything interesting like that
but<00:06:53.810> this<00:06:54.050> just<00:06:54.229> goes<00:06:54.440> to<00:06:54.470> show<00:06:54.590> what<00:06:54.949> you<00:06:55.099> can

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:55.129 
but this just goes to show what you can

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:57.189 
but this just goes to show what you can
actually<00:06:55.340> do<00:06:55.669> with<00:06:55.879> Thunderbolt<00:06:56.449> it's<00:06:56.780> one

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 
actually do with Thunderbolt it's one

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:59.439 
actually do with Thunderbolt it's one
plug<00:06:57.500> in<00:06:57.710> and<00:06:57.949> you're<00:06:58.310> plugging<00:06:58.520> all<00:06:58.849> this

00:06:59.439 --> 00:06:59.449 
plug in and you're plugging all this

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:01.149
