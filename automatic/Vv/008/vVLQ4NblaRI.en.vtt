show you today is kind of an advancement

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.470 
show you today is kind of an advancement
on<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.340> auto<00:00:26.580> loop<00:00:27.029> which<00:00:27.180> I've<00:00:27.330> already

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
on the auto loop which I've already

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.659 
on the auto loop which I've already
shown<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.869> where<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.740> when<00:00:29.070> you've<00:00:29.220> got<00:00:29.399> the

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:29.669 
shown you where is when you've got the

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:31.790 
shown you where is when you've got the
buttons<00:00:30.300> lit<00:00:30.540> up<00:00:30.660> normally<00:00:31.200> it's<00:00:31.590> going<00:00:31.739> to

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
buttons lit up normally it's going to

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.460 
buttons lit up normally it's going to
take<00:00:31.980> eight<00:00:32.189> beats<00:00:32.550> four<00:00:33.540> beats<00:00:33.780> two<00:00:34.230> beats

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
take eight beats four beats two beats

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.500 
take eight beats four beats two beats
and<00:00:34.710> one<00:00:34.890> beats<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.370> loop<00:00:35.579> if<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.270> hit<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
and one beats in the loop if you hit the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.299 
and one beats in the loop if you hit the
beat<00:00:36.690> select<00:00:37.050> button<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.739> can<00:00:37.829> go<00:00:37.980> down<00:00:38.160> to

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
beat select button you can go down to

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.740 
beat select button you can go down to
the<00:00:38.340> really<00:00:38.610> short<00:00:38.850> measures<00:00:39.270> where<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.540> can

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
the really short measures where you can

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.540 
the really short measures where you can
create<00:00:39.899> like<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> snare<00:00:40.649> roll<00:00:40.860> effect<00:00:41.219> which<00:00:41.399> is

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
create like a snare roll effect which is

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.459 
create like a snare roll effect which is
pretty<00:00:41.700> cool<00:00:42.000> what<00:00:42.629> my<00:00:42.809> favorite<00:00:43.260> feature

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
pretty cool what my favorite feature

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.500 
pretty cool what my favorite feature
about<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.010> auto<00:00:44.219> loop<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.850> if<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.090> hold<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
about the auto loop is if you hold the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.450 
about the auto loop is if you hold the
beat<00:00:45.660> select<00:00:46.050> button<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.710> jumps<00:00:47.040> over<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.370> this

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
beat select button it jumps over to this

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.400 
beat select button it jumps over to this
right<00:00:47.730> hand<00:00:48.000> column<00:00:48.180> where<00:00:48.900> you<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.110> see<00:00:49.290> that

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
right hand column where you can see that

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.050 
right hand column where you can see that
you've<00:00:49.500> got<00:00:49.680> your<00:00:49.950> half<00:00:50.160> measures<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.910> your

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
you've got your half measures and your

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.700 
you've got your half measures and your
quarter<00:00:51.420> measures<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.930> beat<00:00:52.140> but<00:00:52.590> in

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
quarter measures of a beat but in

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.340 
quarter measures of a beat but in
between<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.340> you've<00:00:53.670> got<00:00:53.910> thirds<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.780> three

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
between it you've got thirds and three

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.110 
between it you've got thirds and three
quarters<00:00:55.770> which<00:00:56.070> many<00:00:56.340> producers<00:00:56.640> all<00:00:56.970> know

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
quarters which many producers all know

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.060 
quarters which many producers all know
as<00:00:57.240> triplets<00:00:57.750> which<00:00:58.290> is<00:00:58.440> really<00:00:58.650> cool<00:00:58.890> when

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
as triplets which is really cool when

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.400 
as triplets which is really cool when
you<00:00:59.160> take<00:00:59.400> in<00:00:59.579> loops<00:00:59.850> with<00:01:00.450> a<00:01:00.480> slip<00:01:00.810> feature<00:01:01.079> on

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
you take in loops with a slip feature on

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.780 
you take in loops with a slip feature on
because<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.770> can<00:01:01.890> really<00:01:02.040> mix<00:01:02.310> up<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.579> groove

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
because you can really mix up the groove

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.009 
because you can really mix up the groove
of<00:01:02.880> the<00:01:02.940> record<00:01:03.329> I'm<00:01:03.540> just<00:01:03.690> going<00:01:03.810> to<00:01:03.840> give<00:01:03.960> you

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
of the record I'm just going to give you

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:25.520 
of the record I'm just going to give you
a<00:01:04.049> little<00:01:04.110> demonstration

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.200 

so<00:01:26.530> that's<00:01:26.680> the<00:01:26.799> auto<00:01:27.009> loop<00:01:27.369> feature<00:01:27.640> using

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
so that's the auto loop feature using

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.880 
so that's the auto loop feature using
triplets<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.750> that's<00:01:31.930> using<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.350> triplet

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
triplets so that's using the triplet

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.680 
triplets so that's using the triplet
timing<00:01:33.430> of<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.759> loop<00:01:33.970> on<00:01:34.210> a<00:01:34.299> track<00:01:34.659> that's

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
timing of the loop on a track that's

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.660 
timing of the loop on a track that's
written<00:01:35.080> in<00:01:35.259> straight<00:01:35.619> for<00:01:35.920> for<00:01:36.190> musical

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
written in straight for for musical

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.430 
written in straight for for musical
timing<00:01:37.090> another<00:01:37.720> thing<00:01:37.930> that<00:01:37.960> I<00:01:38.110> found<00:01:38.290> really

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
timing another thing that I found really

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.320 
timing another thing that I found really
cool<00:01:38.830> is<00:01:39.100> if<00:01:39.310> you<00:01:39.460> actually<00:01:39.580> get<00:01:39.970> a<00:01:40.000> track

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
cool is if you actually get a track

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.270 
cool is if you actually get a track
that's<00:01:40.360> written<00:01:40.720> in<00:01:40.899> triplets<00:01:41.440> I<00:01:41.649> found<00:01:42.130> this

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
that's written in triplets I found this

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.889 
that's written in triplets I found this
in<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.490> past<00:01:42.700> that<00:01:42.880> if<00:01:43.000> you<00:01:43.090> take<00:01:43.299> a<00:01:43.330> standard

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
in the past that if you take a standard

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:45.719 
in the past that if you take a standard
loop<00:01:44.140> it<00:01:44.530> can<00:01:44.770> ruin<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:45.340> groove<00:01:45.549> of<00:01:45.670> the

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
loop it can ruin the groove of the

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:46.800 
loop it can ruin the groove of the
record<00:01:46.090> almost<00:01:46.270> I'll<00:01:46.570> give<00:01:46.690> you<00:01:46.780> a

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
record almost I'll give you a

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.539 
record almost I'll give you a
demonstration<00:01:46.990> of<00:01:47.560> how<00:01:48.009> I've<00:01:48.159> been<00:01:48.280> doing

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
demonstration of how I've been doing

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:56.590 
demonstration of how I've been doing
things<00:01:48.759> in<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:48.970> past

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.600 

as<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.900> can<00:01:57.990> see<00:01:58.170> there<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.500> almost<00:01:58.799> ruins<00:01:59.430> the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
as you can see there it almost ruins the

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.609 
as you can see there it almost ruins the
groove<00:01:59.850> a<00:02:00.000> little<00:02:00.030> bit<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.810> record<00:02:01.229> as<00:02:01.439> its

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
groove a little bit of the record as its

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.620 
groove a little bit of the record as its
kind<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:02.009> changing<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.880> time<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.210> back<00:02:03.360> as<00:02:03.509> its

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
kind of changing the time in back as its

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.179 
kind of changing the time in back as its
supposed<00:02:03.720> to<00:02:04.080> have<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.320> swing<00:02:04.560> in<00:02:04.740> triplets

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
supposed to have the swing in triplets

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.010 
supposed to have the swing in triplets
so<00:02:05.759> when<00:02:05.909> you've<00:02:06.030> got<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.180> triplets<00:02:06.659> effect

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
so when you've got the triplets effect

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.169 
so when you've got the triplets effect
that<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.470> can<00:02:07.649> actually<00:02:07.860> use<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.789> can<00:02:08.940> really

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
that you can actually use you can really

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.790 
that you can actually use you can really
create<00:02:09.479> some<00:02:09.660> interest<00:02:09.989> in<00:02:10.110> phils<00:02:10.380> so<00:02:10.709> I'll

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
create some interest in phils so I'll

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.020 
create some interest in phils so I'll
give<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.009> demonstration<00:02:11.190> about<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.819> should

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
give you a demonstration about it should

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.160 
give you a demonstration about it should
be<00:02:12.120> done<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.420> how<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.569> can<00:02:12.750> do<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:12.989> with<00:02:13.080> the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
be done and how you can do it with the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:32.460 
be done and how you can do it with the
new<00:02:13.290> triplet<00:02:13.650> timing<00:02:13.980> on<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.160> 900

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.290 

so<00:02:33.470> that's<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.740> auto<00:02:33.950> loop<00:02:34.340> feature<00:02:34.670> using

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
so that's the auto loop feature using

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:47.309 
so that's the auto loop feature using
triplet<00:02:35.720> musical<00:02:36.170> timing

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319
