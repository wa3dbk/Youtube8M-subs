00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
struggling I understand I think that

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.400 
struggling I understand I think that
consistency<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.090> key<00:00:39.450> but<00:00:39.780> going<00:00:39.989> outside

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
consistency is the key but going outside

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.889 
consistency is the key but going outside
is<00:00:40.620> not<00:00:40.770> always<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.460> best<00:00:41.579> way<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:42.239> fact<00:00:42.690> most

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
is not always the best way in fact most

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.569 
is not always the best way in fact most
veterinarians<00:00:43.440> will<00:00:43.800> tell<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.309> keep<00:00:44.460> your

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
veterinarians will tell you to keep your

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.610 
veterinarians will tell you to keep your
puppy<00:00:44.879> away<00:00:45.120> from<00:00:45.450> areas<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.960> adult<00:00:46.320> dogs

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
puppy away from areas that adult dogs

use until they're fully vaccinated

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.260 
use until they're fully vaccinated
