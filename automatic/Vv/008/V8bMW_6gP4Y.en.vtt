00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.670
 its time won't 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.620
 Hello everyone, Zach, and today, a couple 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.050
 episodes that literally happened 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.510
 successively my games in 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.340
 In both cases, I took a physics mat using 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.010
 just the predictability of enemy players 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.869
 and in one game the player of silver was mistaken 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.550
 in the second player with daimon that is given 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.050
 the topic is relevant to any silt and you 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.390
 can use it in your games 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.910
 as you can see in this episode, I start 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.370
 blue buff however will cause starts 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.430
 right on handing me a red owl and 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.550
 we did a much stronger sex than 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.970
 and when I still cleaned my women 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:50.320
 just this puzzle he is already moving 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.650
 the top of the jungle I looked at 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.380
 this 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.390
 where did ladiana come from i looked where 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.370
 with what delay the enemy 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.770
 bot line I mean, I made sure that jarvan 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.630
 exactly started its red buff and in 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.530
 principle was ready to meet us fat 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:07.390
 on top, of course, I never expected that 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.939
 he gets to my place so fast 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.430
 red buff here i will see that he has 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.590
 for usa flag and calmly with his young auto attack 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.909
 here I flush him 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.289
 flash in stock here you do 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.060
 stupid enough thing that is he hears 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.340
 in a straight line though I could just torture chambers 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.829
 heard I would never catch up with him 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.570
 plus he doesn't slow me down in any way 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:27.460
 auto attack though principle can he have 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.189
 also red buff but he doesn't use it 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.829
 okay thanks to his okushka eshka he 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:35.039
 as if saved we accompany him to 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.420
 the tower itself is lit up here 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.819
 we melt what we exactly leave we do and 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.789
 that we leave but we naturally go nowhere 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:44.770
 99 percent of the players do not go away 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.409
 such situations that made the right 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.740
 there they will go in parma to make money they 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.960
 will go 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.639
 wolves pride of golems here everything is 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.469
 here I will live the other side 

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:56.049
 what I did not see on the map 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:57.520
 I am but at that moment it was dangerous all 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.229
 here I look slows these out 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.819
 red buff jarvan I'm not slow 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.249
 Yamada tired all this first book 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.479
 do not repeat in your games such 

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:06.819
 such errors that is 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.649
 go at least there if you really go to farm 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:11.370
 they are about 1000 go to the right of 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.100
 it will be much safer 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.290
 second second game second episode here 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.960
 they make me much more chic 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.460
 pool plus vs me here pantheon 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.690
 jungle which is slow enough 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:28.990
 honor jungle comparison with the same jax 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.820
 see i already ran the top of it 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.400
 just the pub it fits its sitting 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.860
 here I am also convinced with what delay 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.060
 where did the enemy bot line tus come from 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.620
 I was 100% sure that pantheon 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.470
 begins its blue buff 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.060
 plus i know i will take my blue 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.950
 faster than you can pick up your red 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.650
 so after my blue I'll go to 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.570
 enemy red buff however here 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.550
 pantheon there all deceived that is he 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.140
 took lessons in the right of why it is not clear 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.340
 he will not get the third level 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.870
 matching when approaching your 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.220
 i will have 3 red 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.290
 he will only have a second level 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.220
 level 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.590
 Well, naturally I will be enough 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.240
 just make him dilute as 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.160
 Naturally he did not pump in the second 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.450
 level I will, that is, he shook his spear and 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:16.630
 and at the eshku here I give him with auto attacks and 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.820
 knocking down his shield plus a thousand auto attack 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.280
 his tower if some garbage creates 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.290
 and actually I am itching for her 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.180
 flash but although it was already absolutely 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.090
 extra step just could not soberly assess 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.360
 bombs caught fire red with korean here 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.780
 i climb on as a reward his red 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.850
 buff and I'm not going anywhere with reddish I 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.470
 I will stand and wait for him here again 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.440
 in 99 percent of cases 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:45.780
 players will come and check if I took it exactly 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:48.310
 what if he didnâ€™t take him away 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.930
 I'm missing here in advance to give him a couple 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.050
 auto attack in the back sit at dawn 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.250
 autoattacks using landmarks give it a mill 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.750
 slowing it down with a red buff but all 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.380
 completely he doesn't have to leave 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.810
 two kilos 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.580
 I completely broke my game and completely 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.860
 made a game for yourself use 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.510
 similar elements of your games you were 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.510
 take a taxi to good luck in Solok
