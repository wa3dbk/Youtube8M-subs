kind of everything I never want to be

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.730 
kind of everything I never want to be
what<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.840> biggest<00:01:25.049> problem<00:01:25.500> facing

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
what is the biggest problem facing

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.370 
what is the biggest problem facing
female<00:01:26.460> content<00:01:26.909> creators<00:01:27.000> today<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.020> any

female content creators today and any

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.050 
female content creators today and any
solutions<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.189> just<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.610> think<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:29.909> harassment

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
solutions I just I think it's harassment

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.120 
solutions I just I think it's harassment
and<00:01:30.570> perhaps<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.990> lack<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.200> online<00:01:31.680> structure

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
and perhaps a lack of online structure

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.710 
and perhaps a lack of online structure
to<00:01:32.250> deal<00:01:32.400> with<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.579> harassment<00:01:32.880> because<00:01:33.240> you

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
to deal with the harassment because you

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.179 
to deal with the harassment because you
can't<00:01:33.960> release<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.259> internet<00:01:34.770> at<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.009> same

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
can't release the internet at the same

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.710 
can't release the internet at the same
time<00:01:35.369> there<00:01:35.610> needs<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.909> be<00:01:35.939> more<00:01:36.060> safety<00:01:36.479> in

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
time there needs to be more safety in

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.359 
time there needs to be more safety in
place<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.200> whatever<00:01:37.770> size<00:01:38.040> needs<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.310> be

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
place and whatever size needs to be

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.590 
place and whatever size needs to be
placed<00:01:38.610> on<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.030> rather<00:01:39.270> than<00:01:39.390> necessarily

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
placed on that rather than necessarily

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.359 
placed on that rather than necessarily
the<00:01:40.170> freedom<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.560> speech<00:01:40.829> side<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.220> things

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
the freedom of speech side of things

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.830 
the freedom of speech side of things
which<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.700> think<00:01:41.909> generally<00:01:42.509> tends<00:01:42.720> to

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
which I think generally tends to

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.300 
which I think generally tends to
dominate<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.290> conversation<00:01:43.979> more

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
dominate that conversation more

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.830 
dominate that conversation more
structure<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.970> more<00:01:45.119> awareness<00:01:45.390> about<00:01:45.689> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
structure and more awareness about the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.359 
structure and more awareness about the
structure<00:01:46.110> once<00:01:46.380> that's<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.770> place<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.220> have

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
structure once that's in place I have

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.770 
structure once that's in place I have
written<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.670> post<00:01:47.850> on<00:01:48.030> tumblr<00:01:48.210> about<00:01:48.540> safety

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
written a post on tumblr about safety

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.950
