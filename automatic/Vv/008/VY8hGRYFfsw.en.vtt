 we can zoom the camera down like this 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.239
 here and also we can rotate it like this 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.309

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.820
 and in this mission we need to win here 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.100
 these aliens here we can 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.739
 we can do 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.469
 such a move on our player 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.500
 there are stages and we are in any part of the screen 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:09.360
 eg click here and so like this 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.460
 here we do not go our players so 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.170
 let's let's here is what my 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.820
 this players went and we can and 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.580
 move to any point click 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.650
 push the boom and our character moves 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.759
 limited number of moves we can 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.460
 make it mean 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.670
 can also of course our enemies and 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.220
 shoot here then as if we started 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.740
 on the sheet then that's a sign of the aliens 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.900
 move some not 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.560
 additional properties make friend 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:44.250
 friend blue or something goes about trying 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.329
 run away from us here it is this aliens 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:52.200
 let's try to get such topics 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.659
 time with us he is trying to somehow get 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.479
 let's choose our player we also 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.600
 we can use grenades and various 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.670
 special features and capabilities 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.270
 let's try to shoot him 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.910
 let's move mov also here can 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.410
 choose unless we press the sight 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.379
 try to shoot click accept and 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.620
 we shoot 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:19.170
 well we twice put enough between 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.420
 let's try a little further yourself 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:27.180
 Do I get grenades? 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.090
 the game is very cool 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.859
 she is really very very very addictive 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.859
 click confirm and throw a grenade 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:43.290
 both I unfortunately very recklessly it 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:46.730
 did it because it got me too 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.109
 let's move on 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.769
 graphically how cool did enough 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:53.669
 but still on the schedule, and even that it 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.219
 it seems like so far 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:58.799
 version because whale mobile 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:03:00.359
 devices we like another minus 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.189
 the end is that I play very much not 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.010
 optimized in some moments 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:07.430
 very much 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.859
 there are very glitches like textures 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.699
 the problem disappears altogether lighting 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:17.220
 can not see anything and you have a 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:19.229
 wander in the dark and trying so everyone 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.359
 normal normal hope 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:24.329
 developers fix these moments 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:28.129
 because it really strains these 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:33.030
 moments let's go further how to catch and 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:35.669
 with the explosion of a grenade and I was standing here 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.829
 some kind of fence that we 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:44.659
 destroyed as you can because they have 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:48.959
 weapon in the process is to look for a shootout 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:50.639
 letting the alien kill for now 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.109
 it more or less turns out to be his 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:54.109
 do you want and he attacked me 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:59.840
 here we knocked him of my partner in 2 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:03.239
 hour specifically happens 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.879
 the lighting is somehow getting worse well, I think 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.519
 for barrels will reduce 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:10.770
 improve the quality is clear that the game came out 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.120
 only 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.450
 lot to arrange for the game to be 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.030
 installed and therefore a lot of fuke can 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.500
 flights have appeared have these 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.760
 aliens and in which it is necessary to destroy 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.180
 advice is sure this game 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.090
 buy that real game 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.270
 cool let me come down and 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:38.410
 let's try to shoot this 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:42.850
 alien invader who decided but 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:47.430
 line of sight we shoot perfectly 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:53.320
 well we have failed our enemy 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:55.090
 he is trying to shoot back but while I'm playing 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.070
 by the way lanes in english have 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.080
 this is due to 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.570
 do you have it strained to him 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:06.400
 you problems so our enemy does it all 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:09.610
 trying some kind of development assets and what 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.400
 he and so let me have ours here 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:17.560

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:38.050
 let's try threw a grenade 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:41.580
 well I shoot leaving over the wall 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:44.050

 the price is certainly quite high but 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.710
