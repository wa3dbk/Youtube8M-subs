00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.220
 those of today I thought of 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.690
 bring a first course to the table 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.220
 enclosed in a crunchy shell of 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.220
 vegetables to delight my guests 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.350
 I found all the ingredients that 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.850
 I tried to prepare the rolls of 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.850
 cabbage stuffed with rice and endive 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.860
 we begin our recipe of putting 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.520
 dried raisins soaked in water 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.010
 warm 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.050
 here on the fire how it was prepared of 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.610
 vegetable broth with a carrot onion and 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.110
 celery if you want you can also put inside 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.940
 a bit of parsley or stems of 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.700
 chopped shallot parsley 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.890
 finely and now I'm going to cut the 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.780
 I already rinsed it and cut it 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.330
 in strips simply holding the 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.330
 together in this way vahdat launch it 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.780
 perfect all I need for 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.780
 pass stoves 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.200
 in this large pan I did 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.940
 dry the shallot with a little oil 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.140
 extra virgin olive oil in focus 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.970
 bass 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.800
 I now add the rice I use 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.270
 one-grain carnaroli rice rather 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.500
 thick and keeps cooking very well 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.500
 ideal for risottos 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.150
 I let him stay for 12 minutes 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.200
 stirring so I recommend the peak 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:06.280
 it is completely covered with oil 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.280
 now they move a little white wine 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.849
 and as soon as it is completely evaporated 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.379
 I add some hot vegetable broth mi 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.500
 I recommend not to interrupt the 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.500
 cooking 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.860
 and gradually add up to 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.860
 finish cooking the rice 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.270
 we are five minutes from the end of the 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.770
 rice cooking 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:51.130
 I add the raisins that he drained 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.130
 Pine nuts 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.060
 and finally the endive 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:11.980
 to a little vegetable stock and finish the 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:12.430
 cooking the rice is cooked so I turn off the 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.230
 fire 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.230
 and add the grated pecorino 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.890
 it is already tasty enough I do not add 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.890
 of salt, however, this is a bit of pepper 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.290
 and mantico with a piece of butter 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.290
 future 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.420
 the risotto is ready let it intimidate 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.430
 I have to prepare our faces 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:54.049
 blanch the cabbage leaves here 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.780
 committed a large pot with 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:59.319
 of water on the fire and is boiling I go 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.319
 add salt 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.220
 the leak has already been washed so I have 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.930
 cut the base practically more 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.390
 acea heart and holds together all the 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.430
 leaves and then I gently removed the 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.650
 leaves without breaking them very important 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.420
 the o rinsed now I'm going to put 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.790
 in the water that boils the water must 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.070
 just soak up not boil 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.400
 otherwise the leaves will swirl 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.400
 break 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.220
 lester or when they will be a little more tender 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.220
 but still crunchy 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.990
 the cabbage leaves are ready, the strago 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:40.090
 gently so as not to break them and the 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.550
 I immerse in ice water 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.930
 in this way the cooking is stopped and the 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.930
 color will remain bright 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.919
 I extract all the leaves from the water 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.990
 iced I put them on a tray and then 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:58.729
 I can proceed to the formation of the 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.169
 But first I have to take rolls 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.300
 this part that you see is more 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.990
 leathery protruding and would prevent the 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.990
 rolling 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.569
 and here we are at the realization of ours 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.270
 rolls we take a leaf la 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:18.310
 we sweep a little bit to remove 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.000
 excess water and then with a 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.130
 boxcutter 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.410
 we must cut this part as you do 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.410
 I said that it protrudes we start from here 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:30.060
 let's put some stuffing on the leaf 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.370
 let's explain the edges in this way 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:41.490
 rolled up 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.229
 and here is our roll I put a 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:48.960
 drop of olive oil in a baking dish 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:50.669
 of the dimensions of 20 x 30 cm and there 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.130
 slowly the roll with the closure towards 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.840
 the low 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:57.199
 in the same way I will proceed with all the 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.199
 other leaves 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:15.100
 the matter is ready I just have to 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.280
 put her for each roll a little 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.280
 oil 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:22.080
 cover with a little pecorino 

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:23.490
 grated 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.929
 or if you prefer a taste a 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.929
 a little lighter with some grain 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.470
 I can put my rolls underneath 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.220
 the oven grill for 5 minutes so 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.220
 that they become golden 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.789
 and while they cook we see 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.120
 together all the ingredients that 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:47.110
 needed to prepare this recipe 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.979

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:54.460

 oven and the rolls are ready for 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.300
 the raisins are served and the pine nuts donate 

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.190
 a sweet and sour note that goes well with 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.110
 the strong taste of cabbage and 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.960
 pecorino a tasty appetizer that can 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.340
 to be served also as a main dish 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.289
 they also cook and let me know if you do 

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:37.090
 liked and now a tip for a 

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:39.250
 interesting combination with this dish 

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:41.919
 a good match with this recipe 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.659
 may be the already red a wine of the 

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:46.270
 fontanafredda cellars composed of a 

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:48.370
 barbera and nebbiolo dolcetto and the first 

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:51.010
 wine of the grape harvest but it is not new 

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:53.800
 here not very pleasant vinous very much 

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:56.680
 fresh goes to soften the bitter tones 

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:59.789
 of the endive and the cabbage that they are 

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.789
 components of this recipe 

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.360
 Hey
