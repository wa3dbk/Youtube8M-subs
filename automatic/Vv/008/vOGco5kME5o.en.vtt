00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:16.820
 what are the risks in liposuction and 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:21.029
 of any good abdomen plastic 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.980
 surgery, I compare it a lot with the 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.570
 crossing the street in the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.740
 people cross the questions is 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.109
 dangerous 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.599
 if you come running across the street will 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.320
 be very dangerous because you can be 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.059
 ran over 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.399
 but if you stop and wait for the signal 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.290
 close cross in the crosswalk 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.149
 it's pretty safe 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.700
 so is liposuction and liposculpture 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.670
 if you have all the care you 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.989
 must be done is quite safe 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.789
 But you have to take all the 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.320
 people's difficulties 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.360
 including you talking now in the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.360
 people looking for his surgery by pulling 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.410
 who is going to lose weight and is not well there or 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.190
 what is the appropriate profile of a 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.199
 person who is going to have a lipo 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.510
 Successful liposuction 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.640
 liposuction and surgery for 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.880
 body contour and if the person is 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.040
 within or near your expected weight 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.240
 he can do a liposuction 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.970
 to change the shape of the body it is 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.369
 well over the weight she would have wanted 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.400
 should do a diet and exercises 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.720
 changes in lifestyle habits and 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.850
 weight that she intends to stay and 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.130
 Then you'll see what's left of 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.520
 fat for liposuction or 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.369
 it is appropriate is recommended without either 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.470
 do a cosmetic surgery do it but it's 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.149
 recommended to be done with 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.340
 physical exercise 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.220
 exercise is recommended until 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.590
 for those who will not do for everyone 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.570
 always but mainly in relation to 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.420
 aesthetic because it does not help because you 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.939
 stir the fat to keep your 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.560

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.270
