00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
like you removed a debug does that make

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.510 
like you removed a debug does that make
any<00:01:14.040> sense<00:01:14.360> does<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.479> make<00:01:15.600> any<00:01:15.930> sense<00:01:16.520> like

any sense does that make any sense like
right<00:01:17.790> now<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.450> think<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.650> first<00:01:19.830> unlock<00:01:20.340> that

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.330 
right now I think the first unlock that
you<00:01:20.700> get<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.119> climb<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.470> makes<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.920> climb
