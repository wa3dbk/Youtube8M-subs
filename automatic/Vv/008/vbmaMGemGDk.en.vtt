so<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.479> kind<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.840> thought<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.259> should<00:01:58.680> have<00:01:58.920> got

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
gone with a medium but i couldn't find

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.090 
gone with a medium but i couldn't find
any<00:05:40.210> sizes<00:05:40.780> but<00:05:41.169> these<00:05:41.410> were<00:05:41.590> on<00:05:41.740> clearance

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
any sizes but these were on clearance

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.820 
any sizes but these were on clearance
for<00:05:42.370> like<00:05:42.669> five<00:05:43.030> something<00:05:43.540> mind<00:05:43.780> says<00:05:43.990> 1148

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
for like five something mind says 1148

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.710 
for like five something mind says 1148
but<00:05:45.550> it<00:05:45.640> was<00:05:45.729> actually<00:05:45.910> cheaper<00:05:46.419> than<00:05:46.570> that

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
but it was actually cheaper than that

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.120 
but it was actually cheaper than that
because<00:05:46.870> i<00:05:47.020> took<00:05:47.140> up<00:05:47.410> another<00:05:47.500> one<00:05:47.800> that<00:05:47.979> said

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
because i took up another one that said

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.190 
because i took up another one that said
five<00:05:48.340> something<00:05:48.820> that<00:05:49.060> was<00:05:49.240> the<00:05:49.690> extra<00:05:50.080> large

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
five something that was the extra large

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.900 
five something that was the extra large
so<00:05:50.470> these<00:05:50.590> actually<00:05:50.919> went<00:05:51.370> down<00:05:51.430> to<00:05:51.550> five

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
so these actually went down to five

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.690 
so these actually went down to five
something<00:05:52.660> so<00:05:52.900> if<00:05:53.169> you<00:05:53.590> see<00:05:53.890> these<00:05:54.160> you<00:05:54.520> should

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.040 
something so if you see these you should
get<00:05:54.790> one<00:05:54.850> and<00:05:55.120> they're<00:05:55.210> actually<00:05:55.390> quite<00:05:55.750> long

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050

get one and they're actually quite long
like<00:05:56.229> it<00:05:56.380> goes<00:05:56.530> past<00:05:56.800> my<00:05:57.190> waist<00:05:57.430> and<00:05:57.760> then<00:05:57.970> the
