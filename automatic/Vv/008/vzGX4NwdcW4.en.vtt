now<00:00:11.790> have<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.059> counterweight<00:00:12.690> pivoting

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
now have the counterweight pivoting

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.220 
now have the counterweight pivoting
freely<00:00:13.799> here<00:00:14.160> for<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.059> flyweights<00:00:15.740> on<00:00:16.880> these

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
freely here for the flyweights on these

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.220 
freely here for the flyweights on these
eighth<00:00:19.230> inch<00:00:19.619> steel<00:00:19.920> pins<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.730> have<00:00:21.230> right

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
eighth inch steel pins that I have right

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.230 
eighth inch steel pins that I have right
here<00:00:22.970> it's<00:00:23.970> just<00:00:24.150> eighth<00:00:24.359> inch<00:00:24.660> round<00:00:24.960> stock

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
here it's just eighth inch round stock

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.269 
here it's just eighth inch round stock
eighth<00:00:27.240> inch<00:00:27.480> hole<00:00:27.720> through<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.349> weight<00:00:29.039> and

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
eighth inch hole through the weight and

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.690 
eighth inch hole through the weight and
the<00:00:29.849> mount<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:32.329> had<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.450> grind<00:00:34.250> kind<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.340> an<00:00:35.460> arc

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
the mount I had to grind kind of an arc

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.660 
the mount I had to grind kind of an arc
in<00:00:35.910> here<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.420> an<00:00:36.540> arc<00:00:36.719> here<00:00:37.399> to<00:00:38.399> allow<00:00:38.640> for

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
in here in an arc here to allow for

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:46.100 
in here in an arc here to allow for
clearance<00:00:39.239> as<00:00:39.420> they<00:00:39.600> turned<00:00:44.450> the<00:00:45.450> one<00:00:45.840> thing

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
clearance as they turned the one thing

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.190 
clearance as they turned the one thing
that<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.379> didn't<00:00:46.739> expect<00:00:47.160> was<00:00:47.399> there<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:48.000> be<00:00:48.120> a

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
that I didn't expect was there to be a

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.340 
that I didn't expect was there to be a
difference<00:00:49.200> between<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.739> counterweights

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
difference between the counterweights

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.590 
difference between the counterweights
the<00:00:52.350> difference<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.969> way<00:00:54.120> they're<00:00:54.300> cut

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
the difference in the way they're cut

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.299 
the difference in the way they're cut
and<00:00:54.980> I<00:00:55.980> had<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.309> modify<00:00:56.579> them<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:58.309> one

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
and I had to modify them so that one

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.889 
and I had to modify them so that one
would<00:00:59.520> fit<00:00:59.730> one<00:00:59.940> side<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.420> with<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.750> other

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
would fit one side one with the other

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.360 
would fit one side one with the other
that's<00:01:01.079> why<00:01:01.289> they<00:01:01.469> have<00:01:01.500> numbers<00:01:01.980> like<00:01:02.190> this

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
that's why they have numbers like this

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.810 
that's why they have numbers like this
one<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.609> number<00:01:02.850> two<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.600> side<00:01:04.100> and<00:01:05.100> side

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
one is number two this is side and side

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.420 
one is number two this is side and side
number<00:01:06.210> two<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.750> efficiency<00:01:07.560> that's<00:01:08.280> number

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
number two in efficiency that's number

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.710 
number two in efficiency that's number
one<00:01:10.189> the<00:01:11.189> screws<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:12.119> are<00:01:12.180> coming<00:01:12.570> out<00:01:12.659> of

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
one the screws that are coming out of

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.100 
one the screws that are coming out of
the<00:01:12.869> weights<00:01:13.080> there<00:01:13.470> for<00:01:13.830> 40<00:01:14.689> size<00:01:15.689> screws

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
the weights there for 40 size screws

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.340 
the weights there for 40 size screws
they<00:01:16.590> are<00:01:16.650> going<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.189> be<00:01:17.400> what<00:01:18.299> actually<00:01:18.780> moves

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
they are going to be what actually moves

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.719 
they are going to be what actually moves
the<00:01:20.479> governor<00:01:21.479> school<00:01:21.780> as<00:01:22.970> as<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.689> fluids

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
the governor school as as the fluids

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.420 
the governor school as as the fluids
move<00:01:26.729> out<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.119> then<00:01:27.210> come<00:01:27.420> back<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:28.430> something

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
move out and then come back in something

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.510 
move out and then come back in something
like<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.360> spool<00:01:30.630> will<00:01:30.750> be<00:01:30.900> held<00:01:31.170> up<00:01:31.520> here

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
like this the spool will be held up here

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.609 
like this the spool will be held up here
by<00:01:32.700> spring<00:01:33.180> tension<00:01:33.659> by<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> spring<00:01:34.259> little

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
by spring tension by a spring little

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.460 
by spring tension by a spring little
that's<00:01:34.920> going<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.189> be<00:01:35.340> either<00:01:36.320> positioned<00:01:37.320> in

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
that's going to be either positioned in

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.120 
that's going to be either positioned in
between<00:01:37.770> here<00:01:38.189> or<00:01:38.689> spring<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.930> will<00:01:40.170> be<00:01:40.380> on

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
between here or spring that will be on

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.800 
between here or spring that will be on
the<00:01:41.939> lever<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:43.439> push<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.770> back<00:01:43.950> up<00:01:44.360> and<00:01:45.360> just

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
the lever to push it back up and just

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.469 
the lever to push it back up and just
like<00:01:45.960> any<00:01:46.140> other<00:01:46.259> governor<00:01:47.240> flyweights<00:01:48.240> move

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
like any other governor flyweights move

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.760 
like any other governor flyweights move
out<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:50.360> push<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.509> spool<00:01:51.869> down

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
out the push the spool down

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.959 
out the push the spool down
pretty<00:01:54.399> a<00:01:54.520> pretty<00:01:55.530> standard<00:01:56.789> also<00:01:57.789> the

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
pretty a pretty standard also the

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:59.760 
pretty a pretty standard also the
weights<00:01:58.240> will<00:01:58.570> have<00:01:58.750> a<00:01:58.780> spring<00:01:59.229> in<00:01:59.409> between

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
weights will have a spring in between

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.279 
weights will have a spring in between
them<00:01:59.979> i'm<00:02:00.250> not<00:02:00.490> sure<00:02:00.759> what<00:02:01.479> size<00:02:01.719> tension

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
them i'm not sure what size tension

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.889 
them i'm not sure what size tension
spring<00:02:02.619> i'll<00:02:02.770> need<00:02:02.979> but<00:02:03.390> they'll<00:02:04.390> have<00:02:04.420> one

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
spring i'll need but they'll have one

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.719 
spring i'll need but they'll have one
spring<00:02:05.229> on<00:02:05.350> one<00:02:05.530> side<00:02:05.799> and<00:02:05.829> just<00:02:06.219> bring<00:02:06.429> on<00:02:06.610> the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
spring on one side and just bring on the

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.859 
spring on one side and just bring on the
opposite<00:02:07.030> side<00:02:08.069> because<00:02:09.069> these<00:02:09.429> have<00:02:09.489> a<00:02:10.119> lot

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
opposite side because these have a lot

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.039 
opposite side because these have a lot
they<00:02:11.080> have<00:02:11.470> quite<00:02:11.769> a<00:02:11.799> bit<00:02:12.010> of<00:02:12.129> mass<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:13.049> i'll

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
they have quite a bit of mass and i'll

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:15.839 
they have quite a bit of mass and i'll
just<00:02:14.410> doing<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.680> couple<00:02:14.799> tests<00:02:15.160> been<00:02:15.459> devoted

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
just doing a couple tests been devoted

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.339 
just doing a couple tests been devoted
by<00:02:15.940> hand<00:02:16.239> they<00:02:16.450> want<00:02:16.629> to<00:02:16.720> fly<00:02:16.900> out<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.110> lot

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
by hand they want to fly out a lot

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.850 
by hand they want to fly out a lot
faster<00:02:17.799> than<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:18.010> thought<00:02:18.220> they<00:02:18.430> would<00:02:18.459> so

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
faster than I thought they would so

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.720 
faster than I thought they would so
they're<00:02:20.860> going<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.099> want<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.340> have<00:02:21.430> a<00:02:21.459> lot<00:02:21.700> of

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
they're going to want to have a lot of

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.509 
they're going to want to have a lot of

forward<00:02:26.040> what<00:02:27.040> else<00:02:27.220> is<00:02:27.340> going<00:02:27.610> on<00:02:27.790> oh<00:02:29.610> have

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
forward what else is going on oh have

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.979 
forward what else is going on oh have
some<00:02:30.640> ideas<00:02:31.420> on<00:02:31.630> how<00:02:32.019> the<00:02:33.360> lever<00:02:34.360> arm<00:02:34.660> is<00:02:34.870> going

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
some ideas on how the lever arm is going

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.509 
some ideas on how the lever arm is going
to<00:02:35.140> work<00:02:35.319> for<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:37.860> how<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:38.920> lever<00:02:39.190> arm<00:02:39.400> is
