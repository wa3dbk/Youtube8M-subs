00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.720
 imagine what's on your hand 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.440
 full android is not some 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.870
 cut down 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.120
 android wear and the real smartphone 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.780
 right on the hand presented opportunities 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.869
 so there is already such a thing and this is a watch 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.420
 in abs gone on hand they are very similar to 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.130
 square apple ipod nano actually 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.529
 the screen is taken from there 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.730
 one and a half inches diagonal and resolution 240 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.820
 at 240 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.009
 there is still a camera and 2 buttons upper 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.820
 blocks and including the clock and the lower this 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.520
 back button 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.380
 Incidentally watch case made of aluminum but not 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.050
 protected from moisture and swim with them 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.390
 all is impossible because of this hole in 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.070
 the watch straps are inserted into the micro sim 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.230
 cards. 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.450
 Generally there are 3 colors white blue and 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.550
 Black, that 's what I like more 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.140
 total black country and on hand they 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.780
 look a little neater 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.280
 dual core processor and 512 megabytes 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.469
 RAM is enough for the eyes 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.960
 I was just upset that memory for 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.809
 just two gigabytes of data, and this despite the fact 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.820
 that memory card slots do not have numbers 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.280
 in the benchmarks comes out good and in terms of 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.820
 speed of android 4 0 4 is also not 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.369
 brings 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.979
 actually i should be a little surprised 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.210
 android to say the least not new but working 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.189
 quickly and without problems 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.100
 probably the whole thing in a small resolution 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.680
 screen and now the main thing that they can 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.479
 or they may be the same as normal android 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.610
 smartphone you can call from them 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.950
 chat social networks watch 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.049
 movies and generally all-all-all 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.329
 the only question is finger dexterity 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.310
 such a small screen idea full 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.229
 android on the clock I really like but 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.590
 not only everyone can make them 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.299
 right few can do it 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.119
 it's not enough just to reduce the interface 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.960
 it still needs to be adapted with this as 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.000
 time all is well 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.820
 the main desktop is made by plates with glasses 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.159
 like windows phone icons big and 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.799
 it’s easy to get on the frames around the screen 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.320
 there is a touch button true they are not there 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.939
 marked if clicked on the bottom left 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.579
 then this button is back 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.799
 and if on the right it opens a menu 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.060
 much more convenient than pressing each time 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.520
 buttons on the side 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.290
 when the clock lights up , then from here you can 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.630
 go quickly to the phone player 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.270
 calendar or just unlock them 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.340
 and the rest of the interface is typical 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.120
 android to make it easier to get on 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.519
 menu items 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.380
 I will slightly increase the font maker 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.750
 tried and made my keyboard 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.060
 to type something you need to click on 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.970
 the area which is the desired letter a 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.160
 then pull her side so goes 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.300
 much less mistakes than standard 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.340
 keyboard android 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.380
 some programs do not work well on 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.030
 square screen but read twitter and 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.489
 listen to music through the option 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.470
 quite real hours there is no connector under 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.540
 headphones but the set has the right one 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.390
 adapter plus you can listen to music 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.849
 via bluetooth speaker and microphone per hour 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.340
 But in there, too, but talk without a headset 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.630
 it's like talking on the speakerphone all 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.780
 hears talk around 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.360
 so I advise you to connect a headset 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.370
 did already speak here low of the world myself 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.750
 the shooting process looks like a lighter base 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.000
 shoot a laser 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.359
 although the pictures come out very, very 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.980
 quite good judge yourself cool in 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.620
 There are a lot of camera options 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.350
 settings brightness contrast sharpness 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.450
 saturation and even their tears panorama 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.209
 that what, but the links do not 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.549
 it turns out that it does not work but it 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.130
 not a selfie but a selfie because in the frame 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.049
 only one nose anyway 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.120
 that pictures come out and not square 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.280
 rectangular and displayed on screen 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.819
 only part of the future pictures and now 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.120
 short 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.069
 the device is interesting the very idea of ​​such a watch 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.859
 very cool when you have a watch 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.750
 phone camera player 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.700
 and everything is always with you and not 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.639
 pulls away pocket and just is on 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.370
 hand it is comfortable and practical and unusual 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:56.190
 if you are a miniature asian girl then 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.180
 this watch will suit you all the more 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.380
 bye everyone 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.380
 now short 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.570
 go ahead
