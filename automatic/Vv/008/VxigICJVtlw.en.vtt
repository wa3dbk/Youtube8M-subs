00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
because I'm flipping over in burning and

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.350 
because I'm flipping over in burning and
coming<00:02:34.320> back<00:02:34.470> down<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:34.950> floor<00:02:35.130> that's<00:02:36.030> why

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
coming back down to the floor that's why

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.590 
coming back down to the floor that's why
when<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.780> first<00:02:37.170> started<00:02:37.560> running<00:02:38.540> when<00:02:39.540> I

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
when I first started running when I

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.759 
when I first started running when I
started<00:02:40.019> I<00:02:40.170> Cupid<00:02:40.820> because<00:02:41.820> my<00:02:42.120> outside<00:02:42.570> hand

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
started I Cupid because my outside hand

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.620 
started I Cupid because my outside hand
comes<00:02:43.769> lower<00:02:44.220> than<00:02:44.519> my<00:02:44.670> inside<00:02:45.000> hand<00:02:45.030> because
