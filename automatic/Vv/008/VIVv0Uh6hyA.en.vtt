00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.410 
where I give you little tutorials on how
to<00:00:21.449> do<00:00:21.779> different<00:00:22.170> things<00:00:22.199> in<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.769> game

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
to do different things in the game

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.820 
to do different things in the game
anyway<00:00:24.590> today<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:26.699> cobblestone<00:00:27.269> generator

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
anyway today is a cobblestone generator

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.810 
anyway today is a cobblestone generator
so<00:00:30.140> this<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.769> do<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.040> with<00:00:32.219> lava<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.669> water

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
so this you do this with lava and water

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.440 
so this you do this with lava and water
the<00:00:33.510> easiest<00:00:34.170> way<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.440> do<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:35.090> like<00:00:36.090> this

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:47.450 

gotta<00:00:39.450> make<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.690> for<00:00:41.120> that<00:00:42.800> oops

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.610 

and<00:00:48.460> then<00:00:50.460> one<00:00:51.460> down<00:00:51.670> right<00:00:51.910> here<00:00:52.230> that

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
and then one down right here that

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.270 
and then one down right here that
put<00:00:55.280> your<00:00:55.430> water<00:00:55.730> I<00:00:56.239> have<00:00:56.989> water<00:00:57.289> hexed<00:00:57.920> into

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
put your water I have water hexed into

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.630 
put your water I have water hexed into
my<00:00:58.399> inventory<00:00:58.820> hex<00:00:59.300> edited<00:00:59.780> in<00:01:00.160> but<00:01:01.160> you<00:01:01.430> could

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
my inventory hex edited in but you could

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.999 
my inventory hex edited in but you could
do<00:01:01.790> this<00:01:01.969> if<00:01:02.149> you<00:01:02.239> just<00:01:02.480> had<00:01:02.629> natural<00:01:03.140> lava<00:01:03.649> and

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
do this if you just had natural lava and

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:11.620 
do this if you just had natural lava and
water<00:01:06.549> yeah<00:01:07.549> so<00:01:08.180> they're<00:01:09.909> cobblestone<00:01:10.909> and<00:01:11.180> if

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
water yeah so they're cobblestone and if

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:18.550 
water yeah so they're cobblestone and if
you<00:01:11.720> look<00:01:12.460> it's<00:01:13.780> infinite<00:01:15.790> that<00:01:16.960> now<00:01:17.960> another

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
you look it's infinite that now another

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.760 
you look it's infinite that now another
thing<00:01:18.830> that<00:01:18.860> happens<00:01:19.369> is<00:01:19.700> if<00:01:20.540> water<00:01:20.930> touches<00:01:21.320> a

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
thing that happens is if water touches a

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.389 
thing that happens is if water touches a
lava<00:01:22.280> source<00:01:22.790> now<00:01:23.119> a<00:01:23.149> lot<00:01:23.390> of<00:01:23.420> source<00:01:23.750> is<00:01:24.399> the

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
lava source now a lot of source is the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.270 
lava source now a lot of source is the
soul<00:01:25.880> and<00:01:26.060> lava<00:01:26.270> that<00:01:26.509> you<00:01:26.660> place<00:01:26.899> like<00:01:27.170> that

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
soul and lava that you place like that

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.340 
soul and lava that you place like that
that's<00:01:28.330> turned<00:01:29.330> into<00:01:29.479> obsidian<00:01:29.899> because<00:01:30.259> it

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
that's turned into obsidian because it

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.340 
that's turned into obsidian because it
was<00:01:30.440> touching<00:01:30.619> water<00:01:30.979> I<00:01:31.250> put<00:01:32.119> lava<00:01:32.990> source

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
was touching water I put lava source

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.910 
was touching water I put lava source
right<00:01:33.590> here<00:01:36.700> water<00:01:37.700> source<00:01:38.060> right<00:01:38.210> here<00:01:38.920> if

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
right here water source right here if

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.940 
right here water source right here if
the<00:01:40.310> water<00:01:40.520> touches<00:01:40.820> that<00:01:41.270> lava<00:01:41.840> source<00:01:42.110> it

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
the water touches that lava source it

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.899 
the water touches that lava source it
can<00:01:43.250> be<00:01:43.399> the<00:01:43.610> source<00:01:43.820> or<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.119> stream<00:01:44.479> of<00:01:44.830> water

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
can be the source or the stream of water

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.859 
can be the source or the stream of water
it<00:01:46.909> will<00:01:47.000> turn<00:01:47.210> into<00:01:47.270> obsidian<00:01:47.929> in<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:50.330> pc

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
it will turn into obsidian in the pc

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.499 
it will turn into obsidian in the pc
version<00:01:51.009> you<00:01:52.009> can<00:01:52.159> make<00:01:52.429> smooth<00:01:52.850> stone<00:01:53.240> if

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
version you can make smooth stone if

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.359 
version you can make smooth stone if
lava<00:01:54.470> falls<00:01:54.920> onto<00:01:55.580> a<00:01:55.819> water<00:01:56.179> source<00:01:56.600> block

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
lava falls onto a water source block

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.089 
lava falls onto a water source block
that<00:01:58.369> doesn't<00:01:58.789> work<00:01:58.970> in<00:01:59.539> Pocket<00:01:59.989> Edition<00:02:00.099> it

00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:01.099 
that doesn't work in Pocket Edition it

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:03.760 
that doesn't work in Pocket Edition it
turns<00:02:01.489> into<00:02:01.700> cobblestone<00:02:02.360> so<00:02:03.080> there's<00:02:03.500> no<00:02:03.560> way

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
turns into cobblestone so there's no way

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.419 
turns into cobblestone so there's no way
to<00:02:03.800> make<00:02:04.039> smooth<00:02:04.759> stone<00:02:05.380> also<00:02:06.380> there's<00:02:07.160> no<00:02:07.310> way

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
to make smooth stone also there's no way

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.369 
to make smooth stone also there's no way
to<00:02:07.489> make<00:02:07.670> an<00:02:07.910> infinite<00:02:10.030> obsidian<00:02:11.030> generator

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
to make an infinite obsidian generator

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.949 
to make an infinite obsidian generator
since<00:02:12.379> one<00:02:12.770> obsidian<00:02:13.370> is<00:02:13.580> equal<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.420> one<00:02:14.690> lava

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
since one obsidian is equal to one lava

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.650 
since one obsidian is equal to one lava
source<00:02:15.290> block<00:02:15.560> so<00:02:15.800> for<00:02:16.010> each<00:02:16.190> block<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.390> lava

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
source block so for each block of lava

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
source block so for each block of lava
you<00:02:18.230> have<00:02:18.520> source<00:02:19.870> thing<00:02:21.670> that's<00:02:22.670> one<00:02:23.090> of<00:02:23.209> city

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
you have source thing that's one of city

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.709 
you have source thing that's one of city
so<00:02:25.659> yeah<00:02:26.659> I<00:02:26.959> hope<00:02:27.230> this<00:02:27.439> helped<00:02:27.859> you<00:02:28.510> if<00:02:29.510> you

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:29.719 
so yeah I hope this helped you if you

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.920 
so yeah I hope this helped you if you
have<00:02:29.900> any<00:02:30.170> more<00:02:31.329> things<00:02:32.329> you<00:02:32.450> need<00:02:32.540> help<00:02:32.689> with

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930
