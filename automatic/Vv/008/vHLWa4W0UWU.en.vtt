okay<00:04:21.540> so<00:04:22.320> those<00:04:22.530> are<00:04:22.680> our<00:04:22.770> four<00:04:23.010> turns<00:04:23.340> our

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
okay so those are our four turns our

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.030 
okay so those are our four turns our
left<00:04:24.000> right<00:04:24.930> right<00:04:24.960> left<00:04:26.900> so<00:04:27.900> where<00:04:28.710> could<00:04:28.920> you

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
left right right left so where could you

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.430 
left right right left so where could you
be<00:04:29.070> going<00:04:29.370> wrong<00:04:29.670> so<00:04:30.570> there's<00:04:30.750> really<00:04:30.960> about

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
be going wrong so there's really about

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.830 
be going wrong so there's really about
four<00:04:32.040> main<00:04:32.340> areas<00:04:32.970> where<00:04:33.120> we<00:04:33.240> could<00:04:33.420> go<00:04:33.600> wrong

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
four main areas where we could go wrong

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.800 
four main areas where we could go wrong
with<00:04:34.020> this<00:04:34.110> manoeuvre<00:04:34.970> number<00:04:35.970> one<00:04:36.180> is<00:04:36.450> you

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
with this manoeuvre number one is you

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.650 
with this manoeuvre number one is you
could<00:04:37.080> be<00:04:37.490> steering<00:04:38.490> too<00:04:38.670> much<00:04:38.940> in<00:04:39.210> your<00:04:39.390> left

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
could be steering too much in your left

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.140 
could be steering too much in your left
door<00:04:40.170> mirror<00:04:40.470> now<00:04:41.160> if<00:04:41.310> your<00:04:41.520> focus<00:04:41.880> are<00:04:42.000> too

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
door mirror now if your focus are too

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.290 
door mirror now if your focus are too
much<00:04:42.390> on<00:04:42.570> that<00:04:42.690> mirror<00:04:42.990> it's<00:04:43.830> very<00:04:44.550> difficult

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
much on that mirror it's very difficult

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.850 
much on that mirror it's very difficult
for<00:04:45.480> you<00:04:45.570> to<00:04:45.690> be<00:04:45.840> able<00:04:46.020> to<00:04:46.170> see<00:04:46.320> if<00:04:46.440> any<00:04:46.560> cars

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
for you to be able to see if any cars

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.110 
for you to be able to see if any cars
are<00:04:47.040> coming<00:04:47.130> around<00:04:47.400> so<00:04:47.640> you<00:04:47.760> won't<00:04:47.970> be<00:04:48.090> able

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
are coming around so you won't be able

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.870 
are coming around so you won't be able
to<00:04:48.480> stop<00:04:48.750> or<00:04:49.020> you<00:04:49.290> know<00:04:49.710> give<00:04:49.980> due<00:04:50.310> regard<00:04:50.340> as

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
to stop or you know give due regard as

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.790 
to stop or you know give due regard as
safety<00:04:51.300> towards<00:04:51.750> those<00:04:51.840> cars<00:04:52.440> or<00:04:52.650> pedestrians

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
safety towards those cars or pedestrians

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.130 
safety towards those cars or pedestrians
so<00:04:53.430> you<00:04:53.490> make<00:04:53.730> sure<00:04:53.760> you<00:04:53.970> continue<00:04:54.750> scanning

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
so you make sure you continue scanning

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
so you make sure you continue scanning
and<00:04:55.530> don't<00:04:56.310> stare<00:04:56.760> in<00:04:56.970> your<00:04:57.120> mirror<00:04:57.360> okay

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
and don't stare in your mirror okay

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.770 
and don't stare in your mirror okay
second<00:04:59.160> place<00:04:59.310> you<00:04:59.340> could<00:04:59.790> be<00:04:59.940> going<00:05:00.180> wrong<00:05:00.570> is

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
second place you could be going wrong is

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.960 
second place you could be going wrong is
you<00:05:00.990> could<00:05:01.290> be<00:05:01.500> going<00:05:01.710> too<00:05:02.340> fast

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
you could be going too fast

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.090 
you could be going too fast
the<00:05:03.480> vehicles<00:05:03.900> going<00:05:04.080> too<00:05:04.380> fast<00:05:04.650> it's<00:05:05.070> very

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
the vehicles going too fast it's very

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.390 
the vehicles going too fast it's very
difficult<00:05:06.030> for<00:05:06.720> you<00:05:06.870> to<00:05:07.020> judge<00:05:07.260> your<00:05:07.530> turns

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
difficult for you to judge your turns

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.430 
difficult for you to judge your turns
and<00:05:08.610> to<00:05:08.760> be<00:05:08.880> accurate<00:05:09.420> with<00:05:09.540> those<00:05:09.720> turns<00:05:10.050> so

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
and to be accurate with those turns so

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.930 
and to be accurate with those turns so
you<00:05:10.500> need<00:05:10.770> to<00:05:10.890> make<00:05:11.070> sure<00:05:11.100> you<00:05:11.520> can<00:05:11.730> control

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
you need to make sure you can control

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.050 
you need to make sure you can control
your<00:05:12.480> speed<00:05:12.840> so<00:05:13.800> maybe<00:05:14.100> practice<00:05:14.430> your<00:05:14.820> clutch

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
your speed so maybe practice your clutch

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.470 
your speed so maybe practice your clutch
control<00:05:15.410> before<00:05:16.410> you<00:05:16.530> try<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:16.830> maneuver<00:05:17.480> now

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
control before you try the maneuver now

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.720 
control before you try the maneuver now
the<00:05:19.290> third<00:05:19.530> place<00:05:19.860> you<00:05:20.010> could<00:05:20.220> be<00:05:20.340> going<00:05:20.490> wrong

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
the third place you could be going wrong

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.490 
the third place you could be going wrong
in<00:05:20.880> the<00:05:20.910> most<00:05:21.150> common<00:05:21.480> area<00:05:21.960> where<00:05:22.020> people

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
in the most common area where people

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.730 
in the most common area where people
tend<00:05:22.740> to<00:05:22.919> go<00:05:23.040> wrong<00:05:23.280> with<00:05:23.310> this<00:05:23.580> maneuver<00:05:24.120> is

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
tend to go wrong with this maneuver is

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.900 
tend to go wrong with this maneuver is
misjudging<00:05:25.740> the<00:05:25.950> third<00:05:26.520> turn<00:05:27.080> so<00:05:28.080> if<00:05:29.040> for

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
misjudging the third turn so if for

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.450 
misjudging the third turn so if for
example<00:05:30.000> you<00:05:30.510> do<00:05:30.870> misjudge<00:05:31.860> it<00:05:32.040> and<00:05:32.160> you<00:05:32.220> find

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
example you do misjudge it and you find

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.480 
example you do misjudge it and you find
that<00:05:32.640> you've<00:05:32.820> turned<00:05:33.290> too<00:05:34.290> late<00:05:34.560> and<00:05:35.040> it<00:05:35.190> looks

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
that you've turned too late and it looks

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.060 
that you've turned too late and it looks
like<00:05:35.730> you're<00:05:35.880> about<00:05:36.180> to<00:05:36.240> hit<00:05:36.600> the<00:05:36.750> curb<00:05:37.070> it's

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
like you're about to hit the curb it's

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.370 
like you're about to hit the curb it's
important<00:05:38.550> that<00:05:38.580> you<00:05:38.820> stop<00:05:39.210> because<00:05:40.050> at<00:05:40.230> this

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
important that you stop because at this

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.100 
important that you stop because at this
point<00:05:40.680> what<00:05:40.830> you<00:05:40.950> can<00:05:41.130> do<00:05:41.310> is<00:05:41.520> stop<00:05:41.900> secure<00:05:42.900> the

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
point what you can do is stop secure the

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.110 
point what you can do is stop secure the
car<00:05:43.350> and<00:05:43.650> we're<00:05:43.980> going<00:05:44.220> to<00:05:44.280> do<00:05:44.520> what<00:05:44.669> we<00:05:44.850> call

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
car and we're going to do what we call

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.080 
car and we're going to do what we call
taking<00:05:45.480> a<00:05:45.720> shunt<00:05:46.169> forward<00:05:46.860> so<00:05:47.310> taking<00:05:47.760> a<00:05:47.820> shunt

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
taking a shunt forward so taking a shunt

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.540 
taking a shunt forward so taking a shunt
forward<00:05:48.600> is<00:05:49.050> basically<00:05:49.590> resetting<00:05:50.520> your

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
forward is basically resetting your

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.780 
forward is basically resetting your
observations<00:05:51.710> drive<00:05:52.710> it<00:05:52.950> forward<00:05:53.310> a<00:05:53.550> short

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
observations drive it forward a short

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.060 
observations drive it forward a short
distance<00:05:54.330> and<00:05:54.510> as<00:05:54.870> you<00:05:55.080> do<00:05:55.290> turning<00:05:55.830> the<00:05:55.919> wheel

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
distance and as you do turning the wheel

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.790 
distance and as you do turning the wheel
to<00:05:56.370> the<00:05:56.400> left<00:05:56.690> until<00:05:57.690> you<00:05:57.780> go<00:05:57.930> about<00:05:58.110> two<00:05:58.410> three

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
to the left until you go about two three

okay the fourth place you could be going

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.210 
okay the fourth place you could be going
wrong<00:06:16.980> is<00:06:17.460> you<00:06:17.730> could<00:06:18.030> be<00:06:19.220> misinterpreting

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
wrong is you could be misinterpreting
