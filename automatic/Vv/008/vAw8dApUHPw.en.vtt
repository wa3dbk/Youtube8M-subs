00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 good people welcome to a new video 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.000
 welcome in this case to a new 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.620
 call of duty information video 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.480
 advanced grant was the truth had 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.070
 eager to upload this information 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.049
 since he had it good for a few 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.420
 days and I wanted to upload it the only thing is 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.100
 that I'm going to leave the dlc and I've gone up 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.480
 a lot of queries times that the 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.490
 I really love it even if it does not go up 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.779
 game very much myself I did not get on a 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.730
 couple of videos and such and I'm trying 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.960
 with the time to be able to try the interest 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.369
 but well that was not a story too 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.810
 before starting with the information 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.500
 tell them that if we are 100,000 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.840
 subscribers 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.340
 I obviously heard the special there 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.230
 is not there is the special that what 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.910
 I have to leave but good now 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.270
 my life is going through a lot of things that 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.969
 Well, I'm worried about a lot of things 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.520
 many more important things 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.129
 as it is a move for example 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.320
 but but that then especially I 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.520
 you will have a bad explanation 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.170
 especially I want to make a good one like that 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.539
 I do not feel more calm I'll do it 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.460
 but basically nothing but 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.780
 information that right now is also 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.270
 thank you so much for showing off a thousand 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.000
 subscribers we continue to butt towards a 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.840
 new goal so nothing information 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.649
 what do I want to have 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.409
 very good and it is referring to the credits 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:16.439
 of supplies what the arms market the 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.270
 bank as you want to call it and when it goes 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.759
 to leave more or less that is going to be and how 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.770
 it's going to work to tell you that that source 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.950
 Well, it's from the game code, it's worth 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.500
 that's all the game code and nothing is going 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.899
 to start when the market will come out 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.310
 of weapons or supplies credits or 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.189
 as you want to call it better the credits 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.869
 of supplies because it will come out in some 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.219
 two weeks since I am this video 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.049
 more or less according to what I have 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.610
 commented is going to leave this to the best 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.439
 it may vary a bit obviously 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.909
 time depends on them but there is what 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.219
 that has to come out in a little bit 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.200
 What does this consist of? 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:51.509
 next you can sell part of x 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.209
 px all the items you have not 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.560
 You can sell for credits that credit 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:58.110
 they are going to give for example if you 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.599
 you sell a cadet item every 500 credits 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.239
 If you sell a professional item they will make you 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:04.829
 thousand credits will be 21 elite 2000 if 

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:07.409
 you sell a retired one that until now 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.509
 fulfill a very large function they give you 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.900
 three thousand and if you sell one legendary you 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.389
 they give four thousand credits that they give you 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.670
 if it is an elite soul or if it is a hat 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:20.220
 elite or anything not if it's both 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.840
 pledge as a weapon then this 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.780
 obviously it can vary but I think that 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.519
 it will be this I find very very good scale 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.230
 I think it's going to be like this like this 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.930
 that I think is going to stay like that 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.190
 then with this we can buy here 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.230
 Well, we can buy supplies 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.900
 advanced or normal supply I do not know 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.940
 that you can actually buy and how much 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.510
 alert or how much they are worth because this can 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.480
 be very good or shit because it's going to 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.160
 vary between 10,000 and 20,000 each 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.780
 supply worth this seems to me a 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.180
 bit canon because to get a 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.489
 supply you have to sell at least three 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.190
 legendary things for example but that 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.810
 yes but I think of all things by 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.819
 professional example that I do not want and there 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.560
 you can get me a million supplies 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.419
 but but good that's what is worth more or 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.579
 less between 10,000 20,000 let's say yes 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:07.650
 is 10,000 because it would seem to me more or less 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.230
 right but already more than 10,000 I do not 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.319
 It would not seem like a good thing either and apart from 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.810
 this also how it leaked a month ago 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.549
 or so we will also be able to get the 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.990
 item of the week each week will put in 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.240
 a better estimate is a garment 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.280
 it's a weapon that will cost a lot 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.800
 money to the best is worth 100,000 and if you 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.870
 you have 100 thousand credits then there are those 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.670
 boots with permanent a message equals 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.900
 100 thousand credits because if you have 100 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.700
 thousand credits and you can sell all your 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.590
 things for a heavy snow you can 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.820
 doing so will not be changing places 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.070
 the week maybe one day they give you 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.810
 shalit and another day is the pants of 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.690
 royalty and another day is what they are 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.610
 is for example then what else can I 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.950
 teach that certify a little that 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.110
 theory so to speak as well this 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.110
 it's a picture that they went through on Twitter 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.310
 a kid called rmc efe / david that 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.920
 thank you very much for giving me what I 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.570
 he showed a super picture of his 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.400
 color application you go warfare in 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.230
 which we can see a new tab and 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.780
 that puts my bank this was not up 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.580
 now as far as I have understood no no 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.440
 until now the tab of the bank 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.210
 and if he gave iu he did not act 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.990
 say as if he did not let in 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.370
 my bank 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.690
 I just think that may have 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.400
 something to do with the credits of 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.440
 Catalan and supplies like you have 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.670
 25 ideas can not be a book can 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.470
 be included in the application 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.060
 of call of duty but I tell you that this 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.370
 within a short time you have to 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.510
 leave so that's not much 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.620
 more than real comments this 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.240
 information the truth 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:33.570
 the prediction because it is an information 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.639
 very very interesting and I hope that inside 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.840
 if it does not come out because if it is not it will die 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.180
 pongolle fra I do not want him to die 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.919
 for now so so nothing too 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.780
 soon new weapons will be released 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.370
 legendary that has to come out inside 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.050
 from very little also because good 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.850
 touches already told us that August came out 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.550
 and such and a lot of 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.139
 things that have to do with ak-47 is the 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.389
 that will make it go out can be but until 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.550
 Now everything that has come out almost everything is 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.960
 fake simply decided sixth that this 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.970
 has to leave the subject soon 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.620
 of supplies and credits of the 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.820
 ministers tell them I think that for 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.169
 mid- August I do not know I would say or half 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.830
 August or early September 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.840
 you have to leave now because if you are not 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.520
 at ease is that if it goes out it will match 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.139
 with the target of targets 3 then that 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.300
 it would be to cover a little between 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:21.090
 activision so you leave very soon 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:25.500
 very prontito in three four five or six 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:27.330
 days would already be that 13 August 14 or 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.949
 it comes out afterwards not when it finishes 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.570
 beta of targets 3 unless there is 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:31.710
 some kind of surprises and that nothing 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.460
 Really, I hope that I have you 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.560
 liked this video 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.900
 thank you a hundred thousand thanks for twelve 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.240
 Thousands of subscribers are still at full capacity 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.460
 a new era has liked to leave me 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.259
 like if you want to see more 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.800
 information of that wine style we see the 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.800
 next video
