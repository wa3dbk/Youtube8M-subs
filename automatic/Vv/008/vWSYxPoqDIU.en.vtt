come<00:02:42.150> from<00:02:42.360> actually<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.200> does<00:02:43.379> a<00:02:43.410> Buddhist

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
come from actually it does a Buddhist

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.330 
come from actually it does a Buddhist
scripture<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.379> depicts<00:02:46.379> the<00:02:46.620> universe

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
scripture that depicts the universe

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.390 
scripture that depicts the universe
contained<00:02:48.120> in<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.599> mustard<00:02:48.959> seed<00:02:48.989> so<00:02:49.560> anyone

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
contained in the mustard seed so anyone

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.809 
contained in the mustard seed so anyone
can<00:02:50.640> observe<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.180> mustard<00:02:51.840> seed<00:02:52.020> and<00:02:52.260> then

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
can observe a mustard seed and then

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.199 
can observe a mustard seed and then
Stan<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:54.370> universe<00:02:55.370> so<00:02:55.760> it's<00:02:55.999> a<00:02:56.180> very

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
Stan the universe so it's a very

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.649 
Stan the universe so it's a very
profound<00:02:57.170> philosophical<00:02:57.879> meaning<00:02:58.879> behind<00:02:59.269> it

00:02:59.649 --> 00:02:59.659 
profound philosophical meaning behind it

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:02.679 
profound philosophical meaning behind it
but<00:02:59.870> of<00:03:00.019> course<00:03:00.230> on<00:03:00.439> stage<00:03:00.859> you<00:03:01.430> see<00:03:01.849> just<00:03:02.090> very

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:02.689 
but of course on stage you see just very

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:05.050 
but of course on stage you see just very
pure<00:03:03.049> movement<00:03:03.799> and<00:03:04.040> then<00:03:04.400> you<00:03:04.519> can<00:03:04.670> derive

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
pure movement and then you can derive

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.270 
pure movement and then you can derive
your<00:03:05.230> imagination<00:03:06.230> through<00:03:06.469> watching<00:03:07.129> the

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
your imagination through watching the

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.429 
your imagination through watching the
movie<00:03:07.519> and<00:03:08.239> what<00:03:08.629> has<00:03:08.780> been<00:03:08.810> some<00:03:09.319> of<00:03:09.379> the

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:09.439 
movie and what has been some of the

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.379 
movie and what has been some of the
challenges<00:03:09.620> you<00:03:09.920> faced<00:03:10.219> so<00:03:10.609> far<00:03:10.639> with<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.180> two

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:11.389 
challenges you faced so far with the two

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:13.119 
challenges you faced so far with the two
different<00:03:11.810> groups<00:03:12.109> coming<00:03:12.439> in<00:03:12.650> together<00:03:12.799> I

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
different groups coming in together I

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.149 
different groups coming in together I
think<00:03:13.790> it's<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.290> of<00:03:15.290> course<00:03:15.560> a<00:03:15.650> cultural

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 
think it's the of course a cultural

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.940 
think it's the of course a cultural
difference<00:03:17.120> you<00:03:17.629> know<00:03:17.659> and<00:03:17.989> dances<00:03:18.799> they

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
difference you know and dances they

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.149 
difference you know and dances they
don't<00:03:19.189> speak<00:03:19.849> the<00:03:20.269> other<00:03:20.989> dialects<00:03:21.500> or<00:03:21.709> the

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 
don't speak the other dialects or the

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:24.369 
don't speak the other dialects or the
languages<00:03:22.730> so<00:03:22.909> they<00:03:23.060> have<00:03:23.239> to<00:03:23.389> make<00:03:23.719> use<00:03:23.900> of<00:03:23.930> a

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
languages so they have to make use of a

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.140 
languages so they have to make use of a
lot<00:03:24.620> of<00:03:24.769> our<00:03:24.919> sign<00:03:25.280> language<00:03:25.730> and<00:03:25.939> body

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
lot of our sign language and body

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.599 
lot of our sign language and body
movements<00:03:26.900> but<00:03:27.560> it's<00:03:27.769> interesting<00:03:28.099> to<00:03:28.430> see

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
movements but it's interesting to see

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.849 
movements but it's interesting to see
how<00:03:28.790> how<00:03:29.090> it<00:03:29.239> developed<00:03:29.719> and<00:03:29.930> then<00:03:30.530> but<00:03:30.739> of

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
how how it developed and then but of

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.280 
how how it developed and then but of
course<00:03:31.069> the<00:03:31.669> go<00:03:32.299> ballet<00:03:32.510> dancers<00:03:33.049> they<00:03:33.230> were

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
course the go ballet dancers they were

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.439 
course the go ballet dancers they were
primarily<00:03:35.049> classically<00:03:36.049> trained<00:03:36.439> so<00:03:37.219> then<00:03:37.519> of

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:38.449 
primarily classically trained so then of

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:41.289 
primarily classically trained so then of
course<00:03:38.930> Lucci<00:03:39.469> or<00:03:39.889> she<00:03:40.069> has<00:03:40.340> her<00:03:40.699> classical

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
course Lucci or she has her classical

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.780 
course Lucci or she has her classical
background<00:03:41.750> but<00:03:42.290> she's<00:03:42.530> much<00:03:42.799> more<00:03:43.189> into<00:03:43.669> the

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
background but she's much more into the

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.509 
background but she's much more into the
contemporary<00:03:44.359> use<00:03:44.540> of<00:03:44.719> the<00:03:44.959> body<00:03:45.379> so<00:03:46.159> it<00:03:46.310> has

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
contemporary use of the body so it has

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.300 
contemporary use of the body so it has
to<00:03:47.139> transferring<00:03:48.139> this<00:03:48.500> kind<00:03:48.829> of<00:03:48.889> experience

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
to transferring this kind of experience

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.789 
to transferring this kind of experience
to<00:03:49.669> the<00:03:49.699> dancer<00:03:50.389> so<00:03:50.569> it's<00:03:50.750> it<00:03:50.959> takes<00:03:51.290> quite<00:03:51.739> a

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
to the dancer so it's it takes quite a

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:57.999 
to the dancer so it's it takes quite a
while<00:03:52.569> and<00:03:53.569> what<00:03:54.019> can<00:03:54.169> audiences<00:03:56.349> show<00:03:57.349> well<00:03:57.979> I

00:03:57.999 --> 00:03:58.009 
while and what can audiences show well I

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:00.939 
while and what can audiences show well I
think<00:03:58.189> they<00:03:58.569> I<00:03:59.569> hope<00:04:00.079> they<00:04:00.259> will<00:04:00.470> enjoy<00:04:00.650> the

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:00.949 
think they I hope they will enjoy the

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:04.689 
think they I hope they will enjoy the
show<00:04:01.129> just<00:04:01.549> by<00:04:01.699> the<00:04:01.729> sheer<00:04:03.370> movement<00:04:04.370> you<00:04:04.609> know

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:04.699 
show just by the sheer movement you know

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:06.249 
show just by the sheer movement you know
it's<00:04:04.849> it's<00:04:05.120> as<00:04:05.329> beautiful<00:04:05.509> you<00:04:05.900> know<00:04:05.930> these

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:06.259 
it's it's as beautiful you know these

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:10.749 
it's it's as beautiful you know these

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:10.759 
dances are beautifully trained and then

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:13.059 
dances are beautifully trained and then
of<00:04:11.150> course<00:04:11.419> the<00:04:11.680> choreography<00:04:12.680> is<00:04:12.739> very

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
of course the choreography is very

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.429 
of course the choreography is very
interesting<00:04:13.579> started<00:04:14.329> from<00:04:14.509> a<00:04:14.659> very<00:04:14.900> simple

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:15.439 
interesting started from a very simple

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:19.629 
interesting started from a very simple
solo<00:04:16.370> dancer<00:04:17.359> and<00:04:17.539> then<00:04:18.229> it's<00:04:18.470> developed<00:04:19.340> into

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
solo dancer and then it's developed into

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.439 
solo dancer and then it's developed into
duet<00:04:20.299> and<00:04:20.630> trio<00:04:21.039> quadrat<00:04:22.039> and<00:04:22.430> then<00:04:22.729> into<00:04:23.389> a

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449 
duet and trio quadrat and then into a
