the best on the market and I especially

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.159 
the best on the market and I especially
like<00:00:21.439> the<00:00:21.470> dark<00:00:21.859> tone<00:00:22.160> because<00:00:23.050> when<00:00:24.050> you're

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.169 
like the dark tone because when you're

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:25.720 
like the dark tone because when you're
wearing<00:00:24.320> a<00:00:24.499> lot<00:00:24.650> of<00:00:24.740> eye<00:00:24.890> makeup<00:00:25.099> it's<00:00:25.429> good<00:00:25.640> to

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
wearing a lot of eye makeup it's good to

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.890 
wearing a lot of eye makeup it's good to
use<00:00:25.849> the<00:00:25.970> dark<00:00:26.179> tone<00:00:26.359> because<00:00:26.599> it<00:00:26.720> really

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
use the dark tone because it really

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.130 
use the dark tone because it really
doesn't<00:00:27.320> create<00:00:27.560> that<00:00:27.740> white<00:00:28.539> glue<00:00:29.539> mark<00:00:29.869> that

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
doesn't create that white glue mark that

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.630 
doesn't create that white glue mark that
it<00:00:30.320> can<00:00:30.650> sometimes<00:00:30.829> happen<00:00:31.099> when<00:00:31.369> you<00:00:31.490> don't

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
it can sometimes happen when you don't

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.020 
it can sometimes happen when you don't
use<00:00:31.759> the<00:00:31.970> dark<00:00:32.180> tone<00:00:32.390> so<00:00:32.840> what<00:00:32.960> I<00:00:32.989> do<00:00:33.110> is<00:00:34.000> I<00:00:35.000> put

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
use the dark tone so what I do is I put

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.400 
use the dark tone so what I do is I put
a<00:00:35.210> little<00:00:35.390> bit<00:00:35.570> on<00:00:35.720> my<00:00:35.750> hand<00:00:38.170> some<00:00:39.170> people

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
a little bit on my hand some people

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.690 
a little bit on my hand some people
apply<00:00:39.650> it<00:00:39.710> directly<00:00:39.890> to<00:00:40.160> the<00:00:40.250> lash<00:00:40.430> but<00:00:40.670> I

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
apply it directly to the lash but I

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.510 
apply it directly to the lash but I
prefer<00:00:41.060> to<00:00:41.210> apply<00:00:41.420> it<00:00:41.480> directly<00:00:41.630> to<00:00:42.050> my<00:00:42.170> hand

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
prefer to apply it directly to my hand

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:52.950 
prefer to apply it directly to my hand
and<00:00:43.520> then<00:00:43.940> I<00:00:44.000> take<00:00:44.270> the<00:00:44.450> lash

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.770 

and<00:00:53.590> I<00:00:53.680> picked<00:00:53.920> these<00:00:54.100> ones<00:00:54.370> because<00:00:54.879> they're

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
and I picked these ones because they're

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.689 
and I picked these ones because they're
flared<00:00:56.290> towards<00:00:56.649> the<00:00:56.800> end<00:00:56.950> which<00:00:57.309> gives<00:00:57.550> that

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
flared towards the end which gives that

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.939 
flared towards the end which gives that
cat<00:00:58.270> eye<00:00:58.300> effect<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:59.559> you're<00:00:59.649> just<00:00:59.710> going<00:00:59.860> to

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.910 
cat eye effect so you're just going to
dip<00:01:00.129> it<00:01:00.250> in<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:00.399> lashes<00:01:00.790> like<00:01:00.910> this<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:04.920> then

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
dip it in the lashes like this and then

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.950 
dip it in the lashes like this and then
the<00:01:06.009> key<00:01:06.220> to<00:01:06.490> false<00:01:06.729> eyelashes<00:01:07.330> is<00:01:07.479> to<00:01:07.750> make
