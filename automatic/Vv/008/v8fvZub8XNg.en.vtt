this<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.860> one<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.280> batteries<00:01:45.229> it<00:01:46.229> has<00:01:46.470> an

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
this is one of the batteries it has an

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.429 
this is one of the batteries it has an
international<00:01:47.579> power<00:01:48.329> adapter<00:01:48.810> or<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.020> guess

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
international power adapter or I guess

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.620 
international power adapter or I guess
this<00:01:49.799> would<00:01:49.950> be<00:01:50.130> from<00:01:50.340> Korea<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.149> any<00:01:51.329> country

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
this would be from Korea so any country

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.749 
this would be from Korea so any country
that<00:01:51.780> uses<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.229> power<00:01:52.470> adapter<00:01:52.890> that's

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
that uses this power adapter that's

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.340 
that uses this power adapter that's
where<00:01:53.970> it's<00:01:54.090> for<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.689> wouldn't<00:01:55.049> really<00:01:55.140> work

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
where it's for it wouldn't really work

factor<00:03:27.290> with<00:03:27.489> having<00:03:28.489> one<00:03:28.669> of<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.819> biggest

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
factor with having one of the biggest

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.909 
factor with having one of the biggest
screens<00:03:29.299> on<00:03:29.629> the<00:03:29.780> market<00:03:30.169> so<00:03:30.410> take<00:03:30.650> a<00:03:30.709> look<00:03:30.859> at

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
screens on the market so take a look at

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:31.869 
screens on the market so take a look at
the<00:03:30.980> back<00:03:31.129> the<00:03:31.310> first<00:03:31.489> thing<00:03:31.639> you'll<00:03:31.730> notice

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 
the back the first thing you'll notice

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:33.909 
the back the first thing you'll notice

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:33.919 
is the camera setup along with the three

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:36.670 
is the camera setup along with the three
buttons<00:03:34.389> this<00:03:35.389> is<00:03:35.540> basically<00:03:36.019> the<00:03:36.230> power<00:03:36.379> on

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
buttons this is basically the power on

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.050 
buttons this is basically the power on
power<00:03:37.010> off<00:03:37.220> button<00:03:37.579> and<00:03:37.639> then<00:03:37.790> you<00:03:37.879> have

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
power off button and then you have

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.689 
power off button and then you have
volume<00:03:38.329> up<00:03:38.629> and<00:03:38.840> down<00:03:39.099> the<00:03:40.099> back<00:03:40.250> facing

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:40.699 
volume up and down the back facing

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:44.770 
volume up and down the back facing
camera<00:03:40.780> which<00:03:41.780> is<00:03:42.049> 13<00:03:42.829> megapixels<00:03:43.579> along<00:03:44.510> with

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
camera which is 13 megapixels along with

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.170 
camera which is 13 megapixels along with
an<00:03:44.989> LED<00:03:45.319> flash<00:03:45.500> and<00:03:46.250> of<00:03:46.489> course<00:03:46.699> you'll<00:03:46.849> notice

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
an LED flash and of course you'll notice

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.689 
an LED flash and of course you'll notice
the<00:03:47.329> lte-a<00:03:48.049> logo<00:03:48.949> which<00:03:49.129> means<00:03:49.370> that<00:03:49.519> it<00:03:49.669> is

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:49.699 
the lte-a logo which means that it is

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:52.119 
the lte-a logo which means that it is
LTE<00:03:50.239> compatible<00:03:51.139> in<00:03:51.319> the<00:03:51.709> States

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
LTE compatible in the States

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:54.059 
LTE compatible in the States
and<00:03:52.220> in<00:03:52.579> Korea<00:03:52.849> so<00:03:53.150> pretty<00:03:53.329> much<00:03:53.449> worldwide

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
and in Korea so pretty much worldwide

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.339 
and in Korea so pretty much worldwide
and<00:03:55.069> then<00:03:55.310> you<00:03:55.430> have<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:56.150> LG<00:03:56.510> logo<00:03:56.780> and<00:03:57.139> then

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
and then you have the LG logo and then

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.589 
and then you have the LG logo and then

when<00:04:21.289> you<00:04:21.380> go<00:04:21.469> to<00:04:21.500> the<00:04:21.739> top<00:04:21.950> you

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
when you go to the top you

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.559 
when you go to the top you
your<00:04:22.949> headphone<00:04:23.949> jack<00:04:24.000> along<00:04:25.000> with<00:04:25.210> another

your headphone jack along with another
microphone<00:04:26.020> there<00:04:26.800> is<00:04:26.949> an<00:04:27.069> IR<00:04:27.430> blaster<00:04:27.460> and

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:27.909 
microphone there is an IR blaster and

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:29.850 
microphone there is an IR blaster and
this<00:04:28.479> is<00:04:28.629> very<00:04:28.960> cool<00:04:29.139> this<00:04:29.259> is<00:04:29.439> actually<00:04:29.740> the

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
this is very cool this is actually the

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.950 
this is very cool this is actually the
Korean<00:04:30.129> model<00:04:30.400> so<00:04:30.580> it<00:04:30.729> has<00:04:30.939> this<00:04:31.419> built-in

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
Korean model so it has this built-in

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.999 
Korean model so it has this built-in
antenna<00:04:32.530> which<00:04:33.310> allows<00:04:33.699> users<00:04:34.110> to<00:04:35.110> watch<00:04:35.439> TV

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
antenna which allows users to watch TV

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.670 
antenna which allows users to watch TV
now<00:04:36.189> which<00:04:36.490> is<00:04:36.639> kind<00:04:37.479> of<00:04:37.539> cool<00:04:37.750> but<00:04:38.080> I<00:04:38.349> don't

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
now which is kind of cool but I don't

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.830 
now which is kind of cool but I don't
think<00:04:38.830> you'll<00:04:38.919> be<00:04:38.979> able<00:04:39.280> to<00:04:39.370> use<00:04:40.240> this<00:04:40.479> very

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
think you'll be able to use this very

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.200 
think you'll be able to use this very
much<00:04:41.050> in<00:04:41.289> the<00:04:41.439> American<00:04:41.889> market<00:04:42.099> so<00:04:42.789> taking<00:04:43.180> a

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
much in the American market so taking a

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.550 
much in the American market so taking a
look<00:04:43.330> at<00:04:43.419> some<00:04:43.539> of<00:04:43.599> the<00:04:43.659> internals<00:04:44.169> it<00:04:44.319> has<00:04:44.530> a

that you're playing from any application
so<00:05:02.020> that'll<00:05:02.259> be<00:05:02.349> awesome<00:05:02.529> it<00:05:03.069> comes<00:05:03.310> in<00:05:03.490> two

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
so that'll be awesome it comes in two

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.110 
so that'll be awesome it comes in two
memory<00:05:04.150> sizes<00:05:04.389> 16<00:05:05.020> and<00:05:05.199> 32<00:05:05.590> gigabytes<00:05:06.069> what<00:05:07.029> it

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
memory sizes 16 and 32 gigabytes what it

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.589 
memory sizes 16 and 32 gigabytes what it
has<00:05:07.330> here<00:05:07.750> is<00:05:07.930> the<00:05:08.439> 32<00:05:08.830> gigabyte<00:05:09.129> version<00:05:09.729> it

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
has here is the 32 gigabyte version it

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:12.450 
has here is the 32 gigabyte version it
has<00:05:10.840> three<00:05:11.080> gigabytes<00:05:11.409> of<00:05:11.529> RAM<00:05:11.770> inside<00:05:12.129> so<00:05:12.370> you

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
has three gigabytes of RAM inside so you

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.570 
has three gigabytes of RAM inside so you
can<00:05:12.610> see<00:05:12.789> it's<00:05:12.969> one<00:05:13.090> of<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.770> nicer<00:05:14.770> phones<00:05:15.340> in

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
can see it's one of the nicer phones in

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.730 
can see it's one of the nicer phones in
