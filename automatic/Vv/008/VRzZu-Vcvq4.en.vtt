 from a photo in the window 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:31.390
 category i select from huawei and 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.190

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.369

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.830
 ok which is at the top right 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.900
 now I confirm the treatment of 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.009
 the photo by pressing the 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.259
 ok button at the top right the picture is 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.930
 processed by the application in a few 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.210
 seconds and then if the results pleases me 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.950
 I save it with the button 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.080
 looks like a floppy up to 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.090
 right 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.919
 so what you need to know is that the 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.140
 originals are not destroyed they are 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:15.900
 preserved since the application 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.569
 keep montages in a folder 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.930
 photofunia you can share 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.640
 directly your montages photos from 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.040
 the app on social networks 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.620
 like facebook 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.390
 in most photo montages 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.970
 the photo application was there offers me 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.580
 options like here i can add some 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.370
 the texture to mimic and accentuate the 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.420
 pellet paper or add color 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.400
 in the way crayons you 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.709

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.410
 video 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.090
