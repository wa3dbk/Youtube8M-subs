00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
cool i like the fact that he's wearing

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.990 
cool i like the fact that he's wearing
pants<00:05:46.150> I<00:05:46.740> don't<00:05:47.740> like<00:05:48.070> the<00:05:48.280> fact<00:05:48.550> that<00:05:48.760> they're

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
pants I don't like the fact that they're

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.960 
pants I don't like the fact that they're
not<00:05:49.120> real<00:05:49.420> denim<00:05:49.810> pants<00:05:50.470> that<00:05:51.460> they're<00:05:51.730> kind

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
not real denim pants that they're kind

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.500 
not real denim pants that they're kind
of<00:05:52.060> really<00:05:52.300> just<00:05:52.330> cheap<00:05:53.140> cloth<00:05:54.270> they<00:05:55.270> still

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
of really just cheap cloth they still

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.290 
of really just cheap cloth they still
look<00:05:55.540> good<00:05:55.840> for<00:05:56.140> pants<00:05:56.680> my<00:05:56.830> opinion<00:05:57.580> is<00:05:57.850> that

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
look good for pants my opinion is that

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.840 
look good for pants my opinion is that
they<00:05:58.660> should<00:05:59.020> have<00:05:59.350> used<00:05:59.620> dental<00:06:00.040> it<00:06:00.700> would

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
they should have used dental it would

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.300 
they should have used dental it would
have<00:06:00.970> looked<00:06:01.090> nicer<00:06:01.630> and<00:06:02.380> would<00:06:02.620> not<00:06:02.800> look<00:06:03.010> so

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310 
have looked nicer and would not look so

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.910 
have looked nicer and would not look so
cheaply<00:06:03.850> looking<00:06:06.600> for<00:06:07.600> some<00:06:07.900> kind<00:06:08.110> of<00:06:08.230> doom

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:08.920 
cheaply looking for some kind of doom

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.600 
cheaply looking for some kind of doom
but<00:06:09.280> I'm<00:06:09.970> not<00:06:10.120> really<00:06:10.270> sure<00:06:11.250> why<00:06:12.250> they<00:06:12.430> did

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
but I'm not really sure why they did

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.970 
but I'm not really sure why they did
that<00:06:12.640> but<00:06:12.970> it's<00:06:13.270> okay<00:06:13.540> does<00:06:14.440> it<00:06:14.560> have<00:06:14.710> to<00:06:14.740> use

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980 
that but it's okay does it have to use

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.740 
that but it's okay does it have to use
still<00:06:15.190> maybe<00:06:15.490> he<00:06:15.670> doesn't<00:06:15.820> worden<00:06:16.360> on<00:06:16.630> the

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
still maybe he doesn't worden on the

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.630 
still maybe he doesn't worden on the
show<00:06:16.960> I<00:06:17.260> think<00:06:17.590> dental<00:06:18.070> would<00:06:18.220> probably<00:06:18.550> look

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:18.640 
show I think dental would probably look

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.810 
show I think dental would probably look
a<00:06:18.970> little<00:06:19.360> bit<00:06:19.540> nicer<00:06:20.700> and<00:06:21.750> then<00:06:22.750> they're<00:06:22.930> his

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
a little bit nicer and then they're his

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.630 
a little bit nicer and then they're his
slippers<00:06:25.650> basically<00:06:26.650> they<00:06:26.800> look<00:06:26.950> like<00:06:27.070> deuces

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
slippers basically they look like deuces

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:33.330 
slippers basically they look like deuces

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
he comes with a mix can take it off if

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:46.380

you let me take it off of him and yeah
it<00:06:46.630> kind<00:06:47.500> of<00:06:47.530> leaves<00:06:47.740> the<00:06:47.950> mark<00:06:48.250> so<00:06:48.460> you<00:06:48.580> might

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:48.700 
it kind of leaves the mark so you might

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.430 
it kind of leaves the mark so you might
want<00:06:48.880> to<00:06:48.910> be<00:06:49.000> careful<00:06:49.030> I<00:06:49.860> don't<00:06:50.860> know<00:06:50.950> if<00:06:51.010> you

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
want to be careful I don't know if you

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.620 
want to be careful I don't know if you
see<00:06:51.620> it<00:06:51.770> may<00:06:52.100> not<00:06:53.110> but<00:06:54.940> think<00:06:55.940> I<00:06:56.120> seen<00:06:56.390> the

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:56.630 
see it may not but think I seen the

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.190 
see it may not but think I seen the
darkness<00:06:57.290> shady<00:06:58.010> park<00:06:58.550> there<00:06:59.050> all<00:07:00.050> right

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:00.200 
darkness shady park there all right

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.470 
darkness shady park there all right
there<00:07:01.060> it<00:07:02.060> does<00:07:02.270> leave<00:07:02.750> the<00:07:03.410> buffness<00:07:03.680> stain

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:04.480 
there it does leave the buffness stain

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.840 
there it does leave the buffness stain
so<00:07:05.480> he<00:07:05.690> might<00:07:05.840> have<00:07:06.020> that<00:07:06.230> light<00:07:07.160> colored<00:07:07.490> skin

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:07.850 
so he might have that light colored skin

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.090 
so he might have that light colored skin
since<00:07:08.690> this<00:07:08.780> yellow<00:07:09.140> that<00:07:09.440> stains<00:07:09.950> by<00:07:10.370> magenta

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:12.100 
since this yellow that stains by magenta

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:17.830 
since this yellow that stains by magenta
it<00:07:13.100> has<00:07:13.430> a<00:07:13.790> little<00:07:14.630> bit<00:07:15.160> pretty<00:07:16.160> cool<00:07:16.840> but
