 You do not have to be careful with religious issues 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:14.049
 religious feelings must not hurt 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:15.769
 that's where the freedom of speech ends 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.029

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.590
 Tolerance is foreign to the region, Christianity was not there 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.510

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.590
