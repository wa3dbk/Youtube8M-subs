basically what it is is your this man at
first<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.810> punch<00:00:31.109> these<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.830> scumbags

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
first and you punch these and scumbags

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.970 
first and you punch these and scumbags
and<00:00:34.700> your<00:00:35.700> life<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:35.910> strong<00:00:36.329> ammonia<00:00:36.770> and<00:00:37.770> then

do you mega drive version if ought to be

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.889 
do you mega drive version if ought to be
is<00:00:54.329> actually<00:00:55.020> very<00:00:55.550> very<00:00:56.570> true<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.750> the

version<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.870> water-based<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.710> actually

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
version of water-based is actually

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.630 
version of water-based is actually
probably<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.670> best<00:01:05.880> version

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640

think fast into the coil as you can see
now<00:01:12.640> I've<00:01:12.880> got<00:01:13.150> more<00:01:14.280> massive<00:01:15.280> power<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
now I've got more massive power the

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.930 
now I've got more massive power the
