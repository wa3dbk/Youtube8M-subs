film protecting thing from my iphone 4s
and<00:00:12.320> this<00:00:13.070> also<00:00:13.340> works<00:00:13.640> for<00:00:13.820> iphone<00:00:14.570> 4<00:00:14.960> this

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
and this also works for iphone 4 this

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.280 
and this also works for iphone 4 this
actually<00:00:15.920> is<00:00:16.400> made<00:00:16.700> by<00:00:16.970> company<00:00:17.840> called<00:00:18.050> wrap

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:18.290 
actually is made by company called wrap

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.870 
actually is made by company called wrap
so<00:00:18.560> I<00:00:18.800> picked<00:00:19.520> this<00:00:19.610> up<00:00:19.820> earlier<00:00:20.350> and<00:00:21.789> like<00:00:22.789> i

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
so I picked this up earlier and like i

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.430 
so I picked this up earlier and like i
said<00:00:22.940> this<00:00:23.180> does<00:00:23.450> work<00:00:23.480> for<00:00:23.690> the<00:00:23.930> iphone<00:00:24.110> 4s

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:24.440 
said this does work for the iphone 4s

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.460 
said this does work for the iphone 4s
but<00:00:25.010> as<00:00:25.220> you<00:00:25.400> can<00:00:25.550> see<00:00:25.789> here<00:00:26.240> it<00:00:26.570> does<00:00:27.020> say<00:00:27.230> just

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
but as you can see here it does say just

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.770 
but as you can see here it does say just
iphone<00:00:27.710> 4<00:00:27.980> but<00:00:28.760> they<00:00:28.940> just<00:00:29.090> haven't<00:00:29.420> changed

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:29.780 
iphone 4 but they just haven't changed

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.810 
iphone 4 but they just haven't changed
the<00:00:29.869> labeling<00:00:30.260> so<00:00:30.830> it<00:00:31.070> does<00:00:31.220> work<00:00:31.250> for<00:00:31.490> i<00:00:31.730> have

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
the labeling so it does work for i have

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.090 
the labeling so it does work for i have
before<00:00:32.090> us<00:00:32.119> just<00:00:32.239> be<00:00:32.840> aware<00:00:32.900> that<00:00:33.050> it<00:00:33.920> does

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
before us just be aware that it does

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.290 
before us just be aware that it does
work<00:00:34.280> for<00:00:34.310> it<00:00:34.550> if<00:00:34.640> you<00:00:34.730> want<00:00:34.880> to<00:00:34.940> check<00:00:35.120> this

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
work for it if you want to check this

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.970 
work for it if you want to check this
out<00:00:35.540> and<00:00:35.720> get<00:00:35.840> one<00:00:35.930> for<00:00:36.140> yourselves<00:00:36.530> and<00:00:36.620> as

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
out and get one for yourselves and as

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.770 
out and get one for yourselves and as
you<00:00:37.130> see<00:00:37.310> here<00:00:37.489> on<00:00:37.579> the<00:00:37.670> side<00:00:37.940> it<00:00:38.270> does<00:00:38.510> give

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
you see here on the side it does give

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.500 
you see here on the side it does give
you<00:00:38.899> little<00:00:39.050> specks<00:00:39.620> of<00:00:39.890> the<00:00:40.579> features<00:00:41.090> and

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
you little specks of the features and

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.380 
you little specks of the features and
all<00:00:41.660> that<00:00:41.870> stuff<00:00:42.190> I<00:00:43.190> know<00:00:43.579> we<00:00:43.790> can<00:00:43.820> really<00:00:44.120> tell

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
all that stuff I know we can really tell

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.710 
all that stuff I know we can really tell
but<00:00:44.600> it<00:00:44.750> does<00:00:45.050> say<00:00:45.350> here<00:00:45.380> right<00:00:45.829> here<00:00:46.040> on<00:00:46.100> the

but it does say here right here on the
on<00:00:47.720> that<00:00:47.780> book<00:00:48.380> it<00:00:48.530> says<00:00:48.680> application<00:00:49.370> process

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
on that book it says application process

seven<00:01:12.200> two<00:01:12.829> I<00:01:13.509> don't<00:01:14.509> know<00:01:14.569> if<00:01:14.630> you<00:01:14.689> could

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
seven two I don't know if you could

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.149 
seven two I don't know if you could
really<00:01:15.139> read<00:01:15.469> that<00:01:15.819> what<00:01:17.350> but<00:01:18.350> yeah<00:01:18.469> anyways

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
really read that what but yeah anyways

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.160 
really read that what but yeah anyways
that<00:01:19.399> this<00:01:19.700> does<00:01:19.939> protect<00:01:20.389> like<00:01:20.630> I<00:01:20.659> said<00:01:20.929> the

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
that this does protect like I said the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.940 
that this does protect like I said the
sides<00:01:21.499> and<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.069> back<00:01:22.729> and<00:01:22.999> the<00:01:23.359> front<00:01:23.709> so<00:01:24.709> it's

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
sides and the back and the front so it's

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.949 
sides and the back and the front so it's
pretty<00:01:25.189> cool<00:01:25.429> um<00:01:26.179> I<00:01:26.270> was<00:01:26.719> thinking<00:01:26.779> about

pretty cool um I was thinking about
getting<00:01:27.139> a<00:01:27.319> case<00:01:27.529> but<00:01:28.100> I'm<00:01:28.340> just<00:01:28.549> gonna<00:01:28.729> go

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:28.999 
getting a case but I'm just gonna go

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:31.120 
getting a case but I'm just gonna go
ahead<00:01:29.270> and<00:01:29.389> go<00:01:29.689> with<00:01:29.719> this<00:01:30.049> for<00:01:30.289> now<00:01:30.319> and<00:01:30.649> let's

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
ahead and go with this for now and let's

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.480 
ahead and go with this for now and let's
just<00:01:31.520> go<00:01:31.670> ahead<00:01:31.700> and<00:01:31.909> open<00:01:32.090> it<00:01:32.359> up<00:01:33.310> see<00:01:34.310> what's

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
just go ahead and open it up see what's

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.809 
just go ahead and open it up see what's
in<00:01:34.639> the<00:01:34.729> package<00:01:36.369> this<00:01:37.369> comes<00:01:37.700> out<00:01:39.639> what<00:01:40.639> else

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
in the package this comes out what else

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:48.279 
in the package this comes out what else
is<00:01:40.969> in<00:01:41.090> here<00:01:46.179> okay<00:01:47.179> I<00:01:47.209> think<00:01:47.689> that's<00:01:47.869> all<00:01:48.079> it's

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
is in here okay I think that's all it's

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.690 
is in here okay I think that's all it's
in<00:01:48.469> the<00:01:48.590> box<00:01:49.090> just<00:01:50.090> move<00:01:50.240> that<00:01:50.270> aside<00:01:50.810> so<00:01:51.709> let's

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
in the box just move that aside so let's

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.809 
in the box just move that aside so let's
see<00:01:52.939> we<00:01:53.179> got<00:01:53.209> a<00:01:53.689> little<00:01:54.259> towel<00:01:54.919> to<00:01:55.279> clean<00:01:55.549> off

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
see we got a little towel to clean off

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:58.809 
see we got a little towel to clean off
the<00:01:56.179> iphone<00:01:56.810> right<00:01:57.109> before<00:01:57.439> you<00:01:57.529> put<00:01:58.340> this<00:01:58.549> on

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
the iphone right before you put this on

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.559 
the iphone right before you put this on
and<00:01:59.179> then<00:01:59.630> we<00:01:59.719> got<00:01:59.899> the<00:02:00.079> little<00:02:00.229> side

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
and then we got the little side

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.379 
and then we got the little side
protectors<00:02:02.569> right<00:02:02.899> here<00:02:03.409> and<00:02:04.029> then<00:02:05.029> we<00:02:05.149> got<00:02:05.359> a

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:05.389 
protectors right here and then we got a

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:07.809 
protectors right here and then we got a
squeegee<00:02:05.989> which<00:02:06.770> is<00:02:06.950> like<00:02:07.130> a<00:02:07.159> piece<00:02:07.789> of

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
squeegee which is like a piece of

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.240 
squeegee which is like a piece of
cardboard<00:02:08.300> it<00:02:08.600> feels<00:02:08.840> like<00:02:09.100> look<00:02:10.100> like<00:02:10.220> a

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
cardboard it feels like look like a

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.120 
cardboard it feels like look like a
piece<00:02:10.430> of<00:02:10.460> cardboard<00:02:10.759> so<00:02:11.330> I<00:02:12.040> don't

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
piece of cardboard so I don't

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.580 
piece of cardboard so I don't
that<00:02:13.340> really<00:02:13.550> works<00:02:14.020> I'll<00:02:15.020> probably<00:02:15.230> just<00:02:15.380> use

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
that really works I'll probably just use

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.980 
that really works I'll probably just use
a<00:02:15.650> credit<00:02:15.890> card<00:02:16.040> or<00:02:16.280> something<00:02:16.490> and<00:02:16.850> then<00:02:17.780> we

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
a credit card or something and then we

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.350 
a credit card or something and then we
got<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:19.490> front<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.360> back<00:02:22.180> shields<00:02:23.180> right

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
got the front and the back shields right

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.340 
got the front and the back shields right
here<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:24.610> then<00:02:25.610> we<00:02:26.000> also<00:02:26.780> have<00:02:26.960> the

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
here and then we also have the

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.800 
here and then we also have the
instruction<00:02:27.950> manual<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:28.670> show<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.150> how<00:02:29.390> to<00:02:29.450> do

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
instruction manual to show you how to do

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.110 
instruction manual to show you how to do
it<00:02:29.990> and<00:02:30.170> all<00:02:30.980> that<00:02:31.250> stuff<00:02:31.460> so<00:02:33.910> that's<00:02:34.910> gonna<00:02:35.030> be

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
it for this little quick unboxing I'm

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.470 
it for this little quick unboxing I'm
actually<00:02:37.670> gonna<00:02:38.000> be<00:02:38.240> doing<00:02:38.570> a<00:02:38.780> video<00:02:40.480> review

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
actually gonna be doing a video review

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.960 
actually gonna be doing a video review
actually<00:02:42.050> over<00:02:42.290> it<00:02:42.410> whenever<00:02:43.130> I<00:02:43.340> actually<00:02:43.580> put

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
actually over it whenever I actually put

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.310 
actually over it whenever I actually put
it<00:02:44.090> all<00:02:44.210> in<00:02:44.360> here<00:02:44.740> so<00:02:46.690> we'll<00:02:47.690> just<00:02:47.990> have<00:02:48.170> to

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
it all in here so we'll just have to

00:02:48.320 --> 00:03:31.390 
it all in here so we'll just have to
wait<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:48.710> see<00:02:48.800> that<00:03:29.800> alright<00:03:30.800> guess<00:03:30.980> well<00:03:31.250> I'd

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
squeeze this all into one video the

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.120 
squeeze this all into one video the

here on the sides it does have

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.060 
here on the sides it does have
protection<00:03:57.170> on<00:03:57.290> there<00:03:57.470> let<00:03:57.650> me<00:03:57.680> try<00:03:57.890> to<00:03:57.950> zoom

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
protection on there let me try to zoom

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.910 
protection on there let me try to zoom
in<00:03:58.370> a<00:03:58.400> little<00:03:58.520> more<00:03:58.900> let<00:03:59.900> me<00:04:00.020> see<00:04:00.260> let's<00:04:00.860> see

in a little more let me see let's see
come<00:04:03.920> on<00:04:04.040> camera<00:04:06.820> there<00:04:07.820> we<00:04:07.970> go<00:04:08.209> there's

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
come on camera there we go there's

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.100 
come on camera there we go there's
little<00:04:09.140> piece<00:04:09.440> right<00:04:09.590> there<00:04:09.770> and<00:04:10.700> that<00:04:11.110> goes

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
little piece right there and that goes

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.830 
little piece right there and that goes
all<00:04:12.320> the<00:04:12.350> way<00:04:12.470> to<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:12.770> bottom<00:04:13.070> and<00:04:13.550> it<00:04:14.510> ends

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
all the way to the bottom and it ends

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.780 
all the way to the bottom and it ends
right<00:04:14.870> there<00:04:15.020> at<00:04:15.200> that<00:04:15.350> screw<00:04:15.770> and<00:04:16.100> then<00:04:16.640> the

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
right there at that screw and then the

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.780 
right there at that screw and then the
other<00:04:16.820> part<00:04:17.450> it<00:04:17.920> starts<00:04:18.920> at<00:04:19.040> the<00:04:19.130> screw<00:04:19.520> all

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
other part it starts at the screw all

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.600 
other part it starts at the screw all
the<00:04:19.850> way<00:04:20.270> to<00:04:20.500> where<00:04:21.500> the<00:04:21.620> SIM<00:04:21.859> card<00:04:22.100> tray<00:04:22.160> is

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
the way to where the SIM card tray is

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.640 
the way to where the SIM card tray is
that<00:04:22.850> if<00:04:23.120> you<00:04:23.450> have<00:04:23.600> a<00:04:23.630> SIM<00:04:23.900> card<00:04:24.110> tray<00:04:24.169> will

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
that if you have a SIM card tray will

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.379 
that if you have a SIM card tray will
end<00:04:24.919> right

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
end right

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.800 
end right
so<00:04:25.659> you'll<00:04:25.870> have<00:04:26.050> an<00:04:26.460> opening<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:27.819> insert<00:04:28.780> a

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
so you'll have an opening to insert a

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.369 
so you'll have an opening to insert a
SIM<00:04:29.289> card<00:04:29.650> and<00:04:30.009> then<00:04:30.639> it<00:04:30.819> keeps<00:04:31.030> going<00:04:31.389> up<00:04:31.810> here

00:04:32.369 --> 00:04:32.379 
SIM card and then it keeps going up here

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:35.879 
SIM card and then it keeps going up here
to<00:04:32.590> the<00:04:32.740> top<00:04:32.770> and<00:04:33.990> then<00:04:34.990> it<00:04:35.169> stops<00:04:35.469> right

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
to the top and then it stops right

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.219 
to the top and then it stops right
before<00:04:36.249> the<00:04:36.460> power<00:04:36.849> button<00:04:37.090> and<00:04:37.449> then<00:04:38.020> it<00:04:38.110> has

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
before the power button and then it has

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.559 
before the power button and then it has
a<00:04:38.259> little<00:04:38.499> middle<00:04:38.919> section<00:04:39.340> protection<00:04:40.029> right

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:40.569 
a little middle section protection right

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:45.929 
a little middle section protection right
here<00:04:41.050> or<00:04:42.330> in<00:04:43.330> between<00:04:43.509> your<00:04:44.349> mic<00:04:44.620> up<00:04:45.009> here<00:04:45.789> and

00:04:45.929 --> 00:04:45.939 
here or in between your mic up here and

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:48.719 
here or in between your mic up here and
your<00:04:46.749> power<00:04:47.050> button<00:04:47.499> and<00:04:47.680> then<00:04:48.430> it<00:04:48.550> has<00:04:48.699> a

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
your power button and then it has a

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.230 
your power button and then it has a
little<00:04:49.029> section<00:04:49.419> for<00:04:49.870> the<00:04:50.469> headphone<00:04:51.189> jack<00:04:51.240> so

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
little section for the headphone jack so

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.459 
little section for the headphone jack so
you'll<00:04:52.360> have<00:04:52.479> to<00:04:52.599> worry<00:04:52.749> about<00:04:52.870> that<00:04:53.229> of

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:53.469 
you'll have to worry about that of

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:56.159 
you'll have to worry about that of
course<00:04:54.189> because<00:04:55.120> I'll<00:04:55.330> be<00:04:55.449> pretty<00:04:55.629> dumb<00:04:55.900> if

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
course because I'll be pretty dumb if

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.129 
course because I'll be pretty dumb if
they<00:04:56.379> covered<00:04:56.800> it<00:04:56.919> but<00:04:57.509> anyways<00:04:58.509> that<00:04:58.779> then

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
they covered it but anyways that then

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.010 
they covered it but anyways that then
they<00:04:59.259> have<00:04:59.379> a<00:04:59.409> little<00:04:59.680> piece<00:04:59.949> right<00:05:00.069> here<00:05:00.250> and

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
they have a little piece right here and

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.110 
they have a little piece right here and
that's<00:05:02.020> about<00:05:02.229> it<00:05:02.759> the<00:05:03.759> front<00:05:04.349> facing

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
that's about it the front facing

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.369 
that's about it the front facing
protection<00:05:07.120> it<00:05:07.300> responds<00:05:08.110> really<00:05:08.229> well

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:08.379 
protection it responds really well
