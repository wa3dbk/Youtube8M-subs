00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
that so maybe if I practice and practice

I'll<00:04:22.690> be<00:04:22.840> to<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.050> point<00:04:23.289> where<00:04:23.500> I'll<00:04:23.740> be<00:04:23.919> able

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:23.949 
I'll be to the point where I'll be able

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:26.189

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:26.199 
to just do it without hesitating and

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:27.300 
to just do it without hesitating and
without<00:04:26.440> fighting<00:04:26.680> hence<00:04:27.009> one<00:04:27.160> of<00:04:27.250> the

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
without fighting hence one of the

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.540 
without fighting hence one of the
workshops<00:04:27.789> it's<00:04:28.449> so<00:04:28.810> hardcore<00:04:29.259> that<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:30.310> next

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
workshops it's so hardcore that the next

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.830 
workshops it's so hardcore that the next
week<00:04:30.699> you<00:04:30.789> can<00:04:30.940> hardly<00:04:31.180> walk

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
week you can hardly walk

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.920 
week you can hardly walk
and<00:04:32.289> because<00:04:32.770> just<00:04:33.250> so<00:04:33.849> unfit<00:04:34.330> instead<00:04:34.810> of

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
and because just so unfit instead of

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.240 
and because just so unfit instead of
kind<00:04:35.259> of<00:04:35.289> free<00:04:35.470> run<00:04:35.620> is<00:04:35.740> more<00:04:35.919> like<00:04:36.070> free

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
kind of free run is more like free

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.909 
kind of free run is more like free
falling<00:04:36.460> for<00:04:36.820> me<00:04:36.880> at<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.030> moment<00:04:37.919> there's

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
falling for me at the moment there's

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:40.950 
falling for me at the moment there's
like<00:04:39.099> the<00:04:39.220> sandwiches<00:04:39.880> it's<00:04:40.300> better<00:04:40.570> to<00:04:40.690> splat

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
like the sandwiches it's better to splat

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.330 
like the sandwiches it's better to splat
on<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.139> mat<00:04:41.380> than<00:04:41.560> food<00:04:41.740> dead<00:04:41.919> meat<00:04:42.099> on<00:04:42.250> the

on the mat than food dead meat on the

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.129 
on the mat than food dead meat on the
street<00:04:42.639> training<00:04:43.449> gets<00:04:43.660> harder<00:04:43.930> than

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
street training gets harder than

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.100 
street training gets harder than
actually<00:04:44.949> doing<00:04:45.190> this<00:04:45.539> when<00:04:46.539> you<00:04:46.630> see<00:04:46.810> on<00:04:46.990> the

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
actually doing this when you see on the

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.230 
actually doing this when you see on the
videos<00:04:47.500> you<00:04:47.860> think<00:04:48.039> the<00:04:48.130> guy<00:04:48.280> just<00:04:48.550> thought<00:04:49.120> of

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
videos you think the guy just thought of

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.029 
videos you think the guy just thought of
it<00:04:49.360> and<00:04:49.449> they've<00:04:49.539> done<00:04:49.840> it<00:04:49.990> but<00:04:50.110> actually<00:04:50.530> you

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
it and they've done it but actually you

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:52.680 
it and they've done it but actually you
don't<00:04:51.160> see<00:04:51.400> how<00:04:51.669> hard<00:04:51.880> you<00:04:52.000> work<00:04:52.180> for<00:04:52.360> it<00:04:52.479> I

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
don't see how hard you work for it I

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.870 
don't see how hard you work for it I
really<00:04:53.349> expected<00:04:53.740> it<00:04:53.860> to<00:04:53.949> be<00:04:54.009> competitive<00:04:54.639> and

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
really expected it to be competitive and

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.850 
really expected it to be competitive and
just<00:04:55.330> it<00:04:55.570> is<00:04:55.780> it<00:04:55.990> isn't<00:04:56.139> at<00:04:56.380> all<00:04:56.470> they're<00:04:56.770> all

the<00:05:52.210> world<00:05:52.479> and<00:05:52.810> I<00:05:53.080> think<00:05:53.110> any<00:05:53.530> sport<00:05:53.889> can<00:05:54.039> do

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:54.159 
the world and I think any sport can do

the world and I think any sport can do
that<00:05:54.340> particularly<00:05:54.699> parkour<00:05:55.330> I<00:05:55.509> think<00:05:56.050> it<00:05:56.139> has

00:05:58.499 --> 00:05:58.509 
qualities that no other sport has it's
