00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
say it again NCAA 12 and my opinion is a

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.740 
say it again NCAA 12 and my opinion is a
playable<00:00:51.629> game<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> fun<00:00:53.460> game<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.719> can

playable game it is a fun game and I can
get<00:00:55.020> enjoyment<00:00:55.440> out<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.920> game<00:00:56.180> but<00:00:57.180> at<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
get enjoyment out of the game but at the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.420 
get enjoyment out of the game but at the
same<00:00:57.870> time<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.469> that's<00:00:58.559> very<00:00:59.070> big<00:00:59.430> but<00:01:00.020> but<00:01:01.430> it

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
same time and that's very big but but it

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.500 
same time and that's very big but but it
is<00:01:02.699> not<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.270> true<00:01:03.570> simulation<00:01:04.850> it<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.030> not<00:01:06.299> up<00:01:06.479> to

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
is not a true simulation it is not up to

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.080 
is not a true simulation it is not up to
par<00:01:06.659> up<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.799> standards<00:01:08.340> where<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.820> would

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
par up to the standards where I would

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.539 
par up to the standards where I would
like<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.240> see<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> game<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:11.040> day<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.310> age

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
like to see a game in this day and age

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.600 
like to see a game in this day and age
that's<00:01:12.390> considered<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.020> simulation<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.250> I'm

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
that's considered a simulation and I'm

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.980 
that's considered a simulation and I'm
going<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.850> explain<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.360> briefly<00:01:15.659> two

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
going to explain to you briefly two

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.830 
going to explain to you briefly two
things<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.340> think<00:01:17.729> keep<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.420> game<00:01:18.630> from

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
things that I think keep the game from

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.890 
things that I think keep the game from
being<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.170> simulation<00:01:19.770> am<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:21.150> again<00:01:21.630> like<00:01:21.810> I

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
being a simulation am I and again like I

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.749 
being a simulation am I and again like I
said<00:01:21.930> well<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.590> what<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.770> think<00:01:23.250> but

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
said well this is what I think but

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.370 
said well this is what I think but
there's<00:01:23.939> several<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.630> us<00:01:24.780> here<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
there's several of us here in the

community here at tss that have various
different<00:01:29.490> reasons<00:01:29.850> why<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.060> game<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.390> by<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
different reasons why the game is by the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.020 
different reasons why the game is by the
sin<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.140> we've<00:01:31.320> all<00:01:31.560> come<00:01:31.799> together

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030

collectively<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.600> we've<00:01:34.140> agreed<00:01:34.439> but<00:01:35.130> I

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
collectively and we've agreed but I

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.530 
collectively and we've agreed but I
don't<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.520> lot<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.729> time<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.240> spend<00:01:36.270> in

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
don't have a lot of time to spend in

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.899 
don't have a lot of time to spend in
this<00:01:36.659> video<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.110> address<00:01:37.799> everything<00:01:38.220> but

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
this video to address everything but

these are some of the big concerns for

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.280 
these are some of the big concerns for

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
me first and foremost of running

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.260 
me first and foremost of running
animations<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.759> know<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.000> running

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
animations you know the running

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.300 
animations you know the running
animations<00:01:45.840> have<00:01:46.049> not<00:01:46.290> been<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.560> same<00:01:46.680> have

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
animations have not been the same have

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.030 
animations have not been the same have
not<00:01:47.579> been<00:01:47.850> truly<00:01:48.840> realistic<00:01:49.350> since<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
not been truly realistic since the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.160 
not been truly realistic since the
previous<00:01:50.280> jam<00:01:50.759> whatever<00:01:51.630> happened<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.110> that

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
previous jam whatever happened to that

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.040 
previous jam whatever happened to that
you've<00:01:53.070> all<00:01:53.250> seen<00:01:53.579> that

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
you've all seen that

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.920 
you've all seen that
for<00:01:54.580> we<00:01:55.580> saw<00:01:55.790> how<00:01:56.000> good<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.390> running<00:01:56.720> looked

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
for we saw how good the running looked

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.390 
for we saw how good the running looked
into<00:01:57.290> how<00:01:57.410> fluid<00:01:57.890> it<00:01:58.010> was<00:01:58.190> what<00:01:59.150> happened<00:02:00.400> also
