00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.600
 two categories a and b the 2012 championship 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.480
 of rb remains an excellent 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.940
 alternative for pilots looking for 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.430
 competition at a reduced cost 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.579

 There are three stages to 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:08.729
 close the year in the sixth step 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:10.200
 There for 89 to stage the story of 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.630
 trinity couple is a kart track 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.600
 excellent a catholic that every pilot 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.780
 even more the category rd 135 loves 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.700
 because it is a fast circuit Saturday the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.100
 activities in the kart track had a 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.890
 beginning early with the opening of the track 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.439
 for free practice and then immediately the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.890
 taking the time to set the grid drop 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.680
 in the fight for the title two drivers well 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:40.079
 known the difference minute lucas one 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:42.240
 point is at 33 1 434 points so if 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.399
 I was well rated today and 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.520
 he does not score 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.680
 I'm definitely going to open a good advantage. 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.720
 faith can win I think the dollar will not 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.240
 get it but if I win 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.770
 the champion is by category to the pilot 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.860
 Lucas would have left on Monday 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.830
 position in the first heat has proved 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.590
 conservative watching closely 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.800
 the leader eduardo martins who won 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.440
 end to end in the second battery the order 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.140
 was the same with Eduardo 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.050
 martins dropping at the end followed by 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.010
 lucas faria and uelliton teles the third 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.270
 their first race after 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.820
 months without competing 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.730
 different from the previous battery eduardo 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.190
 martins dropped on the end and had problems 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.130
 with its gearshift lever leaving the 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.410
 way to lucas would cross in 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.600
 first followed by wellington 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.990
 second in category b 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.959
 the winner was carlos esa with where the tel 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.360
 second and ivan fernandes the third 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:49.830
 was great stage is very pilots of this 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:52.950
 time I think the selection and also in the fight 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.830
 Next game eduardo is broke but 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.260
 also in the end everything worked out 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.300
 explaining the union of this group is something 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.530
 exceeds the comprehension of any 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.350
 lay on the subject 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.120
 stay for hours under a hot sun 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.190
 without infrastructure and in the late afternoon 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.790
 get a simple smile 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:15.269
 of the pilots is the pure demonstration that 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.160
 marching and singing karts add and 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.630
 are needed in any race 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.510
 approved in the capital 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.580
 and passion is the explanation for the 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.970
 category success 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.280
 a big one for that there is alleging that the 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.280
 community he gave the personal likes very much 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.320
 to read and ask you to do so 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.030
 rb race as you said 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.519
 even with this lack of network structure 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.049
 brings of what I have that can give you a 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.440
 way to come because we really 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:46.530
 really like the rbr of a big family 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.810
 everyone helps everyone and with it the 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:53.640
 people can gather and 17 to 20 boxes 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:56.160
 on the grid and as I said friendship does 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.620
 the difference and it's a category I have 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.950
 enough time and we will give sequence and 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.780
 increasingly strengthening more and more 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.670
 outside the official calendar is 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.290
 something that local leaders should 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.599
 think about 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:15.450
 the next meeting will be at the kart track 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:15.450
 goias now accelerate opera
