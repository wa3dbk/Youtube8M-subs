00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:09.080
 Hey, people, good morning. It's day. 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:14.580
 best graphic apps and then though 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:17.190
 good and the first ep is the trio ex team 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.400
 is a motorcycle game where your goal is 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.619
 arriving is completing the route it's time to 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.949
 obstacles and tals in the middle of more than one 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.500
 from a path on a trail where you 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.380
 will encounter several obstacles such as 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.450
 example is tree trunks will 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.670
 find ramps have a few reed 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.309
 bizarre obstacles also a nothing to see 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.059
 Mixed container type but the game is well 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.340
 cool 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.200
 the game in 3d the game graphic 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.329
 impresses quite precisely because it is 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.120
 very well done unfortunately in the version 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.739
 game only finds 15 phase not 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.350
 I know why this is because the guys 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.960
 put in so few stages but that's it. 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.820
 you control your bike with touches on the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.680
 acceleration and braking and can also 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.239
 direct your character to boost 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.739
 forward or backward with 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.500
 see operating or by touching the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.510
 screen too so it was great in a game 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.670
 very nice and even having few houses 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.590
 it's worth you to play though 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.890
 next 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:17.159
 Good guys, the next one is the plate. 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.740
 a cool strategy game where 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.170
 goal is quite different where you 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.360
 control an illness you the creator of 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.000
 a disease and you have to take all 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.829
 humanity with this disease kills there the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.680
 hint all mankind 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.329
 The game is very smart, you go. 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.770
 evolving the influence of countries in 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.020
 paradise to vote subtitled in Portuguese 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.520
 so it makes things a lot easier 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.619
 You choose the country where you have the 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.009
 disease begins and it will start 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.049
 contaminate people first sound 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.700
 tens then hundreds of thousands 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.810
 of people all over the world 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.399
 you can choose a country to 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.960
 independence will start you can 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.240
 to evolve over the broadcast 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.979
 you can put stones to transmit 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.810
 more easily by birds through 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.340
 fast by blood and water 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.640
 you can see her symptoms that she 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.750
 will cause what it is to catch her eyes 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.520
 The owner's name is to make 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.410
 several options to evolve your illness and 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.600
 fight against the cure that humans will 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.820
 try 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.890
 is to develop in order to eradicate this 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.020
 disease then click a game for you that 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.360
 like a good strategy game 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.050
 there in that game then beauty though pro 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.170
 Next, the next good thing is that the 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.490
 cd guedes will only use the complicated name 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.470
 but let's go 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.860
 This game in this game you 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.020
 famous action film character jet and 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.540
 You have to survive a wave of 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.520
 zombies on various maps have to be well 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.740
 cool is a third-person shooter 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.050
 who is also positioned through 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.790
 So the character then you 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.350
 can see a large area there 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.140
 where you late where your enemies 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.900
 are your goal is to reach a 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.240
 platform where you will be taken to 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.370
 the next stage and survived zombies that 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.240
 Tim Condon will try to stop you to 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.860
 get there 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.870
 The game is cool because when you're done 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.930
 to kill a wave before a month ago 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.790
 example on 5 Sunday you kill 4 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.360
 at the time you kill the last fifth 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.520
 sumbe is the death of steam as well or motion 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.440
 and you can see a liquid of blood 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.160
 It 's very strange of his body but it's okay. 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.380
 also the variety of weapons in the 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.930
 game is very big are four in total 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.060
 with a pistol a 12 one that 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.170
 I looked thinner do not know right and 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.350
 grenade launcher 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.150
 but you can opt for they increase 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.120
 year is the fastest among others 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.460
 things then those of ideas for you either 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.770
 a game not too heavy but still 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.460
 very fun beauty then although the 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.460
 next 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.630
 good guys here the next and the split pike 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.260
 the application very interesting and nice 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.990
 also 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.110
 on it you can join two images 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.030
 like you're just a nice one, you 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.890
 could have had the input of 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.610
 half a bone of one person from one 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.770
 a friend of yours 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.720
 half of the other's face and managed to 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.550
 join the two images 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.800
 you are still seeing when 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.440
 I took this photo in Copinha takes 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.780
 Focus on the front of her I turned her and 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.300
 I took the portugal again in the 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.610
 front of the van and my two later 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.530
 they look like an image under a 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.140
 cane 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.940
 you have several options to get it out of the 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.710
 half of a photo you can take the 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.930
 left-wing parliamentarian on the right 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.790
 is from above, then the part of 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.650
 Down is so cool. 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.290
 now you are seeing in zinc where 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.880
 I took a photo of two different eggs from 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.250
 part of me and the bottom 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.380
 with other of kitchens images you see 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.810
 and that before that line Munich 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.220
 with the classic line and just adjust the 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.420
 which joins the two images 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.280
 the epp also features a gallery 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.020
 difficult basic well do not expect to find 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.910
 the best effects but still 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.230
 broke the twig beauty so it's okay 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:58.690
 Creative this though close 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:02.320
 good guys and last and want to show 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.840
 You inlay is pink good. 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.120
 another rather than two and this time 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.230
 with a different theme here is 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.900
 dead 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.880
 The goal of the game is to hit the mark. 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.740
 the points kill them only this time 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.300
 the birds get bus powers 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.540
 they get to play analyzed 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.000
 other famous lightsabers and others in the 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.640
 can do this with the reinforcement of 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.350
 push objects but the famous darth 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:30.230
 vader the villain of the series appears in the game 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.240
 logical as a villain out there in the game beauty 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.970
 the wheels are deer finds doing 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.300
 stage in places out there too 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.490

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.680
 Scenarios are also very varied objects 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.290
