00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
and I think that's a very important

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.780 
and I think that's a very important
thing<00:01:37.530> especially<00:01:38.130> when<00:01:38.549> you're<00:01:38.670> holding

thing especially when you're holding

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.510 
thing especially when you're holding
twenty<00:01:39.600> rounds<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:40.079> three-inch<00:01:40.710> double-o

twenty rounds of three-inch double-o

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.249 
twenty rounds of three-inch double-o
buck<00:01:41.790> because<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.630> magazine<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.140> get

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.289 
rather heavy and if you drop the gun
there's<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.100> possibility<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.909> magazine

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
there's a possibility that the magazine

there's a possibility that the magazine
could<00:01:48.450> break<00:01:48.720> or<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.530> lip<00:01:49.680> could<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:49.979> snap

holes trigger put it in repaint the gun

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.950 
holes trigger put it in repaint the gun
but<00:05:51.810> the<00:05:52.350> reason<00:05:52.650> I<00:05:52.710> like<00:05:52.950> this<00:05:53.130> is<00:05:53.310> because

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
but the reason I like this is because

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.320 
but the reason I like this is because
you<00:05:54.960> can<00:05:55.229> put<00:05:55.770> a<00:05:55.919> standard<00:05:56.430> box<00:05:56.639> magazine<00:05:57.180> in

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
you can put a standard box magazine in

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.440 
you can put a standard box magazine in
promote<00:05:57.840> it<00:05:58.020> with<00:05:58.680> the<00:05:59.010> bolt<00:05:59.190> closed<00:05:59.729> it's

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450 
promote it with the bolt closed it's

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.969 
promote it with the bolt closed it's
kind<00:06:00.720> of<00:06:00.780> a<00:06:00.870> pain<00:06:01.050> in<00:06:01.169> the<00:06:01.200> ass<00:06:02.870> it's<00:06:03.870> about<00:06:04.680> 10

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
kind of a pain in the ass it's about 10

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:06.650 
kind of a pain in the ass it's about 10
times<00:06:05.220> easier<00:06:05.430> to<00:06:05.669> put<00:06:05.820> the<00:06:05.910> magazine<00:06:06.300> in<00:06:06.330> when

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
times easier to put the magazine in when

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.310

where my fingers not on the trigger it's
just<00:06:28.320> an<00:06:28.440> ageneral<00:06:28.830> position<00:06:29.220> it<00:06:29.310> would<00:06:29.430> be<00:06:29.550> if

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:29.760 
just an ageneral position it would be if

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.640 
just an ageneral position it would be if
I<00:06:29.850> wasn't<00:06:30.090> you<00:06:30.479> know<00:06:30.600> pointing<00:06:31.289> at<00:06:31.440> something

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
I wasn't you know pointing at something

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.100 
I wasn't you know pointing at something
I<00:06:31.830> was<00:06:31.950> intending<00:06:32.310> to<00:06:32.340> shoot<00:06:32.660> so<00:06:33.660> that's<00:06:33.990> a

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
I was intending to shoot so that's a

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.510 
I was intending to shoot so that's a
natural<00:06:34.260> position<00:06:34.710> so<00:06:35.250> I<00:06:35.280> just<00:06:35.610> you<00:06:35.729> know<00:06:37.520> get

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
natural position so I just you know get

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.020 
natural position so I just you know get
the<00:06:38.700> bolt<00:06:39.120> stop<00:06:39.390> with<00:06:39.690> my<00:06:39.870> finger<00:06:40.560> right<00:06:40.710> there

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.030 
the bolt stop with my finger right there

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.760 
the bolt stop with my finger right there
stops<00:06:42.030> the<00:06:42.210> bolt<00:06:42.419> you<00:06:42.720> okay

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
stops the bolt you okay

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.730 
stops the bolt you okay
trigger<00:06:44.280> configuration<00:06:45.020> B<00:06:46.020> rear<00:06:46.590> of<00:06:46.680> the

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
trigger configuration B rear of the

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.980 
trigger configuration B rear of the
trigger<00:06:46.890> guard<00:06:47.160> would<00:06:47.490> be<00:06:47.640> right<00:06:47.850> here<00:06:48.300> so

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:48.990 
trigger guard would be right here so

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.080 
trigger guard would be right here so
you'd<00:06:49.110> have<00:06:49.140> to<00:06:49.350> clinch<00:06:49.650> your<00:06:49.770> finger<00:06:50.280> all<00:06:50.880> the

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090 
you'd have to clinch your finger all the

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.140 
you'd have to clinch your finger all the
way<00:06:51.180> down<00:06:51.450> and<00:06:52.440> then<00:06:52.650> we're<00:06:52.889> back<00:06:52.919> I<00:06:53.550> just

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
way down and then we're back I just

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.279 
way down and then we're back I just
think<00:06:54.330> this<00:06:54.389> is<00:06:54.450> quicker<00:06:54.810> and<00:06:54.930> more

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:55.289 
think this is quicker and more

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:56.900 
think this is quicker and more
comfortable<00:06:55.740> that's<00:06:56.010> why<00:06:56.190> I<00:06:56.220> left<00:06:56.520> my<00:06:56.639> hey

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:56.910 
comfortable that's why I left my hey

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:57.800 
comfortable that's why I left my hey
