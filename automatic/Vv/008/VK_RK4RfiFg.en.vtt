00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.320
 files as they were online and here 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.480
 we came back after 10 days of being 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.039
 completely absent because I was leaving 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.890
 life in the ass gave me a diarrhea 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.140
 incredible and well for me to tell you 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.180
 ladies and gentlemen but you know that this is not 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.789
 it's about my elimination habits 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.400
 corporeal but of some news that 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.439
 we have for you in first good the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.020
 megalodon you already know that it was discovered that 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.390
 they activated it in the pizza cti that has 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.520
 a lovely video about it with all 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.020
 the options to do it we do not 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.879
 we did because there were many imbeciles 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.040
 that they were destroying us all 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.289
 fucking palm trees and we never managed to record 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.270
 but go go to that pizza video 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.800
 because it is very very good that when 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.430
 we will be able to see it at the end of the accounts 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.580
 apparently 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.700
 very good but this is not all ladies and 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:01.270
 Gentlemen this is not the only one and be the one 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.489
 is going to be taking out in those days there 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.600
 an interest for a kind of 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:10.120
 collaborator ex competitive player who 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.220
 no longer engaged in that for something will be that 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.660
 it's called ex factor is a very friend 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.600
 close to mild there were some of 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.210
 you know him if the former himself 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.640
 factor that in our time accused our 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.000
 beloved champion of europe win young of 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.100
 use hacks and he did relax around 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.080
 the internet and it turned out to be a lie and 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.759
 they were like liars and for that 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.979
 I leave a link in the description but 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.680
 it's about this being saying 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.360
 gossip but this gentleman 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.860
 fortunately regardless of 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.310
 that has raised false collaborates 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.899
 very much much much much with the ct a 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.000
 such a degree that the Lord has a server 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.310
 private that the guys from 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.500
 dais and the man is reporting 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.149
 things of the good ct it turns out that in these 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.580
 last deliveries except now because 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.620
 the sprint patch is active now 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.620
 I'll talk to you right now about the respect 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.570
 good he collaborates a lot and you gave him 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.750
 they decided forgiveness of you giving away a 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.550
 mister that we still do not know what is 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.280
 they just told him it has to do with 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.370
 your game mode or something like that and 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.730
 well the man loves the map 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.190
 For him he likes to use the look up 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.290
 but you use it basically yes it is a 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.810
 master of the place of the Lord use 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.250
 a lot of the rpg is the patrol boats and 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.550
 the birds 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.790
 they told me play eventually heavy 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.070
 so there's someone to youtuber what good 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.860
 if it's not so as famous as lb the 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.200
 cap they dedicated the capo jack 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.540
 frost gave him a strike 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.430
 so this speaks very well that the the 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.320
 people up there pay attention to what 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.550
 what is done here in the community and good 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.650
 that is another thing that remains to be discovered 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.080
 but it will be later in the ct 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.640
 They took the 7 she is active the patch 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.440
 spring that spring does not have 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.840
 they do not have what my radish has 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.730
 German but the truth is that it was delayed 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.340
 a lot has been delayed a lot and they're going to see 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.600
 certain improvements does not come all that 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.040
 we have been waiting 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.700
 I think the act does not come 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.310
 and not any of that but they're going to see improvements 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.950
 the net with this they will see more vehicles 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.109
 fast is going to improve the stuttgart 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.390
 I ingo the slight stutter that then there 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:18.489
 that as if one or two were repeated 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.730
 pictures and that's called this I have 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.859
 stutter in the multiplayer is also 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.840
 something added a status update 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.530
 fastest for all types of 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.909
 positions for example if you were 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.829
 chest earth and suddenly they killed you 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:35.079
 because you had already changed 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.700
 squatting and they killed you from behind 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.470
 a good wall all those changes of 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.510
 position are already going to report faster 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.280
 to the server which means that it 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.959
 will update more quickly so 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.909
 that's also going to change they're going to 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.319
 improve the robert van dyck or that feel 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:49.720
 that you go ahead and from 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.629
 suddenly something pulls you backwards it's going to 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.549
 improve this smoothing of network use 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.799
 today do not know how they have put him in English 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.769
 is networks very useful factor is going to 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.810
 remove completely because it has already 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.060
 improved data transmission in the 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.420
 servers and also something very good is 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.970
 that is going to reduce the advantage 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.520
 even more than the players have 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.230
 high ping these very good news already 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.600
 players with high ping are going to have 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.370
 less advantage than they had before 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.750
 and that honestly is disgusting because 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.210
 he shot them if they did not die 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.830
 condemned and there is also a very rumor 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.780
 We handle it like a rumor because 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.169
 there is still nothing confirmed by part 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:33.190
 of them I have seen that all 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:35.440
 dlc is that they continue from now on they will 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.970
 be free for all users 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.220
 both players that animations of the 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.870
 base game like those that have premium and 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.610
 What we mean by this is what 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.160
 lack good you know that missing the 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.500
 night maps are missing that you take out the 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.169
 new dlc with new weapons and mode 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.760
 of a master's degree they need to take out the map 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.350
 of the community that takes some advances 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.790
 great and later on 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.760
 we will talk as the more mature 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.350
 project and remember that we also 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.240
 they did a survey of which maps 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.370
 we wanted them to be redone for several 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.229
 figures so all this content goes to 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.880
 come for all types of users 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:08.560
 I tell them that we have not been confirmed yet 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.110
 it's a very strong rumor but if the river 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.969
 sounds is that water carries so ladies 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.889
 and gentlemen that is 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:16.360
 that comes later we will already be 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.389
 testing in fact if you follow the 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.499
 ct can try the spring patch 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.119
 Currently, the truth is that it's worth 

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:24.069
 the pain to prove it to me has encouraged me 

00:05:22.119 --> 00:05:25.959
 a lot because I tell them that's what I 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:28.209
 is going to come back on the 4th I'm sick of it 

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:29.919
 he shot them and they do not move or the bullets 

00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:31.749
 they do not go where I want now 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.219
 and now it feels fine me 

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:34.689
 he recalled that these updates are going to 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:36.729
 leave for all platforms all 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:38.889
 the consoles and pc do not worry about 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:41.799
 none of this I want to know you that 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:43.749
 would like to see extra later what is 

00:05:41.799 --> 00:05:46.179
 what they want me to go what is what 

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:48.759
 they want to get rid of these things like this 

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:50.379
 what good ladies and gentlemen and I want that 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:52.089
 opinion in the comments already know 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:54.519
 you create the social networks of 

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:55.989
 facebook 3 buy with our link in 

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:58.389
 generous because the truth the games 

00:05:55.989 --> 00:06:00.459
 airs are very cheap and depend 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.829
 app offers of the situation of the 

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:06.219
 days but it's cheaper in general in 

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:10.289
 g2am and good gentlemen gentlemen says goodbye 

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:10.289
 you in now poyo and see you the action 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.599

 what development
