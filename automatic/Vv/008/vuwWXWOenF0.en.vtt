00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
and when I'm using 110

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.029 
and when I'm using 110
I'm<00:00:47.640> pretty<00:00:48.000> much<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.480> BMI<00:00:49.260> guy<00:00:49.500> these<00:00:49.739> traps

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
I'm pretty much a BMI guy these traps

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.279 
I'm pretty much a BMI guy these traps
are<00:00:50.309> not<00:00:50.850> easy<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.300> find<00:00:51.510> but<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.840> think<00:00:52.079> there's

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289

are not easy to find but I think there's
some<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.590> most<00:00:52.739> sensitive<00:00:52.980> traps<00:00:53.780> that

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
some of the most sensitive traps that

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.689 
some of the most sensitive traps that
you<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.110> buy<00:00:55.320> which<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.770> important<00:00:56.430> when

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
you can buy which is important when

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.490 
you can buy which is important when

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
dimensions and one thing that you'll

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.270 
dimensions and one thing that you'll
notice<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.720> when<00:01:06.720> set<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.860> outer<00:01:08.040> most

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
notice is when set in the outer most

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.320 
notice is when set in the outer most
trigger<00:01:08.610> position<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.200> not<00:01:10.409> very<00:01:10.619> stable

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
trigger position this is not very stable

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.670 
trigger position this is not very stable
this<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.510> mean<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:12.810> just<00:01:13.049> isn't<00:01:13.380> gonna<00:01:13.470> work

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
this I mean this just isn't gonna work

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.179 
this I mean this just isn't gonna work
that'll<00:01:13.979> come<00:01:14.159> right<00:01:14.430> off<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:16.170> stabilizer<00:01:16.710> so

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
that'll come right off the stabilizer so

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.270 
that'll come right off the stabilizer so
that<00:01:17.400> that's<00:01:18.390> not<00:01:18.570> gonna<00:01:18.720> work<00:01:19.020> now<00:01:19.770> if<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.009> try

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
that that's not gonna work now if I try

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.080 
that that's not gonna work now if I try
and<00:01:20.490> move<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.780> second<00:01:22.200> trigger<00:01:22.470> I

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
and move this to the second trigger I

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.630 
and move this to the second trigger I
can<00:01:24.090> get<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.479> but<00:01:24.750> that's<00:01:24.990> extremely<00:01:25.640> tight

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
can get it but that's extremely tight

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.870 
can get it but that's extremely tight
and<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.869> has<00:01:28.170> made<00:01:28.200> my<00:01:28.619> attention<00:01:29.100> my

wiggle here so let me do some
modification<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.869> what<00:01:54.960> I'm<00:01:55.079> going<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.229> do<00:01:55.380> is

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
modification and what I'm going to do is

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.440 
modification and what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:01:55.680> simply<00:01:55.890> going<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.189> bend<00:01:56.520> these<00:01:56.670> prongs<00:01:57.060> on

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
I'm simply going to bend these prongs on

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.139 
I'm simply going to bend these prongs on
each<00:01:57.600> side<00:01:58.040> farther<00:01:59.040> outward<00:01:59.460> so<00:01:59.880> that<00:01:59.909> I'll

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
each side farther outward so that I'll

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.120 
each side farther outward so that I'll
get<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.360> tighter<00:02:00.689> fit<00:02:01.049> in<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:01.770> outermost

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
get a tighter fit in this outermost

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.770 
get a tighter fit in this outermost
trigger<00:02:02.549> position<00:02:04.310> okay<00:02:05.310> now<00:02:05.520> after<00:02:06.119> bending

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
trigger position okay now after bending

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.869 
trigger position okay now after bending
the<00:02:07.140> killer<00:02:07.320> Clips<00:02:07.619> out<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.860> little<00:02:08.069> bit<00:02:08.280> you

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
the killer Clips out a little bit you

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.279 
the killer Clips out a little bit you
can<00:02:09.000> see<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.239> triggers<00:02:09.629> in<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.840> outer<00:02:10.020> most

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
can see the triggers in the outer most

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.080 
can see the triggers in the outer most
position<00:02:10.860> but<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.310> can<00:02:11.430> see<00:02:11.610> that's<00:02:11.760> some

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
position but you can see that's some

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.540 
position but you can see that's some
much

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
much

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.590 
much
much<00:02:13.180> more<00:02:13.930> stable<00:02:14.230> hold<00:02:15.240> so<00:02:16.240> that<00:02:16.420> right

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
much more stable hold so that right

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.820 
much more stable hold so that right
there<00:02:16.660> that's<00:02:17.110> good<00:02:17.350> to<00:02:17.470> go

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
there that's good to go

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.220 
there that's good to go
and<00:02:18.370> of<00:02:18.580> course<00:02:18.760> all<00:02:18.910> I<00:02:18.970> do<00:02:19.090> is<00:02:19.360> just<00:02:19.720> run<00:02:20.140> the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
and of course all I do is just run the

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.830 
and of course all I do is just run the
stake<00:02:20.470> through<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.800> trap<00:02:21.070> ring<00:02:21.750> stick<00:02:22.750> the

stake through the trap ring stick the

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.350 
stake through the trap ring stick the
stake<00:02:23.080> down<00:02:23.260> in<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.530> mud<00:02:23.740> put<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.790> trap<00:02:25.000> on<00:02:25.180> it

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
stake down in the mud put the trap on it

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.550 
stake down in the mud put the trap on it
and<00:02:25.510> you're<00:02:25.780> ready<00:02:25.960> to<00:02:26.080> go<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.320> when<00:02:26.440> you're

anyway<00:03:47.489> this<00:03:48.489> is<00:03:48.700> one<00:03:48.970> thing<00:03:49.180> that<00:03:49.360> I<00:03:49.450> can<00:03:49.630> use

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
anyway this is one thing that I can use

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.780 
anyway this is one thing that I can use
for<00:03:50.140> both<00:03:50.290> traps<00:03:50.739> I<00:03:50.950> can<00:03:51.130> use<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:51.580> killer

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
for both traps I can use the killer

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.479 
for both traps I can use the killer
clips<00:03:52.150> on<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.900> grade<00:03:53.380> stakes<00:03:53.680> and<00:03:53.980> they'll

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
clips on the grade stakes and they'll

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.699 
clips on the grade stakes and they'll
fit<00:03:54.730> all<00:03:54.880> of<00:03:55.000> my<00:03:55.150> 110<00:03:55.690> and<00:03:56.050> they'll<00:03:56.230> fit<00:03:56.440> all<00:03:56.590> of

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
fit all of my 110 and they'll fit all of

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.030 
fit all of my 110 and they'll fit all of
my<00:03:56.830> two<00:03:56.890> 20s<00:03:57.540> so<00:03:58.540> that's<00:03:59.260> just<00:03:59.440> a<00:03:59.590> way<00:03:59.620> I<00:03:59.739> can

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
my two 20s so that's just a way I can

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.370 
my two 20s so that's just a way I can
standardize<00:04:00.550> it<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:01.270> make<00:04:01.420> sure<00:04:01.450> that<00:04:01.870> I<00:04:02.110> know

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
standardize it and make sure that I know

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.810 
standardize it and make sure that I know
when<00:04:02.739> I<00:04:02.770> grab<00:04:03.040> something<00:04:03.520> that's<00:04:03.550> going<00:04:03.760> to

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
when I grab something that's going to

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.900 
when I grab something that's going to
work<00:04:04.000> when<00:04:04.239> I<00:04:04.270> get<00:04:04.480> out<00:04:04.570> in<00:04:04.690> the<00:04:04.750> field
