 even if you have been playing poker for a long time 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.239
 advice all videos watch first 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.730
 noticed that even well-experienced players 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.270
 sometimes they know the elementary things a 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.210
 poker 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:08.280
 that you need to know so 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.350
 let's start with poker combinations and what you need 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.890
 know about them advice to learn all this 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.650
 by heart 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.880
 always remember this very much 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.100
 useful to you in the game 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.470
 especially when there is a strong rival 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.600
 the first thing you need to know is 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.970
 the probability of getting poker 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.140
 combinations have rivals and what about this 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:39.570
 do let you have any cards except 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:42.950
 pairs and flop nothing for you 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.549
 Generally you have nothing at all what to do 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:50.310
 think correctly think think again 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:55.049
 what could be your opponent this first 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.210
 that feast 1 what you need to think think not 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.060
 about your card especially when nothing 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.030
 No, but what about the opponent? 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.530
 the opponent may have 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.229
 time with a probability of 42 percent or one 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.910
 to two and a half 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.130
 the opponent can also have two pairs with 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.850
 probability 4 point twenty five 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.040
 percent or one to twenty one set 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.340
 or three identical cards may be 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.600
 probability two point 11 percent or 1 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.360
 to 47 street with a probability of 039 percent 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.220
 or one 256 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:40.590
 flash may be an opponent with 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:43.730
 probability 0.25 and full house 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:48.660
 maybe with probability 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.069
 0.44 percent or one to-700 bark or 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.560
 four identical can be with 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:56.670
 probability of 0.24 percent or one to 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.269
 four thousand 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.980
 well, about straight flush and flush royal 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.440
 we will not consider them as 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.590
 the probability of falling out is very small and not 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.890
 affect the game in principle therefore we will 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:15.840
 stuff your head 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:18.450
 trash what lies on the table during flappy 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.860
 will give you read well will give you 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.500
 opportunity to read the opponent's card 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.450
 more 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.480
 if there are no 3 identical suits 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.390
 means flash drive sapper end if not 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.690
 two identical suits even on flash 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.180
 and the opponent can not go but if he 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.900
 Of course it doesnâ€™t quite go and go to flash 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:43.320
 only with a flash draw i mean i am 4 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.709
 the same suits on the hands of prostreet too 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.900
 we can say that proflesh only cards 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.120
 must be in order if in discord 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.480
 then the opponent with 3 there and does not smell with 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.489
 full house ikari is even easier if not 3 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.489
 or 2 identical cards on the flop 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.829
 there is no full house or curry 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.650
 difficult to determine the opponent 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:07.829
 two pairs or a set, that is, three identical 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.030
 cards and the last two combinations 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:13.240
 the most dangerous in poker 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.420
 and they can lose a lot 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.180
 money here the principle is simple if the flop 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:23.290
 consists of small things for nine then 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.840
 the probability of these combinations is small if in 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:30.550
 fleet and dozens of pictures then the probability 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:33.220
 that the opponent has something very big 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:37.690
 how to determine this probability 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:40.210
 it's impossible but when you play a lot 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.490
 poker and start to see rivals then 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.500
 have read their style of play you can 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.050
 define rather accurate than 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.290
 the rival comes and already from this to do 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.570
 your calculations for example more aggressive 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.570
 poker players or maniacs can 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.640
 go on anything you leave 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.070
 calm players just come in 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.290
 usually on strong cards your goal 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.020
 determine the degree to aggression or 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.150
 tight sti rival or whatever i call 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.389
 it's about myself determine the degree of idiocy 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.979
 and rival and after that 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:14.440
 paying about what he has 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:19.060
 maybe hands when the flop opens 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:21.840
 all this comes with a tribute to them and for years 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:25.120
 poker games the main thing is always carefully 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:28.000
 watch your opponents and remember on 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.840
 how do they play if you want to play 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.289
 plus then this lesson 1 you should know on 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.020
 tooth 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:37.930
 and always remember everywhere all these percentages 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.510
 and probabilities if questions arise 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.190
