00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
actually makes it sound because it's

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.810 
actually makes it sound because it's
just<00:01:48.659> liquid<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.979> what<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.490> does<00:01:50.670> is

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
just liquid and it what it does is

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.249 
just liquid and it what it does is
pretty<00:01:51.030> much<00:01:51.150> once<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.540> put<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.930> into<00:01:52.110> the

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
pretty much once you put it into the

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.289 
pretty much once you put it into the
bike<00:01:52.619> tire<00:01:53.189> or<00:01:53.460> in<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.610> case<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.030> soccer

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
bike tire or in this case the soccer

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.690 
bike tire or in this case the soccer
ball<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.780> will<00:01:55.409> add<00:01:55.650> another<00:01:55.950> coating<00:01:56.310> inside

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
ball it will add another coating inside

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.740 
ball it will add another coating inside
of<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.689> rubber<00:01:58.049> bladder<00:01:59.420> causing<00:02:00.420> for<00:02:00.659> the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
of the rubber bladder causing for the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.800 
of the rubber bladder causing for the
hole<00:02:01.049> or<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.259> puncture<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.740> be<00:02:01.950> fixed<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.810> not

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
allowing the air to leak that's pretty

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.940 
allowing the air to leak that's pretty
much<00:02:06.659> what<00:02:06.869> I'll<00:02:06.990> be<00:02:07.079> showing<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.439> how<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.710> do

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
hole of the ball be very careful in that

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.320 
hole of the ball be very careful in that
right<00:02:46.990> there<00:02:47.230> very<00:02:47.380> carefully<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.940> see<00:02:49.150> it's

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
right there very carefully and see it's

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.510 
right there very carefully and see it's
now<00:02:49.450> sticking<00:02:49.840> out<00:02:50.110> then<00:02:51.010> you'll<00:02:51.160> take<00:02:51.340> your

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
now sticking out then you'll take your

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.000 
now sticking out then you'll take your
liquid<00:02:51.940> tire<00:02:52.180> sealant<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:52.870> sealant<00:02:53.830> and

liquid tire sealant and sealant and

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.550 
liquid tire sealant and sealant and
you'll<00:02:54.310> fill<00:02:54.550> in<00:02:54.580> about<00:02:54.910> a<00:02:55.150> half<00:02:55.420> half<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.410> the

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
you'll fill in about a half half of the

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.230 
you'll fill in about a half half of the
bottle<00:02:57.520> that<00:02:57.640> is<00:02:57.850> I'm<00:02:58.090> in<00:02:58.660> about<00:02:58.900> one<00:02:59.170> full

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
bottle that is I'm in about one full

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.470 
bottle that is I'm in about one full
syringe<00:03:02.190> which<00:03:03.190> is<00:03:03.340> about<00:03:03.580> that<00:03:03.970> much<00:03:04.030> so

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
syringe which is about that much so

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.510 
syringe which is about that much so
three-quarters<00:03:05.050> twenty<00:03:05.380> milliliters<00:03:05.620> works

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
three-quarters twenty milliliters works

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.390 
three-quarters twenty milliliters works
perfectly<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.950> then<00:03:08.950> you<00:03:09.070> need<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:09.250> be<00:03:09.370> a

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
perfectly and then you need to be a

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.520 
perfectly and then you need to be a
little<00:03:09.520> bit<00:03:09.700> careful<00:03:10.560> put<00:03:11.560> in<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.770> top<00:03:12.010> and

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
little bit careful put in the top and

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.170 
little bit careful put in the top and
just<00:03:14.530> fill<00:03:14.740> in<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:14.920> ball<00:03:15.100> like<00:03:15.250> that<00:03:18.180> really

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
just fill in the ball like that really

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:28.520 
just fill in the ball like that really
slowly<00:03:19.890> might<00:03:20.890> give<00:03:21.310> you<00:03:21.430> some<00:03:21.820> pressure

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.160 

you<00:03:29.280> really<00:03:29.460> saw<00:03:29.610> I'll<00:03:29.700> probably<00:03:29.910> just<00:03:30.450> fast

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
you really saw I'll probably just fast

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.380 
you really saw I'll probably just fast
motion<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:31.770> just<00:03:32.010> now<00:03:32.520> speed<00:03:32.790> up<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.000> process

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
motion and just now speed up the process

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:40.470 
motion and just now speed up the process
here

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.940 

you

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.280 

and<00:03:43.550> make<00:03:43.700> sure<00:03:43.849> not<00:03:44.030> to<00:03:44.090> pop<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:44.720> bladder<00:03:45.080> on

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
and make sure not to pop the bladder on

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.900 
and make sure not to pop the bladder on
the<00:03:45.380> inside<00:03:46.390> all<00:03:47.390> right<00:03:47.510> there<00:03:47.660> you<00:03:47.690> go<00:03:48.910> so

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
the inside all right there you go so

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:50.520 
the inside all right there you go so
that<00:03:49.940> was<00:03:50.150> it

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
that was it

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.720 
that was it

on the inside on the bladder so it

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.890 
on the inside on the bladder so it
really<00:04:17.540> makes<00:04:17.810> sure<00:04:17.930> that<00:04:18.169> the<00:04:19.630> pole<00:04:20.630> on<00:04:20.870> the
