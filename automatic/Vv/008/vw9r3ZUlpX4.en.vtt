00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.920 

so<00:00:24.849> wrong<00:00:25.060> and<00:00:25.240> tell<00:00:25.390> me<00:00:25.480> a<00:00:25.509> little<00:00:25.630> bit<00:00:25.810> about

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 
so wrong and tell me a little bit about

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.659 
so wrong and tell me a little bit about
actually<00:00:26.560> feeding<00:00:26.830> the<00:00:27.039> plants<00:00:27.400> with<00:00:27.580> the

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:27.669 
actually feeding the plants with the

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:29.370 
actually feeding the plants with the
water<00:00:27.880> right<00:00:28.390> well<00:00:28.599> the<00:00:28.779> you<00:00:28.960> know<00:00:29.079> as<00:00:29.140> I

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
water right well the you know as I

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.509 
water right well the you know as I
talked<00:00:29.619> about<00:00:29.680> the<00:00:29.919> recipe<00:00:30.250> here<00:00:30.369> that's

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 
talked about the recipe here that's

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.549 
talked about the recipe here that's
mixed<00:00:30.820> in<00:00:30.939> this<00:00:31.090> thousand<00:00:31.810> gallon<00:00:32.050> tank<00:00:32.290> and

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
mixed in this thousand gallon tank and

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.500 
mixed in this thousand gallon tank and
then<00:00:33.100> the<00:00:33.309> pump<00:00:33.550> pumps<00:00:34.000> it<00:00:34.090> all<00:00:34.239> the<00:00:34.390> way<00:00:34.480> up

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
then the pump pumps it all the way up

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.720 
then the pump pumps it all the way up
hill<00:00:34.840> with<00:00:35.829> you<00:00:35.949> know<00:00:36.040> the<00:00:36.160> greenhouse<00:00:36.519> is

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
hill with you know the greenhouse is

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.509 
hill with you know the greenhouse is
situated<00:00:37.210> uphill<00:00:37.480> about<00:00:37.750> about<00:00:38.070> 1.5<00:00:39.070> percent

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:39.519 
situated uphill about about 1.5 percent

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:42.030 
situated uphill about about 1.5 percent
grade<00:00:39.930> pumped<00:00:40.930> all<00:00:41.019> the<00:00:41.170> way<00:00:41.260> up<00:00:41.410> and<00:00:41.800> then

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
grade pumped all the way up and then

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.270 
grade pumped all the way up and then
returns<00:00:42.579> by<00:00:43.269> gravity<00:00:43.839> and<00:00:44.070> whatever<00:00:45.070> is<00:00:45.159> not

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
returns by gravity and whatever is not

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.360 
returns by gravity and whatever is not
used<00:00:45.579> by<00:00:45.760> the<00:00:45.820> plant<00:00:46.120> comes<00:00:47.019> back<00:00:47.320> to<00:00:47.530> the<00:00:47.680> tank

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
used by the plant comes back to the tank

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.060 
used by the plant comes back to the tank
and<00:00:48.640> it's<00:00:49.390> remixed<00:00:49.870> accordingly<00:00:50.320> to<00:00:50.800> get<00:00:50.980> the

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
and it's remixed accordingly to get the

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.079 
and it's remixed accordingly to get the
proper<00:00:51.370> pH<00:00:51.670> and<00:00:52.559> nutrients<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.850> there's<00:00:55.030> a

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
proper pH and nutrients so there's a

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:56.910 
proper pH and nutrients so there's a
constant<00:00:55.420> flow<00:00:55.750> this<00:00:56.019> this<00:00:56.229> white<00:00:56.439> noise<00:00:56.650> of

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
constant flow this this white noise of

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.780 
constant flow this this white noise of
the<00:00:56.979> pump<00:00:57.189> is<00:00:57.339> 24/7<00:00:59.070> we<00:01:00.070> have<00:01:00.159> a<00:01:00.189> backup<00:01:00.400> pump

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
the pump is 24/7 we have a backup pump

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:01.829 
the pump is 24/7 we have a backup pump
we<00:01:00.909> have<00:01:01.000> a<00:01:01.030> generator<00:01:01.449> if<00:01:01.600> we<00:01:01.689> lose

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
we have a generator if we lose

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:03.450 
we have a generator if we lose
electricity<00:01:02.409> it<00:01:02.559> needs<00:01:02.739> to<00:01:02.890> always<00:01:03.280> be

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
electricity it needs to always be

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.450 
electricity it needs to always be
running<00:01:03.610> right<00:01:04.119> even<00:01:04.420> an<00:01:04.510> hour<00:01:04.720> in<00:01:05.350> sunny<00:01:06.100> July

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
running right even an hour in sunny July

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.330 
running right even an hour in sunny July
would<00:01:06.909> be<00:01:07.240> very<00:01:07.570> very<00:01:07.780> disastrous<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:09.159> pump

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
would be very very disastrous the pump

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.510 
would be very very disastrous the pump
is<00:01:09.460> off<00:01:09.640> I<00:01:09.820> can't<00:01:10.060> imagine<00:01:10.119> you<00:01:11.250> Ryan<00:01:12.250> this<00:01:12.460> is

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
is off I can't imagine you Ryan this is

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.100 
is off I can't imagine you Ryan this is
really<00:01:12.880> interesting<00:01:13.299> is<00:01:13.420> this<00:01:13.600> what<00:01:14.020> are

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
really interesting is this what are

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.039 
really interesting is this what are
these<00:01:14.200> baffles<00:01:14.740> yeah<00:01:15.700> this<00:01:15.880> is<00:01:16.030> our<00:01:16.509> cooling

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
these baffles yeah this is our cooling

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.130 
these baffles yeah this is our cooling
wall<00:01:17.259> and<00:01:17.530> it<00:01:18.520> serves<00:01:18.880> its<00:01:19.540> evaporative

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
wall and it serves its evaporative

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.319 
wall and it serves its evaporative
cooling<00:01:20.350> so<00:01:20.680> this<00:01:20.979> wall<00:01:21.159> is<00:01:21.340> wet<00:01:21.610> there's<00:01:22.210> a

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
cooling so this wall is wet there's a

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:24.240 
cooling so this wall is wet there's a
sump<00:01:22.869> pump<00:01:22.930> down<00:01:23.530> here<00:01:23.740> at<00:01:23.799> the<00:01:23.920> end<00:01:24.040> that's

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
sump pump down here at the end that's

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.280 
sump pump down here at the end that's
constantly<00:01:24.850> pumping<00:01:25.030> of<00:01:25.299> water<00:01:25.329> which<00:01:26.110> then

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
constantly pumping of water which then

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.760 
constantly pumping of water which then
trickles<00:01:26.740> down<00:01:26.799> and<00:01:27.369> out<00:01:28.180> behind<00:01:28.720> this<00:01:28.990> baffle

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
trickles down and out behind this baffle

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.149 
trickles down and out behind this baffle
is<00:01:29.920> an<00:01:30.070> open<00:01:30.340> open<00:01:30.850> door<00:01:31.090> and<00:01:31.440> those<00:01:32.440> big<00:01:32.860> fans

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
is an open open door and those big fans

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.120 
is an open open door and those big fans
at<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.550> North<00:01:33.790> End<00:01:34.000> are<00:01:34.360> sucking<00:01:34.870> the<00:01:35.620> air<00:01:35.770> to

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
at the North End are sucking the air to

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.880 
at the North End are sucking the air to
draw<00:01:36.370> the<00:01:36.430> air<00:01:36.670> through<00:01:37.000> on<00:01:37.300> the<00:01:37.450> area<00:01:37.930> so<00:01:38.770> this

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
draw the air through on the area so this

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.100 
draw the air through on the area so this
it<00:01:39.070> serves<00:01:39.310> to<00:01:39.460> cool<00:01:39.700> it<00:01:40.450> also<00:01:40.600> serves<00:01:40.930> that

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
it serves to cool it also serves that

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.800 
it serves to cool it also serves that
some<00:01:41.350> humidity<00:01:41.650> on<00:01:42.040> dry<00:01:42.280> days<00:01:42.310> sure<00:01:42.909> sure<00:01:43.540> and

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
some humidity on dry days sure sure and

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.690 
some humidity on dry days sure sure and
while<00:01:44.229> we're<00:01:44.440> on<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.650> humidity<00:01:45.220> what<00:01:45.550> are

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
while we're on the humidity what are

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.719 
while we're on the humidity what are
these<00:01:45.820> tubes<00:01:46.510> that<00:01:46.870> keep<00:01:47.080> inflating<00:01:47.729> randomly

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
these tubes that keep inflating randomly

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:49.469 
these tubes that keep inflating randomly
it<00:01:48.880> seems

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
it seems

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.810 
it seems
yeah<00:01:49.720> there's<00:01:49.930> a<00:01:49.990> big<00:01:50.170> jet<00:01:50.440> fan<00:01:50.710> at<00:01:51.190> high<00:01:51.490> under

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
yeah there's a big jet fan at high under

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.130 
yeah there's a big jet fan at high under
each<00:01:51.940> under<00:01:52.420> each<00:01:52.540> and<00:01:53.170> there<00:01:53.830> and

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
each under each and there and

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.240 
each under each and there and
depending<00:01:55.470> on<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.620> time<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.800> year<00:01:55.950> runs

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
depending on the time of year runs

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.310 
depending on the time of year runs
pretty<00:01:56.430> much<00:01:56.640> evenly<00:01:57.030> also<00:01:57.750> all<00:01:57.870> the<00:01:57.960> time<00:01:58.140> in

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
pretty much evenly also all the time in

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.050 
pretty much evenly also all the time in
a<00:01:58.380> winter<00:01:58.710> when<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.010> it's<00:01:59.340> distributing<00:01:59.790> the

system<00:04:07.569> from<00:04:08.500> the<00:04:08.799> lettuces<00:04:09.220> that<00:04:09.370> we<00:04:09.459> just

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
system from the lettuces that we just

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.369 
system from the lettuces that we just
took<00:04:09.849> a<00:04:09.909> look<00:04:10.090> at<00:04:10.239> right<00:04:10.629> well<00:04:11.049> the<00:04:11.109> lettuce

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
took a look at right well the lettuce

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:13.920 
took a look at right well the lettuce
stores<00:04:11.709> and<00:04:11.920> channels<00:04:12.340> it<00:04:13.090> has<00:04:13.329> a<00:04:13.359> constant

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
stores and channels it has a constant

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.020 
stores and channels it has a constant
flow<00:04:14.109> of<00:04:14.230> nutrients<00:04:14.709> the<00:04:14.950> tomatoes<00:04:15.640> grow<00:04:15.849> in<00:04:15.970> a

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
flow of nutrients the tomatoes grow in a

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.330 
flow of nutrients the tomatoes grow in a
bucket<00:04:16.419> and<00:04:16.600> they<00:04:17.470> don't<00:04:17.650> use<00:04:17.859> rot<00:04:18.070> we<00:04:18.190> do

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
bucket and they don't use rot we do

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.830 
bucket and they don't use rot we do
plant<00:04:18.579> the<00:04:18.729> seed<00:04:18.940> in<00:04:19.090> Rockville<00:04:19.570> but<00:04:19.720> then

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
plant the seed in Rockville but then

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.140 
plant the seed in Rockville but then
inside<00:04:20.260> this<00:04:20.470> bucket<00:04:20.739> is<00:04:21.100> what's<00:04:21.669> called<00:04:21.820> para

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
inside this bucket is what's called para

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.000 
inside this bucket is what's called para
light<00:04:22.360> which<00:04:22.600> is<00:04:22.750> that<00:04:22.930> white<00:04:23.500> stuff<00:04:23.770> that's

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
light which is that white stuff that's

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.180 
light which is that white stuff that's
in<00:04:24.190> potting<00:04:24.639> soil<00:04:25.139> so<00:04:26.139> the<00:04:26.440> roots<00:04:26.650> are<00:04:26.800> growing

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
in potting soil so the roots are growing

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.550 
in potting soil so the roots are growing
in<00:04:27.340> that<00:04:27.729> bucket<00:04:27.910> in<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.360> para<00:04:28.600> line<00:04:28.780> now

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
in that bucket in the para line now

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.279 
in that bucket in the para line now
they're<00:04:29.979> fed<00:04:30.280> the<00:04:31.240> nutrients<00:04:31.690> are<00:04:31.810> mixed<00:04:32.169> that

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
they're fed the nutrients are mixed that

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:33.510 
they're fed the nutrients are mixed that
we<00:04:32.410> have<00:04:32.500> the<00:04:32.620> acid<00:04:32.979> to<00:04:33.070> lower<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.370> pH

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
we have the acid to lower the pH

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.740 
we have the acid to lower the pH
everything<00:04:34.210> so

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
everything so

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.450 
everything so
similar<00:04:35.320> there<00:04:35.500> but<00:04:36.010> they<00:04:36.130> don't<00:04:36.310> get<00:04:36.400> a

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
similar there but they don't get a

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.730 
similar there but they don't get a
constant<00:04:36.940> flow<00:04:37.150> every<00:04:37.810> 20<00:04:38.140> minutes<00:04:38.320> during

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
constant flow every 20 minutes during

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.100 
constant flow every 20 minutes during
daylight<00:04:39.130> you<00:04:39.550> know<00:04:39.580> dawn<00:04:39.850> to<00:04:40.090> dusk<00:04:40.270> they<00:04:40.930> get

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
daylight you know dawn to dusk they get

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.830 
daylight you know dawn to dusk they get
fed<00:04:41.320> every<00:04:41.350> 20<00:04:41.800> minutes<00:04:42.210> according<00:04:43.210> to<00:04:43.600> how

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
fed every 20 minutes according to how

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.500 
fed every 20 minutes according to how
hot<00:04:44.110> and<00:04:44.290> dry<00:04:44.410> it<00:04:44.560> is<00:04:44.800> the<00:04:44.980> air<00:04:45.130> is<00:04:45.310> so<00:04:46.120> it<00:04:46.420> might

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
hot and dry it is the air is so it might

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.330 
hot and dry it is the air is so it might
be<00:04:46.690> two<00:04:46.870> minutes<00:04:47.050> it<00:04:47.290> might<00:04:47.440> be<00:04:47.620> two<00:04:48.160> and<00:04:48.310> a

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
be two minutes it might be two and a

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.820 
be two minutes it might be two and a
half<00:04:48.490> minutes<00:04:48.880> but<00:04:49.510> each<00:04:49.990> plant<00:04:50.380> gets<00:04:50.500> their

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
half minutes but each plant gets their

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.860 
half minutes but each plant gets their
own<00:04:50.950> little<00:04:51.160> feed<00:04:51.400> tube<00:04:51.670> and<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:52.390> nutrients

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
own little feed tube and the nutrients

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.020 
own little feed tube and the nutrients
does<00:04:53.050> trickle<00:04:53.350> down<00:04:53.640> you<00:04:54.640> know<00:04:54.730> like<00:04:54.760> I<00:04:54.970> said

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
does trickle down you know like I said

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.630 
does trickle down you know like I said
every<00:04:55.300> 20<00:04:55.540> minutes<00:04:55.690> this<00:04:56.530> is<00:04:56.710> fascinating

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
every 20 minutes this is fascinating

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.900 
every 20 minutes this is fascinating
so<00:04:57.850> you'll<00:04:58.030> replant<00:04:58.660> these<00:04:58.960> Tomatoes<00:04:59.910> in

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
so you'll replant these Tomatoes in

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.900 
so you'll replant these Tomatoes in
December<00:05:01.570> right<00:05:01.780> yeah<00:05:02.590> yeah<00:05:03.340> at<00:05:03.580> the<00:05:03.670> end<00:05:03.700> of

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
December right yeah yeah at the end of

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.150 
December right yeah yeah at the end of

the year you know we'll decide to tear

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.470 
the year you know we'll decide to tear
them<00:05:06.250> out<00:05:06.370> if<00:05:06.550> the<00:05:06.670> winter<00:05:06.970> is<00:05:07.030> pretty<00:05:07.270> hot
