but<00:02:11.730> if<00:02:11.819> you

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
but if you

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.630 
but if you
closely<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.630> in-game<00:02:12.930> sad<00:02:13.230> has<00:02:13.440> 69<00:02:14.069> heading

closely the in-game sad has 69 heading

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.510 
closely the in-game sad has 69 heading
accuracy<00:02:14.940> he<00:02:15.630> has<00:02:15.750> great<00:02:15.989> jumping<00:02:16.410> 97<00:02:17.130> jumping

so<00:02:17.640> he<00:02:17.730> can<00:02:17.849> really<00:02:18.000> leap<00:02:18.330> up<00:02:18.510> in<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.780> air<00:02:18.930> but

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
so he can really leap up in the air but

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.290 
so he can really leap up in the air but
he<00:02:19.440> didn't<00:02:19.650> win<00:02:19.890> any<00:02:20.190> headers<00:02:20.430> for<00:02:20.730> me<00:02:20.880> he

he didn't win any headers for me he

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.240 
he didn't win any headers for me he
really<00:02:21.569> couldn't<00:02:21.870> win<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.260> over<00:02:22.349> stronger<00:02:23.069> and

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
really couldn't win it over stronger and

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
felt like he was a good striker do I

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.270 
felt like he was a good striker do I
recommend<00:03:12.330> him<00:03:12.540> yes<00:03:13.049> because<00:03:13.470> of<00:03:13.500> his<00:03:13.739> pacing

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
recommend him yes because of his pacing

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.030 
recommend him yes because of his pacing
shot<00:03:14.640> he<00:03:15.030> can<00:03:15.209> be<00:03:15.330> a<00:03:15.360> very<00:03:15.750> deadly<00:03:16.109> striker<00:03:16.560> but

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
shot he can be a very deadly striker but
