00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:03.620
 AR 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.770
 Grichting has to 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.930
 indirect testing for a day in some would have too 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.930
 you have them 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:19.519
 October 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.440
 the whole thing is now in real on red 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.440
 Now I have the chocolate cut quarters 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:31.169
 The numbers are very nice and the smell of the eighth part 2 is whiter 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:32.750
 chocolate 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.750
 In the field defense Schmidt lays everything is already won 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.190
 that he is resting for now and your other different masses 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.140
 No goes by again Â» 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.140
 with the ice snow 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.680
 does not work 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.969
 b 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.460
 and if you sit right next to us he too 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.970
 Aachen residents do not feel so much Aachen 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.040
 a blunder dapd has one that you have good evenly that's him 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.040
 now for the dark chocolate 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.170
 Gagging is not based on what was wasted 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.490
 Oak trees b 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.490
 now the ladies can too 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.900
 so in case of doubt, the Chamer chocolate in St can be mixed with 1 as 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.900
 co-determined to ThyssenKrupp 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.070
 He guides the Boy Scouts as well as he did 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.160
 the Chamer have been getting everything small around a high-end positive 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.979
 Now I just hope that with the singer Tina also right in Hama 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.979
 Racing team is always so tricky thing 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.299
 Sam is very fluid 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.299
 I might not have beaten ten meters 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.400
 In order not to let hold you would have to standard use says Steinke Anstalt 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.220
 I did not need to use it 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.790
 Heldt does not always want to have so many things to comment on that and so on 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:29.329
 was 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.329
 Of course I prefer to have as little subprime as possible 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.609
 All in all, it has a hard time 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:39.659
 but maybe not at some point my way there not stop in the field 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.150
 Not good euros so now the chocolate can carry food 

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:47.309
 next to who's the hostile takeover 

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:56.099
 KH, that's what the dentist sees 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.800
 First of all, the usual civil status of Holland is still good 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.799
 has come through 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.319
 Dublin with 3 0 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:23.999
 and the community ever before in the other 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:27.509
 sda 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.049
 on 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.449
 Partner country was 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.019
 the first one has been found 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.309
 the dark chocolate 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:44.629
 which was best suited 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:45.590
 Danger 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.590
 Honorary prizes to prepare cocktails 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:54.089
 So turned those essences because that's not done on chocolate 

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:58.349
 or because this man can become me now I do not suppose it 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.729
 the latter 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:03.729
 but i am very happy so that you can be fast 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:08.750
 I am pleased that our opponent 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.750
 because I am just these people 

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:19.999
 to be found at this point 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.180
 first in cold water 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.469
 but gone forward 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:32.469
 but it has to be pretty good 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:40.909
 dpa 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.550
 "Whole world" has expired now 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.080
 and how warm chocolate is to the Saarner and the 1 Kretschmann 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.559
 but the question is how 

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:55.879
 Lietzmann right 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:58.620
 These are nice quick procedures 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.789
 bit cool and windy Kotow Ulm 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:03.789
 2 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:07.240
 Both transmitters are the most capable of doing so 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.120
 the plight of many can be confessed also preserved but if you are not 100 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.569
 m was also the cloud with I'm not so nice 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:17.990
 That's why I have to see that I make the right team with it 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.469
 Greenland and hang 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:23.479
 yes that's wonderful so really easy 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.240
 Flurry first so I'll regret it right and you will come the dark 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.470
 chocolate
