00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
little tricky because of the angle of

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.530 
little tricky because of the angle of
the<00:01:17.400> screwdriver<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.610> won't<00:01:21.119> open

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
the screwdriver and the a won't open

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
now on the side of the screen there are

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.870 
now on the side of the screen there are
four<00:01:50.280> screws<00:01:50.550> on<00:01:50.940> both<00:01:51.200> sides<00:01:53.240> now<00:01:55.070> those<00:01:56.070> need

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
four screws on both sides now those need

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.200

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
the smaller the smaller 8 screws on both

00:03:41.190 --> 00:04:02.170 
the smaller the smaller 8 screws on both
sides<00:03:41.520> of<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.790> screen

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.990 

okay<00:04:03.180> now<00:04:03.719> we're<00:04:03.900> going<00:04:03.989> to<00:04:04.280> get<00:04:05.280> these<00:04:05.579> bottom

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
okay now we're going to get these bottom

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.880 
okay now we're going to get these bottom
corners<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:06.569> I<00:04:06.780> found<00:04:07.049> that<00:04:07.200> in<00:04:07.379> order<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.739> do

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
corners and I found that in order to do

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.479 
corners and I found that in order to do
that<00:04:08.040> it's<00:04:08.370> a<00:04:08.609> little<00:04:08.760> easier<00:04:09.980> to<00:04:10.980> screw<00:04:11.310> the

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
that it's a little easier to screw the

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.909 
that it's a little easier to screw the
top<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.980> top<00:04:14.189> corners<00:04:14.810> into<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.959> body<00:04:16.650> of<00:04:16.829> the

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
top the top corners into the body of the

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.460 
top the top corners into the body of the
screen<00:04:17.190> that<00:04:18.030> way<00:04:18.150> this<00:04:18.329> doesn't<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:19.139> body

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
screen that way this doesn't the body

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.379 
screen that way this doesn't the body
use<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:19.889> screen<00:04:20.130> and<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.430> actual<00:04:21.090> screen

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
use the screen and the actual screen

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:33.140 
use the screen and the actual screen
stay<00:04:21.780> together<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.650> LCD<00:04:25.190> so<00:04:31.190> okay<00:04:32.190> now<00:04:32.970> that

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
stay together the LCD so okay now that

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.909 
stay together the LCD so okay now that
should<00:04:33.330> make<00:04:33.449> it<00:04:33.630> easier<00:04:33.930> to<00:04:34.110> get<00:04:34.259> to<00:04:34.289> these<00:04:34.650> a

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
should make it easier to get to these a

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:40.450 
should make it easier to get to these a
little<00:04:35.729> bit<00:04:35.820> more<00:04:35.940> hard-to-reach<00:04:36.630> places<00:04:39.050> and
