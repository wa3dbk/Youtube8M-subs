00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.980
 By the way, next time there is a station instruction of Abobo who is active in Tochigi 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.780
 It will be 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:24.610
 It's the best it's going to be as it's coming Exige's super-charged 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:27.040
 How Well Exige of you I think that it's I mean Tsu point aimed at the development stage 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:31.240
 We were taking advantage of the goodness of cat traction 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:33.200
 a to up the total balance by taking advantage of it from handling good 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.190
 I believe in the direction 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.660
 That Shota himself is also active in the all-Japan sound Jim Kana driver 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.320
 In coming remains 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.240
 It would not be if you thought that you would do it from the gym . 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.220
 It looks like 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:52.030
 It is quite different from the secretariat and stable 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:58.510
 Has become a specification I'm such mon wrote that from my How so 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:01:03.700
 That's right I divided it for gymkhana and let me roll it 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:07.240
 It'd specifications, such as moving the rear for the circuit is relatively vice versa 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.210
 I reduce the roll amount and make the area stable 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.300
 Anyway steering 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:15.280
 By listening well do 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:21.550
 It is important though is everyone Well, if the rear is not out might be a place seeking 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:23.260
 Like I'm going to it was prima facie pursuit engine kindergarten is er also normal intends uhh to especially 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:28.290
 Uh? 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:30.320
 The mission is normal as well, and so is the brake area. 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.070
 Rotor original 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:38.290
 Then it sucks and then exhausts 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.290
 Then I am changing ec dark 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.600
 Since the corner of the ear is earlier 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.910
 a 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.030
 I 'm getting into a tower and I 'm going to bend the Morgan and it feels great there 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.720
 is not it 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.210
 At Tsukuba Circuit 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.470
 Other than formula 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:05.300
 Besides, though it does not contain much water, it bends from cancerous rose so much 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:10.450
 I have not experienced a little place 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.450
 You can also feel something like Sgo-san on the follow + chassis
