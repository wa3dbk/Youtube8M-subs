honoré level and I select that one and
then<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:13.870> select<00:03:14.260> that<00:03:14.440> start<00:03:15.010> measurement<00:03:15.670> and

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
then I select that start measurement and

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.530 
then I select that start measurement and
now<00:03:16.600> this<00:03:17.190> p.m.<00:03:18.190> we<00:03:18.370> start<00:03:18.760> to<00:03:18.910> measure<00:03:19.120> this

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
now this p.m. we start to measure this

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.670 
now this p.m. we start to measure this
oil<00:03:19.840> level<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.989> this<00:03:23.170> is<00:03:23.290> interesting

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
oil level and this is interesting

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.789 
oil level and this is interesting
because<00:03:24.069> motor<00:03:24.459> is<00:03:24.700> running<00:03:25.359> and<00:03:25.630> it<00:03:26.530> actually

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
because motor is running and it actually

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:32.750 
because motor is running and it actually
turn<00:03:27.519> more<00:03:28.500> turns<00:03:30.989> interesting

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
turn more turns interesting

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.619 
turn more turns interesting
and<00:03:33.330> it's<00:03:33.629> it's<00:03:34.250> it's<00:03:35.250> measuring<00:03:36.030> or<00:03:36.269> level

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
and it's it's it's measuring or level

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.460 
and it's it's it's measuring or level
and<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:37.590> think<00:03:38.250> that<00:03:38.519> this<00:03:39.330> is<00:03:39.540> quite<00:03:39.810> complex

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
and I think that this is quite complex

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.660 
and I think that this is quite complex
way<00:03:40.830> to<00:03:40.890> measure<00:03:41.810> oil<00:03:42.810> level<00:03:43.409> I<00:03:43.650> prefer<00:03:44.340> more

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
way to measure oil level I prefer more

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.699 
way to measure oil level I prefer more
oil<00:03:45.239> stick<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:46.670> and<00:03:47.670> I<00:03:48.200> think<00:03:49.200> that<00:03:49.379> this<00:03:49.560> is

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
oil stick and and I think that this is

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.300 
oil stick and and I think that this is
really<00:03:50.250> technologic<00:03:51.120> technologic<00:03:52.110> ally<00:03:52.500> oil

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
really technologic technologic ally oil

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.440 
really technologic technologic ally oil
or<00:03:54.120> level<00:03:54.540> measurement<00:03:55.500> but<00:03:56.220> let's<00:03:56.610> see<00:03:56.819> that

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
or level measurement but let's see that

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:04.220 
or level measurement but let's see that
what<00:03:57.750> happened<00:03:58.940> sixty<00:03:59.940> percent<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:03.019> then<00:04:04.019> we

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
what happened sixty percent and then we

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.390 
what happened sixty percent and then we
can<00:04:04.500> add<00:04:05.010> next<00:04:05.849> i<00:04:06.120> will<00:04:06.180> show<00:04:06.750> you<00:04:07.319> that<00:04:07.530> how<00:04:08.340> we

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
can add next i will show you that how we

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.069 
can add next i will show you that how we
can<00:04:08.849> then<00:04:09.090> add<00:04:09.329> this<00:04:10.200> oil<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.950> this<00:04:11.099> PMP

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
can then add this oil to this PMP

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:18.330 
can then add this oil to this PMP
Gazzola<00:04:13.079> ng

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:26.820 

okay<00:04:18.970> this<00:04:20.010> 90%<00:04:21.600> white<00:04:22.600> soon<00:04:22.870> we<00:04:23.139> are<00:04:23.169> in<00:04:23.560> 100%

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.490 

okay<00:04:27.830> and<00:04:28.070> it<00:04:28.190> says<00:04:28.460> that<00:04:28.760> that<00:04:29.480> our<00:04:29.720> own<00:04:30.020> level

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
okay and it says that that our own level

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.450 
okay and it says that that our own level
is<00:04:30.950> totally<00:04:31.760> max<00:04:32.650> very<00:04:33.650> cool<00:04:33.980> engine<00:04:34.580> is<00:04:35.060> and

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
is totally max very cool engine is and

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.510 
is totally max very cool engine is and

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
under a screen motor screen very nice

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.820 
under a screen motor screen very nice
okay<00:04:40.520> and<00:04:40.639> then<00:04:40.820> we<00:04:41.030> can<00:04:41.300> go<00:04:41.750> to<00:04:41.889> focus<00:04:42.889> and<00:04:43.220> oil

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
okay and then we can go to focus and oil

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.060 
okay and then we can go to focus and oil
oil<00:04:45.830> adding<00:04:46.540> array<00:04:47.540> of<00:04:47.600> and<00:04:48.020> how<00:04:48.320> to<00:04:48.380> open<00:04:48.650> this

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
oil adding array of and how to open this

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.300 
oil adding array of and how to open this
hat<00:04:49.820> and<00:04:50.120> and<00:04:50.690> we<00:04:50.960> go<00:04:51.230> to<00:04:51.290> loop<00:04:51.800> this<00:04:52.040> motor

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
hat and and we go to loop this motor

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.240 
hat and and we go to loop this motor
around<00:04:52.520> next<00:04:52.910> they<00:04:53.510> need<00:04:53.780> to<00:04:54.020> open<00:04:54.560> this<00:04:54.800> code

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
around next they need to open this code

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.150 
around next they need to open this code
and<00:04:55.580> there<00:04:56.090> is<00:04:56.240> idea<00:04:56.660> that<00:04:56.900> we<00:04:57.080> need<00:04:57.290> to<00:04:57.530> press

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
and there is idea that we need to press

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.610 
and there is idea that we need to press
this<00:05:00.160> this<00:05:01.160> tip<00:05:01.520> two<00:05:01.970> times<00:05:02.300> first<00:05:02.750> and<00:05:03.290> 10

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
this this tip two times first and 10

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.000 
this this tip two times first and 10
second<00:05:04.040> I<00:05:04.450> can<00:05:05.450> tell<00:05:05.690> we<00:05:05.870> go<00:05:06.169> to<00:05:06.229> look<00:05:06.740> this

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
second I can tell we go to look this

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.450 
second I can tell we go to look this
motor<00:05:07.580> ok<00:05:08.479> and<00:05:08.720> first<00:05:09.139> you<00:05:09.380> need<00:05:09.650> to<00:05:09.680> open<00:05:09.979> this

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
motor ok and first you need to open this

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.930 
motor ok and first you need to open this
car<00:05:10.850> bonnet<00:05:11.360> and<00:05:11.750> there<00:05:12.710> is<00:05:12.860> this<00:05:13.100> motor<00:05:13.520> oka

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
car bonnet and there is this motor oka

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.320 
car bonnet and there is this motor oka
so<00:05:14.060> an<00:05:14.180> engine<00:05:14.600> and<00:05:14.870> SAS<00:05:15.530> in<00:05:15.889> here<00:05:16.340> this<00:05:17.150> is

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
so an engine and SAS in here this is

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.950 
so an engine and SAS in here this is
this<00:05:18.100> cap<00:05:19.100> where<00:05:19.639> you<00:05:19.880> could<00:05:20.150> add<00:05:20.389> this<00:05:20.630> motor

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
this cap where you could add this motor

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.370 
this cap where you could add this motor
oil<00:05:21.320> and<00:05:21.560> you<00:05:21.740> open<00:05:22.250> that<00:05:22.430> in<00:05:22.639> this<00:05:22.910> way<00:05:23.180> and<00:05:23.450> if

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
oil and you open that in this way and if

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.629 
oil and you open that in this way and if
you<00:05:24.740> need<00:05:25.419> your<00:05:26.419> motor<00:05:26.720> needs<00:05:27.050> more<00:05:27.500> oil<00:05:27.770> you

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
you need your motor needs more oil you

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.110 
you need your motor needs more oil you
only<00:05:29.090> dry<00:05:29.540> oil<00:05:29.930> in<00:05:30.229> here<00:05:30.560> I<00:05:31.000> recommend<00:05:32.000> that

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
only dry oil in here I recommend that

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.110 
only dry oil in here I recommend that
first<00:05:32.419> you<00:05:32.630> add<00:05:32.960> there<00:05:33.289> how<00:05:33.800> litter<00:05:34.220> and<00:05:34.580> then

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
first you add there how litter and then

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.560 
first you add there how litter and then
you<00:05:35.300> go<00:05:35.539> to<00:05:35.600> measure<00:05:36.190> this<00:05:37.190> oil<00:05:37.970> level<00:05:38.360> in

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
you go to measure this oil level in

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.170 
you go to measure this oil level in
inside<00:05:39.080> and<00:05:39.380> then<00:05:40.039> when<00:05:40.250> you<00:05:40.370> have<00:05:40.550> added<00:05:41.000> this

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
inside and then when you have added this

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.490 
inside and then when you have added this
oil<00:05:41.479> you<00:05:41.900> insert<00:05:42.350> this<00:05:42.560> oil<00:05:43.340> cap<00:05:44.229> back<00:05:45.229> in

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
oil you insert this oil cap back in

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.230 
oil you insert this oil cap back in
there<00:05:45.770> and<00:05:46.010> you'll<00:05:46.220> take<00:05:46.490> then<00:05:46.729> this<00:05:47.650> this<00:05:49.240> cap

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
there and you'll take then this this cap

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.360 
there and you'll take then this this cap
and<00:05:50.510> hat<00:05:50.720> because<00:05:51.140> this<00:05:51.350> is<00:05:51.440> very<00:05:51.650> important
