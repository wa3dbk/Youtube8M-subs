00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
difficult for me to say but i think

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.410 
difficult for me to say but i think
that's<00:01:01.440> an<00:01:01.590> opportunity<00:01:02.250> for<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.180> want

to be able to india better in the
aviation<00:01:07.409> industry<00:01:08.540> and<00:01:09.540> i<00:01:10.580> think<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.850> that

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
aviation industry and i think is that

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.289 
aviation industry and i think is that
the<00:01:13.229> opening<00:01:13.860> up<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.820> terms<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
the opening up in terms of the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.359 
the opening up in terms of the
restriction<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.869> ownership<00:01:16.369> potentially

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
restriction of ownership potentially

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.550 
restriction of ownership potentially
