turning up all over of course I have a
good<00:01:00.100> idea<00:01:00.400> who<00:01:00.640> the<00:01:00.850> culprits<00:01:01.300> are<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
good idea who the culprits are the

that the easiest way to find out what's

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.010 
that the easiest way to find out what's
inside<00:01:21.070> would<00:01:21.490> be<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:21.700> take<00:01:21.909> a<00:01:21.940> look<00:01:24.600> well<00:01:25.600> as<00:01:25.990> a

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
check all the spheres and see what's

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.010 
check all the spheres and see what's
inside

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
inside

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.289

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
course but this passcode should open use

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:52.569 
course but this passcode should open use
this<00:01:50.450> so<00:01:51.319> if<00:01:51.409> you<00:01:51.469> tried<00:01:51.710> before<00:01:51.859> you<00:01:52.159> accepted

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
this so if you tried before you accepted

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.010 
this so if you tried before you accepted
that<00:01:52.609> quest<00:01:52.969> that's<00:01:53.270> why<00:01:53.390> you<00:01:53.450> can't<00:01:53.719> open<00:01:53.810> it
