00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.879
 the second world war brought 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.550
 rigged a great international crisis 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.439
 that reverberated in different areas here 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.529
 in Argentina among other things he saw 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.090
 affected the automotive activity 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.829
 but the great pilots did not want 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.140
 resign his passion for high 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:31.779
 speeds is then that many of 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.519
 they dabbled in motorboat 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.980
 today to whom for the steel thread we are going 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:38.470
 to show a real pearl of the river 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.860
 that was managed by oscar alfredo 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.339
 Gálvez, a real museum pearl 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.339
 look which 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.540
 today in parallel to 0 we want to show you 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.940
 a boat that besides being beautiful and 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.130
 to be impeccable has a lot of history 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.840
 we are with romina that its owner 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.850
 how are these payrolls very well and you how 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.950
 you walk well very well we want to 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.840
 know in depth the history that 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.600
 it's the most interesting of this boat 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.420
 well we are from a family that always 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.270
 We have sailed since the time of my 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.220
 grandparents and one day dad calls me and tells me 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.350
 I found you something that I always 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.020
 you were asking and I said I was scared 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.630
 when he told me that and it was like love 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.270
 at first sight with the boat was 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.369
 oscar gálvez the tile goes to compete 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.229
 at the time of the Second World War 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.960
 as there were no covers to run in 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.030
 car is like at that time they started to 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.630
 marin hoisted the engines these were 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.369
 some four 60 hp v8 the sea started and 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.100
 they started doing careers here in the 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.640
 delta 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.640
 do not 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.159
 no no 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.340
 in what conditions found because if 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.770
 the important thing also does not 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.719
 Tells the boat 0 from what it is 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.700
 carpentry the engine when what to look for 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.830
 it's all unarmed it was in drawers of 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.260
 apple and good 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.930
 Raponi was the one who varnish or 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.330
 boat who raponi was the one who made the 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.489
 colors and who maybe it was not 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.030
 advising and good here we are 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:26.459
 romina tell me how useful he is if 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.680
 perform to see with friends came a couple 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.349
 Sometimes I get nervous because I see her 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.410
 fragile although it is all reinforced is 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.180
 completely traveled and it is safe not 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.040
 is that you crash into a pier 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.980
 hit a little bit we say lamented in a 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.049
 shipyard and it is solved here we have a 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.299
 way that is 100 years old 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.370
 then fix a wood if it breaks 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:51.829
 that I can change to send 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.829
 change course but it's not the same 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.629
 as I said at the beginning of the note is a 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.439
 boat that attracts a lot of attention 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:14.840
 and it is really impeccable that careful 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:18.500
 has just recently told us that 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.390
 you are going to give him more hands of good varnish 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.000
 how he was out of the water for so long 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.950
 and we were working is how it is 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.349
 wood the wood always replenishes me 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.150
 in the wood is always alive then 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.980
 the idea is that it will stay in the water 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.239
 when they finish working well 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:38.150
 Woods has 11 coats of varnish and goes to 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:41.030
 have as the surplus the surplus 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.829
 varnish varnish goes outside when 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.230
 is finished to accommodate everything when you 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:47.599
 we will give 5 or 6 more hands so that it is 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.989
 optimal press like a mirror that is what 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.989
 what I wanted 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.400
 romina at this moment we are seeing 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.990
 a photo on the cover of a magazine that 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.220
 we think that synthesizes what was the 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.200
 restoration what is the restoration 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.060
 of this boat and the history that 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.510
 encloses that you can tell us good 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:25.540
 this is the note of the magazine stage 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.820
 the graph of February of the year 945 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.190
 when oscar gálvez ran with this 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.320

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.780

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.500
 thank the Argentine nautical museum that

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.960

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:50.470
 eternally thank Luis Aguilera 15 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.320

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.260
 scrap everything rusty and good got that
