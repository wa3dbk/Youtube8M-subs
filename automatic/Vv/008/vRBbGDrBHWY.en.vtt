00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.839
 Hey guys 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:10.500
 It's been a while since I've been there. 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:15.509
 several things did not walk 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.970
 but for work reasons the issues 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:23.210
 I ended up being a long time ago not posted 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:26.869
 nothing we go there had put and 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:32.579
 shock absorbers was 11 give a visual 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:35.730
 animal but lately I'm very attached 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.739
 the city was judging too much 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.500
 city borreau stands with its tower 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:46.200
 lived then also does not have a project 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.030
 leave a little more coffee then 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.399
 that raise a little more to power 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:56.160
 letting Brazilian sedur be the highest 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.940
 it 's very sensational. 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.680
 good has no comparison with any other 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:06.030
 Time for me, for my style. 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.960
 The best thing I put on my 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.280
 moto 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:17.270
 the bike gets much more in the hand for me 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.270
 it was the best purchase that made him win 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:25.290
 other things there with me 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:28.409
 the bike got much looser than him 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.950
 be a lot more loose and are 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.950
 much larger 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:41.009
 I had to also exchange the dampers not 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.549
 It's really stuffy here. 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.520
 the founder or two I have adapted with the 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.350
 little things left over here a little 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:55.670
 can see but some adaptation can achieve 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:02:00.899
 leave everything right there 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:03.299
 there are some things I painted the painting of 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.619
 Lighthouse 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.630
 It's good for me, you 're quite usual. 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.450
 the black flares had been left here 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.430
 there needed to review the bike over 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.050
 losing O to say that had 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.110
 but I want to put some 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:26.550
 something else to make it all black 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:31.530
 must is this then as there has been as 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:35.989
 the noise of the damper with me in the 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.989
 my opinion was better than this 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.299
 that's what I said
