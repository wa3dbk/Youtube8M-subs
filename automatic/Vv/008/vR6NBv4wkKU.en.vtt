00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello everyone with you again booze and scott 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.410
 kavton once again 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.889
 I posted a new picture on my site 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.830
 which us which is depicted as 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:18.600
 such a map whose minimap 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.970
 All games are five but this radio operators but something 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.800
 here is unusual it of course 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.619
 these are the rounds that are here 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.820
 barely visible well by the way is called 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.619
 The picture is just a map. The map is clear here. 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.020
 there are some workarounds that 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.239
 which is still visible even on their website 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.640
 you do not need to clarify how it is clear 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.360
 but I covered this 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.610
 if illuminate at full brightness 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.010
 as you can see here are many 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.930
 interesting passages that like me 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.280
 it seems are ventilation 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.170
 just think if theoretically it 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.539
 scott cavton probably listen like that 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.149
 can let me do the first and second 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.699
 type will be mixed then there will be one door 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.780
 other ventilation why not this in 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:10.310
 first secondly listen to his truth like 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.479
 can you imagine such a game where 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.479
 just one door for now 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.610
 five night at freddy's first part two 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.780
 doors so logical need at least somehow 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:25.470
 act at the second part for 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.250
 ventilation and one main pass on what 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.560
 the main hall is understandable to put it bluntly 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.009
 30 Now their approach to you as well here 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.570
 One is suitable, of course, not here 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.759
 There are such approaches at least 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.820
 least the picture certainly does not stink and 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.420
 laid out scott card poprade on his 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.500
 the site 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.439
 so you can only say that in 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.780
 the game should really be in such 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.180
 passages for animatronics only here 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.520
 joke is that probably not all of them 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.500
 will be able to climb what would be logical 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.240
 there is ventilation if you think something like that 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.700
 there must be given to 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.080
 it intermeddle I do not know here is a 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.090
 hefty golden 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.310
 new short animatronic which 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.560
 could be seen in the trailer because 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.690
 reality as thought was like 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:23.150
 the second part of the example was able to get through 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.260
 through ventilation to you so hefty 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.500
 two meter 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:32.300
 horseradish somehow managed to climb here under 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:35.090
 awesome logical all right well more on 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.230
 scott site nothing discovered failed 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.810
 How are you? 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.550
 clarification gave only such passes 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.580
 before them so you could see 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.040
 but anyway it was already wanted some 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.700
 information and at least something new if 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.810
 honest well well thank you all for watching 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.790
 put your thumbs up 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.690
 subscribe to my channel all good luck 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.690
 until
