00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.430 

that's<00:00:04.440> very<00:00:04.620> nice<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:05.040> be<00:00:05.130> back<00:00:05.210> obviously

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:06.440 
that's very nice to be back obviously

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.770 
that's very nice to be back obviously
after<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:08.280> f1<00:00:08.639> opportunity<00:00:09.210> started<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.630> go<00:00:09.750> I

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
after the f1 opportunity started to go I

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.230 
after the f1 opportunity started to go I
think<00:00:10.019> coming<00:00:10.980> back<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.340> mercedes-benz<00:00:11.759> and

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
think coming back to mercedes-benz and

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.570 
think coming back to mercedes-benz and
recent<00:00:12.750> DTM<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.380> something<00:00:13.920> very<00:00:14.099> close<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.490> my

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
recent DTM is something very close to my

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.029 
recent DTM is something very close to my
heart<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:15.000> great<00:00:15.630> experiences<00:00:16.289> since<00:00:16.949> the

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
heart and great experiences since the

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.260 
heart and great experiences since the
championship<00:00:17.580> has<00:00:17.699> moved<00:00:17.880> on

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
championship has moved on

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.720 
championship has moved on
I've<00:00:18.359> always<00:00:18.570> been<00:00:19.289> enthusiastic<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.279> always

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
I've always been enthusiastic and always

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.210 
I've always been enthusiastic and always
kept<00:00:21.210> in<00:00:21.359> touch<00:00:21.480> with<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.500> think<00:00:22.800> when

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
kept in touch with it and I think when

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.040 
kept in touch with it and I think when
the<00:00:23.310> opportunity<00:00:23.880> arose<00:00:24.090> for<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
the opportunity arose for the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.689 
the opportunity arose for the
combination<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.650> Mercedes<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.189> myself<00:00:26.369> I

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
combination of Mercedes and myself I

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.550 
combination of Mercedes and myself I
think<00:00:26.880> we<00:00:27.000> could<00:00:27.599> have<00:00:27.689> put<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.050> good<00:00:28.199> package

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
think we could have put a good package

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.630 
think we could have put a good package
together<00:00:28.710> hopefully<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.400> bring<00:00:29.490> the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
together hopefully to bring the

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.540 
together hopefully to bring the
championship<00:00:29.820> back<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.480> mercedes-benz<00:00:30.869> I

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
championship back to mercedes-benz I

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.310 
championship back to mercedes-benz I
think<00:00:32.550> since<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.850> left<00:00:33.090> left<00:00:33.660> as<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> champion

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
think since I left left as a champion

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.020 
think since I left left as a champion
and<00:00:34.620> when<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.070> signed<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.399> contract<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:35.940> I

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
and when I signed the contract and I

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.270 
and when I signed the contract and I
hope<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.360> come<00:00:36.540> back<00:00:36.690> as<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> champion<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:38.190> know

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
hope to come back as a champion you know

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.330 
hope to come back as a champion you know
ISO<00:00:38.640> DTM<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.059> something<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.480> know<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.140> think

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
ISO DTM is something I know and I think

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.290 
ISO DTM is something I know and I think
something<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.460> hopefully<00:00:41.610> won't<00:00:41.969> take<00:00:42.180> too

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
something that hopefully won't take too

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.209 
something that hopefully won't take too
long<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.540> get<00:00:42.780> back<00:00:42.840> up<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.140> speed<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.620> be<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.160> a

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
long to get back up to speed and be in a

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.950 
long to get back up to speed and be in a
position<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.670> hopefully<00:00:45.239> be<00:00:45.360> at<00:00:45.480> least<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
position to hopefully be at least on the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.170 
position to hopefully be at least on the
podium<00:00:46.350> at<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.500> first<00:00:46.710> races<00:00:47.160> when<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.789> races

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
podium at the first races when in races

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.160 
podium at the first races when in races
and<00:00:48.360> be<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> title<00:00:49.200> contender<00:00:50.750> my<00:00:51.750> knowledge<00:00:52.079> of

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
and be a title contender my knowledge of

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.930 
and be a title contender my knowledge of
racing<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.620> think<00:00:52.860> has<00:00:53.039> been<00:00:53.250> expanded<00:00:53.789> and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
racing I think has been expanded and

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.400 
racing I think has been expanded and
moved<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> lot<00:00:54.660> over<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.960> last<00:00:55.170> three<00:00:55.379> years

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
moved on a lot over the last three years

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.430 
moved on a lot over the last three years
from<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.430> one<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.670> leading<00:00:57.030> technology<00:00:57.719> you

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
from the one is leading technology you

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.930 
from the one is leading technology you
know<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.680> lots<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.039> development<00:00:59.489> lots<00:00:59.820> of

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
know it's lots of development lots of

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.910 
know it's lots of development lots of
people<00:01:00.270> things<00:01:00.570> move<00:01:00.780> on<00:01:00.960> it's<00:01:01.530> been<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> battle

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
people things move on it's been a battle

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.130 
people things move on it's been a battle
recent<00:01:02.520> in<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.640> midfield<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:03.300> very<00:01:03.539> tight<00:01:03.870> I

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
recent in the midfield it's very tight I

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.920 
recent in the midfield it's very tight I
think<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.890> race<00:01:05.040> management<00:01:05.369> has<00:01:05.939> been<00:01:06.119> one

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
think a race management has been one

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.679 
think a race management has been one
crucial<00:01:07.260> part<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.920> equally<00:01:08.600> developing<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
crucial part and equally developing the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.690 
crucial part and equally developing the
car<00:01:09.900> along<00:01:10.470> with<00:01:10.530> Pirelli<00:01:11.010> tires<00:01:11.220> which<00:01:11.520> seem

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
car along with Pirelli tires which seem

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.260 
car along with Pirelli tires which seem
more<00:01:11.790> difficult<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:12.900> DTM<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.760> you<00:01:14.760> know<00:01:14.850> one

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
more difficult but DTM is you know one

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.580 
more difficult but DTM is you know one
one<00:01:15.570> end<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.930> skill<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.350> another

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
one end of the skill to another

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.080 
one end of the skill to another
competitor<00:01:17.100> from<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.400> one<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.759> think<00:01:17.970> this

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
competitor from the one and I think this

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.600 
competitor from the one and I think this
is<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> best<00:01:18.479> engineered<00:01:19.080> Road<00:01:20.070> car

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
is the best engineered Road car

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.880 
is the best engineered Road car
essentially<00:01:21.180> for<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.509> track<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.960> from<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
essentially for the track and from the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.859 
essentially for the track and from the
one<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> race<00:01:23.400> car<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.850> it's<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.509> little<00:01:24.750> bit

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
one is a race car and it's a little bit

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.020 
one is a race car and it's a little bit
heavier<00:01:25.200> but<00:01:25.530> leading<00:01:25.799> technology<00:01:26.460> again<00:01:26.759> and

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
heavier but leading technology again and

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.179 
heavier but leading technology again and
the<00:01:27.750> development<00:01:28.290> path<00:01:28.500> keeps<00:01:28.950> increasing

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
the development path keeps increasing

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.370 
the development path keeps increasing
and<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:30.180> think<00:01:30.390> competitive<00:01:30.900> racing<00:01:31.259> and

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
and I think competitive racing and

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.440 
and I think competitive racing and
that's<00:01:31.740> what<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.220> know<00:01:32.310> prize<00:01:32.820> me<00:01:33.090> talk<00:01:33.270> to

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
that's what you know prize me talk to

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.530 
that's what you know prize me talk to
want<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.689> race<00:01:33.869> one<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:35.180> don't<00:01:36.180> think<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.390> have

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
want to race one I don't think you have

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.210 
want to race one I don't think you have
to<00:01:36.630> change<00:01:36.869> much<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.320> didn't<00:01:37.590> change<00:01:37.799> much<00:01:38.009> to

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
to change much I didn't change much to

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.730 
to change much I didn't change much to
go<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.729> go<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.850> form<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.240> one<00:01:39.360> from<00:01:39.630> DTM<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.290> you

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
go to go to form the one from DTM so you

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.230 
go to go to form the one from DTM so you
drive<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.280> grip<00:01:41.460> that's<00:01:41.610> available<00:01:41.820> and

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
drive to the grip that's available and

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.359 
drive to the grip that's available and
hopefully<00:01:43.200> with<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.649> combination<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.280> the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369
