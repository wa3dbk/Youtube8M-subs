00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
the UHF ones the FD 460 I think as I SMA

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.819 
the UHF ones the FD 460 I think as I SMA
but<00:04:07.879> the<00:04:08.060> difference<00:04:08.180> between<00:04:08.569> normal<00:04:09.470> radios

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
but the difference between normal radios

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.729 
but the difference between normal radios

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
only thing that the kind of bugs me this

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.999 
only thing that the kind of bugs me this
is<00:05:32.400> an<00:05:32.520> electronic<00:05:32.880> scratch<00:05:33.330> it's<00:05:33.569> not<00:05:33.750> like<00:05:33.960> a

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:34.009 
is an electronic scratch it's not like a

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:36.309 
is an electronic scratch it's not like a
pot<00:05:35.009> or<00:05:35.039> nothing<00:05:35.460> it's<00:05:35.610> done<00:05:35.880> digitally

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:36.319 
pot or nothing it's done digitally

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:38.809 
pot or nothing it's done digitally
that's<00:05:37.319> not<00:05:37.469> too<00:05:37.650> bad<00:05:37.680> but<00:05:37.979> if<00:05:38.400> you<00:05:38.520> want<00:05:38.759> a

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:38.819 
that's not too bad but if you want a

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:44.149 
that's not too bad but if you want a
really<00:05:38.969> you<00:05:39.569> know<00:05:39.750> accurate<00:05:40.380> squelch<00:05:43.159> you

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:44.159 
really you know accurate squelch you

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:47.719 
really you know accurate squelch you
know<00:05:44.310> you<00:05:44.550> need<00:05:44.779> to<00:05:45.779> a<00:05:45.810> have<00:05:46.229> a<00:05:46.440> got<00:05:47.400> one<00:05:47.580> like

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
know you need to a have a got one like

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:52.879 
know you need to a have a got one like
this<00:05:47.880> potentiometer<00:05:49.909> so<00:05:51.229> my<00:05:52.229> rating<00:05:52.469> for<00:05:52.860> this

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
this potentiometer so my rating for this

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:58.219 
this potentiometer so my rating for this
radio<00:05:53.279> out<00:05:53.550> five<00:05:54.060> would<00:05:54.840> be<00:05:55.580> about<00:05:56.580> 4.5<00:05:57.389> you

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
radio out five would be about 4.5 you

00:05:58.229 --> 00:05:59.749 
radio out five would be about 4.5 you
know<00:05:58.349> the<00:05:58.529> only<00:05:58.620> let<00:05:58.830> that<00:05:59.009> is<00:05:59.159> the<00:05:59.370> battery

00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 
know the only let that is the battery

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:02.089 
know the only let that is the battery
meet<00:05:59.940> and<00:06:00.090> not<00:06:00.240> really<00:06:00.690> giving<00:06:00.840> you<00:06:01.050> them<00:06:01.229> the

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:02.099 
meet and not really giving you them the

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:03.920 
meet and not really giving you them the
full<00:06:02.340> warning<00:06:02.819> that<00:06:02.940> it's<00:06:03.060> going<00:06:03.210> to<00:06:03.270> die<00:06:03.449> sort
