cover<00:00:03.419> Mount<00:00:03.659> Everest<00:00:04.049> I<00:00:04.410> was<00:00:04.950> in<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.100> debate

cover Mount Everest I was in a debate

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.829 
cover Mount Everest I was in a debate
one<00:00:05.490> time<00:00:05.670> in<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:05.850> skeptic<00:00:06.299> stood<00:00:06.509> up<00:00:06.629> but<00:00:06.750> he

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
one time in the skeptic stood up but he

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.780 
one time in the skeptic stood up but he
said<00:00:06.990> hopen<00:00:07.230> do<00:00:07.290> you<00:00:07.350> realize<00:00:07.620> when<00:00:08.429> it<00:00:08.519> rains

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
said hopen do you realize when it rains

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.089 
said hopen do you realize when it rains
it<00:00:09.120> releases<00:00:09.780> heat<00:00:09.929> into<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.260> atmosphere<00:00:10.440> I

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
it releases heat into the atmosphere I

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.980 
it releases heat into the atmosphere I
said<00:00:11.759> yes<00:00:11.940> sir<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.090> taught<00:00:12.330> physics<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.809> called

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
said yes sir I taught physics is called

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.360 
said yes sir I taught physics is called
the<00:00:13.049> latent<00:00:13.349> heat<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.469> condensation<00:00:13.679> what's

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
the latent heat of condensation what's

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.779 
the latent heat of condensation what's
your<00:00:14.460> question<00:00:15.980> he<00:00:16.980> said<00:00:17.160> well<00:00:17.310> if<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:17.609> rained

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
your question he said well if it rained

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.970 
your question he said well if it rained
enough<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.150> cover<00:00:18.300> Mount<00:00:18.510> Everest<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.740> heat

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
enough to cover Mount Everest the heat

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.400 
enough to cover Mount Everest the heat
would<00:00:20.220> cook<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.699> entire<00:00:21.029> world<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.810> said<00:00:22.289> you

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
would cook the entire world I said you

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.189 
would cook the entire world I said you
are<00:00:22.439> exactly<00:00:22.920> right<00:00:23.570> he<00:00:24.570> said<00:00:24.779> but<00:00:24.900> don't<00:00:25.080> you

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
are exactly right he said but don't you

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.390 
are exactly right he said but don't you
think<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.500> rained<00:00:25.650> enough<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.010> cover<00:00:26.160> Mount

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
think it rained enough to cover Mount

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.810 
think it rained enough to cover Mount
Everest<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.910> said<00:00:27.119> no<00:00:27.330> I've<00:00:27.630> never<00:00:27.840> said<00:00:28.140> that

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
Everest I said no I've never said that

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.769 
Everest I said no I've never said that
he<00:00:29.820> said<00:00:30.000> what<00:00:30.090> do<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.210> think<00:00:30.390> Mount<00:00:30.570> Everest

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
he said what do you think Mount Everest

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.930 
he said what do you think Mount Everest
was<00:00:30.960> covered<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.560> said<00:00:32.369> well<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.520> don't<00:00:32.790> think

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
was covered I said well I don't think

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.660 
was covered I said well I don't think
Mount<00:00:33.090> Everest<00:00:33.329> was<00:00:33.540> there<00:00:33.960> i<00:00:34.489> don't<00:00:35.489> think

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
Mount Everest was there i don't think

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.639 
Mount Everest was there i don't think
the<00:00:35.760> mountains<00:00:36.090> even<00:00:36.239> form<00:00:36.630> till<00:00:36.899> late<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
the mountains even form till late in the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.530 
the mountains even form till late in the
flood<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.100> Bible<00:00:38.370> covers<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:38.879> Psalm<00:00:39.090> 104

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
flood the Bible covers that in Psalm 104

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.940 
flood the Bible covers that in Psalm 104
we'll<00:00:39.719> get<00:00:39.809> into<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.020> later<00:00:40.140> when<00:00:40.739> we<00:00:40.829> talk

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
we'll get into that later when we talk

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.799 
we'll get into that later when we talk
about<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.309> mountain<00:00:41.969> ranges<00:00:42.329> forming<00:00:42.690> on

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
about the mountain ranges forming on

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.389 
about the mountain ranges forming on
this<00:00:42.930> planet<00:00:43.170> but<00:00:43.620> no<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.920> don't<00:00:44.010> think<00:00:44.219> it

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
this planet but no I don't think it

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.889 
this planet but no I don't think it
rained<00:00:44.550> enough<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.910> cover<00:00:45.090> Mount<00:00:45.300> Everest<00:00:45.600> I

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
rained enough to cover Mount Everest I

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.090 
rained enough to cover Mount Everest I
don't<00:00:46.110> know<00:00:46.170> any<00:00:46.289> Christians<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.739> teach<00:00:46.890> that

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
don't know any Christians to teach that

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.459 
don't know any Christians to teach that
I<00:00:47.399> think<00:00:48.390> what<00:00:48.539> happened<00:00:48.899> was<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.350> whole

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
I think what happened was the whole

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.110 
I think what happened was the whole
world<00:00:49.649> was<00:00:49.800> covered<00:00:50.160> with<00:00:50.190> water<00:00:50.520> but<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
world was covered with water but the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.299 
world was covered with water but the
water<00:00:51.149> didn't<00:00:51.629> come<00:00:51.780> from<00:00:51.899> rain<00:00:52.199> very<00:00:53.129> little

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
water didn't come from rain very little

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.869 
water didn't come from rain very little
water<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.030> flood<00:00:54.239> came<00:00:54.270> from<00:00:54.750> rain<00:00:55.879> so

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
water for the flood came from rain so

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.459 
water for the flood came from rain so
they<00:00:57.030> built<00:00:57.149> up<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.480> straw<00:00:57.750> man<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.199> if<00:00:58.320> it

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
they built up this straw man that if it

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.810 
they built up this straw man that if it
rained<00:00:58.649> enough<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.010> cover<00:00:59.190> Mount<00:00:59.430> Everest<00:00:59.640> it

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
rained enough to cover Mount Everest it

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.189 
rained enough to cover Mount Everest it
would<00:00:59.940> cook<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.270> world<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.629> that's<00:01:00.719> correct

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
would cook the world and that's correct

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.460 
would cook the world and that's correct
but<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.280> an<00:01:02.370> artificial<00:01:02.730> argument<00:01:03.570> that's

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
but it's an artificial argument that's

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.920 
but it's an artificial argument that's
not<00:01:04.680> where<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.920> water<00:01:05.100> came<00:01:05.400> from<00:01:05.869> there<00:01:06.869> are

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
not where the water came from there are

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.570 
not where the water came from there are
several<00:01:07.080> theories<00:01:07.290> about<00:01:07.590> what<00:01:07.740> caused<00:01:08.070> the

flood in the days of Noah I'm gonna

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.750 
flood in the days of Noah I'm gonna

be<00:03:14.380> stayed<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:15.010> believe<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.880> earth<00:03:15.970> broke<00:03:16.299> up

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
be stayed I believe the earth broke up

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.030 
be stayed I believe the earth broke up
at<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.720> time<00:03:16.840> of<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.080> flood<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.590> we<00:03:17.890> still

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
at the time of the flood and we still

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.890 
at the time of the flood and we still
have<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.310> scars<00:03:18.730> all<00:03:19.030> over<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.390> planet<00:03:19.570> where

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
have the scars all over the planet where

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.720 
have the scars all over the planet where
this<00:03:20.079> happened<00:03:20.530> they're<00:03:20.709> called<00:03:20.920> fault<00:03:21.430> lines

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
this happened they're called fault lines

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.270 
this happened they're called fault lines
I<00:03:22.180> lived<00:03:23.140> right<00:03:23.350> by<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.590> San<00:03:23.890> Andreas<00:03:24.040> Fault

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
I lived right by the San Andreas Fault

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.530 
I lived right by the San Andreas Fault
I've<00:03:24.609> studied<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:24.910> Hayward<00:03:25.150> Fault<00:03:25.180> in<00:03:25.480> New

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
I've studied the Hayward Fault in New

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.509 
I've studied the Hayward Fault in New
Madrid<00:03:25.690> fault<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:26.109> golden<00:03:26.380> fault<00:03:26.590> number<00:03:27.370> my

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
Madrid fault the golden fault number my

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.069 
Madrid fault the golden fault number my
fault<00:03:27.760> but<00:03:27.970> I've<00:03:28.209> studied<00:03:28.420> um<00:03:28.570> okay<00:03:28.750> there's

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
fault but I've studied um okay there's

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.720 
fault but I've studied um okay there's
no<00:03:29.200> question<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:29.709> earth<00:03:29.799> is<00:03:30.010> busted<00:03:30.400> up<00:03:30.489> into

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
no question the earth is busted up into

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.979 
no question the earth is busted up into
plates<00:03:30.940> and<00:03:31.209> there's<00:03:31.329> no<00:03:31.480> question<00:03:31.870> these

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
plates and there's no question these

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.289 
plates and there's no question these
plates<00:03:32.350> are<00:03:32.470> moving<00:03:32.799> and<00:03:33.130> when<00:03:33.790> they<00:03:33.910> move<00:03:34.120> it

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
plates are moving and when they move it

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.150 
plates are moving and when they move it
causes<00:03:34.750> tsunamis<00:03:35.319> and<00:03:35.530> earthquakes<00:03:35.650> and

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
causes tsunamis and earthquakes and

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.099 
causes tsunamis and earthquakes and
volcanoes<00:03:36.519> there's<00:03:36.970> no<00:03:37.120> question<00:03:37.480> that<00:03:37.510> stuff

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
volcanoes there's no question that stuff

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.069 
volcanoes there's no question that stuff
happens<00:03:38.579> the<00:03:39.579> question<00:03:40.000> is<00:03:40.180> when<00:03:40.690> did<00:03:40.930> this

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
happens the question is when did this

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.289 
happens the question is when did this
happen<00:03:41.319> to<00:03:41.560> the<00:03:41.650> earth<00:03:41.739> I<00:03:42.040> think<00:03:42.880> it<00:03:42.970> happened

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
happen to the earth I think it happened

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.360 
happen to the earth I think it happened
about<00:03:43.450> 4,400<00:03:44.170> years<00:03:44.350> ago<00:03:44.590> at<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.190> very

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
about 4,400 years ago at the very

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.240 
about 4,400 years ago at the very
beginning<00:03:45.489> of<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.299> flood<00:03:46.650> an<00:03:47.650> evolutionist

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
beginning of the flood an evolutionist

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.470 
beginning of the flood an evolutionist
will<00:03:48.400> say<00:03:48.519> sue<00:03:48.700> wait<00:03:48.910> don't<00:03:49.030> you<00:03:49.150> see<00:03:49.359> that's

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
will say sue wait don't you see that's

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.690 
will say sue wait don't you see that's
proof<00:03:49.750> of<00:03:49.900> Pangaea<00:03:50.470> these<00:03:51.010> continents<00:03:51.370> fit

proof of Pangaea these continents fit

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.759 
proof of Pangaea these continents fit
together<00:03:52.030> can't<00:03:52.630> you<00:03:52.750> see<00:03:52.930> how<00:03:53.049> South<00:03:53.319> America

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
together can't you see how South America

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.550 
together can't you see how South America
and<00:03:53.829> Africa<00:03:53.920> seem<00:03:54.370> to<00:03:54.489> be<00:03:54.579> a<00:03:54.609> fit<00:03:55.350> well<00:03:56.350> yeah<00:03:56.530> a

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
and Africa seem to be a fit well yeah a

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
of Pangaea they teaches in the textbooks

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.990 
of Pangaea they teaches in the textbooks
like<00:03:59.530> some<00:03:59.739> kind<00:03:59.889> of<00:03:59.950> fact<00:04:00.190> you<00:04:00.370> know<00:04:00.489> all<00:04:00.730> the

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
like some kind of fact you know all the

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.910 
like some kind of fact you know all the
confidence<00:04:01.299> used<00:04:01.569> to<00:04:01.660> fit<00:04:01.840> together<00:04:02.139> I<00:04:02.350> say

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
confidence used to fit together I say

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.840 
confidence used to fit together I say
guys<00:04:03.100> now<00:04:03.250> wait<00:04:03.400> a<00:04:03.430> minute<00:04:03.489> there's<00:04:03.730> a<00:04:03.760> couple

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
guys now wait a minute there's a couple

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:04.979 
guys now wait a minute there's a couple
things<00:04:04.030> you<00:04:04.150> ought<00:04:04.209> to<00:04:04.329> consider<00:04:04.389> about<00:04:04.750> this

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
things you ought to consider about this

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.449 
things you ought to consider about this
Pangaea<00:04:05.590> theory<00:04:05.889> before<00:04:06.040> you<00:04:06.220> get<00:04:06.340> too

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
Pangaea theory before you get too

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.849 
Pangaea theory before you get too
excited<00:04:06.930> first<00:04:07.930> of<00:04:08.019> all<00:04:08.109> they'll<00:04:08.500> say<00:04:08.650> South

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
excited first of all they'll say South

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.330 
excited first of all they'll say South
America<00:04:09.280> and<00:04:09.340> Africa<00:04:09.430> seemed<00:04:09.940> to<00:04:10.120> fit<00:04:10.859> yeah<00:04:11.859> my

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
America and Africa seemed to fit yeah my

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.680 
America and Africa seemed to fit yeah my
house<00:04:12.519> and<00:04:12.760> the<00:04:12.819> neighbor's<00:04:13.090> house<00:04:13.239> would<00:04:13.510> fit

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
house and the neighbor's house would fit

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.150 
house and the neighbor's house would fit
too<00:04:13.900> if<00:04:14.019> you<00:04:14.109> slid<00:04:14.350> them<00:04:14.470> together<00:04:14.739> what<00:04:14.980> does

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
too if you slid them together what does

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.650 
too if you slid them together what does
that<00:04:15.280> prove<00:04:16.380> nothing<00:04:18.060> it<00:04:19.060> doesn't<00:04:19.389> prove<00:04:19.479> the

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
that prove nothing it doesn't prove the

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.000 
that prove nothing it doesn't prove the

street used up in between them in the
houses<00:04:21.160> slit<00:04:21.609> apart<00:04:21.909> okay<00:04:22.300> it's<00:04:22.990> a<00:04:23.110> pure

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
houses slit apart okay it's a pure

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.719 
houses slit apart okay it's a pure

you<00:05:25.870> would<00:05:26.020> notice<00:05:26.199> there<00:05:26.590> is<00:05:26.620> dirt

underneath<00:05:27.550> I<00:05:29.129> mean<00:05:30.129> the<00:05:30.219> oceans<00:05:30.520> actually

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
underneath I mean the oceans actually

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.719 
underneath I mean the oceans actually
have<00:05:31.180> a<00:05:31.210> bottom<00:05:31.750> to<00:05:31.960> them<00:05:32.279> how<00:05:33.279> many<00:05:33.460> knew<00:05:33.580> that

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
have a bottom to them how many knew that

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:35.459 
have a bottom to them how many knew that
already<00:05:33.909> okay<00:05:34.330> I<00:05:34.479> mean<00:05:34.659> they<00:05:35.139> didn't<00:05:35.349> have<00:05:35.440> a
