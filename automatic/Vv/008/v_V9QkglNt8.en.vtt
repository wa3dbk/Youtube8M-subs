00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
that first in that video I break down

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.950 
that first in that video I break down
the<00:00:20.950> recipe<00:00:21.130> that<00:00:21.520> every<00:00:21.940> great<00:00:22.210> photo<00:00:22.480> uses

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
the recipe that every great photo uses

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.660 
the recipe that every great photo uses
in<00:00:23.080> order<00:00:23.470> to<00:00:23.619> give<00:00:23.740> you<00:00:23.890> a<00:00:23.920> framework<00:00:24.310> to

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670 
in order to give you a framework to

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.760 
in order to give you a framework to
analyze<00:00:25.119> your<00:00:25.270> own<00:00:25.330> images<00:00:25.869> so<00:00:26.290> this<00:00:26.470> video

make a lot more sense if you go back and

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.660 
make a lot more sense if you go back and
watch<00:00:28.720> this<00:00:28.930> one<00:00:29.110> first<00:00:29.140> as<00:00:29.619> I<00:00:30.130> mentioned<00:00:30.580> in

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
light so let's take a quick look at a

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.229 
light so let's take a quick look at a
couple<00:00:40.000> of<00:00:40.030> images<00:00:40.420> see<00:00:41.080> what's<00:00:41.230> missing<00:00:42.239> okay

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
couple of images see what's missing okay

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:44.970 
couple of images see what's missing okay

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
here's the first image let's take a look

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.950 
here's the first image let's take a look
and<00:00:45.129> see<00:00:45.340> what<00:00:45.640> this<00:00:45.820> photo<00:00:46.330> actually<00:00:46.629> has

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
and see what this photo actually has

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.979 
and see what this photo actually has
going<00:00:47.320> for<00:00:47.680> it<00:00:47.830> well<00:00:48.100> great<00:00:48.940> light<00:00:49.239> for<00:00:49.690> sure

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
going for it well great light for sure

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.410 
going for it well great light for sure
and<00:00:50.229> nothing<00:00:51.010> is<00:00:51.159> blown<00:00:51.400> out<00:00:51.670> or<00:00:51.699> out<00:00:52.150> of<00:00:52.269> focus

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
and nothing is blown out or out of focus

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.259 
and nothing is blown out or out of focus
so<00:00:52.960> decent<00:00:53.379> technique<00:00:53.920> and<00:00:54.220> the<00:00:54.940> composition

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
so decent technique and the composition

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:58.049 
so decent technique and the composition
is<00:00:55.690> acceptable<00:00:56.530> and<00:00:56.860> sort<00:00:57.070> of<00:00:57.159> a<00:00:57.250> boring<00:00:57.699> bland

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
is acceptable and sort of a boring bland

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.329 
is acceptable and sort of a boring bland
way<00:00:58.420> I<00:00:58.449> mean<00:00:58.930> it<00:00:59.080> fills<00:00:59.680> a<00:00:59.799> frame<00:01:00.010> with<00:01:00.159> what's

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
way I mean it fills a frame with what's

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:01.979 
way I mean it fills a frame with what's
interesting<00:01:01.030> and<00:01:01.239> it's<00:01:01.360> got<00:01:01.540> the<00:01:01.690> rule<00:01:01.870> of

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
interesting and it's got the rule of

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.520 
interesting and it's got the rule of
thirds<00:01:02.199> going<00:01:02.680> on<00:01:02.860> so<00:01:03.309> well<00:01:03.820> that's<00:01:04.000> okay<00:01:04.530> but

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
thirds going on so well that's okay but

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.500 
thirds going on so well that's okay but
what's<00:01:05.710> missing<00:01:06.100> here<00:01:06.370> yeah<00:01:07.030> it's<00:01:07.270> the

incredible sunset in Alaska I mean the
light<00:01:27.520> is<00:01:27.760> it's<00:01:28.660> bonkers<00:01:29.050> right<00:01:29.710> but<00:01:30.370> where's

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
light is it's bonkers right but where's

light is it's bonkers right but where's
the<00:01:31.000> subject<00:01:31.540> so<00:01:32.170> now<00:01:32.890> my<00:01:33.100> rule<00:01:33.310> is<00:01:33.340> the

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
the subject so now my rule is the

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.000 
the subject so now my rule is the
subject<00:01:34.570> before<00:01:35.080> the<00:01:35.260> light<00:01:35.500> you<00:01:35.830> have<00:01:35.860> to

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
subject before the light you have to

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.470 
subject before the light you have to
find<00:01:36.340> something<00:01:36.640> that's<00:01:36.790> worth<00:01:36.970> shooting

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
find something that's worth shooting

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.530 
find something that's worth shooting
like<00:01:37.840> this<00:01:38.110> arch<00:01:38.380> in<00:01:38.710> Santa<00:01:39.340> Cruz<00:01:39.550> and<00:01:39.700> set<00:01:40.450> up

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
like this arch in Santa Cruz and set up

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.720 
like this arch in Santa Cruz and set up
a<00:01:40.660> composition<00:01:41.440> that<00:01:41.530> works<00:01:41.800> regardless<00:01:42.190> of

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
a composition that works regardless of

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.240 
a composition that works regardless of
what<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.480> clouds<00:01:43.810> are<00:01:44.080> doing<00:01:44.320> that<00:01:44.950> gives<00:01:45.160> you

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
what the clouds are doing that gives you

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.980 
what the clouds are doing that gives you
a<00:01:45.310> much<00:01:45.730> stronger<00:01:46.090> start<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.510> an<00:01:46.600> image<00:01:46.780> then

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
a much stronger start to an image then

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.810 
a much stronger start to an image then
you<00:01:47.170> throw<00:01:47.440> in<00:01:47.620> some<00:01:47.890> amazing<00:01:48.460> light<00:01:48.640> like

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
you throw in some amazing light like

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.670 
you throw in some amazing light like
this<00:01:49.000> as<00:01:49.210> icing<00:01:49.660> on<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:49.870> cake<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.260> you<00:01:50.530> have<00:01:50.650> a

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
this as icing on the cake and you have a

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.460 
this as icing on the cake and you have a
pretty<00:01:50.920> good<00:01:51.070> shot<00:01:52.050> for<00:01:53.050> this<00:01:53.170> next<00:01:53.380> shot

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
pretty good shot for this next shot

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.470 
pretty good shot for this next shot
let's<00:01:53.980> take<00:01:54.160> a<00:01:54.190> look<00:01:54.400> at<00:01:54.580> another<00:01:54.850> seascape

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
let's take a look at another seascape

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.200 
let's take a look at another seascape
here<00:01:56.380> I've<00:01:56.500> got<00:01:56.650> a<00:01:56.680> good<00:01:57.220> subject<00:01:57.520> this<00:01:57.909> cool

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
here I've got a good subject this cool

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.480 
here I've got a good subject this cool
sea<00:01:58.450> stack<00:01:58.750> but<00:01:59.140> my<00:01:59.409> composition<00:02:00.040> doesn't<00:02:00.250> do

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
sea stack but my composition doesn't do

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.940 
sea stack but my composition doesn't do
anything<00:02:01.180> to<00:02:01.270> show<00:02:01.450> it<00:02:01.600> off<00:02:01.720> I've<00:02:02.380> blown<00:02:02.740> out

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
anything to show it off I've blown out

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.460 
anything to show it off I've blown out
the<00:02:03.130> image<00:02:03.430> and<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.390> light<00:02:04.570> itself<00:02:04.960> is<00:02:05.200> kind

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
the image and the light itself is kind

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.729 
the image and the light itself is kind
of<00:02:05.560> harsh<00:02:06.040> and<00:02:06.370> ugly<00:02:06.790> but<00:02:07.659> if<00:02:07.750> I<00:02:07.840> move<00:02:08.170> closer

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
of harsh and ugly but if I move closer

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.469 
of harsh and ugly but if I move closer
to<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.129> sea<00:02:09.310> stack<00:02:09.610> which<00:02:09.879> improves<00:02:10.300> my

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
to the sea stack which improves my

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.140 
to the sea stack which improves my
composition<00:02:11.170> I<00:02:11.379> wait<00:02:12.250> for<00:02:12.489> sunset<00:02:12.909> which

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
composition I wait for sunset which

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.290 
composition I wait for sunset which
improves<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.870> light<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.379> I<00:02:15.159> use<00:02:15.400> a<00:02:15.430> filter<00:02:15.879> to

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
improves the light and I use a filter to

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.390 
improves the light and I use a filter to
help<00:02:16.510> tame<00:02:16.780> that<00:02:16.810> bright<00:02:17.230> sky<00:02:17.530> improving<00:02:18.250> my

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
help tame that bright sky improving my

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.790 
help tame that bright sky improving my
technique<00:02:19.209> then<00:02:19.569> I've<00:02:19.690> solved<00:02:20.230> those<00:02:20.349> issues

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
technique then I've solved those issues

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.429 
technique then I've solved those issues
and<00:02:21.010> I've<00:02:21.519> made<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.879> shot<00:02:22.439> creating

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:23.439 
and I've made the shot creating

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.119 
and I've made the shot creating
something<00:02:23.650> like<00:02:23.799> this

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
something like this

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.360 
something like this
now<00:02:27.129> here<00:02:27.430> I've<00:02:27.580> got<00:02:27.819> a<00:02:28.000> perfectly<00:02:28.750> boring

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
now here I've got a perfectly boring

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.490 
now here I've got a perfectly boring
shot<00:02:30.370> of<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.849> tortoise<00:02:31.269> in<00:02:31.450> South<00:02:31.629> Africa<00:02:32.110> now

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
shot of a tortoise in South Africa now

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.380 
shot of a tortoise in South Africa now
it's<00:02:32.739> a<00:02:32.860> good<00:02:33.010> subject<00:02:33.310> these<00:02:33.760> tortoises<00:02:34.120> are

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
it's a good subject these tortoises are

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.580 
it's a good subject these tortoises are
really<00:02:34.629> really<00:02:35.049> interesting<00:02:35.439> and<00:02:35.560> really

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
really really interesting and really

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.979 
really really interesting and really
cool<00:02:35.769> and<00:02:36.220> technically<00:02:37.090> it's<00:02:37.390> an<00:02:37.540> acceptable

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
cool and technically it's an acceptable

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.679 
cool and technically it's an acceptable
image<00:02:38.409> the<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:39.159> tortoise<00:02:39.970> is<00:02:40.209> mostly<00:02:40.540> in

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:40.689 
image the the tortoise is mostly in

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.360 
image the the tortoise is mostly in
focus<00:02:41.140> with<00:02:41.319> the<00:02:41.439> background<00:02:41.890> dropping<00:02:42.250> out

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
focus with the background dropping out

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.819 
focus with the background dropping out
of<00:02:42.400> focus<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.090> light<00:02:43.930> is<00:02:44.170> nice<00:02:44.409> and<00:02:44.620> soft

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
of focus and the light is nice and soft

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.430 
of focus and the light is nice and soft
it's<00:02:45.129> not<00:02:45.280> harsh<00:02:45.549> it's<00:02:45.819> not<00:02:45.940> ugly<00:02:46.180> but<00:02:46.659> still<00:02:47.409> I

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
it's not harsh it's not ugly but still I

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.430 
it's not harsh it's not ugly but still I
feel<00:02:47.799> this<00:02:48.010> great<00:02:48.250> big<00:02:48.579> yawn<00:02:49.060> when<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:50.049> look<00:02:50.319> at

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
feel this great big yawn when I look at

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.319 
feel this great big yawn when I look at
this<00:02:50.560> photo<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.609> reason<00:02:51.909> for<00:02:51.940> that<00:02:52.150> is

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
this photo and the reason for that is

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.690 
this photo and the reason for that is
because<00:02:52.359> the<00:02:52.750> composition<00:02:53.379> does<00:02:53.620> nothing<00:02:54.190> to

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
because the composition does nothing to

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.339 
because the composition does nothing to
show<00:02:54.909> off<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.329> tortoise<00:02:55.720> in<00:02:55.900> an<00:02:56.049> interesting

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
show off the tortoise in an interesting

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.490 
show off the tortoise in an interesting
way<00:02:56.819> but<00:02:57.819> if<00:02:58.000> I<00:02:58.209> wait<00:02:58.480> a<00:02:58.629> few<00:02:58.930> minutes<00:02:59.140> until

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
way but if I wait a few minutes until

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.869 
way but if I wait a few minutes until
the<00:02:59.680> tortoise<00:03:00.010> does<00:03:00.280> something<00:03:00.700> interesting

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
the tortoise does something interesting

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.819 
the tortoise does something interesting
and<00:03:01.450> I<00:03:01.540> change<00:03:01.900> my<00:03:02.079> point<00:03:02.349> of<00:03:02.440> view<00:03:02.590> and<00:03:02.769> I

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
and I change my point of view and I

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.039 
and I change my point of view and I
change<00:03:03.250> my<00:03:03.459> composition<00:03:04.150> to<00:03:04.269> take<00:03:04.420> advantage

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
change my composition to take advantage

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.080 
change my composition to take advantage
of<00:03:05.200> this<00:03:05.440> new<00:03:05.769> interesting<00:03:06.549> thing<00:03:06.819> that<00:03:07.000> the

of this new interesting thing that the

this bald eagle photo I took up in

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.740 
this bald eagle photo I took up in
Alaska<00:03:20.349> it's<00:03:20.590> an<00:03:20.769> interesting<00:03:21.040> subject<00:03:21.750> the

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
Alaska it's an interesting subject the

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.420 
Alaska it's an interesting subject the
composition<00:03:23.230> is<00:03:23.349> OK<00:03:23.620> it<00:03:23.799> sort<00:03:23.980> of<00:03:24.069> fills<00:03:24.310> the

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
composition is OK it sort of fills the

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.699 
composition is OK it sort of fills the
frame<00:03:24.700> and<00:03:25.420> while<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.870> lighting<00:03:26.230> is<00:03:26.409> it's

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
frame and while the lighting is it's

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.449 
frame and while the lighting is it's
boring<00:03:27.280> it's<00:03:27.549> you<00:03:28.120> know<00:03:28.239> it's<00:03:28.420> not<00:03:28.599> downright

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
boring it's you know it's not downright

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.159 
boring it's you know it's not downright
awful<00:03:30.459> I<00:03:31.030> mean<00:03:31.239> I<00:03:31.480> guess<00:03:31.720> some<00:03:31.900> people<00:03:31.930> might

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:32.169 
awful I mean I guess some people might

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:33.930 
awful I mean I guess some people might
argue<00:03:32.410> that<00:03:32.560> it<00:03:32.769> is<00:03:32.889> this<00:03:33.010> is<00:03:33.069> pretty<00:03:33.370> flat<00:03:33.639> and

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
argue that it is this is pretty flat and

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.580 
argue that it is this is pretty flat and
bland<00:03:35.760> but<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:37.269> real<00:03:37.510> reason<00:03:38.139> that<00:03:38.169> this

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
bland but the real reason that this

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.460 
bland but the real reason that this
image<00:03:38.859> fails<00:03:39.609> is<00:03:39.970> because<00:03:40.540> of<00:03:40.720> technique<00:03:41.199> I

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
image fails is because of technique I

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.009 
image fails is because of technique I
was<00:03:41.919> using<00:03:42.129> a<00:03:42.370> poor<00:03:42.639> quality<00:03:43.000> lens<00:03:43.329> and<00:03:43.690> I

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
was using a poor quality lens and I

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.869 
was using a poor quality lens and I
didn't<00:03:44.319> have<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.500> faster<00:03:45.010> fast<00:03:45.430> enough<00:03:45.699> shutter

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
didn't have a faster fast enough shutter

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:47.520 
didn't have a faster fast enough shutter
speed<00:03:46.209> just<00:03:46.510> one<00:03:46.780> four<00:03:47.049> hundredth<00:03:47.379> of<00:03:47.440> a

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
speed just one four hundredth of a

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.129 
speed just one four hundredth of a
second<00:03:48.010> to<00:03:48.579> freeze<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.150> eagle<00:03:49.419> in<00:03:49.540> flight<00:03:49.569> and

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
second to freeze the eagle in flight and

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.409 
second to freeze the eagle in flight and
hence<00:03:50.590> you<00:03:50.739> get<00:03:50.859> all<00:03:51.040> these<00:03:51.160> blurry<00:03:51.549> details

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
hence you get all these blurry details

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:54.479 
hence you get all these blurry details
so<00:03:53.019> if<00:03:53.230> I<00:03:53.319> correct<00:03:53.709> those<00:03:53.889> faults<00:03:54.250> I<00:03:54.310> use<00:03:54.459> a

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
so if I correct those faults I use a

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.599 
so if I correct those faults I use a
better<00:03:54.790> sharper<00:03:55.599> lens<00:03:55.840> I<00:03:56.169> use<00:03:56.919> a<00:03:56.949> much<00:03:57.340> faster

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
better sharper lens I use a much faster

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.050 
better sharper lens I use a much faster
shutter<00:03:58.030> one<00:03:58.530> over<00:03:59.530> 116<00:04:00.370> hundredths<00:04:00.849> of<00:04:00.940> a

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
shutter one over 116 hundredths of a

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.849 
shutter one over 116 hundredths of a
second<00:04:01.480> so<00:04:01.959> now<00:04:02.079> I've<00:04:02.199> got<00:04:02.410> way<00:04:02.650> better

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
second so now I've got way better

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.430 
second so now I've got way better
technique<00:04:03.400> and<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:04.690> I<00:04:04.810> get<00:04:04.989> into<00:04:05.199> a<00:04:05.230> situation

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
technique and and I get into a situation

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.439 
technique and and I get into a situation
where<00:04:05.799> the<00:04:05.980> light<00:04:06.160> is<00:04:06.190> better<00:04:06.669> as<00:04:06.879> well<00:04:07.060> all<00:04:07.389> of

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:07.449 
where the light is better as well all of

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:09.930 
where the light is better as well all of
a<00:04:07.810> sudden<00:04:08.109> I<00:04:08.230> can<00:04:08.379> make<00:04:08.560> a<00:04:08.709> much<00:04:09.129> stronger

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
a sudden I can make a much stronger

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.979 
a sudden I can make a much stronger
image<00:04:11.280> for<00:04:12.280> this<00:04:12.370> next<00:04:12.639> shot<00:04:12.790> let's<00:04:13.480> try<00:04:13.930> to

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
image for this next shot let's try to

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.899 
image for this next shot let's try to
figure<00:04:14.199> out<00:04:14.319> what's<00:04:14.889> wrong<00:04:15.190> here<00:04:15.549> because<00:04:15.669> the

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:15.909 
figure out what's wrong here because the

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:17.729 
figure out what's wrong here because the
first<00:04:16.030> glance<00:04:16.299> it<00:04:16.479> looks<00:04:16.659> like<00:04:16.810> a<00:04:16.989> pretty<00:04:17.289> good

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
first glance it looks like a pretty good

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.310 
first glance it looks like a pretty good
shot<00:04:18.099> I've<00:04:18.669> got<00:04:18.909> a<00:04:18.940> great<00:04:19.269> subject<00:04:19.810> this<00:04:19.930> vast

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
shot I've got a great subject this vast

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.710 
shot I've got a great subject this vast
field<00:04:20.530> of<00:04:20.949> Tidy<00:04:21.159> tips<00:04:21.459> I've<00:04:21.669> got<00:04:22.300> a<00:04:22.330> good

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
field of Tidy tips I've got a good

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.960 
field of Tidy tips I've got a good
composition<00:04:23.139> that<00:04:23.560> emphasizes<00:04:24.190> the<00:04:24.520> endless

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
composition that emphasizes the endless

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.850 
composition that emphasizes the endless
expanse<00:04:25.090> of<00:04:25.479> flowers<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:26.020> I've<00:04:26.199> got<00:04:26.380> great

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
expanse of flowers and I've got great

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.379 
expanse of flowers and I've got great
light<00:04:27.130> you<00:04:27.370> know<00:04:27.490> it's<00:04:27.669> soft<00:04:28.000> on<00:04:28.300> the

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
light you know it's soft on the

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.480 
light you know it's soft on the
foreground<00:04:28.870> and<00:04:29.169> it's<00:04:29.650> dramatic<00:04:29.800> up<00:04:30.280> in<00:04:30.400> the

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
foreground and it's dramatic up in the

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.670 
foreground and it's dramatic up in the
sky<00:04:30.729> so<00:04:31.090> what<00:04:31.720> could<00:04:31.840> be<00:04:31.960> wrong<00:04:32.139> out<00:04:32.409> of<00:04:32.440> our

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
sky so what could be wrong out of our

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.860 
sky so what could be wrong out of our
out<00:04:32.919> of<00:04:33.159> our<00:04:33.280> four<00:04:33.580> things<00:04:33.909> the<00:04:34.210> only<00:04:34.330> thing<00:04:34.690> is

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
out of our four things the only thing is

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.469 
out of our four things the only thing is
technique<00:04:35.590> right<00:04:35.979> so<00:04:36.639> the<00:04:36.849> problem<00:04:37.180> here<00:04:37.419> is

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
technique right so the problem here is

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.359 
technique right so the problem here is
that<00:04:37.690> I<00:04:37.719> was<00:04:37.900> very<00:04:37.960> close<00:04:38.200> to<00:04:38.560> the<00:04:38.680> flower

00:04:39.359 --> 00:04:39.369 
that I was very close to the flower

00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:41.639 
that I was very close to the flower
but<00:04:39.669> I<00:04:39.699> was<00:04:39.879> only<00:04:40.089> shooting<00:04:40.389> at<00:04:40.629> f10<00:04:41.139> so<00:04:41.439> if<00:04:41.529> I

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:41.649 
but I was only shooting at f10 so if I

00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:44.579 
but I was only shooting at f10 so if I
actually<00:04:41.830> zoom<00:04:42.279> in<00:04:42.459> to<00:04:42.639> 100%<00:04:42.789> here<00:04:43.599> and<00:04:43.749> I<00:04:44.379> go

00:04:44.579 --> 00:04:44.589 
actually zoom in to 100% here and I go

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:46.559 
actually zoom in to 100% here and I go
over<00:04:44.709> here<00:04:44.800> on<00:04:45.039> the<00:04:45.219> side<00:04:45.459> you<00:04:45.789> can<00:04:46.209> see<00:04:46.239> that

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:46.569 
over here on the side you can see that

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:49.679 
over here on the side you can see that
these<00:04:46.719> flowers<00:04:47.289> are<00:04:47.559> clearly<00:04:48.339> out<00:04:49.029> of<00:04:49.089> focus

00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:49.689 
these flowers are clearly out of focus

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:53.100 
these flowers are clearly out of focus
so<00:04:50.229> that<00:04:50.499> kind<00:04:50.769> of<00:04:50.830> ruins<00:04:51.159> a<00:04:51.249> shot<00:04:51.489> for<00:04:51.699> me<00:04:52.110> but

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
so that kind of ruins a shot for me but

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.109 
so that kind of ruins a shot for me but
to<00:04:53.709> correct<00:04:53.860> that<00:04:54.159> all<00:04:54.339> I<00:04:54.369> have<00:04:54.519> to<00:04:54.639> do<00:04:54.729> is<00:04:54.879> stop

00:04:55.109 --> 00:04:55.119 
to correct that all I have to do is stop

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:57.059 
to correct that all I have to do is stop
down<00:04:55.330> a<00:04:55.360> little<00:04:55.539> bit<00:04:55.689> farther<00:04:55.899> and<00:04:56.199> so<00:04:56.349> for<00:04:56.979> the

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:57.069 
down a little bit farther and so for the

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:59.070 
down a little bit farther and so for the
next<00:04:57.099> image<00:04:57.429> I<00:04:57.610> just<00:04:57.789> went<00:04:57.909> down<00:04:58.059> to<00:04:58.089> f-18<00:04:58.779> all

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
next image I just went down to f-18 all

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.169 
next image I just went down to f-18 all
of<00:04:59.439> a<00:04:59.469> sudden<00:04:59.800> the<00:04:59.919> flowers<00:05:00.339> snap<00:05:00.669> into<00:05:00.879> sharp

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:01.179 
of a sudden the flowers snap into sharp

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:05.659 
of a sudden the flowers snap into sharp
focus<00:05:01.209> and<00:05:01.809> the<00:05:02.289> image<00:05:02.759> regains<00:05:03.759> its<00:05:04.269> quality

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
focus and the image regains its quality

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.009 
focus and the image regains its quality
finally<00:05:06.669> let's<00:05:07.059> take<00:05:07.209> a<00:05:07.239> quick<00:05:07.539> look<00:05:07.749> at<00:05:07.929> the

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:08.019 
finally let's take a quick look at the

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:12.719 
finally let's take a quick look at the
importance<00:05:08.469> of<00:05:08.619> light<00:05:09.339> so<00:05:09.969> here<00:05:10.659> is<00:05:10.869> a<00:05:11.729> photo

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
importance of light so here is a photo

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.969 
importance of light so here is a photo
of<00:05:12.819> my<00:05:12.969> friend<00:05:13.209> Kate<00:05:13.479> shot<00:05:13.929> in<00:05:14.169> ambient<00:05:14.679> light

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
of my friend Kate shot in ambient light

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.879 
of my friend Kate shot in ambient light
she's<00:05:15.969> beautiful<00:05:16.689> but<00:05:16.990> the<00:05:17.259> shot<00:05:17.499> is<00:05:17.529> still

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
she's beautiful but the shot is still

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.999 
she's beautiful but the shot is still
uninspiring<00:05:18.669> right<00:05:19.089> but<00:05:19.749> if<00:05:20.199> I<00:05:20.409> darken<00:05:20.889> the

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
uninspiring right but if I darken the

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:22.949 
uninspiring right but if I darken the
ambient<00:05:21.429> exposure<00:05:21.580> by<00:05:21.999> stop<00:05:22.300> I<00:05:22.569> light<00:05:22.869> her

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:22.959 
ambient exposure by stop I light her

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:24.629 
ambient exposure by stop I light her

from the front using a softbox and I
splash<00:05:24.939> a<00:05:24.969> little<00:05:25.300> more<00:05:25.539> light<00:05:25.779> onto<00:05:26.080> the<00:05:26.439> wall

00:05:26.609 --> 00:05:26.619 
splash a little more light onto the wall

00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:28.379 
splash a little more light onto the wall
behind<00:05:26.800> her<00:05:27.189> all<00:05:27.399> of<00:05:27.789> a<00:05:27.819> sudden<00:05:28.089> I've<00:05:28.149> turned

behind her all of a sudden I've turned

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.069 
behind her all of a sudden I've turned
this<00:05:28.569> boring<00:05:28.959> alleyway<00:05:29.499> into<00:05:29.919> a<00:05:29.949> studio<00:05:30.429> and

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:31.079 
this boring alleyway into a studio and

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:33.769 
this boring alleyway into a studio and
I've<00:05:32.079> got<00:05:32.259> something<00:05:32.679> that's<00:05:33.099> way<00:05:33.429> more

00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:33.779 
I've got something that's way more

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:36.209 
I've got something that's way more
interesting<00:05:34.779> but<00:05:35.319> what<00:05:35.469> about<00:05:35.649> for<00:05:35.860> natural

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:36.219 
interesting but what about for natural

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:38.249 
interesting but what about for natural

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:38.259 
light well here too it makes all the

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:40.499 
light well here too it makes all the
difference<00:05:38.409> so<00:05:39.339> this<00:05:39.550> is<00:05:39.729> one<00:05:39.879> of<00:05:39.969> my<00:05:40.059> favorite

makes it this great subject for a photo
I've<00:05:49.689> got<00:05:49.869> a<00:05:49.899> pretty<00:05:50.169> compelling<00:05:50.529> composition

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:51.219 
I've got a pretty compelling composition

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:53.609 
I've got a pretty compelling composition
set<00:05:51.459> up<00:05:51.639> I've<00:05:51.819> got<00:05:51.969> good<00:05:52.389> good<00:05:52.929> compositional

00:05:53.609 --> 00:05:53.619 
set up I've got good good compositional

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:56.009 
set up I've got good good compositional

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:56.019 
rules and counterpoints and placements

00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:58.439 
rules and counterpoints and placements
going<00:05:56.289> on<00:05:56.469> and<00:05:56.679> and<00:05:57.459> other<00:05:57.819> than<00:05:57.969> a<00:05:58.029> blown<00:05:58.300> out

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:58.449 
going on and and other than a blown out

going on and and other than a blown out
sky<00:05:58.839> here<00:05:59.229> my<00:05:59.409> technique<00:05:59.829> is<00:05:59.979> pretty<00:06:00.279> good

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
sky here my technique is pretty good

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.189 
sky here my technique is pretty good
I've<00:06:00.849> got<00:06:01.029> enough<00:06:01.269> depth<00:06:01.509> of<00:06:01.689> field<00:06:01.959> to<00:06:02.079> get

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 
I've got enough depth of field to get

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:04.079 
I've got enough depth of field to get
everything<00:06:02.439> in<00:06:02.679> focus<00:06:02.709> and<00:06:03.219> I've<00:06:03.639> chosen<00:06:03.879> a

00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:04.089 
everything in focus and I've chosen a

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:05.939 
everything in focus and I've chosen a
long<00:06:04.269> shutter<00:06:04.569> speed<00:06:04.719> which<00:06:05.409> you<00:06:05.529> can<00:06:05.679> see<00:06:05.860> if

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:05.949 
long shutter speed which you can see if

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.100 
long shutter speed which you can see if
i<00:06:06.039> zoom<00:06:06.069> in<00:06:06.459> a<00:06:06.550> little<00:06:06.669> bit<00:06:06.819> adds<00:06:07.179> some<00:06:07.959> nice

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
i zoom in a little bit adds some nice

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:17.519 
i zoom in a little bit adds some nice
softness<00:06:08.769> to<00:06:09.429> the<00:06:09.939> water<00:06:13.619> so<00:06:16.079> the<00:06:17.079> main

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:17.529 
softness to the water so the main

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:19.709 
softness to the water so the main
problem<00:06:17.979> here<00:06:18.009> is<00:06:18.339> the<00:06:18.550> lighting<00:06:19.029> is<00:06:19.209> is

00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:19.719 
problem here is the lighting is is

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:22.799 
problem here is the lighting is is
screwed<00:06:20.259> up<00:06:20.409> so<00:06:20.800> if<00:06:21.129> I<00:06:21.249> add<00:06:21.490> a<00:06:21.519> filter<00:06:22.029> to<00:06:22.209> kind

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:22.809 
screwed up so if I add a filter to kind

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:24.899 
screwed up so if I add a filter to kind
of<00:06:22.869> tame<00:06:23.199> those<00:06:23.469> harsh<00:06:23.800> highlights<00:06:24.249> in<00:06:24.459> the

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:24.909 
of tame those harsh highlights in the

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:27.469 
of tame those harsh highlights in the
sky<00:06:25.209> but<00:06:26.019> I<00:06:26.050> leave<00:06:26.229> everything<00:06:26.649> else<00:06:26.919> the<00:06:27.039> same

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 
sky but I leave everything else the same

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:29.999 
sky but I leave everything else the same
all<00:06:28.479> I'm<00:06:28.779> going<00:06:28.869> to<00:06:28.959> do<00:06:29.110> is<00:06:29.349> I'm<00:06:29.499> going<00:06:29.529> to<00:06:29.709> wait

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:30.009 
all I'm going to do is I'm going to wait

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:34.049 
all I'm going to do is I'm going to wait
for<00:06:30.279> sunset<00:06:31.029> and<00:06:31.929> so<00:06:32.319> when<00:06:32.769> when<00:06:33.189> sunset<00:06:33.699> hits

00:06:34.049 --> 00:06:34.059 
for sunset and so when when sunset hits

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:37.819 
for sunset and so when when sunset hits
it's<00:06:35.429> basically<00:06:36.429> the<00:06:36.699> vibrancy<00:06:37.329> that<00:06:37.539> light

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:37.829 
it's basically the vibrancy that light

00:06:37.829 --> 00:06:40.859 
it's basically the vibrancy that light
improves<00:06:38.829> tremendously<00:06:39.699> and<00:06:40.029> leaving

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:40.869 
improves tremendously and leaving

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:42.389 
improves tremendously and leaving
everything<00:06:41.050> else<00:06:41.649> the<00:06:41.889> same<00:06:41.919> except<00:06:42.369> for

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:42.399 
everything else the same except for

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:45.359 
everything else the same except for
adding<00:06:42.819> a<00:06:42.879> filter<00:06:43.119> waiting<00:06:44.050> for<00:06:44.259> sunset<00:06:44.469> I<00:06:44.889> get

00:06:45.359 --> 00:06:45.369 
adding a filter waiting for sunset I get

00:06:45.369 --> 00:06:47.279 
adding a filter waiting for sunset I get
this<00:06:45.519> tremendously<00:06:46.419> different<00:06:46.749> -

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:47.289 
this tremendously different -

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:49.889 
this tremendously different -
tremendously<00:06:48.099> better<00:06:48.459> shot<00:06:49.209> so<00:06:49.569> you<00:06:49.629> can<00:06:49.719> see

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:49.899 
tremendously better shot so you can see

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:52.319 
tremendously better shot so you can see
there<00:06:50.079> the<00:06:50.199> power<00:06:50.469> of<00:06:50.769> light<00:06:51.339> when<00:06:51.939> it<00:06:52.059> comes

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:52.329 
there the power of light when it comes

00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:52.770 
there the power of light when it comes
to

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
to

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.420
