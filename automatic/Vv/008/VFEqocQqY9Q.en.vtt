i<00:00:16.320> played<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.920> couple<00:00:17.070> weeks<00:00:17.220> ago<00:00:17.490> about<00:00:17.880> a

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
i played it a couple weeks ago about a

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.550 
i played it a couple weeks ago about a
week<00:00:18.270> ago<00:00:18.390> or<00:00:18.539> so<00:00:18.810> something<00:00:19.170> like<00:00:19.199> that<00:00:19.470> i'm

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
week ago or so something like that i'm

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.439 
week ago or so something like that i'm
not<00:00:19.590> sure<00:00:19.740> but<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.730> reason<00:00:20.880> why<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.119> think<00:00:21.240> this

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
not sure but the reason why I think this

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.179 
not sure but the reason why I think this
stands<00:00:21.689> out<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.109> because<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.650> know<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:22.769> didn't

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
stands out is because you know I didn't

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.800 
stands out is because you know I didn't
normally<00:00:23.460> tell<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:23.939> guys<00:00:24.029> not<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.449> play<00:00:24.600> like

normally tell you guys not to play like

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.080 
normally tell you guys not to play like
this<00:00:24.960> because<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.350> do<00:00:25.560> rush<00:00:26.430> pretty<00:00:26.849> heavily

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090
