00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
are down to see the rest of them and so

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.649 
are down to see the rest of them and so
yeah<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:17.099> minimize<00:02:17.849> button<00:02:17.879> is<00:02:18.299> up<00:02:18.450> in<00:02:18.569> the

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
yeah the minimize button is up in the

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.199 
yeah the minimize button is up in the
right-hand<00:02:19.019> corner<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.590> then<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.209> targeting

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209
