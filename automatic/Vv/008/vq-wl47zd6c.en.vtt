00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.480
 good evening my name wrote limes 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.520
 Sanchez Sanchez I'm the coordinator of 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.760
 coexistence of the John F. Kennedy School 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:22.290
 day later they ask me in this 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.230
 moment how the tics have been energized 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:28.109
 inside the school I think that school 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.810
 over the course of his 50 years he has done 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.470
 Advances in the use of media and tips but 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.980
 in recent times we have searched for 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.360
 these these tics first help us to 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.969
 strengthen the processes of 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.340
 teaching-learning and especially 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.410
 also become tools 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.480
 fundamental to optimize 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.180
 communication between members of the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.170
 educational community at the end of the year 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:59.160
 2012 a team formed by 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:02.050
 guidance counselor to 200 mothers and 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.440
 students 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.210
 which is responsible for motivating the use of 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.450
 tics in the different fields of 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.490
 school for this because they have been made 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.050
 some tasks like advancing in our 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.010
 creation of the telephone directory 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.050
 virtual with which we aspire how to 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:24.070
 communicate more effectively to parents 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.860
 of family and in return to school all 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.950
 what refers to the students is being 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.360
 it is 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.160
 subtracting a group of students 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.250
 they will train through the internet 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.080
 for the creation of the blog to use 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.260
 other means and that in this way 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.060
 can also be informed what the 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.220
 academic advances that they are going 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.350
 having in each of his classes good 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.560
 actually the expectations we have 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.110
 is that these new technologies of the 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.140
 information help us make a 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.080
 school that meets every day better 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.180
 institutional goals and a college 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.330
 according to the needs of children 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.330
 of the 21st century names of salamanca I 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.990
 I am a teacher of English and the management of 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.900
 an appointment with your clients 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.990
 very important to me because it allows me 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.520
 motivate them and introduce them to 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.950
 students different types of 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.550
 different exercises 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:30.330
 work fields on the internet 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:33.390
 and that has motivated a lot very much to 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.490
 the groups of the students and has me 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.470
 allowed the same methodology that I have 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.020
 for the development of good afternoon 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.180
 My name is ricardo ortiz I think the 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.750
 explains a cover in class in several 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.960
 senses 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.120
 First, it facilitates the mode of 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.010
 exchange knowledge to negotiate 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.810
 Information to acquire information for 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.000
 the students done that benefits the 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.300
 second class 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.460
 I think it's a way to capture the 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.290
 interest and attention from them since 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.780
 the tics the electronic media 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.210
 Virtuals are a natural way to 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.760
 them my name is fernando bouquets i am 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.870

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.610
 integrated tics to work in the classroom 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.330
 working with platforms like moodle 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:21.750
 which allow me to integrate video 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:24.570
 chat and other tools that attract 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.140
 the students to be able to improve their 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.140
 learning 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.060
