00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.140
 since the time I have to resume 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.299
 something a little more detailed 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.639
 be palms and that's it's it's there 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.080
 there so I removed the dose hood like 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.320
 that we take directly from the 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.880
 Sunday we put ourselves on a minor six 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.130
 so I do it with my fingers but we 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.420
 pick is possible just enough 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.620
 2 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.350
 to ring the bodies in the ranks 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.540
 time when you are at the pick I 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.840
 find it easier with your fingers 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:32.820
 so so the flavors on three chords 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.660
 so insolent miners and the minor for 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.730
 return to minor soil 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.560
 so the interest of the six miners when we 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.370
 take it like that it's stupid 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.690
 shape the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.930
 the two bodies nor if they have the same 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.930
 note 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.060
 they are in unison so here 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.860
 but 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.250
 we go if we come on the ground it's just 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.250
 on point 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.510
 you make them 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.560
 sirh in E minor 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.630
 envied to look for two congo if 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.940
 it's not the say but it gives a 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.490
 sound to get back on him 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.490
 it is also what gives 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.149
 a 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.520
 I redo 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.720
 a 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.060
 m 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.170
 this is the end of the fishing it is 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.730
 him in when he founds the yoke he is 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.350
 the whole chorus is going to happen between the 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.350
 sign between the 6th and the balance in the 16th 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.680
 m 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.829
 okay to complicate a little bit the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.750
 thing and that when it's simple it's 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:59.369
 never too funny and the possibility 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.630
 also add a little small 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.630
 Notes are added anti fact 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.830
 so it's coming on the fifth 5th 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.830
 rope 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.110
 here I want to do that with the middle finger 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.110
 made 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.990
 and 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.870
 I want to resume slowly 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.130
 the 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.150
 what makes 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.090
 Yes 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.600
 latest 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.520
 but play with their husband 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.390
 English 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.690
 the floor his heart net 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.400
 him 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:02.350
 so after for the chorus so I 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.350
 take it as if it were the media 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.230
 so here just a little slit 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.750
 the soil rather than taking it directly 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.240
 we come with the thumb to ring and 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.400
 with both fingers 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.020
 in confessions and lacaune wrote it 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.020
 and in shots in that it does 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.280
 over a year 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.770
 m 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.770
 and 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.269
 the last three 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.270
 e 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.180
 for tron 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.180
 him 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.530
 we come back directly to what was 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.530
 the melody just now 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.970
 we're just ringing seven body says so 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.450
 I resume 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.770
 a 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.140
 should not I be sounded I'm exaggerating on the 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.860
 second part of the chorus we are on a 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.860
 six miners 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:23.019
 we come back to the site is actually a 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.019
 minor the sixth minor friend 6th 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.150
 cost 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:34.390
 I come 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.390
 that there too the demo is important 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.910
 Which give 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.910
 a 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.910
 and 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.860
 yako comes his share a 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.860
 no 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:03.820
 so what makes the chorus and the zero 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.820
 port turns bunker 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.430
 false 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:15.659
 when their voice is changed 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:18.710
 in revolver and his life takkal customers this 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:18.710
 that the enclosure ma 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.270
 I hope it will help us but I will 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.270
 tell later wish
