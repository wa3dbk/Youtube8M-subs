00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:07.810
 It was 10 minutes adult day that club original 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:13.180
 The first piano today is the second 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:14.600
 The last time I moved my finger slowly for the first time in order to move the finger a little smoothly 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.460
 Whats 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:23.340
 Practice to move a little quicker today and strengthen Yuzubi 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:26.460
 I would like to practice at the same time 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:31.140
 Let's get started now 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:34.650
 Today's strengthening the finger and then moving the finger quickly 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:39.960
 I would like to put two horizontal 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:43.370
 You can realize the two by pulling in this rhythm 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.270
 When the little it is easily to the note of explanation 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.270
 Today with this 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.890
 3 types only only does not come out 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.820
 First of all, it is said to put this yellowish book 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.340
 It is also good in the quarter notes 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.240
 I will extend one night 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.500
 This is It is the minute rest or City Branch benefits 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.610
 I will rest for one night 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.710
 And Naa even if some people that Rassharu playing in this is I Tsu bit difficult assignment 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.520
 I think, but it is all right 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.530
 This is two points and eight ordinary husbands 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:23.110
 Extend the length of the three-quarters of the quarter note 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:26.620
 And he will stretch a quarter of the length of the note c worth to say that 16 ordinary man 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:31.390
 I'm do not know why Tatte said such a thing but 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:37.750
 So you are the image of skip 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:41.110
 As if to bounce likeパ ッガ 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:48.210
 I hope you can pull it down 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:49.290
 Plumper Moon 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.810
 I thought 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:58.960
 This is I think this is easy to play and get counted Fu that luck counted Tanto 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:03.990
 Then it will be reflected on the piano already 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.990
 It's not so difficult if you play on the piano 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:17.810
 It is with the position is either the last of the hand from which the piano is taken by the middle one by one in order 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:23.360
 Arrange the finger next to next to 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:30.380
 Then I moved to the real place in the middle of the song and put it in the same place again 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:36.040
 Please go back to the first position and play again 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:41.560
 After you draw while wearing cut passed since standing rhythm as earlier 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:45.200
 If it does not sink from the first Te like this store because I play a little in the ordinary store to defeat once 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:52.569
 Please take a look only to see what I think 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.569
 Boom 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.390
 2 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.390
 2 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.010
 2 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.239
 This time I will play slowly so please play together 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.540
 Hmm 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.159
 Yup 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.670
 In I will pull one more time please firmly remember this rhythm 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.670
 Hmmm 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.830

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:48.540
 Pyon 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:50.020
 When I move, I hear from 3 again with the same rhythm 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.320
 road 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.320
 p 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.870
 Hmm 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.090
 2 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.000
 Have I 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.650
 Well this move by Yeah 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.650
 Same as before 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.830
 2 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.270
 1 minute 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.360
 2 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:15.350
 It's flying again and it's Takka Takka 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.350
 Hmmm 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.780
 hey 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.519
 Lou Buch 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:29.889
 There is only one more practice point 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:34.810
 It is the time to do this time is moved to see 0 and from him 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:41.440
 If you do not connect the sound at that time, you can not strengthen your fingers . 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:45.770
 It means that there is no meaning to practice your finger quickly, so be sure 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:50.490
 Re with the suppressed and handsome color site meaning 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.830
 I'm batting on geosite 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.890
 Hm 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.890
 Four 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.289
 In the wind 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:08.249
 Please try to connect Please try a sample of the useless 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:10.600
 All my eyes are cut with this 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:13.480
 I can not train 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:18.430
 If you take care so much 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:21.090
 Not too much to do so much very good practice will be just because I think that a little tired of 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:25.710
 I please and as to 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:31.740
 Next is your left hand Last time here in the middle and in the middle 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:33.210
 I arranged the fingers later and played in this middle even with the left, but this time using the soil one lower 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.760
 Let's 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.620
 That one 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:42.300
 I think it's easy to sit and play 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:45.930
 Arrange the fingers in the soil one lower than the middle of one piano 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.900
 And in the middle of the song as well as the right hand 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.780
 I will put back my finger again 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.460
 And again how to put this finger back 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:56.820
 If you go 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.790
 I can play it easily, I will play it as well 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.300
 Four 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.480
 goo 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.860
 Minutes 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.220
 Hmm 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.719
 Yup 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.849
 Hmm 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:08.050
 Minutes 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:08.880
 Yup 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.090
 Yup 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.480
 Hmm 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:15.890
 Hmmm 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.890
 Nn 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.800
 Four 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.979
 Four 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.470
 car 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.920
 Yup 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.920
 Yup 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.260
 Hmm 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
 Hmm 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:48.300
 It's difficult for the light to go around here 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.300
 I do not think that the finger of the sound is really difficult 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:54.900
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:07:01.830
 It is a finger of this side of the left hand that is the most difficult in the piano 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:07.830
 In the right hand, the hard ion and the ring of protection It is difficult but the left hand is really at first 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:10.350
 It's very hard to move and it's tired and hard, but this one starts to move 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:13.169
 Because I can not play the piano well 

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:15.990
 This practice is very important 

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:17.240
 Then again the third time 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.190
 An idea 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:24.050
 I am thinking now 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:27.430
 Please take a look at the third visit by all means Thank you to the end 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.430
 It was an adult piano club
