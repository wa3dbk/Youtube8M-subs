00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
and a spark can catch fire one

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.920 
and a spark can catch fire one
so<00:00:35.880> we've<00:00:36.300> we<00:00:36.690> found<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.110> dried<00:00:37.350> grass<00:00:37.680> here

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
that it's easy to catch but that much

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.110 
that it's easy to catch but that much
should<00:01:24.210> do<00:01:24.390> then<00:01:25.350> turn<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.710> over<00:01:25.970> you<00:01:26.970> don't

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
should do then turn it over you don't

of the knife but it's good idea to run
all<00:01:30.870> the<00:01:31.050> way<00:01:31.080> down<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.530> length<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.010> Flint

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
all the way down the length of the Flint

here's<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.770> quick<00:01:34.980> look<00:01:35.160> at<00:01:35.280> what's<00:01:35.460> happening

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
here's a quick look at what's happening

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.820 
here's a quick look at what's happening
the<00:01:36.540> culprit<00:01:36.870> behind<00:01:36.960> why<00:01:37.290> flint<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.800> steel

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
the culprit behind why flint and steel

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.590 
the culprit behind why flint and steel
create<00:01:38.310> sparks<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.910> our<00:01:39.120> good<00:01:39.270> old<00:01:39.390> pal

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
create sparks is our good old pal

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.600 
create sparks is our good old pal
friction<00:01:40.050> once<00:01:40.260> again<00:01:40.560> what<00:01:41.130> most<00:01:41.310> people

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
friction once again what most people

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.250 
friction once again what most people
don't<00:01:41.700> realize<00:01:41.970> though<00:01:42.480> is<00:01:42.690> that<00:01:42.750> it's<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
don't realize though is that it's the

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.080 
don't realize though is that it's the
steel<00:01:43.530> not<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.070> Flint<00:01:44.370> that's<00:01:44.610> causing<00:01:44.820> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
steel not the Flint that's causing the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.120 
steel not the Flint that's causing the
sparks<00:01:45.480> as<00:01:45.690> the<00:01:46.290> flint<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.680> steel<00:01:46.710> rub

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
sparks as the flint and steel rub

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.070 
sparks as the flint and steel rub
together<00:01:47.340> tiny<00:01:47.910> pieces<00:01:48.330> of<00:01:48.450> steel<00:01:48.840> are

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
together tiny pieces of steel are

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.960 
together tiny pieces of steel are
actually<00:01:49.500> scraping<00:01:49.920> off<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.640> amount<00:01:50.730> of

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
actually scraping off and the amount of

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.730 
actually scraping off and the amount of
energy<00:01:51.390> that's<00:01:51.570> released<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:52.110> doing<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.530> is

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
energy that's released in doing so is

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.500 
energy that's released in doing so is
enough<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.160> make<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.430> steel<00:01:53.640> pieces<00:01:53.850> red-hot

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
enough to make the steel pieces red-hot

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.750 
enough to make the steel pieces red-hot
this<00:01:55.290> heat<00:01:55.560> combined<00:01:56.040> with<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.340> right<00:01:56.490> amount

this heat combined with the right amount

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.810 
this heat combined with the right amount
of<00:01:56.850> air<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.090> fuel<00:01:57.480> is<00:01:57.810> what<00:01:58.020> starts<00:01:58.320> your<00:01:58.440> fire

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
of air and fuel is what starts your fire

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.010 
of air and fuel is what starts your fire
now<00:01:59.820> you're<00:01:59.940> probably<00:02:00.120> wondering<00:02:00.300> what<00:02:00.930> are

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
now you're probably wondering what are

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.600 
now you're probably wondering what are
the<00:02:01.050> magnesium<00:02:01.650> shavings<00:02:01.680> have<00:02:02.220> to<00:02:02.340> do<00:02:02.460> with

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
the magnesium shavings have to do with

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.000 
the magnesium shavings have to do with
this<00:02:02.820> well<00:02:03.479> truth<00:02:04.020> be<00:02:04.229> told<00:02:04.260> you<00:02:04.590> can<00:02:04.710> start<00:02:04.950> a

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
this well truth be told you can start a

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.800 
this well truth be told you can start a
fire<00:02:05.160> without<00:02:05.370> the<00:02:05.520> magnesium<00:02:06.030> but<00:02:06.630> it's<00:02:06.750> a

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
fire without the magnesium but it's a

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.080 
fire without the magnesium but it's a
whole<00:02:06.960> lot<00:02:06.990> easier<00:02:07.440> with<00:02:07.650> it<00:02:07.860> when<00:02:08.550> magnesium

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
whole lot easier with it when magnesium

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.780 
whole lot easier with it when magnesium
burns<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.690> burns<00:02:09.720> really<00:02:10.110> hot<00:02:10.550> 2500<00:02:11.550> degrees

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
burns it burns really hot 2500 degrees

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.070 
burns it burns really hot 2500 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.330> be<00:02:12.540> exact

this<00:02:13.590> additional<00:02:14.010> heat<00:02:14.250> makes<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.640> tinder<00:02:14.880> it

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
this additional heat makes the tinder it

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.540 
this additional heat makes the tinder it

sits on catch fire that much faster keep
in<00:02:17.670> mind<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:18.030> little<00:02:18.120> bit<00:02:18.330> of<00:02:18.450> magnesium<00:02:18.570> goes<00:02:19.140> a

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
in mind a little bit of magnesium goes a

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.170 
in mind a little bit of magnesium goes a
long<00:02:19.410> way<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:20.100> be<00:02:20.220> careful<00:02:20.550> with<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.000> avoid

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
long way so be careful with it and avoid

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.000 
long way so be careful with it and avoid
looking<00:02:21.600> directly<00:02:21.810> at<00:02:22.050> it<00:02:22.320> when<00:02:22.500> it's<00:02:22.620> on<00:02:22.739> fire

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
looking directly at it when it's on fire

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.390 
looking directly at it when it's on fire
since<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:23.459> burns<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:23.850> brightly

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.910 

that's<00:02:27.209> all<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.540> takes<00:02:27.720> so<00:02:28.379> you<00:02:28.410> got<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.620> flame

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
that's all it takes so you got a flame

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.040 
that's all it takes so you got a flame
going<00:02:29.129> from<00:02:29.970> here<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.360> can<00:02:30.450> pick<00:02:30.629> it<00:02:30.750> up<00:02:30.840> blow

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
going from here you can pick it up blow

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.980 
going from here you can pick it up blow
on<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.379> get<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.620> air<00:02:31.890> going<00:02:33.680> start<00:02:34.680> your<00:02:34.800> fire
