hi kim here with ochimp.com and we are

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.779 
hi kim here with ochimp.com and we are
looking<00:00:11.760> at<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.299> Crayola<00:00:12.590> dry<00:00:13.590> erase<00:00:14.129> markers

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:14.789 
looking at the Crayola dry erase markers

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:16.790 
looking at the Crayola dry erase markers
today<00:00:15.120> now<00:00:15.719> one<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.110> the<00:00:16.230> great<00:00:16.440> things<00:00:16.650> about

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
today now one of the great things about

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.580 
today now one of the great things about
these<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.279> they<00:00:17.400> were<00:00:17.490> designed<00:00:17.940> by<00:00:18.359> teachers

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
these is they were designed by teachers

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.769 
these is they were designed by teachers
Crayola<00:00:19.590> teamed<00:00:19.859> up<00:00:20.039> with<00:00:20.520> some<00:00:20.789> teachers<00:00:20.970> to

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
Crayola teamed up with some teachers to

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.029 
Crayola teamed up with some teachers to
create<00:00:22.880> the<00:00:23.880> ultimate<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.630> dry<00:00:25.050> erase<00:00:25.439> markers

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
create the ultimate in dry erase markers

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.779 
create the ultimate in dry erase markers
so<00:00:26.490> as<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.759> can<00:00:26.910> see<00:00:27.089> here<00:00:27.419> they're<00:00:27.720> designed

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
so as you can see here they're designed

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.460 
so as you can see here they're designed
kind<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.880> uniquely<00:00:30.419> and<00:00:30.659> this<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.259> so<00:00:31.439> that

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
kind of uniquely and this is so that

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.500 
kind of uniquely and this is so that
children<00:00:31.800> can<00:00:32.130> differentiate<00:00:32.550> between<00:00:32.880> these

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
children can differentiate between these

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.890 
children can differentiate between these
and<00:00:33.870> just<00:00:34.200> regular<00:00:34.470> standard<00:00:35.160> markers

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
and just regular standard markers

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.870 
and just regular standard markers
another<00:00:36.900> great<00:00:37.170> thing<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.500> if<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.950> look<00:00:37.980> here

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880 
another great thing is if you look here

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.119 
another great thing is if you look here
you<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.570> see<00:00:39.600> there's<00:00:40.500> some<00:00:40.649> holes<00:00:40.829> at<00:00:41.039> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
you can see there's some holes at the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.069 
you can see there's some holes at the
top<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.670> actually<00:00:42.059> has<00:00:42.239> an<00:00:42.359> extended

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
top this actually has an extended

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.650 
top this actually has an extended
ventilated<00:00:43.710> cap<00:00:44.039> once<00:00:44.730> again<00:00:45.059> keeping<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
ventilated cap once again keeping the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.990 
ventilated cap once again keeping the
kids<00:00:45.930> in<00:00:46.079> mind<00:00:46.289> just<00:00:46.890> makes<00:00:47.129> them<00:00:47.370> all<00:00:47.640> that

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
kids in mind just makes them all that

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.049 
kids in mind just makes them all that
much<00:00:48.149> more<00:00:48.890> safer<00:00:49.890> for<00:00:50.340> kids<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.730> use<00:00:50.850> now

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
much more safer for kids to use now

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.590 
much more safer for kids to use now
these<00:00:51.210> are<00:00:51.510> aap<00:00:51.960> certified<00:00:52.440> non-toxic<00:00:53.600> and

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
these are aap certified non-toxic and

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.290 
these are aap certified non-toxic and
they're<00:00:54.809> also<00:00:54.960> low<00:00:55.590> odor<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.670> put<00:00:57.090> all<00:00:57.179> those

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
they're also low odor so put all those

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.810 
they're also low odor so put all those
things<00:00:57.359> together<00:00:57.949> they're<00:00:58.949> not<00:00:59.280> gonna<00:00:59.519> harm

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
things together they're not gonna harm

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.369 
things together they're not gonna harm
your<00:01:00.059> children<00:01:00.239> if<00:01:00.570> they're<00:01:00.750> around<00:01:01.170> these

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
all day or you as a teacher either so

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.760 
all day or you as a teacher either so
they<00:01:05.370> come<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:05.910> either<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.540> pack<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:06.960> four<00:01:07.380> or<00:01:07.710> a

and<00:01:11.360> one<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.509> the<00:01:12.600> things<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.079> think<00:01:13.229> is

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
and one of the things that I think is

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.319 
and one of the things that I think is
awesome<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.400> these<00:01:14.700> things<00:01:14.909> don't

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
awesome is that these things don't

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:17.990 
awesome is that these things don't
squeak<00:01:16.310> kind<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.369> like<00:01:17.520> nails<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:17.970> a

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
squeak kind of like nails on a

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.580 
squeak kind of like nails on a
chalkboard<00:01:18.299> but<00:01:18.750> not<00:01:19.049> quite<00:01:19.290> as<00:01:19.409> bad

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
chalkboard but not quite as bad

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.010 
chalkboard but not quite as bad
squeaking<00:01:20.520> from<00:01:20.850> dry<00:01:21.060> erase<00:01:21.299> markers<00:01:21.689> can<00:01:21.869> get

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
squeaking from dry erase markers can get

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.800 
squeaking from dry erase markers can get
very<00:01:22.320> annoying<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.520> these<00:01:24.180> are<00:01:24.329> made<00:01:24.479> not<00:01:24.659> to

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
very annoying so these are made not to

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.889 
very annoying so these are made not to
squeak<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.590> they<00:01:26.369> go<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:26.850> really<00:01:27.570> nice<00:01:27.869> and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
smooth you can see just the tip here you

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.690 
smooth you can see just the tip here you
can<00:01:30.840> use<00:01:31.140> one<00:01:31.619> end<00:01:31.860> if<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.220> wanted<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.520> do<00:01:32.670> a
