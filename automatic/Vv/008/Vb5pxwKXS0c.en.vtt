00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.300 
sliding splice like on a 49er bridle or
something<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:52.020> was<00:01:52.200> good<00:01:52.439> but<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:53.009> know<00:01:53.250> it

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
something it was good but you know it

something it was good but you know it
was<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.909> was<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.180> dog<00:01:54.689> bone<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.259> hung<00:01:55.619> up<00:01:55.799> I

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
was a it was a dog bone so it hung up I

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.830 
was a it was a dog bone so it hung up I
wanted<00:01:56.549> something<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.939> was<00:01:57.090> flat<00:01:57.509> against

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
wanted something that was flat against

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.149 
wanted something that was flat against
the<00:01:57.960> tack

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
the tack

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.660 
the tack
straight<00:01:59.310> down<00:01:59.520> so<00:02:00.049> that's<00:02:01.049> g10<00:02:01.499> stroll

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
straight down so that's g10 stroll

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.389 
straight down so that's g10 stroll
g10<00:02:03.060> plate<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.630> took<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:04.049> center<00:02:05.039> out<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.310> a

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
g10 plate I took the center out of a

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.969 
g10 plate I took the center out of a
hole<00:02:05.579> saw<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.630> put<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.500> on<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.619> drill<00:02:07.950> press

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
hole saw and put it on a drill press

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.249 
hole saw and put it on a drill press
with<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.519> clamp<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.119> just<00:02:09.330> popped<00:02:09.690> out<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.929> disc

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
with a clamp and just popped out a disc

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.470 
with a clamp and just popped out a disc
and<00:02:10.500> then<00:02:10.590> drill<00:02:10.860> two<00:02:11.069> holes<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.879> do<00:02:12.450> a

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
and then drill two holes and do a

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.600 
and then drill two holes and do a
brahmalok<00:02:13.049> splice<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.250> can<00:02:14.400> have<00:02:14.580> a

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
brahmalok splice so that you can have a

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.309 
brahmalok splice so that you can have a
really<00:02:15.000> short<00:02:15.209> taper<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:15.900> keep<00:02:16.080> the

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
really short taper and keep the

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.680 
really short taper and keep the
thickness<00:02:17.010> down<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.610> then<00:02:18.150> basically<00:02:18.599> if

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
thickness down and then basically if

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.309 
thickness down and then basically if
this<00:02:18.840> is<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:19.110> tack<00:02:19.379> of<00:02:19.410> your<00:02:19.830> sail<00:02:21.049> line<00:02:22.049> gets

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
this is the tack of your sail line gets

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.520 
this is the tack of your sail line gets
folded<00:02:22.500> in<00:02:22.799> half<00:02:22.980> loop<00:02:23.879> goes<00:02:24.150> through<00:02:24.540> the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
folded in half loop goes through the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.920 
folded in half loop goes through the
disk<00:02:25.830> just<00:02:26.190> buttons<00:02:26.670> on<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:26.940> back<00:02:27.120> side<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.569> it

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
disk just buttons on the back side of it

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.110 
disk just buttons on the back side of it
and<00:02:28.769> it's<00:02:28.950> sweet<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.430> then<00:02:29.549> this<00:02:29.670> just<00:02:29.879> press

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
and it's sweet and then this just press

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.300 
and it's sweet and then this just press
when<00:02:30.780> there's<00:02:30.959> never<00:02:31.140> never<00:02:31.769> any<00:02:31.920> issue<00:02:32.129> with

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
when there's never never any issue with

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.770 
when there's never never any issue with
taking<00:02:32.910> it<00:02:32.940> off<00:02:33.120> because<00:02:33.329> there's<00:02:33.510> no<00:02:33.599> not

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
doing and I kind of went to the next

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.570 
doing and I kind of went to the next
level<00:04:24.670> on<00:04:25.320> this<00:04:26.320> is<00:04:26.470> just<00:04:26.500> a<00:04:26.740> baton<00:04:27.160> in<00:04:27.460> a

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
level on this is just a baton in a

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.810 
level on this is just a baton in a
bungee<00:04:28.170> and<00:04:29.170> on<00:04:29.290> August<00:04:29.770> 24<00:04:30.220> this<00:04:30.430> is<00:04:30.550> even
