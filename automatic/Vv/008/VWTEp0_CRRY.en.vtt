system<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.390> good<00:01:18.960> for<00:01:19.140> approximately<00:01:19.890> 200

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.570 
system is good for approximately 200
gallons<00:01:21.000> now<00:01:21.630> that's<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.290> bit<00:01:22.619> more<00:01:22.920> than<00:01:23.250> some

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
gallons now that's a bit more than some

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.270 
gallons now that's a bit more than some
other<00:01:23.850> systems<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:25.290> it's<00:01:25.560> kind<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.979> trade

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
other systems but it's kind of a trade

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.450 
other systems but it's kind of a trade
off<00:01:26.310> because<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.810> particular<00:01:28.170> system<00:01:28.650> does

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
off because this particular system does

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.530 
off because this particular system does

other<00:01:55.979> faucet<00:01:56.850> mounted<00:01:56.939> systems<00:01:57.540> remove

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
other faucet mounted systems remove

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.440 
other faucet mounted systems remove
those<00:01:58.380> higher-level<00:01:58.790> contaminants<00:01:59.790> but<00:02:00.329> they

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
those higher-level contaminants but they

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.830 
those higher-level contaminants but they
only<00:02:00.600> do<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:00.930> for<00:02:01.140> maybe<00:02:01.259> 100<00:02:01.979> gallons<00:02:02.579> or<00:02:02.840> 75

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
only do it for maybe 100 gallons or 75

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.859 
only do it for maybe 100 gallons or 75
gallons<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.520> get<00:02:05.670> longer<00:02:05.909> life<00:02:06.060> but<00:02:06.600> it's

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
gallons so you get longer life but it's

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.029 
gallons so you get longer life but it's
not<00:02:07.110> going<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.320> remove<00:02:07.590> the
