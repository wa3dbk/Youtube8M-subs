and<00:00:34.050> something<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.469> really<00:00:34.500> want<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.070> get

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
and something I really want to get

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.600 
and something I really want to get
across<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:36.000> if<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.110> have<00:00:37.410> long<00:00:37.739> hair<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.550> you

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
across is if you have long hair and you

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.610 
across is if you have long hair and you
like<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.930> there's<00:00:40.140> nothing<00:00:40.440> wrong<00:00:40.559> with

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
like it and there's nothing wrong with

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.549 
like it and there's nothing wrong with
it<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.100> really<00:00:41.640> strongly<00:00:42.320> suggest<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.379> you

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
it I really strongly suggest that you

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.380 
it I really strongly suggest that you
don't<00:00:43.800> get<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.129> cut<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.399> short<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:45.360> only

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
don't get it cut this short the only

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.299 
don't get it cut this short the only
reason<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.079> did<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.530> because<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:47.010> felt<00:00:47.190> like

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
reason I did this is because I felt like

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.580 
reason I did this is because I felt like
I<00:00:47.610> had<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.879> because<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.780> was<00:00:48.870> just<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:50.120> damaged

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
I had to because it was just so damaged

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.369 
I had to because it was just so damaged
the<00:00:52.590> layers<00:00:52.980> were<00:00:53.460> just<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:54.239> really<00:00:55.050> don't<00:00:55.230> know

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
the layers were just I really don't know

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.279 
the layers were just I really don't know
what<00:00:55.680> happened<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.129> don't<00:00:56.160> know<00:00:56.399> if<00:00:57.109> when<00:00:58.109> they

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
what happened I don't know if when they

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.340 
what happened I don't know if when they
put<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.949> extensions<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.059> my<00:01:00.270> hair<00:01:00.300> they<00:01:00.989> did<00:01:01.320> a

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
put the extensions in my hair they did a

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.160 
put the extensions in my hair they did a
bunch<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.940> cutting<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.239> like<00:01:03.629> blend<00:01:03.870> them<00:01:04.049> in

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
hair was cut with that because it was

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.810

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.869 
it's a heavier bag it's definitely
heavier<00:03:30.409> than<00:03:30.799> the<00:03:32.590> desire<00:03:33.590> so<00:03:34.430> but<00:03:34.729> it's

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 
heavier than the desire so but it's

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.240 
heavier than the desire so but it's
certainly<00:03:35.569> not<00:03:35.659> as<00:03:35.959> heavy<00:03:36.169> as<00:03:36.290> that<00:03:36.680> Alexander

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
certainly not as heavy as that Alexander

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.580 
certainly not as heavy as that Alexander

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590
