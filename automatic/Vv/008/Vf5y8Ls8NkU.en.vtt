00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
work to it over the years and I kind of

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.490 
work to it over the years and I kind of
keep<00:01:58.939> it<00:01:59.119> looking<00:01:59.539> kind<00:01:59.780> of<00:01:59.869> grubby<00:02:00.229> for<00:02:00.469> a

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
keep it looking kind of grubby for a

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.609 
keep it looking kind of grubby for a
reason<00:02:01.070> and<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.939> reason<00:02:01.969> is<00:02:02.689> is<00:02:03.289> so<00:02:03.469> that

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
reason and the reason is is so that

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.139 
reason and the reason is is so that
people<00:02:03.649> don't<00:02:04.039> think<00:02:04.100> it's<00:02:04.460> any<00:02:04.640> better<00:02:04.850> than

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149

or<00:02:05.479> any<00:02:05.689> good<00:02:06.789> they<00:02:07.789> think<00:02:07.999> it's<00:02:08.270> just<00:02:08.479> an<00:02:08.570> old

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
or any good they think it's just an old

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.419 
or any good they think it's just an old
piece<00:02:08.780> of<00:02:08.899> crap<00:02:09.170> it's<00:02:09.560> not<00:02:09.740> gonna<00:02:09.860> run<00:02:10.100> good

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
piece of crap it's not gonna run good

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.400 
piece of crap it's not gonna run good
you<00:02:11.060> know<00:02:11.180> appearances<00:02:11.810> can<00:02:11.930> be<00:02:11.990> deceiving

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
you know appearances can be deceiving

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.770 
you know appearances can be deceiving
that's<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:13.010> idea<00:02:13.340> behind<00:02:13.550> it<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.180> know<00:02:14.210> make

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
that's the idea behind it you know make

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.290 
that's the idea behind it you know make
it<00:02:14.960> look<00:02:15.490> make<00:02:16.490> it<00:02:16.640> look<00:02:16.790> less<00:02:17.030> than<00:02:17.210> it

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
it look make it look less than it

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.800 
it look make it look less than it
actually<00:02:17.480> is<00:02:17.960> so<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:20.000> doesn't<00:02:20.300> look<00:02:20.450> that<00:02:20.480> good

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
actually is so it doesn't look that good
