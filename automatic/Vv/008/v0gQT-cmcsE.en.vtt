00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.910

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.090
 two minors this week have said 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.070
 with subscribers a big dedications 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.870
 and it makes me really happy 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.830
 I am pleased to share these minors 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.240
 with my subscribers etc 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.530
 we find bars they learn a 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.570
 little more to know me we laugh 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.800
 rage and it's really cool 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.540
 pleasure so there you go see on the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.550
 loot i had a dark and east torso 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.770
 exotic in your old torso must 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.150
 know that the new so the office of 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.770
 purification I do not know how he 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.060
 is called I praise them present time of 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.259
 veterans but there he was an elder of 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.840
 disassemble it served absolutely to 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.159
 nothing you will see that on my second 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.450
 from the north so I was with my little angel 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.189
 and with subscribers I had never 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.570
 play it seems to me so this has one 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.830
 with whom I had already seen that I had 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.950
 already played a role I had never played 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.720
 higher up it was a way of the 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.040
 discover and that's how he 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.360
 plays and that's so it went really well 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.280

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.810
