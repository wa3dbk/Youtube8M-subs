I close down the world straightaway
assumes<00:00:17.310> i<00:00:17.430> noticed<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:17.850> little<00:00:17.970> something

me<00:00:22.470> was<00:00:22.619> completely<00:00:23.460> destroyed<00:00:23.880> if<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.330> wasn't

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660

modded<00:00:24.930> item<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:26.010> I've<00:00:26.070> had<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.250> rebuild<00:00:26.760> some

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
modded item so I've had to rebuild some

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.060 
modded item so I've had to rebuild some
of<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.449> lot<00:00:27.810> was<00:00:27.990> lost<00:00:28.289> everything<00:00:29.039> that

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070

of it a lot was lost everything that
hadn't<00:00:29.519> been<00:00:29.670> sorted<00:00:30.210> had<00:00:30.390> been<00:00:30.599> lost<00:00:30.840> and

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
hadn't been sorted had been lost and

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.610 
hadn't been sorted had been lost and
everything<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.450> was<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.110> system<00:00:34.320> this

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
everything that was in this system this

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.450 
everything that was in this system this
has<00:00:34.770> actually<00:00:34.890> been<00:00:35.520> rebuilt<00:00:37.010> yeah<00:00:38.010> some<00:00:38.430> of

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
has actually been rebuilt yeah some of

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.490 
has actually been rebuilt yeah some of
the<00:00:38.610> items<00:00:38.700> might<00:00:39.030> might<00:00:39.719> be<00:00:39.989> wrong<00:00:40.230> now

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
the items might might be wrong now

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.530 
the items might might be wrong now
actually<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.190> think<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.579> put<00:00:41.790> these<00:00:41.910> as<00:00:42.120> Mark<00:00:42.360> to

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
actually I think I put these as Mark to

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.389 
actually I think I put these as Mark to
instead<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:42.989> Mach<00:00:43.260> 1<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.559> don't<00:00:43.890> think<00:00:44.070> all<00:00:44.340> of

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
instead of Mach 1 I don't think all of

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.740 
instead of Mach 1 I don't think all of
them<00:00:44.760> will<00:00:44.879> mark<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.590> but<00:00:46.590> yeah<00:00:47.399> I'm<00:00:47.730> sure<00:00:48.030> it's

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
them will mark to but yeah I'm sure it's

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.750 
them will mark to but yeah I'm sure it's
good<00:00:48.960> enough<00:00:48.989> considering<00:00:49.649> how<00:00:49.980> many<00:00:50.039> items<00:00:50.460> i

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
good enough considering how many items i

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.709 
good enough considering how many items i
lost<00:00:52.129> ya<00:00:53.129> one<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.670> my<00:00:53.730> engines<00:00:54.120> exploited

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
lost ya one of my engines exploited

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.569 
lost ya one of my engines exploited
because<00:00:54.840> some<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.500> redstone<00:00:56.039> disappeared

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
because some of the redstone disappeared

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.270 
because some of the redstone disappeared
wait<00:00:56.940> couldn't<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.840> redstone<00:00:58.230> like<00:00:59.160> I

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
wait couldn't in the redstone like I

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.010 
wait couldn't in the redstone like I
have<00:00:59.370> no<00:00:59.520> idea<00:00:59.789> why<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.000> disappeared<00:01:00.780> but<00:01:00.899> it

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
have no idea why that disappeared but it

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.490 
have no idea why that disappeared but it
did<00:01:01.199> as<00:01:01.320> well<00:01:02.180> but<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.539> did<00:01:03.750> give<00:01:03.960> me<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> little

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
did as well but it did give me a little

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.539 
did as well but it did give me a little
bit<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.769> time<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.339> rebuild<00:01:05.880> some<00:01:06.689> things<00:01:07.560> well

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
bit of time to rebuild some things well

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.160 
bit of time to rebuild some things well
so<00:01:08.939> many<00:01:09.119> holes<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.600> ground<00:01:09.720> now<00:01:09.990> we're

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
so many holes in the ground now we're

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.920 
so many holes in the ground now we're
all<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.350> marble<00:01:10.740> used<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.040> be<00:01:11.600> this<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.780> now

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
all the marble used to be this is now

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.300 
all the marble used to be this is now
much<00:01:13.140> more<00:01:13.320> compact<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.010> little<00:01:14.220> bit

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
much more compact and a little bit

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.679 
much more compact and a little bit
faster<00:01:14.460> but<00:01:15.240> yeah<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.909> I<00:01:17.909> actually<00:01:17.970> had<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.299> re

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
faster but yeah and I actually had to re

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.280 
faster but yeah and I actually had to re
put<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.080> all<00:01:19.259> these<00:01:19.409> recipes<00:01:20.750> but<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:22.140> all

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
put in all these recipes but it all

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.100 
put in all these recipes but it all
should<00:01:22.560> still<00:01:22.830> be<00:01:22.920> working<00:01:23.390> hopefully<00:01:24.390> in

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
should still be working hopefully in

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.190

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
quickly him to ask for a redstone engine

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.469 
quickly him to ask for a redstone engine
and<00:01:30.119> see<00:01:30.479> what<00:01:30.630> happens<00:01:31.400> okay<00:01:32.400> well<00:01:33.180> that's<00:01:33.329> a

to<00:02:28.980> set<00:02:29.250> up<00:02:29.370> this<00:02:29.519> final<00:02:29.910> frequency<00:02:30.390> yep<00:02:30.600> there

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
to set up this final frequency yep there

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.530 
to set up this final frequency yep there
it<00:02:30.989> is<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.290> red<00:02:31.470> light<00:02:31.680> now<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.850> can't<00:02:33.300> report

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
it is the red light now I can't report

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.030 
it is the red light now I can't report
frequency<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.200> fears<00:02:34.440> but<00:02:34.709> if<00:02:34.769> the<00:02:34.890> frequency

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
frequency the fears but if the frequency

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.270 
frequency the fears but if the frequency
that<00:02:35.370> allows<00:02:35.820> items<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.660> get<00:02:36.840> smelted<00:02:37.220> so<00:02:38.220> it

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
that allows items to get smelted so it

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.340 
that allows items to get smelted so it
should<00:02:38.489> be<00:02:38.640> now<00:02:39.420> wouldn't<00:02:39.720> be<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.810> thousand<00:02:40.230> and

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
should be now wouldn't be a thousand and

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.670 
should be now wouldn't be a thousand and
two<00:02:40.560> would<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:41.360> it<00:02:42.360> could<00:02:42.570> be<00:02:42.720> let's<00:02:43.440> try<00:02:43.560> it

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
two would it it could be let's try it

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.900 
two would it it could be let's try it
out

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
not the correct frequency that looks

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.110 
not the correct frequency that looks
like<00:03:03.570> it<00:03:03.750> could<00:03:03.840> be<00:03:03.900> right<00:03:04.280> 1008<00:03:05.280> maybe<00:03:08.120> come
