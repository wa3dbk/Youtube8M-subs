00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.240
 about smoker parkour 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.750
 if it is correct to speak about means chickens 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.580
 we have 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.889
 Breed Kuchinskaya anniversary husband I have 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.750
 when I built the chicken coop I wanted any 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.640
 was on any general is not very agree 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.830
 I just wanted some kind of parody nave 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.789
 on so she was unpretentious well 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.580
 endured winters well with health 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.050
 she had was not nervous and good 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.760
 egg production was but also after 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.170
 so they will react to what was 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.670
 eat so that was something to eat 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.280
 oath a little bit like that 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.530
 tell yes that's what I chose 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.860
 Breed Kachinsky jubilee rocks of course 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.110
 very much and I want a lot of things 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.059
 but I want my own a little bit 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.170
 hold because there are realities of life 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.570
 I want it to be like a testicle 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.489
 a lot and the meat is tasty well so that 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.620
 birds looked decent even though now 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.780
 pedigree birds quite a lot 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.780
 looks nice drink drink 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.570
 looks nice enough 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.670
 We stopped at the Kuchinskaya anniversary 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.590
 from popular breeds such as there 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.810
 adler silver moscow black 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.100
 we chose 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.259
 still we have more stopped on her 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.850
 because of beauty but i don't know me 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.070
 more like redhead chickens like that 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.350
 to me his you though you burst though in 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.290
 principle and the rest is also enough 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.960
 beautiful were of course I want 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.320
 ornamental chickens and want silk and 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:39.299
 orpington of and brahma and galans I am very 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:43.610
 I want and there billah windows I want more to me 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:47.310
 all all all they like but the ratio 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.470
 Respectively long long growth to 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.290
 long growth of small meat deniska 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.450
 egg production see but still 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.820
 makes more practical a couple more 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.159
 practical breeds pay more 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.500
 attention here means 3 stoves with us 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:06.829
 fasten it sing alone these we have us 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.450
 chief sing and now i will find him 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:12.420
 this is our main song he is the most 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.790
 the eldest here but after molting he got out 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.159
 sconce 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.019
 that is, Kuchinsky and anniversary chickens 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:19.510
 the standard should be without singing whites 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.799
 feathers here she took us and got out 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.439
 he has three white feathers 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.750
 so it's a pity of course we sing to them 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:28.269
 have to let him go to court that is, for now 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.349
 We do not collect eggs for incubation well until 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:34.000
 our incubators are not here he goes with us 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.329
 keeps order so that no one 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 hurt that everything was fair and we can 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.319
 love them as if it is a pity he lives us 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.480
 as soon as we collect the face 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:47.079
 I would incubate it for a month 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.370
 before collecting eggs separately or we have it 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:52.209
 accordingly soo we congratulate 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.549
 let's see him here and two roosters with us 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.139
 such say more 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:03:00.700
 who caught in the corner until the main thing 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:03.189
 seeing this well done here means finnish 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:08.260
 I have a jubilee now I will say how much 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:10.689
 10 10 pieces of core i3 rooster 3 rooster 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.250
 drink they are basically all tame that is 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:14.019
 they are not shy and you can see 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.090
 curious enough to when here 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.689
 tinkering can clean and sit on the neck 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.689
 for flattery. 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:28.269
 Well, of course, white feathers are very disappointed 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.400
 sorry the cock is very cool he has white 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.680
 feathers on the tail straight just pour straight 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.500
 to tears sorry for such manufacturers 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.989
 clean up here but for the time being I donâ€™t collect 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:43.479
 so walking here means I still have 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:45.299
 a gang like this skins this is a cross broken 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:49.019
 brown 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:51.579
 These and disc hens old they gave me 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.819
 friends I mean they were rude to them 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:56.319
 sorry I gave them well in general 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.859
 recently probably somewhere for two months does not have 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.629
 I live here but because of course big 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.220
 big their low egg production 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:05.139
 they look disgusting that is 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.049
 as I do not give them am sure and stern 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:10.599
 for all sorts of vitamins for calcium feasts 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.500
 all the same they are bald and roosters 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:15.449
 of course, too 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:18.989
 on scallops rip haul smoked and the village 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:21.539
 but they had a good egg production 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.160
 by the half of the map has reached in the autumn but not 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.900
 got a couple of months when and to us 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.639
 they came well raced now 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.979
 apparently not quite gone damn chickens rush 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.289
 Rubik stopped them too sorry yet 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:34.050
 so they walk with me then I am all 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.960
 here such poor miserable will sit 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:40.800
 Of course everyone will have to 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:45.120
 send Saturday work singing accuracy 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:48.509
 boil and I still have a mini band here 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:52.830
 now I would find them would not find them 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:56.130
 this, too, yes, these are two comrades, two 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.509
 comrades who gave me chickens he 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.580
 they were already in the will podroschenny 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:01.949
 a month and a half I planted them 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.590
 together with adult chickens here 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.210
 turned this house in the wrong direction 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.159
 entrance from the wall 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.009
 so that the chickens could not get through there from 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:12.659
 they hid here perfectly for those 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:13.800
 sometimes of course they were still chasing 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:17.460
 as the youngest 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.169
 but they have grown enough such already 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.099
 adults but certainly not yet rushing 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.099
 scallops not 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:28.169
 earrings are not they still have not grown I do not know 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:30.509

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.120
 that here is this hen 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:35.610
 smaller here I have there even now and 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.830
 adjust it creep it most likely will 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.039
 cockerel but I think so 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:46.520
 not 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:46.520
