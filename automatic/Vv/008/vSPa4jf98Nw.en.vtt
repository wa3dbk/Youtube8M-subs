00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.399

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.100
 accompany the grandchildren in the last matinee 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.390
 time they decide 'with the mothers with the grandmother 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.420
 take the kids 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.930
 so I'll take the flinstones or the bat 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.030
 the neck and in that shop until the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.430
 have entered the climate of 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.470
 Fantasies and there, tell us the truth. 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.320
 what is the reaction of people when they come 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.869
 you so usually customers see 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.049
 a young mind with fantasies and mind 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.450
 end up leading others come without fantasy 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.180
 seed there we usually dress 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.369
 asks any agent is dressed up to 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.560
 people know how to drink coffee that 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.420
 accounts and the clients see there ends up attracting 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.060
 customers to the store where they do not 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.810
 can put an increase so 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.759
 high 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.850
 then we put 5% to 10% maximum 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.009
 but you can not touch the price very much 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.210
 increases billing on account 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.000
 of demand 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.040
 but as the competition is great and the 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.110
 region people come to look for price 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.110
 and by variety and we can not 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.970
 much increase and who is 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.520
 willing to spend a little more to 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.819
 fall in the party can rent costumes like 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.950
 the one of whale that leaves by 300 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.969
 the real ones or that of mad hatter 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.939
 by 150 today in São Paulo public more 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:24.859
 who uses fantasy is the children's audience 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:27.769
 adults are more for trips to 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:30.889
 cruises but the kids sounds like they 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.420
 to school have prom at school 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:34.790
 so I think the biggest public in the 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:43.840
 carnival today in são paulo is the public 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:46.840
 child is going to take this thing from 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.840
 speech
