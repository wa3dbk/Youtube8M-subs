see but it's straightforward it's got
these<00:02:11.950> two<00:02:12.010> long<00:02:12.970> buttons<00:02:13.660> at<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.870> top<00:02:14.200> the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
these two long buttons at the top the

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.750 
these two long buttons at the top the
middle<00:02:15.100> scroll<00:02:16.000> right<00:02:16.450> there<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:18.400> dpi

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
middle scroll right there and the dpi

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.729 
middle scroll right there and the dpi
change<00:02:19.209> underneath<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:20.049> right<00:02:20.260> there

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
change underneath it right there

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.880 
change underneath it right there
okay<00:02:21.099> so<00:02:21.160> straightforward<00:02:21.940> like<00:02:22.540> I<00:02:22.660> said<00:02:22.900> anti

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
okay so straightforward like I said anti

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.820 
okay so straightforward like I said anti
grip<00:02:24.160> on<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.489> side<00:02:24.730> very<00:02:25.510> lightweight

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
grip on the side very lightweight

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.500

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
nice smooth bottom there so that it

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.820 
nice smooth bottom there so that it
slides<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:29.110> glides<00:02:30.150> not<00:02:31.260> gold-plated<00:02:32.260> not

obviously you can customise that in the

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.920 
obviously you can customise that in the
software<00:02:45.100> so<00:02:45.820> whether<00:02:46.210> you<00:02:46.300> want<00:02:46.480> it<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.630> beep
