many<00:01:02.550> times<00:01:02.969> but<00:01:04.040> some<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.189> style<00:01:05.430> of

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
many times but some of the style of

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.039 
many times but some of the style of
changing<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:08.250> Lu<00:01:08.520> DT<00:01:08.880> goes<00:01:09.150> back<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.689> fact<00:01:09.900> I

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
changing the Lu DT goes back in fact I

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.050 
changing the Lu DT goes back in fact I
think<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.650> lut<00:01:11.130> DT<00:01:11.880> was<00:01:13.250> Tony's<00:01:14.250> very<00:01:14.670> first

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
think the lut DT was Tony's very first

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.899 
think the lut DT was Tony's very first
automatic<00:01:15.689> knife<00:01:16.049> then<00:01:16.770> came<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.040> SOCOM<00:01:17.930> so<00:01:18.930> I

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
automatic knife then came the SOCOM so I

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.730 
automatic knife then came the SOCOM so I
guess<00:01:20.909> we'll<00:01:21.060> start<00:01:21.150> with<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.630> one<00:01:24.409> the<00:01:25.409> Lu

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
guess we'll start with that one the Lu

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.020 
guess we'll start with that one the Lu
DT<00:01:26.159> now<00:01:27.200> this<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.530> interesting

grind<00:02:36.730> lines<00:02:37.030> on<00:02:37.300> this<00:02:37.480> one<00:02:38.910> they've<00:02:39.910> never

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
grind lines on this one they've never

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.780 
grind lines on this one they've never
really<00:02:40.240> put<00:02:40.510> jimping<00:02:41.020> on<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:42.310> spine<00:02:42.580> of<00:02:42.760> the

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
really put jimping on the spine of the

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.540 
really put jimping on the spine of the
blade<00:02:42.970> I<00:02:43.450> wish<00:02:43.990> they<00:02:44.170> would<00:02:44.350> do<00:02:44.500> that<00:02:44.710> so<00:02:45.490> you

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
blade I wish they would do that so you

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.980 
blade I wish they would do that so you
can<00:02:45.670> kind<00:02:45.820> of<00:02:45.880> choked<00:02:46.150> up<00:02:46.360> because<00:02:46.480> it

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
can kind of choked up because it

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.360 
can kind of choked up because it
actually<00:02:47.170> is<00:02:47.410> a<00:02:47.530> larger<00:02:48.100> knife<00:02:49.860> they<00:02:50.860> made

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
actually is a larger knife they made

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.770 
actually is a larger knife they made
three<00:02:51.670> sizes<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.630> Lu<00:02:52.930> DT<00:02:53.320> the<00:02:53.770> MU<00:02:54.310> DT<00:02:55.020> and<00:02:56.640> then

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
three sizes the Lu DT the MU DT and then

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.570 
three sizes the Lu DT the MU DT and then
the<00:02:58.780> UDT<00:03:01.470> coursers<00:03:02.470> there's<00:03:02.740> very<00:03:03.220> small

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
the UDT coursers there's very small

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.410 
the UDT coursers there's very small
versions<00:03:04.150> I<00:03:04.420> think<00:03:04.600> that<00:03:04.720> you<00:03:05.160> UDT<00:03:06.180> there<00:03:07.180> may

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
versions I think that you UDT there may

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.440 
versions I think that you UDT there may
have<00:03:07.540> been<00:03:07.600> something<00:03:08.410> like<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:10.030> set<00:03:10.330> that

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
have been something like the set that

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.300 
have been something like the set that
not<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.780> seventy<00:03:11.170> I<00:03:11.200> think<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.440> 70s<00:03:11.800> and<00:03:11.860> OTF

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
not the seventy I think the 70s and OTF

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.670 
not the seventy I think the 70s and OTF
maybe<00:03:12.550> an<00:03:12.700> 85<00:03:13.150> I<00:03:13.450> don't<00:03:13.720> remember<00:03:13.959> well

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
maybe an 85 I don't remember well

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.230 
maybe an 85 I don't remember well
there's<00:03:14.830> a<00:03:14.920> smaller<00:03:15.190> real<00:03:15.640> really<00:03:15.970> teeny

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
there's a smaller real really teeny

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.180 
there's a smaller real really teeny
version<00:03:18.390> which<00:03:19.390> a<00:03:19.540> buddy<00:03:19.959> of<00:03:20.019> mine<00:03:20.080> had<00:03:20.440> for

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
version which a buddy of mine had for

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.479 
version which a buddy of mine had for
awhile<00:03:22.590> but<00:03:23.590> again<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:23.950> size<00:03:24.160> of<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.370> knife

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
awhile but again the size of the knife

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.070 
awhile but again the size of the knife
it's<00:03:24.970> a<00:03:25.060> almost<00:03:25.360> three<00:03:25.630> and<00:03:25.660> a<00:03:25.750> half<00:03:25.900> inch

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
it's a almost three and a half inch

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.750 
it's a almost three and a half inch
blade<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.780> as<00:03:29.050> I<00:03:29.260> like<00:03:29.830> to<00:03:29.920> show<00:03:30.100> comparison

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
blade and as I like to show comparison

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.550 
blade and as I like to show comparison
picks<00:03:32.730> here's<00:03:33.730> a<00:03:33.820> large<00:03:33.970> Sebenza<00:03:34.360> for<00:03:35.080> example

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
picks here's a large Sebenza for example

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.340 
picks here's a large Sebenza for example
which<00:03:35.680> is<00:03:35.920> I<00:03:36.310> think<00:03:37.000> it's<00:03:37.330> I<00:03:37.630> think<00:03:37.900> it's<00:03:38.140> three

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
which is I think it's I think it's three

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.050 
which is I think it's I think it's three
point<00:03:38.680> six<00:03:41.010> this<00:03:42.010> sub<00:03:42.220> ends<00:03:42.370> is<00:03:42.549> a<00:03:42.610> three<00:03:42.820> point

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
point six this sub ends is a three point

point six this sub ends is a three point
six<00:03:43.269> inch<00:03:43.510> blade<00:03:43.840> so<00:03:44.530> you<00:03:44.950> can<00:03:45.130> see<00:03:45.370> it

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
six inch blade so you can see it

00:03:47.250 --> 00:04:01.610 
six inch blade so you can see it
close<00:03:47.820> to<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.090> size

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:08.509 

so<00:04:02.360> anyhow<00:04:03.410> so<00:04:04.410> that's<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.860> Lu<00:04:05.190> DT<00:04:07.519> large

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
so anyhow so that's the Lu DT large

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.059 
so anyhow so that's the Lu DT large
underwater<00:04:09.090> demolition<00:04:09.629> team<00:04:10.260> it<00:04:10.920> was

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
underwater demolition team it was

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
or armed forces or UDT there it is then

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.629 
or armed forces or UDT there it is then
they<00:04:19.650> came<00:04:19.769> out<00:04:19.889> with<00:04:19.949> a<00:04:20.040> version<00:04:22.520> called<00:04:23.520> the

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
they came out with a version called the

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:30.250 
they came out with a version called the
UMS<00:04:24.320> for<00:04:25.320> fire<00:04:25.530> fighters<00:04:28.490> military<00:04:29.490> personnel

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
UMS for fire fighters military personnel

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.219 
UMS for fire fighters military personnel
rescue<00:04:31.260> personnel<00:04:31.699> really<00:04:32.699> liked<00:04:32.880> the<00:04:33.030> knife

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
rescue personnel really liked the knife

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.330 
rescue personnel really liked the knife
but<00:04:34.229> they<00:04:34.320> didn't<00:04:34.530> like<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.800> fact<00:04:35.040> that<00:04:35.130> it

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
but they didn't like the fact that it

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.360 
but they didn't like the fact that it
did<00:04:35.460> not<00:04:35.490> have<00:04:35.760> a<00:04:35.820> lock<00:04:36.120> on<00:04:36.360> it

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
did not have a lock on it

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.110 
did not have a lock on it
hence<00:04:38.370> this<00:04:38.610> version<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:39.120> UMS<00:04:40.820> and<00:04:41.820> there's

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
hence this version the UMS and there's

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.340 
hence this version the UMS and there's
been<00:04:42.270> different<00:04:42.570> versions<00:04:42.600> they<00:04:42.990> came<00:04:43.200> out

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350

fact with ray skin inserts which I

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.520 
fact with ray skin inserts which I
really<00:05:09.450> like<00:05:09.630> it's<00:05:09.900> one<00:05:10.080> of<00:05:10.169> the<00:05:10.229> reasons<00:05:10.470> why

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
really like it's one of the reasons why

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.340 
really like it's one of the reasons why
I<00:05:10.590> bought<00:05:10.800> the<00:05:10.950> knife<00:05:11.160> now<00:05:11.520> I<00:05:11.990> know<00:05:12.990> the<00:05:13.229> video

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
I bought the knife now I know the video

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.230 
I bought the knife now I know the video
with<00:05:13.710> the<00:05:13.830> lighting<00:05:14.250> this<00:05:14.520> looks<00:05:14.729> like<00:05:14.880> read

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
with the lighting this looks like read

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.469 
with the lighting this looks like read
beyond<00:05:15.930> read<00:05:16.320> but<00:05:16.770> it<00:05:16.889> really<00:05:17.400> is<00:05:17.760> like<00:05:18.000> a<00:05:18.150> dark

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479

blood-red almost a maroon when you see
it<00:05:21.360> it's<00:05:21.510> it's<00:05:21.690> weird<00:05:21.930> how<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:22.080> cameras
