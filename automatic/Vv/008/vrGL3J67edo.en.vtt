00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
five points keys you basically have five

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.740 
five points keys you basically have five
points<00:00:36.670> along<00:00:36.850> the<00:00:37.030> ski<00:00:37.269> that<00:00:37.420> you<00:00:37.539> measure

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
points along the ski that you measure

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
widest point which is actually moved

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.169 
widest point which is actually moved
back<00:00:43.989> from<00:00:44.230> the<00:00:44.649> tip<00:00:44.800> of<00:00:44.829> the<00:00:44.980> ski<00:00:45.100> you've<00:00:45.999> got

00:00:46.169 --> 00:00:46.179 
back from the tip of the ski you've got

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:49.860 
back from the tip of the ski you've got
105<00:00:46.809> underfoot<00:00:47.969> 120<00:00:48.969> behind<00:00:49.329> the<00:00:49.420> binding<00:00:49.809> and

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
105 underfoot 120 behind the binding and

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.910 
105 underfoot 120 behind the binding and
then<00:00:49.989> it<00:00:50.109> tapers<00:00:50.260> off<00:00:50.620> to<00:00:51.149> 114<00:00:52.149> in<00:00:52.359> the<00:00:52.449> tail

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
then it tapers off to 114 in the tail

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.380 
then it tapers off to 114 in the tail
similar<00:00:53.920> to<00:00:54.100> the<00:00:54.219> professor<00:00:54.760> this<00:00:55.239> is<00:00:55.359> a

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
similar to the professor this is a

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.540 
similar to the professor this is a
pretty<00:00:55.629> flexible<00:00:55.989> ski<00:00:56.409> in<00:00:56.649> the<00:00:56.710> tip<00:00:57.280> and<00:00:57.429> the

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
pretty flexible ski in the tip and the

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.790 
pretty flexible ski in the tip and the
tail<00:00:57.609> but<00:00:58.420> it's<00:00:58.690> a<00:00:58.870> little<00:00:59.440> more<00:00:59.559> stable

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
tail but it's a little more stable

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.610 
tail but it's a little more stable
underfoot<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:01.300> idea<00:01:01.600> behind<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:02.140> 5-point

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
underfoot the idea behind the 5-point

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.899 
underfoot the idea behind the 5-point
design<00:01:03.010> is<00:01:03.699> that<00:01:03.900> basically<00:01:05.310> you<00:01:06.310> move<00:01:06.610> the

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
design is that basically you move the

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.180 
design is that basically you move the
widest<00:01:07.240> part<00:01:07.420> of<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:07.600> ski<00:01:07.840> down<00:01:08.200> and<00:01:08.620> then

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
widest part of the ski down and then

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.760 
widest part of the ski down and then
from<00:01:09.730> here<00:01:09.760> down<00:01:10.600> to<00:01:10.870> the<00:01:10.960> next<00:01:11.110> widest<00:01:11.560> point

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
from here down to the next widest point

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.830 
from here down to the next widest point
you<00:01:11.890> actually<00:01:12.310> have<00:01:12.970> the<00:01:13.150> side<00:01:13.390> cut<00:01:13.660> of<00:01:13.780> the

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
you actually have the side cut of the

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.200 
you actually have the side cut of the
ski<00:01:14.170> so<00:01:14.890> when<00:01:15.040> you<00:01:15.130> get<00:01:15.250> it<00:01:15.340> up<00:01:15.430> on<00:01:15.610> edge<00:01:15.880> you

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
ski so when you get it up on edge you

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.210 
ski so when you get it up on edge you
actually<00:01:16.690> can<00:01:17.200> carve<00:01:17.440> it<00:01:17.620> what<00:01:17.740> it<00:01:17.830> does<00:01:17.980> is<00:01:18.190> it

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
actually can carve it what it does is it

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.280 
actually can carve it what it does is it
it<00:01:18.820> changes<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.390> radius<00:01:19.690> of<00:01:19.780> the<00:01:19.870> ski<00:01:20.080> like

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
it changes the radius of the ski like

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.900 
it changes the radius of the ski like
this<00:01:20.470> particular<00:01:20.920> one<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:21.100> professor<00:01:21.700> was<00:01:21.850> a

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
this particular one the professor was a

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.230 
this particular one the professor was a
30-meter<00:01:22.600> radius<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:23.740> is<00:01:24.030> 17.3<00:01:25.030> meter

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
30-meter radius this is 17.3 meter

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.690 
30-meter radius this is 17.3 meter
radius<00:01:25.630> and<00:01:25.780> so<00:01:25.930> it's<00:01:26.260> going<00:01:26.440> to<00:01:26.530> be<00:01:26.740> a<00:01:27.010> much

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
radius and so it's going to be a much

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.090 
radius and so it's going to be a much
quicker<00:01:28.000> ski<00:01:28.450> edge<00:01:28.690> to<00:01:28.720> edge<00:01:29.110> and<00:01:29.500> because<00:01:30.070> of

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
quicker ski edge to edge and because of

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.910 
quicker ski edge to edge and because of
the<00:01:30.370> fact<00:01:30.580> that<00:01:30.760> you<00:01:31.480> when<00:01:32.260> you<00:01:32.350> turn<00:01:32.530> it<00:01:32.560> up<00:01:32.740> on

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
the fact that you when you turn it up on

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.290 
the fact that you when you turn it up on
edge<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.340> widest<00:01:33.610> part<00:01:33.760> of<00:01:33.820> the<00:01:33.910> skis<00:01:34.150> in

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
edge the widest part of the skis in

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.050 
edge the widest part of the skis in
contact<00:01:34.750> to<00:01:34.840> increase<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.380> pressure<00:01:35.590> on<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
contact to increase the pressure on the

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.480 
contact to increase the pressure on the
entire<00:01:37.450> side<00:01:38.110> cut<00:01:38.410> here<00:01:38.710> of<00:01:38.800> the<00:01:38.920> ski<00:01:39.190> so

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
entire side cut here of the ski so

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.830 
entire side cut here of the ski so
you're<00:01:39.670> going<00:01:39.820> to<00:01:39.880> it's<00:01:40.510> going<00:01:40.570> to<00:01:40.720> be<00:01:40.810> a

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
you're going to it's going to be a

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.200 
you're going to it's going to be a
better<00:01:41.020> carving<00:01:41.470> ski<00:01:41.790> because<00:01:42.790> of<00:01:42.910> the<00:01:42.970> rocker

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
better carving ski because of the rocker

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.150 
better carving ski because of the rocker
it's<00:01:44.020> still<00:01:44.260> going<00:01:44.320> to<00:01:44.530> do<00:01:44.680> well<00:01:44.920> in<00:01:44.950> the

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
it's still going to do well in the

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.000 
it's still going to do well in the
powder<00:01:45.370> and<00:01:45.670> then<00:01:46.030> actually<00:01:46.410> bringing<00:01:47.410> you

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
powder and then actually bringing you

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.010 
powder and then actually bringing you
know<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.220> wire<00:01:48.400> point<00:01:48.850> right<00:01:49.420> here<00:01:49.450> and<00:01:49.990> right

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
know the wire point right here and right

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.020 
know the wire point right here and right
here<00:01:50.620> you<00:01:50.980> actually<00:01:51.370> increase<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.700> surface

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
here you actually increase the surface

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.300 
here you actually increase the surface
area<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.660> ski<00:01:52.900> a<00:01:52.930> little<00:01:53.080> bit<00:01:53.320> so<00:01:53.830> still<00:01:54.100> going

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
area the ski a little bit so still going

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.650 
area the ski a little bit so still going
to<00:01:54.370> do<00:01:54.490> very<00:01:54.520> well<00:01:54.760> in<00:01:55.030> powder<00:01:55.240> this<00:01:55.540> is
