00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.550 

and<00:00:00.329> if<00:00:00.420> you're<00:00:00.570> thinking<00:00:00.870> to<00:00:00.900> put<00:00:01.020> inverted

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
and if you're thinking to put inverted

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.530 
and if you're thinking to put inverted
pieces<00:00:01.920> over<00:00:02.159> here<00:00:02.370> to<00:00:02.820> make<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:02.970> straight<00:00:03.330> line

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
pieces over here to make a straight line

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.720 
pieces over here to make a straight line
I<00:00:03.810> already<00:00:04.560> tried<00:00:04.799> that<00:00:04.830> and<00:00:05.130> I<00:00:05.190> was<00:00:05.339> kind<00:00:05.580> of

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
I already tried that and I was kind of

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.610 
I already tried that and I was kind of
fragile<00:00:05.940> what<00:00:06.569> I<00:00:06.600> was<00:00:06.779> gonna<00:00:06.960> split<00:00:07.259> it<00:00:07.410> around

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
fragile what I was gonna split it around

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.680 
fragile what I was gonna split it around
here<00:00:07.890> so<00:00:08.700> I<00:00:08.760> think<00:00:08.970> it's<00:00:09.090> just<00:00:09.210> better<00:00:09.420> and

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
here so I think it's just better and

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.629 
here so I think it's just better and
more<00:00:09.780> stable<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.380> keep<00:00:10.530> it<00:00:10.650> like<00:00:10.800> this<00:00:10.980> now

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
more stable to keep it like this now

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:26.830 
more stable to keep it like this now
fill<00:00:11.849> in<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.030> rest<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.420> head<00:00:12.599> with<00:00:12.840> black

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:40.490 

then<00:00:27.840> add<00:00:27.990> 2<00:00:28.199> more<00:00:28.410> rows<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.770> black<00:00:28.980> on<00:00:29.160> top<00:00:39.500> for

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
then add 2 more rows of black on top for

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.070 
then add 2 more rows of black on top for
the<00:00:40.530> arms<00:00:40.890> take<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.730> black<00:00:41.970> piece<00:00:42.210> fold<00:00:42.839> up<00:00:42.960> the
