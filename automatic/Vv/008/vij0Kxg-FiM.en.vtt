00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
and a manner may be more pragmatic than

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.230 
and a manner may be more pragmatic than
we're<00:00:26.650> used<00:00:26.800> to<00:00:26.919> why<00:00:27.250> a<00:00:27.579> person<00:00:27.880> should

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
we're used to why a person should

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.240 
we're used to why a person should
believe<00:00:28.509> in<00:00:29.140> the<00:00:29.199> Word<00:00:29.380> of<00:00:29.500> God<00:00:29.560> as<00:00:29.980> the<00:00:30.130> Bible

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.090 
believe in the Word of God as the Bible
and<00:00:30.720> why<00:00:31.720> they<00:00:31.899> should<00:00:31.930> basically<00:00:32.379> believe

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
and why they should basically believe

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.759 
and why they should basically believe
every<00:00:33.340> word<00:00:33.460> it<00:00:33.640> says<00:00:33.820> as<00:00:34.809> opposed<00:00:35.170> to<00:00:35.350> any

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:35.769 
every word it says as opposed to any

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:39.119 
every word it says as opposed to any
other<00:00:36.030> holy<00:00:37.030> book<00:00:37.540> and<00:00:37.840> why<00:00:38.379> they<00:00:38.589> should<00:00:38.829> give

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
other holy book and why they should give

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.250 
other holy book and why they should give
their<00:00:39.280> entire<00:00:39.370> life<00:00:39.699> to<00:00:39.730> Christ<00:00:40.059> I<00:00:42.960> know<00:00:43.960> that

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
their entire life to Christ I know that

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
which was Sir Richard a series of

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.120 
which was Sir Richard a series of
lectures<00:01:10.360> delivered<00:01:10.510> at<00:01:10.810> Harvard<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.740> second

lectures delivered at Harvard the second
part<00:01:12.400> of<00:01:12.520> it<00:01:12.640> deals<00:01:12.940> with<00:01:13.120> that<00:01:13.360> very<00:01:13.690> thing<00:01:14.020> so

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
part of it deals with that very thing so

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.940 
part of it deals with that very thing so
let<00:01:14.440> me<00:01:14.590> start<00:01:14.920> off<00:01:15.070> as<00:01:15.340> best<00:01:15.790> as<00:01:16.030> I<00:01:16.180> can

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
let me start off as best as I can

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.090 
let me start off as best as I can
first<00:01:17.950> I<00:01:18.220> believe<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.780> truth<00:01:20.140> as<00:01:20.410> a<00:01:20.470> category

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
first I believe that truth as a category

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.710 
first I believe that truth as a category
does<00:01:21.460> exist<00:01:22.740> number<00:01:23.740> two<00:01:23.920> it<00:01:24.280> is<00:01:24.340> possible<00:01:25.090> in

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
does exist number two it is possible in

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.290 
does exist number two it is possible in
a<00:01:25.869> majority<00:01:26.530> of<00:01:26.800> claims<00:01:27.100> of<00:01:27.520> philosophical

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
a majority of claims of philosophical

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.109 
a majority of claims of philosophical
and<00:01:28.450> historical<00:01:28.740> statements<00:01:29.740> to<00:01:30.250> verify<00:01:30.760> the

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
and historical statements to verify the

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.469 
and historical statements to verify the
truthfulness<00:01:31.660> of<00:01:31.780> those<00:01:32.380> affirmations<00:01:33.479> third

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
truthfulness of those affirmations third

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.420 
truthfulness of those affirmations third
I<00:01:34.840> believe<00:01:35.440> there<00:01:35.650> are<00:01:35.770> existential

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
I believe there are existential

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.510 
I believe there are existential
realities<00:01:37.330> from<00:01:37.720> which<00:01:37.869> I<00:01:38.050> cannot<00:01:38.380> run<00:01:38.680> which

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
realities from which I cannot run which

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.969 
realities from which I cannot run which
drive<00:01:40.060> me<00:01:40.390> to<00:01:40.570> find<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:41.050> answers<00:01:41.560> to<00:01:41.860> the

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
drive me to find the answers to the

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.010 
drive me to find the answers to the
existential<00:01:42.580> struggles<00:01:43.300> that<00:01:43.479> I<00:01:43.540> live<00:01:43.840> with

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
existential struggles that I live with

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.140 
existential struggles that I live with
not<00:01:44.440> just<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.800> philosophical<00:01:45.520> ones<00:01:45.700> the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
not just the philosophical ones the

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.240 
not just the philosophical ones the
philosophical<00:01:46.900> ones<00:01:47.080> are<00:01:47.290> real<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:47.860> I<00:01:48.040> have

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
philosophical ones are real and I have

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.770 
philosophical ones are real and I have
to<00:01:48.430> deal<00:01:48.640> with<00:01:48.820> them<00:01:48.940> but<00:01:49.390> so<00:01:49.630> are<00:01:49.750> the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
to deal with them but so are the

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.590 
to deal with them but so are the
existential<00:01:50.440> ones<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:50.950> by<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.160> way

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
existential ones and by the way

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.240 
existential ones and by the way
existentialism<00:01:52.600> came<00:01:53.140> as<00:01:53.410> a<00:01:53.440> respond<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.130> the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
existentialism came as a respond to the

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.999 
existentialism came as a respond to the
unpaid<00:01:54.820> bills<00:01:55.090> of<00:01:55.509> philosophy<00:01:56.110> but<00:01:56.680> I<00:01:56.710> think

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
unpaid bills of philosophy but I think

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.530 
unpaid bills of philosophy but I think
what<00:01:57.220> we<00:01:57.400> are<00:01:57.430> trying<00:01:57.580> to<00:01:58.000> do<00:01:58.120> is<00:01:58.240> if<00:01:58.360> we<00:01:58.450> are

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
what we are trying to do is if we are

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.360 
what we are trying to do is if we are
trying<00:01:58.780> to<00:01:58.900> find<00:01:59.290> the<00:01:59.530> bridge<00:01:59.770> between<00:02:00.040> the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
trying to find the bridge between the

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.820 
trying to find the bridge between the
head<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:01.060> heart<00:02:01.300> there<00:02:02.200> are<00:02:02.380> numerous

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
head and the heart there are numerous

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.910 
head and the heart there are numerous
ways<00:02:03.190> of<00:02:03.700> doing<00:02:03.940> this<00:02:04.270> and<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:05.170> way<00:02:05.320> you<00:02:05.380> start

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
ways of doing this and the way you start

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.220 
ways of doing this and the way you start
off<00:02:06.130> with<00:02:06.370> by<00:02:06.610> saying<00:02:06.970> if<00:02:07.240> you<00:02:07.420> take<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.840> Bible
