00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.200
 That's right, mortal being. 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.150
 The treasure you are looking for no longer rests in its shell. 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.640
 Here I am, in flesh and blood. 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.990
 I'm not a trophy 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.830
 who can put a red dragon on his fireplace 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.440
 - and I never go back. 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.450
 Do not look so surprised! 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.070
 We dragons are conscious, 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.340
 even in our eggs. 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.800
 When I grew up, 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.580
 I witnessed the plans and intrigues. 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.110
 I should be born a prisoner. 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.890
 But I am unique! 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.330
 A black dragon, free from stain 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.850
 the corruption of my father. 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.680
 And I want to stay that way: free. 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.740
 Somehow 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.750
 have you avoided all my guards? 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.600
 Like a ghost, you sneaked in here. 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.630
 That makes you ... 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.460
 valuable for me. 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:28.650
 Let us talk. 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.060
 Your Highness, 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.420
 we caught this beast as it was in the caves 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.310
 snooped around in front of the property. 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.320
 You do not scare me! 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.710
 Moment - who - who are you? 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.930
 You do not recognize your former captive? 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.250
 Shall we execute him, my prince? 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.260
 No. 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.770
 I want him to deliver a message 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.230
 - to the red dragonflight 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.910
 Tell them that I have no more of my father's delusion 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.120
 be controlled as of them. 

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.940
 You should leave me alone: 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.480
 This is my first and last warning. 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.740
 But ... 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.080
 But Deathwing minions may kill you ... 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.380
 Deathwing minions should be afraid of ME. 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.900
 Take him away. 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.870
 And bicycle? 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.010
 Yes Mr? 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.400
 Break his legs. 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.840
 Well then, my new friend. 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.320
 We have a lot to talk about. 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.320
 As you know, 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.900
 Black dragons often camouflage themselves 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.340
 as humanoids, 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.370
 to mingle in the affairs of mortals. 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.220
 The swarm of my crazy father 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.730
 breaks down. 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.680
 The few remaining black dragons 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.480
 have hid. 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.980
 But I can still feel it. 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.330
 My cowardly brothers and sisters 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.310
 will commit terrible atrocities, 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.940
 if we allow them to stay in the shadows. 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.190
 Besides, they are a threat to me. 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.540
 There you come into play. 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.450
 Help us to destroy them all, 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.570
 and I will reward you richly. 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.780
 Your first goal is here 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.720
 in the ruins of Gilneas. 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.070
 I have already lost some of my best men: 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.210
 Let's see if you can do it better.
