 little things you see sensations of for example 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.940

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.420
 it was by birth facu they already had six 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.770
 months but it was like misplaced here 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.360
 at the moment that the kids are going to 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.820
 dismiss that we said goodbye that this one was going 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.190
 to govern two months I was in bed and 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.720
 the guys around and I look at it and what 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.050
 guys seem like they'll be watching because 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.450
 It was like to see and I was recorded 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.150
 in the head the sensation is healthy and 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.520
 good after the peace that he had when 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.800
 happened you wrote a letter that you 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.259
 and some nation that went to the four 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.759
 years that your baby died in my 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.820
 question in which coincided just with 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.710
 the theme of the pampita and bolo I say 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.990
 they asked for it and you explained this as 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.560
 It aids she does not have either order 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.420
 before you serve time or I said here 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.740
 so that your message or read plastic 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.060
 you spoke after I do not feel like 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.800
 talk with that what happens that good 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.020
 when one lives these things is so 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.180
 strong that like you did not find the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.490
 moment it did not seem like I had to 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.740
 to wait for her to be I do not know with her 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.170
 family and with people because you did 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.539
 tell that letter because the way 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.770
 to feel that I was a little closer to that 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.560
 in case I needed something 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.420
 now that I love helping today is 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.189
 incredible the number of women who 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.439
 they approach and they tell me teacher I have 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.209
 this other baby and the same thing happened to me and I left 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.160
 go ahead in a comment of your son 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.540
 Augustine I do not know that at this moment when 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.520
 Mommy told you why you left him 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.140
 needed 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:22.000
 as a terrible terrible mystery I 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.910
 it was engraved in my heart 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.850
 and nothing I will never forget was like no 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.280
 I could answer, I thought it was the best 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.530
 take a baby to the river or leave him with his 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.890
 grandmother left it seemed to me that I want 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.430
 that the best is bad because my mom is 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:43.060
 the most and I say good I'm calm that 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.950
 was she then nothing the feeling 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.040
 Augustine was nine years old and when I 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.540
 he said that was like one as well as one 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.549
 tuco 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.519
 poor the also afterwards will have passed the 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:57.299
 time and has resented badly but was 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.299
