is located the water pump is actually
this<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.130> pulley<00:00:20.340> for<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.939> water<00:00:21.119> pump

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
this is the pulley for the water pump

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.330 
this is the pulley for the water pump
and<00:00:21.630> it's<00:00:21.960> located<00:00:22.320> all<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.740> way<00:00:22.800> around<00:00:23.070> here

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
the mounting bolts for the engine

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.280 
the mounting bolts for the engine
bracket<00:00:33.030> went<00:00:33.450> we<00:00:33.750> already<00:00:33.989> got<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.110> one

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
bracket went we already got that one

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.830 
bracket went we already got that one
taken<00:00:34.770> care<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.059> when<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.180> take<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.570> water

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
taken care of when you take this water

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.290 
taken care of when you take this water
pump<00:00:37.110> off<00:00:37.380> on<00:00:37.890> there<00:00:38.430> will<00:00:38.579> be<00:00:38.610> some<00:00:38.910> coolant

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
pump off on there will be some coolant

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.970 
pump off on there will be some coolant
that<00:00:39.450> comes<00:00:39.690> out<00:00:39.870> just<00:00:40.530> being<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
that comes out just being that the

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.549 
that comes out just being that the
engine<00:00:41.430> block<00:00:41.700> still<00:00:42.120> has<00:00:42.360> some<00:00:42.750> in<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.079> that

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
engine block still has some in it that

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.720 
engine block still has some in it that
didn't<00:00:43.829> drain<00:00:43.980> out<00:00:44.190> through<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.460> radiator

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
didn't drain out through the radiator

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.470 
didn't drain out through the radiator
drain<00:00:45.030> cop

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
drain cop

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.670 
drain cop
so<00:00:45.719> you're<00:00:45.809> going<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:45.989> place<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> bucket

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
so you're going to place a bucket

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.440 
so you're going to place a bucket
underneath<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.610> keep<00:00:47.760> your<00:00:47.879> floor<00:00:48.180> clean

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
underneath that to keep your floor clean

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.299 
underneath that to keep your floor clean
be<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.260> as<00:00:49.350> environmentally<00:00:49.980> friendly<00:00:50.010> as

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
be it as environmentally friendly as

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.689 
be it as environmentally friendly as
possible<00:00:50.820> take<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.719> ten<00:00:51.960> millimeter<00:00:52.170> socket

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
possible take a ten millimeter socket

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.090 
possible take a ten millimeter socket
with<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> swivel<00:00:54.050> that<00:00:55.050> really<00:00:55.410> helps<00:00:55.680> out<00:00:55.860> with

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
with a swivel that really helps out with

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.920 
with a swivel that really helps out with
getting<00:00:56.430> into<00:00:56.610> those<00:00:56.730> tight<00:00:56.940> places<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.539> a

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
getting into those tight places and a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.740 
getting into those tight places and a
small<00:00:58.199> quarter<00:00:58.590> inch<00:00:58.739> ratchet<00:00:59.510> it's<00:01:00.510> going<00:01:00.690> to

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
small quarter inch ratchet it's going to

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.810 
small quarter inch ratchet it's going to
start<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.890> first<00:01:02.039> bolt<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.430> see<00:01:02.609> there's

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
start on the first bolt you see there's

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.420 
start on the first bolt you see there's
no<00:01:02.940> particular<00:01:03.180> pattern<00:01:03.960> when<00:01:04.379> taking<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.979> off

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
no particular pattern when taking it off

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.820 
no particular pattern when taking it off
however<00:01:06.180> when<00:01:06.390> tightening<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.869> down<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.650> are

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
however when tightening it down you are

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.149 
however when tightening it down you are
going<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.100> want<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.310> use<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.909> star<00:01:09.840> pattern<00:01:10.170> and

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
going to want to use a star pattern and

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:25.160 
going to want to use a star pattern and
I'll<00:01:11.700> show<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.150> here<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.540> moment

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.380 

what<00:01:26.170> we're<00:01:26.350> gonna<00:01:26.500> do<00:01:26.860> to<00:01:27.640> catch<00:01:27.880> as<00:01:28.030> much<00:01:28.210> of

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
what we're gonna do to catch as much of

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.270 
what we're gonna do to catch as much of
that<00:01:28.420> coolant<00:01:29.020> that's<00:01:29.500> going<00:01:29.770> to<00:01:29.830> drain<00:01:30.070> out

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
that coolant that's going to drain out

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.490 
that coolant that's going to drain out
as<00:01:30.520> possible<00:01:31.330> is<00:01:31.450> just<00:01:31.659> take<00:01:31.869> and<00:01:32.049> back<00:01:32.260> off

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
as possible is just take and back off

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.780 
as possible is just take and back off
all<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:33.070> bolts<00:01:33.430> a<00:01:34.920> couple<00:01:35.920> turns<00:01:36.190> what

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
all the bolts a couple turns what

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.730 
all the bolts a couple turns what
that'll<00:01:37.060> do<00:01:37.210> is<00:01:37.240> let<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.720> water<00:01:37.750> pump<00:01:38.229> come

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
that'll do is let the water pump come

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.499 
that'll do is let the water pump come
free<00:01:39.009> from<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:39.310> engine<00:01:39.610> a<00:01:39.759> little<00:01:40.150> bit<00:01:40.330> and

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
free from the engine a little bit and

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.030 
free from the engine a little bit and
that'll<00:01:41.200> give<00:01:41.320> it<00:01:41.350> a<00:01:41.470> crack

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
that'll give it a crack

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.859 
that'll give it a crack
so<00:01:42.310> that<00:01:42.490> coolant<00:01:42.820> can<00:01:42.970> drain<00:01:43.240> out<00:01:43.420> from<00:01:43.750> the

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
so that coolant can drain out from the

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.149 
so that coolant can drain out from the
motor<00:01:44.640> all<00:01:45.640> right<00:01:45.909> now<00:01:46.420> before<00:01:46.750> you<00:01:47.500> break

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
motor all right now before you break

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.160 
motor all right now before you break
this<00:01:48.399> water<00:01:48.640> pump<00:01:48.850> loose<00:01:49.119> like<00:01:49.690> I<00:01:49.780> said<00:01:49.990> make

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
this water pump loose like I said make

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.260 
this water pump loose like I said make
sure<00:01:50.200> you<00:01:50.440> have<00:01:50.590> your<00:01:50.710> drain<00:01:51.009> pan<00:01:51.280> or<00:01:51.520> bucket

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
sure you have your drain pan or bucket

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.359 
sure you have your drain pan or bucket
beneath<00:01:52.630> it<00:01:52.840> once<00:01:53.560> we<00:01:53.740> have<00:01:53.890> all<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.220> bolts

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
beneath it once we have all the bolts

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.700 
beneath it once we have all the bolts
