00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
speaking power lifters are going to have

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.469 
speaking power lifters are going to have
a<00:01:26.579> much<00:01:27.570> wider<00:01:28.049> stance<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.070> hold<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.969> bar<00:01:30.240> a

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
a much wider stance and hold the bar a

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.060 
a much wider stance and hold the bar a
lot<00:01:30.659> lower<00:01:30.929> the<00:01:31.229> reason<00:01:31.469> they<00:01:31.560> do<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.829> is

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
lot lower the reason they do that is

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.249 
lot lower the reason they do that is
because<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.820> minimizes<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.509> distance<00:01:33.869> the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
because it minimizes the distance the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.230 
because it minimizes the distance the
bar<00:01:34.439> has<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.590> travel<00:01:34.950> thus<00:01:35.579> make<00:01:35.789> it<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.030> more

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
bar has to travel thus make it a more

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.749 
bar has to travel thus make it a more
efficient<00:01:36.840> lift<00:01:37.259> alright<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.219> more<00:01:38.490> weight

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
efficient lift alright the more weight

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.849 
efficient lift alright the more weight
they<00:01:38.939> can<00:01:38.969> lift<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:40.380> better<00:01:40.560> they're<00:01:40.770> going

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:40.859 
they can lift the better they're going

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:43.219 
they can lift the better they're going
to<00:01:40.950> do<00:01:41.039> in<00:01:41.130> competition<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:41.899> Olympic<00:01:42.899> lifting
