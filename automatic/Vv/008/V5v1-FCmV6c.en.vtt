00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.130
 if you now further factor 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.990
 It's the same thing for me 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.179
 Table tennis has disturbed sustainably 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.759
 the bag one relatively early if he is in the 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.190
 Location is with simple instructions 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.490
 known from responses ahead 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.850
 play another talent factor that 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.039
 he just has a certain athletic and athletic 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.590
 that means that he has these 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.109
 he just has speed 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.439
 Also able to get to the waves 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.390
 Well then it is also relatively early and 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.680
 for me it's just completely 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.840
 but decide me one 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.900
 personal thing 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.500
 It is in the forest 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.850
 to play with speed 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.340
 you just realize that 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.070
 accelerate speed 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.900
 this production target is not a choice in 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.750
 three sentences that does not mean 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.430
 necessarily that the acceleration 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:11.810
 population does not necessarily have to be fast 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:14.570
 his rotation is a few videos 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.030
 probably really quite small 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.860
 because you could see that relatively quickly 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.170
 he quite extraordinary at the 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.450
 corner has mission data and that is that 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.400
 what still makes them one today 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.369
 extraordinary player does this 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.280
 situation set to dimitrij ovtcharov 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.320
 with a difference has created operational 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.180
 not too many options 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.250
 but the as well as relatively quiet 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.050
 not necessarily in the forest 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.700
 this can meanwhile also the 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.280
 everything happens quickly if you take their 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.920
 videos of him from the relative in the boy 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.470
 she has seen dimitrov's age 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.540
 relatively table away really close and 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.490
 however, fern plays when the ball is off 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.680
 His hand came out of his bat 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.830
 everything here in their white 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.740
 then lines always such factors 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:04.580
 The feeling has moved people on 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:08.270
 ball and passably good and 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.940
 one actually has such factors as 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.100
 Carrier the opportunity to say okay 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.960
 is talented in quotes 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.910
 talente her a very further third 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.710
 but under the dash is always the 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.270
 Quality is a player and not quite 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.270
 come forward when I step out
