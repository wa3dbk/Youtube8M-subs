attempt<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:33.090> she<00:00:33.660> people<00:00:34.469> knew<00:00:34.620> she<00:00:34.829> wanted

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
attempt that she people knew she wanted

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.069 
attempt that she people knew she wanted
it<00:00:35.309> my<00:00:35.730> goodness<00:00:35.940> they<00:00:36.239> knew<00:00:36.420> she<00:00:36.630> wanted<00:00:36.930> it

it my goodness they knew she wanted it

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.040 
it my goodness they knew she wanted it
so<00:00:37.410> bad<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:38.820> problem<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.329> they<00:00:39.510> didn't<00:00:39.840> want

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
so bad the problem is they didn't want

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.049 
so bad the problem is they didn't want
her<00:00:40.440> but<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.190> time<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.550> message<00:00:41.820> coming

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
her but this time the message coming

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.490 
her but this time the message coming
from<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.329> Clinton<00:00:42.540> campaign<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.350> they

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
from the Clinton campaign is that they

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.529 
from the Clinton campaign is that they
think<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.800> problem<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.879> voters<00:00:45.390> thought

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
think the problem is that voters thought

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.569 
think the problem is that voters thought
that<00:00:45.870> maybe<00:00:46.020> she<00:00:46.140> wasn't<00:00:46.500> really<00:00:46.860> seriously

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
that maybe she wasn't really seriously

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.040 
that maybe she wasn't really seriously
in<00:00:47.789> pursuit<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.270> presidency<00:00:48.750> or<00:00:48.870> they

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
in pursuit of the presidency or they

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.959 
in pursuit of the presidency or they
don't<00:00:49.320> think<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:50.100> she<00:00:50.309> really<00:00:50.340> really

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
don't think that she really really

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.729 
don't think that she really really
really<00:00:51.149> really<00:00:51.270> wants<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.079> but<00:00:52.530> they<00:00:52.710> know

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
really really wants it but they know

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.830 
really really wants it but they know
that<00:00:53.100> they<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:53.579> didn't<00:00:53.910> like<00:00:54.149> her<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.600> time

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840
