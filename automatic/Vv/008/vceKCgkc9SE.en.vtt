gliding<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.840> will<00:01:51.930> make<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.200> really

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
gliding and that will make you really

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.609 
gliding and that will make you really

fast and truly efficient you know one of
the<00:01:55.710> most<00:01:55.799> interesting<00:01:56.340> things<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.640> we<00:01:56.820> do

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
the most interesting things that we do

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.090 
the most interesting things that we do
when<00:01:57.210> we're<00:01:57.329> working<00:01:57.899> with<00:01:58.079> stroke<00:01:58.680> rates<00:01:58.950> and

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
when we're working with stroke rates and

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.859 
when we're working with stroke rates and
using<00:01:59.399> either<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.850> Western<00:02:00.240> Elmore<00:02:00.479> tempo

just<00:02:06.780> prior<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:06.990> given<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.619> beeper<00:02:08.009> we'll<00:02:08.160> ask

just prior to given the beeper we'll ask

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.940 
just prior to given the beeper we'll ask

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
them what do they perceive is the stroke

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.380 
them what do they perceive is the stroke
rate<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.430> great<00:02:11.760> swimmers<00:02:12.120> like<00:02:12.270> Ian<00:02:12.599> Thorpe

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
rate that great swimmers like Ian Thorpe

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.990 
rate that great swimmers like Ian Thorpe
six<00:02:13.569> move<00:02:13.840> would<00:02:14.440> swim<00:02:14.710> at<00:02:14.860> now<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.610> answer<00:02:15.970> is

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
six move would swim at now the answer is

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.660 
six move would swim at now the answer is
76<00:02:16.870> strokes<00:02:17.140> per<00:02:17.319> minute<00:02:17.350> but<00:02:18.190> many<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.580> the

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
76 strokes per minute but many of the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.280 
76 strokes per minute but many of the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
swimmers actually sort of perceive that

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.330 
swimmers actually sort of perceive that
their<00:02:20.500> stroke<00:02:20.830> rates<00:02:21.100> would<00:02:21.280> be

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
their stroke rates would be

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.250 
their stroke rates would be
significantly<00:02:22.300> lower<00:02:22.569> than<00:02:22.600> this<00:02:22.930> because

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
significantly lower than this because

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.690 
significantly lower than this because
what<00:02:23.410> you<00:02:23.530> see<00:02:23.800> when<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.069> see<00:02:24.220> these<00:02:24.370> strokes

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
what you see when you see these strokes

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.660 
what you see when you see these strokes
is<00:02:25.000> a<00:02:25.240> very<00:02:25.600> long<00:02:25.980> smooth<00:02:26.980> stroke<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.610> it

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
is a very long smooth stroke and it

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.309 
is a very long smooth stroke and it
often<00:02:27.910> appears<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.360> be<00:02:28.450> quite<00:02:28.600> a<00:02:28.690> slow<00:02:28.900> stroke

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
often appears to be quite a slow stroke

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.800 
often appears to be quite a slow stroke
rate<00:02:29.790> interesting<00:02:30.790> enough<00:02:31.060> when<00:02:31.720> the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
rate interesting enough when the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.720 
rate interesting enough when the
swimmers<00:02:32.110> try<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.530> swim<00:02:32.950> at<00:02:33.190> seventy<00:02:33.520> six

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
swimmers try to swim at seventy six

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.070 
swimmers try to swim at seventy six
strokes<00:02:33.910> per<00:02:34.120> minute<00:02:34.150> they're<00:02:34.540> often<00:02:34.780> amazed

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
strokes per minute they're often amazed

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.590 
strokes per minute they're often amazed
by<00:02:35.350> just<00:02:35.740> how<00:02:35.890> quick<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.459> stroke<00:02:36.700> is<00:02:36.940> this

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
by just how quick the stroke is this

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.449 
by just how quick the stroke is this
gives<00:02:37.840> proof<00:02:38.380> to<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.590> facts<00:02:38.890> I<00:02:38.950> suppose<00:02:39.220> that

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
gives proof to the facts I suppose that

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.060 
gives proof to the facts I suppose that
really<00:02:40.120> these<00:02:40.270> great<00:02:40.750> smooth<00:02:41.170> not<00:02:41.709> only<00:02:41.980> do

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
really these great smooth not only do

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.650 
really these great smooth not only do
they<00:02:42.160> have<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.370> long<00:02:42.640> stroke<00:02:43.030> but<00:02:43.300> they<00:02:43.420> also

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
they have a long stroke but they also

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.380 
they have a long stroke but they also
have<00:02:44.140> a<00:02:44.380> very<00:02:44.680> fast<00:02:45.100> stroke<00:02:45.489> as<00:02:45.670> well<00:02:45.700> it's

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
have a very fast stroke as well it's

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.060 
have a very fast stroke as well it's
just<00:02:46.570> that<00:02:46.690> our<00:02:46.840> perception<00:02:47.530> when<00:02:47.680> we<00:02:47.800> look<00:02:47.950> at

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
just that our perception when we look at

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.740 
just that our perception when we look at
them<00:02:48.220> makes<00:02:48.910> us<00:02:49.060> think<00:02:49.330> that<00:02:49.630> they're

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
them makes us think that they're

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.960 
them makes us think that they're
actually<00:02:50.080> long<00:02:50.320> and<00:02:50.560> slow<00:02:51.130> this<00:02:51.580> is<00:02:51.640> not

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
actually long and slow this is not

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.900 
actually long and slow this is not
correct<00:02:52.150> at<00:02:52.510> all<00:02:53.610> now<00:02:54.610> one<00:02:54.760> of<00:02:54.790> the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
correct at all now one of the

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.970 
correct at all now one of the
interesting<00:02:54.970> thing<00:02:55.540> about<00:02:55.630> smooth<00:02:56.140> is<00:02:56.650> when

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
interesting thing about smooth is when

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.710 
interesting thing about smooth is when
you<00:02:57.070> look<00:02:57.220> at<00:02:57.340> their<00:02:57.489> strokes<00:02:57.820> they're<00:02:58.450> long

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
you look at their strokes they're long

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.210 
you look at their strokes they're long
and<00:02:58.750> efficient<00:02:59.290> so<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.560> might<00:02:59.769> think<00:03:00.070> they're

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
and efficient so you might think they're

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.250 
and efficient so you might think they're
naturally<00:03:00.640> suti<00:03:00.910> tools<00:03:01.239> distance<00:03:01.780> for<00:03:01.989> me

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
naturally suti tools distance for me

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.320 
naturally suti tools distance for me
they<00:03:02.890> already<00:03:03.100> is<00:03:03.400> though<00:03:03.640> that<00:03:03.670> most<00:03:04.030> true

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
they already is though that most true

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.150 
they already is though that most true
smooths<00:03:04.690> are<00:03:04.930> actually<00:03:05.260> natural<00:03:05.470> sprinters

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
and this long stroke style is suited

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.880
