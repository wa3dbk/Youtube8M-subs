00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.420
 hello if laura sanchez in the studio 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.620
 I will teach to correct different 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.620
 Eye shapes using makeup 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:17.449
 we start by lighting under the eyebrow 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.579
 in the inner corner of the eye below 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:23.360
 the lower lashes and inside the 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:26.689
 eye water line blur with the 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:30.309
 finger with a brush and let's put a 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:33.020
 shadow also about what we use clear 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:35.660
 now I'm going to delineate or mark a little 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.530
 the edges of the eyes with a shadow 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.219
 purple and we blend very well everything 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.219
 we clean the excesses 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.829
 We correct very well the dark circles or 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:53.900
 dark circles sealed with dust and 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.900
 we put few layers of blink 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.940
 for color course plans 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.260
 dark to take them as more towards 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.479
 back and make it a little more closed 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.720
 let's mark the outline with the shadow 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.340
 dark coffee we also delineate the line 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.820
 of water above and below the eye with 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.820
 black pencil 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.650
 under the eyelashes too and 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.540
 we sealed with shadow 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.990
 we also mark with the pencil on 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.770
 eyelashes and we also seal we put 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.840
 eyelash we clean the excesses and 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.450
 we correct dark circles or circles 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.010
 blacks around the eyes we seal 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.010
 with dust and ready 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.820
 for Asian eyes you have to mark very 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.490
 ok the outline because you do not see almost 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.200
 it's never hard to see then that 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.149
 create a fake one we mark it with a 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.000
 dark shadow of liamos also 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.340
 down without taking it to the party 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.539
 inside of the eye and with eyeliner 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.939
 liquid we make a line 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.820
 preferably thin and extending 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.740
 up we put blink 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.470
 concentrated in the outer corner of 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.600
 eye 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:15.610
 and we use corrector to correct 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.610
 dark circles dark circles blur 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.060
 well this was the whole tutorial I hope 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.740
 that you liked it very much remember 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.970
 apply each different tic for your 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.970
 different shape of eyes
