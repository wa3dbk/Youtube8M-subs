00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.480
 how are friends are welcome to 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.390
 this new good tutorial here we are going to 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.480
 see this time how can we make a 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.760
 low- level formatting of our 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.500
 our removable devices either 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.779
 memories usb memories sd or micro sd ok or 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.650
 they could also be hard drives 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.720
 removable ok or external hard drives 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:41.199
 good in what it is and what is it used for? 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.090
 low-level formatting happens that a 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:47.050
 sometimes it can be that it gives you some virus 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.909
 on your removable device like you 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.760
 I mentioned earlier it may be in your 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:54.280
 usb or otherwise on removable hard drives 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.870
 obviously good it can be that 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.839
 they will have some virus and maybe not 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.510
 work well or simply because you can 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:03.430
 be that you have files and you want 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.350
 erase it completely 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.780
 let's say you want is to pass the usb to 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.000
 someone and then with a simple formatting 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.580
 this person let's say that you make a 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.110
 simple formatting to your device and 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.329
 Then he wants to lend it to someone 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.040
 according to you, you already did the formatting but 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:20.260
 in case you do not know 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.120
 to these files that you have formatted 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.010
 can be recovered simply with 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.650
 some programs that is 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.840
 there are practically all the files left 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.780
 as who says at disposal still 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.120
 for a one on basic knowledge of 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.640
 computing that plays that can 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.020
 recover these files today that's why 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.300
 let's see how we can make a 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.880
 low level formatting to eliminate 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.270
 completely the files and leave your 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.040
 Removable device as factory 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.140
 like when you connect it to your 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.300
 computer and asks you to put 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.420
 format so what you are going to do is 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:02:00.300
 completely delete the files and 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:02.040
 ok is completely clean the disk 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.280
 good the only application that 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.240
 we will use is this hard disk low level 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.430
 okay 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.190
 the version obviously the version 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.870
 free for more information about this 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.370
 application I'll leave the details 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.130
 is there in the description of this video 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.590
 ok if you want to get it then let's go 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.080
 to open it as you can see is quite 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.850
 simple I use it from this application what 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.830
 The only thing we will do is connect our 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.890
 removable device that is here in 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.950
 this case I will use a usb memory 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.510
 kingston 16 gb well I just 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.910
 connect then now what we will do 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.700
 will be is to run again in 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.100
 programita and as you can see and we 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.450
 detects what the usb would be doing 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.070
 which is down here 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.540
 I have a lot of attention when being 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.200
 already here when selecting the 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.349
 device or the disk that they are going to 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.420
 to format because obviously you have to 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.550
 choose and make sure that it is the 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.680
 device just the one in which you're going to 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.120
 do the format at low to level ok 11 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.760
 God selects the usb and I give it to 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.000
 continue here as you can see then we 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.800
 gives details of what has been the 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.209
 program and what will this do 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.340
 program gives us details also of 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.640
 our usb as you can see by towards 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.010
 down and then if we go here now 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.930
 we can have the option to click 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.920
 here so that we start to format to 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.739
 low level since then here gives us a 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.900
 warning does not say care as this 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:31.069
 process will completely erase the 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:33.049
 files and it will be formatting will be 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.599
 irreversible can not be recovered 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.910
 absolutely nothing then let's give 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.980
 click on format 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.070
 here we get this pop-up window and 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.200
 we are going to click on yes and well as 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.060
 can see already going to finish what 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.850
 it would be the low level formatting 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.510
 As you can see, it's already in 99 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:56.630
 cent and then the sectors and then the 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:00.050
 Worked sectors are more than 30 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.580
 millions as you can see here we are not going to 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:06.200
 wait a moment if you have just 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:08.750
 end and we have completed 100% 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.250
 the speed was 11 points 3 mb at 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.100
 second not of what I was working 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.050
 our our program on the usb 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.510
 well now what I'm going to do is go 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.420
 to the windows explorer and how can 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.520
 see look here is here is the usb like 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.790
 can you guys see me as a record 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.860
 new or something like that not for example because if 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.350
 you are going to see look in the details 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.220
 of usb gives us that it is totally 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.100
 empty 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.930
 this format is total friends like 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.900
 you can see it is completely 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.639
 clean and the only thing we have to do 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.740
 here is it can give you 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.240
 format because it's practically like 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.590
 new as when all new 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.139
 shop and you come to 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:51.080
 connect to your computer is not not with 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:53.990
 ready format then we will double 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.539
 Click to open it and we will give this 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.080
 option that asks us to format it for 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:02.960
 can you use it 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.330
 this raised fast obviously this what 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.090
 what it does is format it 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:11.220
 so they can use and less power 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.330
 the data files and others not good 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.190
