its<00:01:09.000> end<00:01:09.210> up<00:01:09.390> splitting<00:01:09.600> into<00:01:09.869> two<00:01:10.140> as<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.350> can

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
its end up splitting into two as you can

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.130 
we're going to see another new spell not
too<00:01:52.680> sure<00:01:52.860> why<00:01:53.070> but<00:01:54.000> I'm<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.479> defense<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.960> just

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
too sure why but I'm the defense is just

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.899 
too sure why but I'm the defense is just
going<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.380> become<00:01:55.619> harder<00:01:55.979> for<00:01:56.130> us<00:01:56.159> I'm<00:01:56.460> losing

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
going to become harder for us I'm losing

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.810 
going to become harder for us I'm losing
so<00:01:57.119> many<00:01:57.180> as<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.930> already<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:59.130> army<00:01:59.579> came

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
so many as it is already this army came

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.280 
so many as it is already this army came
align<00:02:00.329> his<00:02:00.600> 12,000<00:02:01.290> troops<00:02:01.729> in<00:02:02.729> 196<00:02:03.719> pounds<00:02:04.049> I

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
align his 12,000 troops in 196 pounds I

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.479 
align his 12,000 troops in 196 pounds I
figured<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.909> was<00:02:06.479> just<00:02:06.540> wondering<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:07.489> if

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
figured so I was just wondering of if

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.249 
figured so I was just wondering of if
they<00:02:08.759> could<00:02:09.000> do<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.450> if<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.840> look<00:02:09.989> closely

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
they could do that if you look closely

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.900 
they could do that if you look closely
at<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.649> beginning

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
at the beginning

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.680 
at the beginning
um<00:02:12.000> if<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.170> beginning<00:02:13.590> judge'<00:02:14.270> that<00:02:15.270> purchase

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
um if the beginning judge' that purchase

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.380 
um if the beginning judge' that purchase
shows<00:02:15.960> i<00:02:16.640> chose<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.790> background<00:02:18.180> that<00:02:18.270> the

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
shows i chose the background that the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.650 
shows i chose the background that the
guy<00:02:18.510> has<00:02:18.800> 2,600<00:02:19.800> trophies<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:21.120> therefore<00:02:21.390> I

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
guy has 2,600 trophies so therefore I

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.720 
guy has 2,600 trophies so therefore I
don't<00:02:21.960> think<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.380> don't<00:02:22.740> know<00:02:22.830> it<00:02:23.370> just<00:02:23.400> makes

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
don't think I don't know it just makes

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.430 
don't think I don't know it just makes
me<00:02:23.940> think<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.300> could<00:02:24.480> we<00:02:24.660> be<00:02:24.810> vulnerable<00:02:25.080> to

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
me think that could we be vulnerable to

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.800 
me think that could we be vulnerable to
like<00:02:25.830> two<00:02:26.610> stacked<00:02:26.940> up<00:02:27.090> attacks<00:02:27.480> from

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
like two stacked up attacks from

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.810 
like two stacked up attacks from
supercell<00:02:28.530> war<00:02:28.770> members<00:02:29.190> from<00:02:29.280> super<00:02:29.640> cell

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
supercell war members from super cell

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.290 
supercell war members from super cell

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
just in order to make ice Jim more more

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.870 
just in order to make ice Jim more more

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
frequently than we are I don't know just

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.600 
frequently than we are I don't know just
poses<00:02:36.570> a<00:02:36.600> question<00:02:36.690> because<00:02:37.560> it's<00:02:38.220> kind<00:02:38.550> of

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
turned into a massive thing where this

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.470 
turned into a massive thing where this
is<00:02:40.110> as<00:02:40.260> bad<00:02:40.290> as<00:02:40.530> gambling<00:02:41.070> people<00:02:41.820> spinning<00:02:42.210> so

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
is as bad as gambling people spinning so

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.420 
is as bad as gambling people spinning so
much<00:02:42.780> gems<00:02:43.110> on<00:02:43.320> this<00:02:43.350> game<00:02:43.680> it's<00:02:43.950> not<00:02:44.130> funny

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
much gems on this game it's not funny
