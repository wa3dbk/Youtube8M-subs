00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
just going to talk to some of the main

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.740 
just going to talk to some of the main
differences<00:00:40.640> between<00:00:40.820> the<00:00:41.150> generation<00:00:41.600> two

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
differences between the generation two

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.530 
differences between the generation two
of<00:00:41.900> the<00:00:41.990> new<00:00:42.140> generation<00:00:42.710> threes<00:00:43.360> they're<00:00:44.360> the

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
of the new generation threes they're the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.080 
of the new generation threes they're the
first<00:00:44.750> ones<00:00:45.050> are<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:45.290> obvious<00:00:45.940> kind<00:00:46.940> of

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
first ones are the obvious kind of

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.940 
first ones are the obvious kind of
aesthetically<00:00:47.810> as<00:00:48.530> an<00:00:48.800> aesthetic

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
aesthetically as an aesthetic

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.430 
aesthetically as an aesthetic
differences<00:00:49.460> it's<00:00:50.330> a<00:00:50.450> kind<00:00:50.780> of<00:00:50.870> subtle<00:00:51.290> but

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
differences it's a kind of subtle but

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.650 
differences it's a kind of subtle but
slightly<00:00:52.160> different<00:00:52.310> shaping<00:00:53.060> so<00:00:53.330> these<00:00:53.480> are

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
slightly different shaping so these are

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.220 
slightly different shaping so these are
these<00:00:54.340> a<00:00:55.340> little<00:00:55.700> bit<00:00:55.790> more<00:00:55.940> cornered<00:00:56.720> there's

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
these a little bit more cornered there's

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.900 
these a little bit more cornered there's
obviously<00:00:57.500> still<00:00:57.860> keeping<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:58.280> curved<00:00:58.550> edges

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
obviously still keeping the curved edges

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.000 
obviously still keeping the curved edges
for<00:00:59.330> to<00:01:00.430> minimize<00:01:01.630> diffraction<00:01:02.830> they've<00:01:03.830> done

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
for to minimize diffraction they've done

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.920 
for to minimize diffraction they've done
away<00:01:04.220> with<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.550> screws<00:01:05.270> on<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:05.540> front<00:01:05.780> so

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
away with the screws on the front so

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.480 
away with the screws on the front so
they<00:01:06.020> look<00:01:06.140> a<00:01:06.200> little<00:01:06.380> bit<00:01:06.470> a<00:01:06.500> bit<00:01:06.800> sleeker<00:01:07.160> a

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
they look a little bit a bit sleeker a

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.940 
they look a little bit a bit sleeker a
little<00:01:07.670> bit<00:01:07.790> meaner<00:01:08.060> I<00:01:08.330> quite<00:01:08.630> like<00:01:08.840> I<00:01:09.200> prefer

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
little bit meaner I quite like I prefer

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.180 
little bit meaner I quite like I prefer
them<00:01:10.160> to<00:01:10.190> be<00:01:10.310> honest<00:01:10.550> with<00:01:10.670> you<00:01:11.770> in<00:01:12.770> terms<00:01:12.979> of

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
them to be honest with you in terms of

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.160 
them to be honest with you in terms of
features<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:14.150> main<00:01:14.390> things<00:01:14.660> are<00:01:14.840> that<00:01:15.020> that

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
features the main things are that that

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.960 
features the main things are that that

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
on the on the tweeter they've got a

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.749 
on the on the tweeter they've got a
proprietary<00:01:17.780> waveguide<00:01:18.590> built<00:01:19.040> in<00:01:19.250> which

proprietary waveguide built in which

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.749 
proprietary waveguide built in which
actually<00:01:20.229> aims<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:21.619> waves<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:22.220> sound<00:01:22.520> waves

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
actually aims the waves the sound waves

to the sweet spot really really well
swore<00:01:24.979> that<00:01:25.009> map<00:01:25.400> what<00:01:25.670> means<00:01:25.910> is<00:01:26.150> that<00:01:26.180> means

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
swore that map what means is that means

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.690 
swore that map what means is that means
is<00:01:26.720> when<00:01:27.320> you<00:01:27.350> sat<00:01:27.650> in<00:01:27.680> the<00:01:27.920> sweet<00:01:28.160> spot<00:01:28.369> these

speakers the stereo

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.750

Imaging<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:31.930> stereo<00:01:32.320> separation<00:01:32.620> is<00:01:33.250> really

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
Imaging the stereo separation is really

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.600 
Imaging the stereo separation is really
really<00:01:34.090> fantastic<00:01:34.330> so<00:01:34.990> everything<00:01:35.920> is<00:01:36.370> heard

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
really fantastic so everything is heard

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.580 
really fantastic so everything is heard
perfectly<00:01:36.940> clear<00:01:37.510> and<00:01:37.780> exactly<00:01:38.230> how<00:01:38.440> it

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
perfectly clear and exactly how it

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.230 
perfectly clear and exactly how it
should<00:01:38.770> be<00:01:38.950> this<00:01:39.340> is<00:01:39.520> one<00:01:39.670> of<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.850> key<00:01:40.000> things

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
should be this is one of the key things

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.350 
should be this is one of the key things
that<00:01:40.330> krk<00:01:40.870> really<00:01:41.200> strive<00:01:41.530> for<00:01:42.360> they've

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
that krk really strive for they've

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.680 
that krk really strive for they've
changed<00:01:43.660> the<00:01:43.960> the<00:01:44.350> front<00:01:44.770> of<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:45.160> the<00:01:45.690> front

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
changed the the front of the the front

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.880 
changed the the front of the the front
firing<00:01:46.900> bass<00:01:47.650> ports<00:01:48.100> and<00:01:48.250> slightly<00:01:48.460> just<00:01:49.120> a

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
firing bass ports and slightly just a

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.730 
firing bass ports and slightly just a
improvement<00:01:50.890> on<00:01:50.980> the<00:01:51.130> low-end<00:01:51.670> response<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
improvement on the low-end response the

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.370 
improvement on the low-end response the
the<00:01:54.190> main<00:01:54.430> feature<00:01:55.120> difference<00:01:55.660> on<00:01:55.960> the<00:01:56.200> back

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
the main feature difference on the back

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.430 
the main feature difference on the back
of<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.680> unit<00:01:57.040> is<00:01:57.970> that<00:01:58.390> whereas<00:01:59.080> before<00:01:59.410> you

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
of the unit is that whereas before you

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.460 
of the unit is that whereas before you
just<00:01:59.740> had<00:01:59.860> a<00:01:59.890> high<00:02:00.340> frequency<00:02:00.840> adjustment<00:02:01.840> now

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
just had a high frequency adjustment now

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.140 
just had a high frequency adjustment now
you've<00:02:02.590> got<00:02:02.710> high<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:03.250> low<00:02:03.640> frequency

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
you've got high and low frequency

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.790 
you've got high and low frequency
adjustment<00:02:04.210> so<00:02:04.600> it<00:02:04.690> really<00:02:04.960> helps<00:02:05.230> for<00:02:05.350> you

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
adjustment so it really helps for you

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.010 
adjustment so it really helps for you
know<00:02:06.250> setting<00:02:06.580> them<00:02:06.670> up<00:02:06.760> in<00:02:06.910> your<00:02:06.940> studio<00:02:07.420> and
