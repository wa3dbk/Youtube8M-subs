schedule that the rest of the those

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.569 
schedule that the rest of the those
groups<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.380> then<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.770> final<00:01:37.950> bracket<00:01:38.460> will

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
had a pretty good chance of doing that I

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.640 
had a pretty good chance of doing that I
think<00:04:21.180> it<00:04:21.329> was<00:04:21.359> mostly<00:04:21.720> like<00:04:21.810> for<00:04:22.139> safety<00:04:22.500> sake

it's like okay if I ignite him I don't

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.930 
it's like okay if I ignite him I don't
have<00:04:24.659> to<00:04:24.930> to<00:04:25.289> get<00:04:25.440> any<00:04:25.590> closer<00:04:25.830> than<00:04:26.010> this<00:04:26.490> and
