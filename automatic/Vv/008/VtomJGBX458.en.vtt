 that was of course for me 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.519
 not by private provision 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.150

 others were useful outside, of course it was longer with slicks 

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:52.319
 So we had to go outside 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:55.319

00:05:41.619 --> 00:05:42.189
 his role 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:47.520
 because of SNCF we also have a couple of short strategy
