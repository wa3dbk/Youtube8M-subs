 Google AdWords Campaign Experiment 

00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:09.149
 Easily test your ads with AdWords Campaign Experiments 

00:00:09.334 --> 00:00:17.879
 For example, you can easily add multiple experimental text ads to try different ad information, headlines, display URLs, and call-to-action phrases. 

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:26.641
 For display ads, you can also experiment with test objects including images, call-to-action, and display URLs. 

00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:34.017
 Now you can compare the performance of text and display ads on the Google Display Network with unprecedented performance. 

00:00:34.017 --> 00:00:38.963
 To start testing your ads, you’ll first need to go to the "Ads" tab of your campaign. 

00:00:38.963 --> 00:00:42.609
 Then click the status icon to the left of the relevant ad. 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:48.547
 Click on the empty beaker icon labeled "Control only" to make the relevant ads only valid in the control group 

00:00:48.672 --> 00:00:55.380
 Click on the half-full beaker icon labeled "Experiment only" to make the relevant ads only valid in the experiment group. 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:05.341
 If you set your ads to run only in the experiment or control group, you can see the experiment’s performance from a global perspective with campaign-level statistics. 

00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:12.563
 If you set your ads to run in both the control group and the experiment group, you can view statistics broken down by group for each ad. 

00:01:12.563 --> 00:01:19.180
 To do this, click the "Segment" button in the "Ads" tab of the campaign and select "Experiment." 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:28.189
 As I mentioned before, on the Display Network, you can compare the performance of using text ads and only display ads in ad groups. 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.231
 Here's how to run this type of experiment. 

00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:34.575
 First, you’ll need to create a few display ads in your campaign. 

00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:39.677
 If you haven’t previously served display ads, you can create them with the display ad builder. 

00:01:39.677 --> 00:01:44.910
 Once you're ready to show your ads, you can set up an experiment by following these examples: 

00:01:44.908 --> 00:01:49.430
 First, check the box next to each display ad. 

00:01:49.427 --> 00:01:57.820
 Then click the "Change status" drop-down menu and select "Experiment only" so your display ads will only run when the experiment group is ready to go. 

00:01:57.586 --> 00:02:03.340
 You can test one display ad at the beginning, or you can add multiple different display ad variations. 

00:02:03.344 --> 00:02:08.170
 Follow the same steps to set your text ad to "control only" 

00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:13.680
 Another way to do this is to: Have text ads run in both the control and experiment groups. 

00:02:13.677 --> 00:02:17.540
 Display ads are still only served in the experiment group. 

00:02:17.542 --> 00:02:23.310
 This way, you can measure the marginal value of using both display and text ads in an ad group. 

00:02:23.314 --> 00:02:35.090
 One thing to note: if there are multiple ads in each of the control and experiment groups, the ad rotation setting in the "Settings" tab of the campaign will affect how the ads are served as usual. 

00:02:35.086 --> 00:02:41.730

00:02:41.727 --> 00:02:43.730
 I wish you all the best in the course of the experiment!
