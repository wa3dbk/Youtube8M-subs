00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.370 
going to do it so I mean as you can see
there<00:01:40.979> it's<00:01:41.100> like<00:01:41.189> one<00:01:41.430> two<00:01:41.579> three<00:01:41.850> four<00:01:42.090> five

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
there it's like one two three four five

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.969 
there it's like one two three four five
there's<00:01:43.380> six<00:01:43.710> their<00:01:44.040> way<00:01:44.700> over<00:01:44.729> here<00:01:45.979> okay

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
there's six their way over here okay

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.950 
there's six their way over here okay
there's<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.369> many<00:01:47.460> km<00:01:47.909> counter<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.630> would<00:01:48.810> say

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
there's so many km counter I would say

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.690 
there's so many km counter I would say
there's<00:01:49.110> probably<00:01:49.140> five<00:01:49.770> or<00:01:49.799> six<00:01:50.280> there<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.670> I

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
there's probably five or six there so I

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.210 
there's probably five or six there so I
think<00:01:51.030> there's<00:01:51.210> 12<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.840> ever<00:01:51.960> made<00:01:52.259> out<00:01:52.590> of

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
think there's 12 that ever made out of

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.969 
think there's 12 that ever made out of
the<00:01:53.340> original<00:01:53.460> 16<00:01:54.210> that's<00:01:54.780> pretty<00:01:55.049> good<00:01:55.229> and

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
the original 16 that's pretty good and

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.889 
the original 16 that's pretty good and
that's<00:01:56.399> what<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.939> don't<00:01:57.210> want<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.630> do<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.869> you

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
that's what you don't want to do is you

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.260 
that's what you don't want to do is you
don't<00:01:58.079> want<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.439> set<00:01:58.649> up<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.829> base<00:01:59.070> where<00:01:59.520> it<00:02:00.000> has

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
don't want to set up a base where it has

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.160 
don't want to set up a base where it has
a<00:02:00.299> spread<00:02:00.960> like<00:02:01.920> this<00:02:02.159> if<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.430> recall<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.840> a

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
a spread like this if you recall the a

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.450 
a spread like this if you recall the a
DS<00:02:04.619> themselves<00:02:05.520> were

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
DS themselves were

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.330 
DS themselves were
here<00:02:07.450> and<00:02:07.690> here<00:02:08.590> and<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.970> think<00:02:10.240> here<00:02:10.899> here<00:02:11.890> so

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
here and here and I think here here so

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.030 
here and here and I think here here so
here<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:12.790> there<00:02:13.000> is<00:02:13.540> there<00:02:13.780> in<00:02:13.870> there<00:02:14.080> but

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
here and there is there in there but

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.860 
here and there is there in there but
with<00:02:15.370> when<00:02:15.580> you<00:02:15.670> got<00:02:15.850> that<00:02:16.060> size<00:02:16.390> which<00:02:16.720> is

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
with when you got that size which is

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.500 
with when you got that size which is
like<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.110> 13<00:02:18.069> x<00:02:18.100> 13<00:02:18.360> space<00:02:20.100> it's<00:02:21.100> too<00:02:21.370> big<00:02:21.610> or<00:02:22.390> at

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
like a 13 x 13 space it's too big or at

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.640 
like a 13 x 13 space it's too big or at
least<00:02:22.660> it's<00:02:22.810> not<00:02:22.840> going<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.200> defend<00:02:23.319> well

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
least it's not going to defend well

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.940 
least it's not going to defend well
against<00:02:23.890> la<00:02:24.069> la<00:02:24.130> lune<00:02:24.370> so<00:02:25.319> usually<00:02:26.319> when<00:02:26.650> we're

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
against la la lune so usually when we're

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.590 
against la la lune so usually when we're
when<00:02:27.280> we're<00:02:27.400> doing<00:02:27.520> our<00:02:27.700> tactics<00:02:28.239> review<00:02:28.390> &amp;

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
when we're doing our tactics review &amp;

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.479 
when we're doing our tactics review &amp;
trying<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:28.959> decide<00:02:29.170> how<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.319> attack<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.160> base

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
trying to decide how to attack a base

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.670 
trying to decide how to attack a base
will<00:02:30.790> be<00:02:30.819> looking<00:02:31.090> for<00:02:31.540> la<00:02:32.080> balloon<00:02:32.410> when<00:02:32.590> the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
will be looking for la balloon when the

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.699 
will be looking for la balloon when the
base<00:02:32.830> is<00:02:32.860> anything<00:02:33.489> wider<00:02:33.790> than<00:02:34.090> an<00:02:35.080> 11<00:02:35.530> by<00:02:35.680> 11

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
base is anything wider than an 11 by 11

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.280 
base is anything wider than an 11 by 11
area<00:02:36.459> for<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.030> hades<00:02:37.360> between<00:02:37.840> them<00:02:38.020> where

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
area for the hades between them where

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.240 
area for the hades between them where
they're<00:02:38.440> outside<00:02:38.860> of<00:02:38.980> that<00:02:39.070> box<00:02:40.709> so<00:02:41.709> 13<00:02:42.100> by<00:02:42.220> 13

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
they're outside of that box so 13 by 13

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.070 
they're outside of that box so 13 by 13
was<00:02:42.760> definitely<00:02:43.150> a<00:02:43.180> green<00:02:43.390> light<00:02:43.540> for<00:02:43.780> agony

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
was definitely a green light for agony

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.140 
was definitely a green light for agony
to<00:02:44.140> take<00:02:44.500> it<00:02:44.650> down<00:02:44.800> this<00:02:45.280> way<00:02:45.459> so<00:02:45.519> great<00:02:45.880> attack

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
to take it down this way so great attack

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.690 
to take it down this way so great attack
by<00:02:46.330> him<00:02:46.480> and<00:02:46.660> so<00:02:47.620> ends<00:02:48.010> one<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.400> four

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
by him and so ends one of the four

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.479 
by him and so ends one of the four
attacks<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:49.690> this<00:02:49.930> war<00:02:50.290> is<00:02:50.440> recap<00:02:50.860> if<00:02:51.400> you
