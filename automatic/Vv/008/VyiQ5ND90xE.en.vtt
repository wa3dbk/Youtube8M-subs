 tutorial to teach them how to spend a 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.650
 iso to ps2 format using a memory 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.020
 external flash is worth or what you want to say 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.140
 the same to use it with a pendrive 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.260
 directly to the play well for 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.440
 it 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.260
 we have to first patch the iso vale 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.980
 for this I will provide you with these two 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:33.070
 files is worth this here to patch 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.930
 what and this to pass the iso to format 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.200
 ps2 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:43.020
 well then let's start open the folder 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:45.380
 of that cher artist and we execute the 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.460
 archive 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.790
 with shoes to walk it 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.120
 and we look for our iso 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.160
 I have it here 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.579
 I want to patch for example this game 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.579
 the black 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.859
 the patching process has finished 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.790
 satisfactorily we accept and this 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:08.460
 we can close 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:13.890
 okay now we're going to talk pointed 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:16.340
 ps2 open and execute be here usb 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.340
 Useful 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.120
 we execute it here we give it to go out 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.910
 archive 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.670
 create game from that if we want to create 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.220
 a game or that from a cb that 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.070
 we have put in our cd unit you 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.990
 we give this one in my case I have one that 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.970
 from the hard drive so I will 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.090
 to this one here 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.740
 as we give our origin we go where 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.740
 is the iso 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.680
 and I have it here 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.610
 select black and where we want 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:59.930
 go away I'll put on the desk 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:02.840

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.670
 on-line 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.880
 then we take already we are going to create 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.060
 examining the iso and this completes this 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.099
 start taca taca taca and when it arrives 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.340
 100% has already been made 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:24.069
 you pass it to your pendrive or drive 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.950
 external flash and it only gives you the 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.550
