hey guys you walk in here and kidding

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.849 
hey guys you walk in here and kidding
showing<00:00:02.310> you<00:00:02.520> another<00:00:03.419> design<00:00:03.959> by<00:00:04.140> mojo<00:00:04.620> this

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
showing you another design by mojo this

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.519 
showing you another design by mojo this
is<00:00:05.220> a<00:00:05.250> micro<00:00:05.910> tree<00:00:06.150> farm<00:00:06.450> it's<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:07.080> pretty<00:00:07.319> cool

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
is a micro tree farm it's a pretty cool

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.470 
is a micro tree farm it's a pretty cool
design<00:00:07.859> that<00:00:08.130> pretty<00:00:08.429> much<00:00:08.610> it<00:00:08.849> gets<00:00:09.210> rid<00:00:09.389> of

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
design that pretty much it gets rid of

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.970 
design that pretty much it gets rid of
all<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.840> leaves<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.320> all<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.559> stuff<00:00:10.769> on<00:00:10.950> the

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
all the leaves and all the stuff on the

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.490 
all the leaves and all the stuff on the
trees<00:00:11.280> but<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.120> also<00:00:12.300> gives<00:00:12.509> you<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.960> saplings

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
trees but it also gives you the saplings

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.200 
trees but it also gives you the saplings
back<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.099> course<00:00:14.340> gives<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.759> apples

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
back and of course gives you the apples

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.420 
back and of course gives you the apples
so<00:00:15.690> it's<00:00:15.900> also<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.230> food<00:00:16.680> machine<00:00:17.070> which<00:00:17.279> is

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
so it's also a food machine which is

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.730 
so it's also a food machine which is
amazing<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.090> it's<00:00:18.570> also<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.900> sapling<00:00:19.470> giving

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
amazing and it's also a sapling giving

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.800 
amazing and it's also a sapling giving
back<00:00:19.920> or<00:00:20.100> what<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.820> could<00:00:20.970> call<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.480> of

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
back or what you could call it and of

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.450 
back or what you could call it and of
course<00:00:22.109> it's<00:00:22.380> mostly<00:00:22.740> meant<00:00:23.039> for<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.250> wood

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
course it's mostly meant for the wood

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.460 
course it's mostly meant for the wood
then<00:00:23.970> when<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.269> come<00:00:24.420> along<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.750> just<00:00:25.109> big

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
then when you come along and just big

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.800 
then when you come along and just big
chunks<00:00:25.500> alone<00:00:26.160> use<00:00:26.310> my<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.699> all<00:00:26.910> down<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.599> of

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
chunks alone use my it all down and of

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.810 
chunks alone use my it all down and of
course<00:00:27.840> that's<00:00:28.170> much<00:00:28.500> more<00:00:28.890> easier<00:00:29.340> than

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
course that's much more easier than

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.080 
course that's much more easier than
going<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:31.250> depending<00:00:32.250> on<00:00:32.250> what<00:00:32.520> you're<00:00:32.700> on<00:00:32.820> if

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
going to depending on what you're on if

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.049 
going to depending on what you're on if
you<00:00:33.480> forest<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:35.160> have<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.430> go<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.760> forest

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
you forest you have to go to the forest

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.819 
you forest you have to go to the forest
mine<00:00:36.360> trees<00:00:36.630> or<00:00:36.870> if<00:00:36.989> you're<00:00:37.079> on<00:00:37.140> sky<00:00:37.500> blocks

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
mine trees or if you're on sky blocks

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.639 
mine trees or if you're on sky blocks
and<00:00:38.129> it's<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.610> little<00:00:38.879> tricky<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:40.379> like

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
and it's a little tricky to this to like

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.040 
and it's a little tricky to this to like
get<00:00:40.950> all<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.280> wood<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.480> space<00:00:42.780> and

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
get all the wood in the space and

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.720 
get all the wood in the space and
whatnot<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.559> would<00:00:43.710> be<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> perfect<00:00:44.219> design

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
whatnot this would be a perfect design

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.940 
whatnot this would be a perfect design
the<00:00:45.390> first<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:45.809> making<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> tree<00:00:46.410> from<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.800> want

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
the first we making a tree from you want

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.549 
the first we making a tree from you want
to<00:00:47.010> make<00:00:47.129> like<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.700> big<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.360> would<00:00:48.719> be<00:00:48.840> much

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
to make like this big it would be much

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.049 
to make like this big it would be much
bigger<00:00:49.829> depending<00:00:50.250> on<00:00:50.460> how<00:00:50.579> much<00:00:50.700> would<00:00:50.940> you

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
bigger depending on how much would you

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.970 
bigger depending on how much would you
been<00:00:51.210> or<00:00:51.629> maybe<00:00:51.840> much<00:00:52.199> smaller<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.829> want

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
been or maybe much smaller but you want

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.470 
been or maybe much smaller but you want
to<00:00:53.070> get<00:00:53.160> as<00:00:53.250> much<00:00:53.430> wood<00:00:53.670> as<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.940> begin<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.300> this

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
to get as much wood as you begin in this

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.410 
to get as much wood as you begin in this
in<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.590> normal<00:00:55.829> tree<00:00:56.070> from<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.640> machine<00:00:56.879> so

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
in a normal tree from this machine so

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.060 
in a normal tree from this machine so
yeah<00:00:57.719> I'm<00:00:58.140> going<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.350> go<00:00:58.440> ahead<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.829> just<00:00:58.920> go

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
yeah I'm going to go ahead and just go

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.950 
yeah I'm going to go ahead and just go
to<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.309> bond<00:00:59.609> right<00:00:59.820> here<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.480> pretty<00:01:00.809> much

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
to the bond right here so pretty much

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.020 
to the bond right here so pretty much
right<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.590> here<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.370> just<00:01:02.550> some<00:01:02.730> stuff

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
right in here is and just some stuff

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.210 
right in here is and just some stuff
that<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.390> use<00:01:04.309> like<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.489> apples<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
that you use like the apples in the

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.320 
that you use like the apples in the
saplings<00:01:08.220> back<00:01:08.430> then<00:01:08.640> when<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.880> use<00:01:09.000> trung

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
saplings back then when you use trung

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.300 
saplings back then when you use trung
and<00:01:09.510> she<00:01:09.689> don't<00:01:10.049> worry<00:01:10.200> no<00:01:10.470> bone<00:01:10.740> eels<00:01:10.950> getting

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
and she don't worry no bone eels getting

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.730 
and she don't worry no bone eels getting
wasted<00:01:11.689> only<00:01:12.689> one<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.020> sapling<00:01:13.470> that's

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
wasted only one of sapling that's

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.210 
wasted only one of sapling that's
planted<00:01:14.189> down<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.640> bone<00:01:14.790> mill<00:01:15.000> gets<00:01:15.210> used

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
planted down the bone mill gets used

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.770 
planted down the bone mill gets used
it's<00:01:17.220> better<00:01:17.460> if<00:01:17.610> i<00:01:17.700> use<00:01:17.850> oka<00:01:18.330> goes<00:01:18.509> much

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
it's better if i use oka goes much

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.670 
it's better if i use oka goes much
faster<00:01:19.020> but<00:01:19.500> um<00:01:20.000> yeah<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:22.049> can<00:01:22.200> use<00:01:22.380> two

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
faster but um yeah so you can use two

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.640 
faster but um yeah so you can use two
types<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:23.220> trees<00:01:23.930> pretty<00:01:24.930> much<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.380> can<00:01:25.530> use

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
types of trees pretty much you can use

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.450 
types of trees pretty much you can use
as<00:01:25.950> i<00:01:26.130> said<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.549> birch<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.119> oak<00:01:27.450> but<00:01:28.250> oak<00:01:29.250> is

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
as i said the birch and oak but oak is

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.980 
as i said the birch and oak but oak is
unfortunately<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.329> little<00:01:30.509> bit<00:01:30.600> slower<00:01:30.810> but

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
unfortunately a little bit slower but

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.870 
unfortunately a little bit slower but
depending<00:01:31.470> on<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.710> preference<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.549> what<00:01:32.729> that

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
depending on the preference of what that

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.179 
depending on the preference of what that
you<00:01:33.030> want<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.720> if<00:01:33.869> i'm<00:01:34.020> trying<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.350> build<00:01:35.040> a

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
you want so if i'm trying to build a

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.380 
you want so if i'm trying to build a
base<00:01:35.400> out<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.640> birch<00:01:35.909> wood<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.329> i'll

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
base out of birch wood and i'll

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.359 
base out of birch wood and i'll
definitely<00:01:36.840> use<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.110> for<00:01:37.380> birch<00:01:37.530> wood<00:01:37.799> but

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
definitely use this for birch wood but

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.149 
definitely use this for birch wood but
then<00:01:38.610> if<00:01:39.570> you're<00:01:39.810> using<00:01:39.960> oak<00:01:40.290> then<00:01:40.979> you

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
then if you're using oak then you

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.030 
then if you're using oak then you
probably<00:01:41.430> use<00:01:42.000> oak<00:01:42.270> birch<00:01:43.259> wood<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.590> little

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
probably use oak birch wood is a little

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.260 
probably use oak birch wood is a little
bit<00:01:44.159> slower<00:01:44.689> then<00:01:45.689> um<00:01:46.880> yeah<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> little<00:01:48.030> bit

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
bit slower then um yeah a little bit

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.450 
bit slower then um yeah a little bit
slower<00:01:48.509> than<00:01:48.750> oak<00:01:49.079> just<00:01:49.829> because<00:01:50.159> how<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
slower than oak just because how the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.749 
slower than oak just because how the
background<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> normal<00:01:52.350> oak<00:01:52.560> wood<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.520> it's

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
background is a normal oak wood so it's

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.090 
background is a normal oak wood so it's
just<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.030> little<00:01:54.360> bit<00:01:54.450> better<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.750> would<00:01:54.899> say<00:01:55.140> it

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
just a little bit better I would say it

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.789 
just a little bit better I would say it
uses<00:01:56.880> much<00:01:57.119> less<00:01:57.149> bonus<00:01:57.899> then<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.350> course<00:01:58.590> when

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
uses much less bonus then of course when

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.999 
uses much less bonus then of course when
you're<00:01:58.979> done<00:01:59.299> as<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.600> see<00:02:00.840> I'll<00:02:01.290> plant<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.799> tree
