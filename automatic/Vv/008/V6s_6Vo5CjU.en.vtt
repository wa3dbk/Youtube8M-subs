I<00:01:05.040> think<00:01:05.450> so<00:01:06.450> very<00:01:06.630> nice<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.049> such<00:01:07.229> as

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
I think so very nice that such as

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.770 
I think so very nice that such as
finishing<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.040> heading<00:01:08.340> accuracy<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.570> I'll

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
finishing and heading accuracy so I'll

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.359 
finishing and heading accuracy so I'll
move<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.320> clips<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.680> him<00:01:10.799> playing<00:01:11.040> now

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
move on to the clips of him playing now

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.570 
move on to the clips of him playing now
and<00:01:11.630> my<00:01:12.630> impression<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.619> guy<00:01:13.830> was<00:01:14.159> that

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
and my impression of this guy was that

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.510 
and my impression of this guy was that
it<00:01:15.299> was<00:01:15.450> somewhat<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.920> guy<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.340> real

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
it was somewhat like the guy in real

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.640 
it was somewhat like the guy in real
life<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.939> would<00:01:18.060> say<00:01:18.240> his<00:01:18.900> finishing<00:01:19.350> was

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
life I would say his finishing was

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.130 
life I would say his finishing was
pretty<00:01:20.189> good<00:01:20.460> managed<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.360> finish<00:01:21.509> quite<00:01:22.110> a

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
pretty good managed to finish quite a

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.800 
pretty good managed to finish quite a
lot<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.439> chances<00:01:23.000> although<00:01:24.000> he<00:01:24.330> didn't<00:01:24.659> finish

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
lot of chances although he didn't finish

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.530 
lot of chances although he didn't finish
every<00:01:25.200> single<00:01:25.560> one<00:01:25.740> as<00:01:26.090> you<00:01:27.090> hoped<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.479> might

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
every single one as you hoped you might

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.690 
every single one as you hoped you might
but<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:27.990> would<00:01:28.200> probably<00:01:28.229> be<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.860> bit<00:01:29.159> unfair

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
but that would probably be a bit unfair

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.910 
but that would probably be a bit unfair
on<00:01:29.880> your<00:01:30.030> opponent's<00:01:30.450> if<00:01:30.600> he<00:01:30.689> did<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.380> biggest

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
on your opponent's if he did the biggest

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.590 
on your opponent's if he did the biggest
letdown<00:01:32.340> for<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:32.670> guy<00:01:32.820> about<00:01:32.939> me<00:01:33.240> was<00:01:33.450> his

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
letdown for this guy about me was his

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.289 
letdown for this guy about me was his
heading<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.079> will<00:01:34.950> try<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.430> put<00:01:35.700> some<00:01:35.880> flips<00:01:36.119> in

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
heading I will try to put some flips in

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.480 
heading I will try to put some flips in
of<00:01:36.450> his<00:01:36.600> heading<00:01:37.110> but<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.829> might<00:01:38.100> be<00:01:38.250> hard

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
of his heading but it might be hard

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.310 
of his heading but it might be hard
because<00:01:38.700> it's<00:01:39.000> hard<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.299> find<00:01:39.479> things<00:01:40.170> that

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
because it's hard to find things that

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.380 
because it's hard to find things that
aren't<00:01:40.619> shots<00:01:40.860> but<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.729> problem<00:01:42.060> with<00:01:42.150> him

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
aren't shots but the problem with him

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.810 
aren't shots but the problem with him
was<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.290> he<00:01:43.590> didn't<00:01:44.009> seem<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.310> be<00:01:44.430> able<00:01:44.579> to

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
was that he didn't seem to be able to

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.660 
was that he didn't seem to be able to
win<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.270> many<00:01:45.450> headers<00:01:45.780> outright<00:01:46.340> he<00:01:47.340> was

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
win that many headers outright he was

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.920 
win that many headers outright he was
usually<00:01:47.820> able<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.210> jump<00:01:48.509> higher<00:01:48.689> than<00:01:48.869> the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
usually able to jump higher than the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.499 
usually able to jump higher than the
other<00:01:49.110> guy<00:01:49.380> at<00:01:49.710> least<00:01:49.979> slightly<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.850> had<00:01:51.360> the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
other guy at least slightly and had the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.969 
other guy at least slightly and had the
ball<00:01:51.689> but<00:01:51.930> then<00:01:52.110> usually<00:01:52.500> other<00:01:52.770> guy<00:01:52.920> would

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
ball but then usually other guy would

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.069 
ball but then usually other guy would
get<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.490> way<00:01:53.610> or<00:01:54.000> when<00:01:54.600> he<00:01:54.689> did<00:01:54.840> win<00:01:55.049> the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
get in the way or when he did win the

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.020 
get in the way or when he did win the
header<00:01:55.380> then<00:01:55.950> he<00:01:56.219> would<00:01:56.369> head<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.640> straight<00:01:56.909> at

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
header then he would head it straight at

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.539 
header then he would head it straight at
the<00:01:57.119> goalkeeper<00:01:57.149> or<00:01:58.049> something<00:01:58.350> like<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.549> he

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
the goalkeeper or something like that he

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.130 
the goalkeeper or something like that he
didn't<00:01:59.790> score<00:02:00.000> very<00:02:00.210> many<00:02:00.420> hedge<00:02:00.630> goals<00:02:00.960> for

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
didn't score very many hedge goals for

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.289 
didn't score very many hedge goals for
me<00:02:01.290> apart<00:02:01.950> from<00:02:02.040> maybe<00:02:02.280> ones<00:02:02.640> where<00:02:03.000> he<00:02:03.180> was

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
me apart from maybe ones where he was

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.240 
me apart from maybe ones where he was
just<00:02:03.570> tapping<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:04.110> with<00:02:04.350> his<00:02:04.439> head<00:02:04.649> but<00:02:04.979> really

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
just tapping in with his head but really

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.679 
just tapping in with his head but really
that<00:02:05.369> was<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.520> bit<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.820> disappointment<00:02:06.119> and

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
that was a bit of a disappointment and

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.119 
that was a bit of a disappointment and
especially<00:02:07.619> for<00:02:07.829> his<00:02:08.479> 91<00:02:09.479> henning<00:02:09.780> stat3<00:02:10.289> star

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
especially for his 91 henning stat3 star

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.740 
especially for his 91 henning stat3 star
skills<00:02:11.400> are<00:02:11.580> also<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.879> bit<00:02:12.090> disappointing

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
skills are also a bit disappointing

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.559 
skills are also a bit disappointing
you'd<00:02:12.930> hope

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
you'd hope

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.839 
you'd hope
for<00:02:13.719> a<00:02:13.749> striker<00:02:14.680> or<00:02:14.920> at<00:02:15.099> least<00:02:15.280> I<00:02:15.430> would<00:02:15.609> I

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
for a striker or at least I would I

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.520 
for a striker or at least I would I
guess<00:02:16.659> you<00:02:16.780> can't<00:02:16.959> really<00:02:16.989> do<00:02:17.260> much<00:02:17.290> about

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
guess you can't really do much about

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.039 
guess you can't really do much about
that<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:18.609> one<00:02:18.969> other<00:02:19.090> bad<00:02:19.389> thing<00:02:19.599> about<00:02:19.719> him

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
that and one other bad thing about him

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.949 
that and one other bad thing about him
was<00:02:20.079> his<00:02:20.950> balance<00:02:21.639> he<00:02:21.939> could<00:02:22.359> really<00:02:22.659> feel

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
was his balance he could really feel

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.709 
was his balance he could really feel
that<00:02:23.019> he<00:02:23.379> had<00:02:23.499> low<00:02:23.709> balance<00:02:24.420> really<00:02:25.420> did<00:02:25.569> not

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:25.719 
that he had low balance really did not

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:27.479 
that he had low balance really did not
feel<00:02:25.780> like<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.260> very<00:02:26.560> smooth<00:02:26.859> dribbler<00:02:27.219> at<00:02:27.340> all

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
feel like a very smooth dribbler at all

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.309 
feel like a very smooth dribbler at all
I<00:02:27.730> guess<00:02:28.450> if<00:02:28.659> you're<00:02:28.780> playing<00:02:28.930> him<00:02:29.200> you

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
I guess if you're playing him you

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.629 
I guess if you're playing him you
probably<00:02:29.590> want<00:02:29.769> him<00:02:29.889> to<00:02:30.010> just<00:02:30.040> score<00:02:30.430> goals

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:30.639 
probably want him to just score goals

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:31.920 
probably want him to just score goals
and<00:02:30.879> maybe<00:02:31.060> you<00:02:31.180> don't<00:02:31.299> want<00:02:31.510> him<00:02:31.659> to<00:02:31.810> get

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
and maybe you don't want him to get

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.420 
and maybe you don't want him to get
involved<00:02:32.319> in<00:02:32.409> the<00:02:32.500> build-up<00:02:32.739> or<00:02:32.859> anything<00:02:33.219> but

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
involved in the build-up or anything but

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.819 
involved in the build-up or anything but
for<00:02:34.150> me<00:02:34.299> I<00:02:34.329> like<00:02:34.569> to<00:02:34.719> have<00:02:34.840> all-rounder

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
for me I like to have all-rounder

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.099 
for me I like to have all-rounder
players<00:02:36.069> usually<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.730> this<00:02:37.299> guy<00:02:37.480> could<00:02:37.900> not

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
players usually and this guy could not

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.589 
players usually and this guy could not
travel<00:02:38.349> for<00:02:38.799> his<00:02:38.980> life<00:02:39.400> his<00:02:39.969> long<00:02:40.209> shot<00:02:40.450> was

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
travel for his life his long shot was

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.780 
travel for his life his long shot was
quite<00:02:40.840> good<00:02:40.870> he<00:02:41.500> scored<00:02:41.889> a<00:02:42.129> couple<00:02:42.280> of<00:02:42.489> shots

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
quite good he scored a couple of shots

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.759 
quite good he scored a couple of shots
from<00:02:42.939> outside<00:02:43.269> the<00:02:43.389> box<00:02:43.599> for<00:02:43.780> me<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.590> his

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
from outside the box for me and his

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.379 
from outside the box for me and his
finisher<00:02:45.159> was<00:02:45.310> also<00:02:45.549> quite<00:02:45.700> good<00:02:45.760> once<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.269> got

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:46.389 
finisher was also quite good once I got

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.170 
finisher was also quite good once I got
used<00:02:46.450> to<00:02:46.810> it<00:02:46.840> I<00:02:47.169> think<00:02:47.829> was<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:48.730> little<00:02:49.030> about

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
used to it I think was a little about

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.699 
used to it I think was a little about
our<00:02:49.239> practice<00:02:49.719> or<00:02:49.870> something<00:02:50.230> I'm<00:02:50.349> not<00:02:50.439> really

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
our practice or something I'm not really

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.860 
our practice or something I'm not really
quite<00:02:50.980> sure<00:02:51.219> but<00:02:51.250> I<00:02:51.459> couldn't<00:02:51.819> score<00:02:52.599> from<00:02:52.780> the

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
quite sure but I couldn't score from the

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.479 
quite sure but I couldn't score from the
shots<00:02:53.109> in<00:02:53.199> the<00:02:53.319> beginning<00:02:53.680> but<00:02:53.829> after<00:02:54.099> a<00:02:54.310> while

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
shots in the beginning but after a while

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.030 
shots in the beginning but after a while
I<00:02:54.549> got<00:02:54.699> used<00:02:54.969> to<00:02:55.120> it<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.620> started<00:02:56.620> scoring

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
I got used to it and started scoring

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.479 
I got used to it and started scoring
them<00:02:57.189> pretty<00:02:57.459> easily<00:02:57.549> so<00:02:58.510> yeah<00:02:58.750> this<00:02:58.959> guy<00:02:59.199> is

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
them pretty easily so yeah this guy is

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.809 
them pretty easily so yeah this guy is
clinical<00:03:00.489> enough<00:03:00.790> but<00:03:01.359> he's<00:03:02.280> not<00:03:03.280> quite<00:03:03.609> as

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
clinical enough but he's not quite as

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.520 
clinical enough but he's not quite as
amazingly<00:03:04.389> clinical<00:03:04.989> as<00:03:05.109> you<00:03:05.230> would<00:03:05.349> hope<00:03:05.469> for

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
amazingly clinical as you would hope for

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.039 
amazingly clinical as you would hope for
