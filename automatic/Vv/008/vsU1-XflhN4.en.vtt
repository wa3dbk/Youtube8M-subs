00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.620
 question of karim since the time that I 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.870
 listening who often refers to 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.340
 ali same in time example before he 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.099
 walk and there is a tree rotten and it 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.480
 na li quintile walk in the forest the 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.190
 leaves the trees the brushes and the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.130
 I agree that our young people have 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.600
 little changed since then 99 9% 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.980
 similar and so we are 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.380
 fit a diet more like 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.920
 if they had embarrassed me question in piece 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.539
 attached 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.390
 while I do not have unfortunately km 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.680
 karim a painting that picks 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.000
 human food since the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.009
 australopithecus he completely me 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.530
 lost diets are completely 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.630
 different then yes so I tell you 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.370
 the illustrating little excess pinion on 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.790
 the scale of on the scale of history 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.309
 human 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.530
 we are older than that 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.170
 firstly second problem is so 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.789
 anyway it means nothing 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.860
 and then Australopithecus in 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.559
 which region of the world we are 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.050
 the human species really genetically 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.180
 speaking everything indicates that we are 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.800
 from the tropics while it is 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.989
 evolution whether it's creation we 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.789
 are a tropical species that is stolen 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.840
 in the tropics 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.100
 then the australopithecus fonts 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.659
 have lived in hostile lands and 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.570
 that they fed on meat that's 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.130
 possible in recent times 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.229
 relatively recent first things 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.159
 second of the things he'll have to 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.850
 start questioning the story 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.320
 official 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.430
 because when we start there 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.680
 to interest a little bit 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.810
 account that our history quite other 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.880
 our our history our philosophy 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.650
 is ideologically constructed 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.600
 that is, we have everything 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.090
 body of science that aims only one 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.000
 only thing show us that we are 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.090
 the perfect fulfillment of the man 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.750
 that he had to be valuing lomu 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.030
 twentieth century us such as accomplished home 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.490
 it's valid in philosophy it's 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.189
 valid in history it is valid in 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.009
 sociology it's valid in religion if 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.020
 valid in all these areas have brought together 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.009
 either we have a very partial vision 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.780
 of history it would be time 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.700
 to question and there are historians 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.010
 alternative is what shows you 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.470
 the story agnÃ¨s to his daughter that his daughter 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.780
 it's funny it's really funny he 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.670
 there is something else for example to surprise 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.280
 which often surprises people is what 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.180
 you know that the earth as 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.490
 account represents it 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.990
 it is not true that the maps of the world 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.030
 projections it contained represents 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.290
 on the dish they are false the 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.070
 proportion of territories is not 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.480
 just 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.370
 Africa is very small compared to 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.410
 a great and gentlemen again that's 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.390
 absolutely wrong will see a projection 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.680
 called projection of meyers and you 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.030
 will realize that she reports 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.920
 of the size of the territories and you 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.300
 exactly what is the 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.800
 proportion of territories and you go away 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.240
 realize that the mixer our 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.400
 very small bladders compared to 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.750
 huge southern hemisphere but that it serves 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.460
 some form of ideology 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.170
 so which one do they approach is what 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.820
 it's the classic is what it is 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.860
 projection of the best it is a small 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.020
 little between all that there are several guys 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.240
 in relation to history also our 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.330
 story is completely ideologized 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.100
 So me the power of stories 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.720
 who have progressed the man who ate of 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.850
 tatati meat and tatata what I 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.320
 know is that we ate raw and who 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.120
 eat what they found then if he 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.380
 moved north because it was 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.300
 more in the tropics that's his 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.360
 story and eat what he could but 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.459
 he ate raw anyway what this 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.410
 kind of debate there of betting completely 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.319
 unfounded and I know it sort 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.249
 often 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.870
 but actually I tell you the purpose 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:19.459
 always it's to prove that the man 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.420
 has adapted to powerful that man cedh 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.249
 and adapted to the development 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.079
 technological and that only the 

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:26.209
 technological development pass his 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.709
 mower one early morning and well it's 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.200
 achievement is the ultimate 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.060
 ultra of what can happen to 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.799
 the human I do not agree I am 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.750
 absolutely disagree it's time to 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.790
 question all this there is really a 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.799
 Alternative history is left to 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.489
 create that is created gradually but 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.489
 which is really to create
