going to show you how to do a quick
repair<00:00:26.390> I<00:00:26.680> wore<00:00:28.090> b9f<00:00:30.250> this<00:00:31.419> dick<00:00:32.419> u9f<00:00:33.200> is<00:00:33.520> a

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
repair I wore b9f this dick u9f is a

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.650 
repair I wore b9f this dick u9f is a
tender<00:00:35.570> driven<00:00:35.900> one<00:00:36.079> I<00:00:36.320> think<00:00:36.920> it's<00:00:37.660> going

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
tender driven one I think it's going

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.140 
tender driven one I think it's going
over<00:00:38.780> the<00:00:39.220> barbecue<00:00:40.220> off<00:00:40.400> top<00:00:40.580> of<00:00:40.640> my<00:00:40.730> head<00:00:40.879> but

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
over the barbecue off top of my head but

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.920 
over the barbecue off top of my head but
I<00:00:41.210> got<00:00:41.510> it<00:00:41.629> around<00:00:42.910> 2003<00:00:43.910> 2004<00:00:44.480> kind<00:00:44.870> of

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
I got it around 2003 2004 kind of

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.829 
I got it around 2003 2004 kind of
timeframe<00:00:45.110> so<00:00:45.670> it's<00:00:46.670> it's<00:00:47.330> relatively<00:00:47.660> new

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:47.839 
timeframe so it's it's relatively new

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.380 
timeframe so it's it's relatively new
it's<00:00:48.379> one<00:00:48.559> of<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:48.680> ones<00:00:49.460> that<00:00:49.580> were<00:00:49.790> made<00:00:50.269> in

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
it's one of the ones that were made in

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.770 
it's one of the ones that were made in
China

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
China

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.069 
China
and<00:00:51.250> it<00:00:52.250> has<00:00:52.370> actually<00:00:52.550> been<00:00:52.760> run<00:00:53.059> very<00:00:53.690> often

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
and it has actually been run very often

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.760 
and it has actually been run very often
but<00:00:54.350> it<00:00:55.280> has<00:00:55.399> a<00:00:55.430> problem<00:00:56.210> here<00:00:56.539> you<00:00:57.140> can<00:00:57.559> see

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
but it has a problem here you can see

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.189 
but it has a problem here you can see
that<00:00:57.920> in<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:58.070> video<00:00:58.390> but<00:01:00.100> basically<00:01:02.199> the

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
that in the video but basically the

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.490 
that in the video but basically the
solder<00:01:03.949> joint<00:01:04.570> that<00:01:05.570> was<00:01:05.780> connecting<00:01:06.320> this

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
solder joint that was connecting this

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.690 
solder joint that was connecting this
wall<00:01:06.770> right<00:01:07.100> here<00:01:07.720> to<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:09.490> coupling<00:01:10.490> for<00:01:10.640> the

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
wall right here to the coupling for the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.980 
wall right here to the coupling for the
power<00:01:10.940> for<00:01:11.149> the<00:01:11.240> tender<00:01:11.630> is<00:01:13.240> disconnected<00:01:14.240> so

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
power for the tender is disconnected so

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.590 
power for the tender is disconnected so
we're<00:01:15.350> going<00:01:15.470> to<00:01:15.530> try<00:01:15.740> to<00:01:15.800> repair<00:01:16.160> this<00:01:16.340> I<00:01:16.670> just

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
we're going to try to repair this I just

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.520 
we're going to try to repair this I just
get<00:01:18.530> that<00:01:18.680> fixed<00:01:19.190> out<00:01:19.280> solder<00:01:19.610> joint<00:01:19.880> and

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
get that fixed out solder joint and

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:30.060 
get that fixed out solder joint and
hopefully<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:22.190> 9f<00:01:22.729> will<00:01:22.970> run<00:01:23.240> again<00:01:23.479> properly

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.580 

I'm<00:01:31.070> so<00:01:31.340> here<00:01:31.520> very<00:01:32.060> slowly<00:01:32.299> regard<00:01:32.720> I'm<00:01:33.320> going

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
I'm so here very slowly regard I'm going

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.080 
I'm so here very slowly regard I'm going
to<00:01:33.680> attempt<00:01:34.009> to<00:01:34.070> do<00:01:34.280> so<00:01:35.119> soldiering<00:01:35.920> via<00:01:37.090> the

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
to attempt to do so soldiering via the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.450 
to attempt to do so soldiering via the
video<00:01:38.360> here<00:01:38.900> which<00:01:39.170> is<00:01:39.409> not<00:01:40.040> always<00:01:40.189> the

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
video here which is not always the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:58.460 
video here which is not always the
easiest<00:01:40.490> of<00:01:40.939> things<00:01:41.180> to<00:01:41.329> do

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.960 

okay<00:01:59.470> so<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.830> good<00:01:59.920> news<00:01:59.980> is<00:02:00.250> I<00:02:00.460> have<00:02:00.490> been

okay so the good news is I have been
successful<00:02:02.190> at<00:02:03.190> getting<00:02:03.220> that<00:02:03.730> to<00:02:03.910> solder<00:02:05.460> for

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
successful at getting that to solder for

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.249 
successful at getting that to solder for
today<00:02:06.640> I<00:02:06.700> had<00:02:06.850> to<00:02:06.940> use<00:02:07.120> an<00:02:07.480> extra<00:02:07.780> hand<00:02:07.810> so<00:02:08.229> I

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
today I had to use an extra hand so I

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.350 
today I had to use an extra hand so I
couldn't<00:02:08.470> do<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:08.680> on<00:02:08.740> the<00:02:08.890> video<00:02:09.100> but<00:02:09.369> you<00:02:10.180> can

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
couldn't do it on the video but you can

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.410 
couldn't do it on the video but you can
see<00:02:10.509> there<00:02:10.720> is<00:02:11.580> definitely<00:02:12.580> now<00:02:12.700> reconnected

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
see there is definitely now reconnected

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.860 
see there is definitely now reconnected
and<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:15.160> seems<00:02:15.370> to<00:02:15.430> be<00:02:15.490> working<00:02:15.610> okay<00:02:16.060> so<00:02:16.660> we're

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
and it seems to be working okay so we're

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.570 
and it seems to be working okay so we're
gonna<00:02:16.960> go<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:18.960> give<00:02:19.960> this<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.290> shot<00:02:20.560> on<00:02:21.310> the

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
gonna go and give this a shot on the

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.010 
gonna go and give this a shot on the
rails<00:02:21.930> hopefully<00:02:22.930> it'll<00:02:23.050> work<00:02:23.200> okay<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:25.810> here

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
rails hopefully it'll work okay so here

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.080 
rails hopefully it'll work okay so here
we<00:02:26.050> go<00:02:26.230> we've<00:02:26.530> got<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:26.860> all<00:02:27.010> hooked<00:02:27.820> back

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
we go we've got it all hooked back

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.200 
we go we've got it all hooked back
together<00:02:28.270> that<00:02:28.870> wire<00:02:29.050> solder<00:02:29.560> up<00:02:29.970> let's<00:02:30.970> see

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
together that wire solder up let's see

00:02:31.210 --> 00:03:09.830 
together that wire solder up let's see
if<00:02:31.270> it<00:02:31.480> runs

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.080 

so<00:03:10.840> you<00:03:10.900> can<00:03:11.230> see<00:03:11.410> here<00:03:11.680> unfortunately<00:03:12.090> you

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
so you can see here unfortunately you

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.110 
so you can see here unfortunately you
know<00:03:13.300> we<00:03:13.540> soldered<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.650> wire<00:03:14.860> it<00:03:15.820> did

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
know we soldered the the wire it did

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.780 
know we soldered the the wire it did
come<00:03:16.840> disconnected<00:03:17.620> again<00:03:17.860> after<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.310> few<00:03:18.370> laps

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
come disconnected again after a few laps

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.150 
come disconnected again after a few laps
around<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.240> track<00:03:19.500> say<00:03:20.500> what<00:03:20.740> I've<00:03:20.830> done<00:03:20.950> this

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
around the track say what I've done this

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.400 
around the track say what I've done this
time<00:03:21.400> is<00:03:23.460> basically<00:03:24.460> cut<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.750> wire<00:03:25.960> the

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
time is basically cut the wire the

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.490 
time is basically cut the wire the
shielding<00:03:26.950> off<00:03:27.100> of<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.310> wire<00:03:27.490> I'm<00:03:28.060> about<00:03:28.840> two

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
shielding off of the wire I'm about two

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.940 
shielding off of the wire I'm about two
to<00:03:30.160> four<00:03:30.610> millimeters<00:03:30.880> back<00:03:31.390> and<00:03:31.810> I<00:03:32.620> went<00:03:32.830> to

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
to four millimeters back and I went to

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.040 
to four millimeters back and I went to
tinned<00:03:33.550> s<00:03:33.790> with<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.120> flux<00:03:34.450> on<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.870> solder<00:03:35.500> and

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
tinned s with the flux on the solder and

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.360 
tinned s with the flux on the solder and
solder<00:03:38.050> it<00:03:38.290> back<00:03:38.320> to<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.650> joint<00:03:38.830> again<00:03:39.160> and

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
solder it back to the joint again and

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
solder it back to the joint again and
hopefully<00:03:39.520> this<00:03:40.120> time<00:03:40.330> it'll<00:03:40.510> hold

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.470 

yes<00:03:50.840> and<00:03:51.200> that<00:03:51.470> wasn't<00:03:51.800> exactly<00:03:52.310> Pleasant<00:03:52.940> but

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
yes and that wasn't exactly Pleasant but

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.620 
yes and that wasn't exactly Pleasant but
it<00:03:53.780> did<00:03:53.990> work<00:03:54.370> so<00:03:55.370> as<00:03:55.670> you<00:03:55.760> can<00:03:55.850> see<00:03:55.910> there<00:03:56.180> it's

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
it did work so as you can see there it's

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.650 
it did work so as you can see there it's
now<00:03:56.810> been<00:03:57.520> salud<00:03:58.520> a<00:03:58.670> lot<00:03:58.850> better<00:03:59.090> I'm<00:03:59.450> gonna

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
now been salud a lot better I'm gonna

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:21.090 
now been salud a lot better I'm gonna
add<00:03:59.810> some<00:04:00.040> additional<00:04:01.040> solder<00:04:01.670> to<00:04:01.850> it<00:04:02.320> just<00:04:03.320> to

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:29.260 

okay<00:04:24.970> if<00:04:25.970> your<00:04:26.180> kid<00:04:27.490> that<00:04:28.490> probably<00:04:28.670> isn't<00:04:29.090> the

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
okay if your kid that probably isn't the

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.730 
okay if your kid that probably isn't the
best<00:04:29.480> way<00:04:29.840> to<00:04:29.870> do<00:04:30.170> that<00:04:30.380> but<00:04:30.700> it<00:04:31.700> works<00:04:32.500> so<00:04:33.500> you

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
best way to do that but it works so you

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.510 
best way to do that but it works so you
might<00:04:33.890> want<00:04:34.040> get<00:04:34.160> an<00:04:34.250> adult<00:04:34.550> tough<00:04:34.820> you<00:04:36.520> solder

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
might want get an adult tough you solder

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
might want get an adult tough you solder
that<00:04:37.700> on<00:04:37.820> it's<00:04:38.060> very<00:04:38.420> very<00:04:38.600> small<00:04:38.980> but

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
that on it's very very small but

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.580 
that on it's very very small but
basically<00:04:41.540> the<00:04:41.690> reason<00:04:41.810> it<00:04:42.050> needs<00:04:42.380> to<00:04:42.500> be

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
basically the reason it needs to be

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.990 
basically the reason it needs to be
electrical<00:04:43.010> contact<00:04:43.400> we<00:04:43.490> change<00:04:43.700> this<00:04:43.790> in<00:04:43.940> the

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
electrical contact we change this in the

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.150 
electrical contact we change this in the
tender<00:04:44.390> is<00:04:44.960> that<00:04:45.170> there's<00:04:45.350> pickups<00:04:45.800> on<00:04:45.980> the

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
tender is that there's pickups on the

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.200 
tender is that there's pickups on the
young<00:04:46.370> on<00:04:46.820> the<00:04:46.970> rest<00:04:47.120> of<00:04:47.270> the<00:04:47.390> locomotive<00:04:48.110> and

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
young on the rest of the locomotive and

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.160 
young on the rest of the locomotive and
the<00:04:50.210> problem<00:04:50.510> this<00:04:50.600> particular<00:04:50.720> my

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
the problem this particular my

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.410 
the problem this particular my
locomotive<00:04:51.860> had<00:04:52.040> was<00:04:52.250> it<00:04:52.400> was<00:04:52.580> moving<00:04:53.150> very

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
locomotive had was it was moving very

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.490 
locomotive had was it was moving very
sluggish<00:04:53.750> and<00:04:54.370> it<00:04:55.370> was<00:04:55.870> basically<00:04:56.870> slowing

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
sluggish and it was basically slowing

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.310 
sluggish and it was basically slowing
down<00:04:57.680> and<00:04:57.980> stopping<00:04:58.130> on<00:04:58.610> on<00:04:58.940> curves<00:04:59.330> and<00:04:59.780> the

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
down and stopping on on curves and the

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.870 
down and stopping on on curves and the
reason<00:05:00.590> for<00:05:00.680> that<00:05:00.740> was<00:05:00.920> just<00:05:01.070> simply<00:05:01.370> wasn't

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
reason for that was just simply wasn't

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.660 
reason for that was just simply wasn't
enough<00:05:02.180> contact<00:05:03.190> getting<00:05:04.190> power<00:05:04.370> to<00:05:04.580> the

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 
enough contact getting power to the

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.300 
enough contact getting power to the
motor<00:05:04.790> so<00:05:05.440> hopefully<00:05:06.440> on<00:05:06.680> this<00:05:06.920> will<00:05:07.130> fix

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
motor so hopefully on this will fix

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:32.570 
motor so hopefully on this will fix
problem<00:05:07.930> and<00:05:08.930> it's<00:05:09.200> go<00:05:09.740> test<00:05:10.010> it<00:05:10.130> again

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.639
