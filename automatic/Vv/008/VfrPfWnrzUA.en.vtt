00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:11.599

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.180
 let's go with the logo and start this 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.180
 video 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.390
 to achieve this effect the only thing 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.730
 we have to be a root user and 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.760
 have installed what the equipment is 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.040
 install the module that we are going to occupy 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.660
 call screen of animation that I'm going to 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.730
 leave in the description of the video to 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.890
 that you can download it and install it as a 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.170
 regular application when installing it you go 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.790
 to go for modules and the only thing you're going 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.070
 do is enter the application where 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.960
 says script of animation obviously 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.309
 before entering you have to activate it already 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.520
 you know install it with an application 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.199
 regulate what you activate here in pita and 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.150
 are you going to restart your phone or 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.820
 make debut when restarting it is already going to 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.590
 totally activate what the module is and 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.510
 The only thing we are going to do is enter 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.399
 the application and as I already have it 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.560
 activated in this case you appear 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.380
 totally disabled and the only thing that 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.570
 you are going to do is activate it as you can see 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.399
 we have it activated and the only thing we're going 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.430
 to go is the first option where it says 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.960
 select animation we sting and what 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.970
 only the different ones will appear 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.710
 animations that we can do in this 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.869
 case we have the typical do that 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.539
 horizontal which are the animations 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.740
 of the irises when they go out you coves 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:26.600
 we pricked and 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.240
 how are you going to see what animation is 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.939
 we had another one like lg optimus je 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.350
 as you can see that is the circular we have the 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.190
 What I like the most is that they make faith and 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.620
 is here 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.930
 As you can see they are like squares and we are going to 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.250
 leave it in which fein is made and here 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.380
 we can select what is the 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.470
 speed whether we want to be 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.510
 make faster a little slower and we 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.370
 we are going to complicate what is the 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.340
 power of your phone is going to activate 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.990
