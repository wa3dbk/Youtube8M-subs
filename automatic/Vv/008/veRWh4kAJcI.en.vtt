00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
little different and so did the trap

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.020 
little different and so did the trap
today<00:03:17.799> everything<00:03:18.190> talked<00:03:18.430> as<00:03:18.579> a<00:03:18.730> touch

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
today everything talked as a touch

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.339 
today everything talked as a touch
different<00:03:19.450> but<00:03:19.569> we<00:03:19.690> have<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.870> same<00:03:20.079> setup

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
different but we have the same setup

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.250 
different but we have the same setup
that<00:03:20.620> made<00:03:20.769> some<00:03:20.950> small<00:03:21.129> adjustments<00:03:21.280> and

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
that made some small adjustments and

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.710 
that made some small adjustments and
the<00:03:22.650> car<00:03:22.890> really<00:03:23.129> felt<00:03:23.430> good<00:03:23.489> so<00:03:24.030> I<00:03:24.269> think<00:03:24.480> we
