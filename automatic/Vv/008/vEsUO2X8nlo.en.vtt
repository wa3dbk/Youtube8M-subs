00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.420

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.440
 who came to me to teach her 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.020
 urgently needed such a palette 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.260
 there was no way to wait 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.460
 a few months I sold it in general 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:00.449
 then successfully ordered it means that 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.879
 I got exactly the same palette 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.119
 absolutely absolutely it costs even 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.060
 cheaper than I ordered it myself last 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.430
 Once at the mediator, yes, I like everything 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.260

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.180
 pallets are actually very many 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.920
 makeup artists works learn with these 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.270
 the chancellor that is they practically even 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.990
 I do not use foundation 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.860
 use purely this palette 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:28.200
 conveyors it means that we have 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.290
 here you have here 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.020
 first here is such a white highlighter about 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.509
 actually goes highlighter now i'm 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.659
 little myvi.ru 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:41.189
 here is such here he is very shea mine him on 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.970
 can actually be used as 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.240
 highlighter 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:50.549
 in small quantities it is very convenient 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:55.170
 here we have this color 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.659
 green is what we have in general 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.340
 he goes to green as we know he 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.950
 neutralizes redness 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:08.390
 that is, we use it to hide 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.770
 our pigment spots are red and for 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.380
 eliminate some small 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.660
 prosperity that is, we acne a little bit 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.750
 slightly apply this green color and 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.060
 he neutralizes the redness 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.950
 just like that he is north of this color he 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.090
 neutralizes titmouse 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:30.570
 and ice color here and hereinafter 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.360
 send such here too jolt and by the way too 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.670
 used for some purple 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.820
 bruises can be used well and 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.980
 then send us here with these two I 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.290
 I also overlap some flaws with me 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.270
 really like these grades they already 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.600
 darker they can be used as 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.390
 like a foundation like that 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.540
 seen here it means here you see it means 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.260
 There are two rows of tasks on average 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.630
 shades and goes last here such 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.120
 very dark row this dark row we 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.450
 do face contouring that is, we 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.600
 use it as a bronzer here that is 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.270
 you can completely use this dark one 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.080
 Shadow home can be more light if 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.480
 girls a little skin whiter and 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.959
 correspondingly very dark if skin 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.670
 darker here is very like the same again 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.370
 pleased with this palette but already about her 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.320
 said a lot yes I work on it already 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.070
 About six months and I want to say that 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:36.100
 the quality is just fine here 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:38.110
 completely the same type of palette with some 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.000
 I had professional marks 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.440
 professional brand and this is me 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.460
 really like to work gorgeous just 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.680
 madly in love but the only thing 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.300
 girls who have dry skin then 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.820
 naturally these ends 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.500
 you must first moisten the skin then 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.140
 use concealer and otherwise you imagine 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.130
 underline all your flakings as well in 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.560
 Basically, all very cool all that's not 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.730

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.080

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.750
 small compact that is, it is somewhere 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.239
