00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:30.090

 here the company has not sent us in the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.570
 investment box of the product but in 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.380
 the bottom the idea is to see if they can 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:47.160
 make this one was this touch and 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:50.570

 must be 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.380
 and also talk about their 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.220

 cable the connector an allen key for 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.590
 be able to use and disarm this part of 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.870
 back to change the connector 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.660
 because it can also be used for what 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.520
 It comes to be the new iPhone or iPhone 5 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.410
 we are going to give you an approach and so that 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.030
 you can see more or less in what 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:29.210
 This is this basis for the 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.670
 iphone 44 is ok what we have done is 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.140
 disarm this product and give us an idea 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.520
 more or less what is it for 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.520
 explain to you 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.869
 more clearly as you can 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.510
 see is a basis for what is the iphone 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.119
 4 the iphone 4s or the iphone 5 is 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.310
 totally aluminum is very heavy 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:50.020
 gentlemen, you can appreciate that 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:54.609
 this part here moves have here 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:57.789
 and some allen bolts to be able to withdraw 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:59.890
 this and accommodate this piece to the height and 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.240
 I tell them to height because thanks to 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.469
 this study you are in are going to be able to 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.969
 place your device iphone 4 4 s 15 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.459
 in case you have a case like 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:12.459
 this one here is one of the few one of 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.620
 the few bases that allow the 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.140
 iphone with different studies can 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.840
 then stand here without any problem and 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.980
 keep your smart phone charged 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.890
 you can place up to a thickness of 5.7 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.130
 millimeters not also this here that comes 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.200
 a carving box without any problem in 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.110
 the equipment to charge your device 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.700
 we just tried it and as I say 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.549
 then it is one of the few one of the 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.040
 few bases that allow the cell 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.170
 It is with a case so they can be loaded and 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.510
 You can have it placed on the side of your 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.709
 bed not on your night table without any 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.209
 problem 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.370
 the unarmed as you have been able 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.450
 appreciate here is simply the company 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.090
 does not include 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.090
 someone and what we are now 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.060
 finish the installation you are going to 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.930
 power as I tell you to graduate to the other 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:10.480
 piece in it 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:13.980
 and in the connector that goes to the iphone 44 and 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.980
 soon the iphone 5 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.650
 and you let it be able to load without any 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.100
 problem 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.230
 you have the charge of forgiveness 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.060
 the base here have a small protector 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.090
 and you can see also here that 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.410
 has two exits so that in case of 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.810
 you want to place the music 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.420
 simply in the music go out for the 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.500
 device speakers and exit by 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.780
 the holes that this base has here 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.540
 you can see that the connector can 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.830
 move not if you can also 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.290
 give it a small height in this case 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.730
 lift with more height to fit 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.680
 you can see there that a small 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.970
 of depth between what to do 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.010
 listen to the input connector at 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.560
 connector and in this case then the 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.800
 graduates to simply fit and 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.600
 load without any problem and that 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:11.350
 it's practically the whole cost of this one 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:14.230
 this base is 89 point 95 dollars and 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.510
 as I tell you, it's totally 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.549
 aluminum and includes the cable but not 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.170
 charger becomes something that maybe 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.440
 possibly not as a little bit is the fact 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:26.740
 that the cell phone moves from this 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.450
 way but I think that's not relevant 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.300
 and that we cause many 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:35.970
 problems do not you in mind 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:38.070
 we place you because you simply do not 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.440
 use or have maybe one more box 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.580
 thin that the one that I have is going to 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:48.870
 be much better to install and place 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:52.650
 the device for your charge comes with 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:55.200
 two allen keys to disarm the 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.840
 device from the back and 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.730
 you can see that here has a 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.860
 rubber base to adhere 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:05.400
 really see without being able to move it 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.980
 not to any flat surface is more 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.020
 It looks like 17 gases but do not leave marks 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.330
 when it grabs you very well at the moment of 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.270
 you place this base in the 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.650
 surface the company is darling could 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.660
