00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
definitely I think and there's like a

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.320 
definitely I think and there's like a
little<00:05:03.290> longer<00:05:03.560> like<00:05:03.970> cycling<00:05:04.970> up<00:05:05.150> they're

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
little longer like cycling up they're

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.030 
little longer like cycling up they're
really<00:05:05.630> in<00:05:05.810> right<00:05:05.990> now<00:05:06.050> what<00:05:06.620> it<00:05:06.740> would<00:05:06.860> look

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
really in right now what it would look

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.460 
really in right now what it would look
like<00:05:07.100> that<00:05:07.430> or<00:05:07.669> having<00:05:08.330> a<00:05:08.470> superlative

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
like that or having a superlative

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:16.210 
like that or having a superlative
understand<00:05:10.160> maybe<00:05:10.970> in<00:05:11.240> but<00:05:11.540> I<00:05:13.690> mean<00:05:15.010> yeah<00:05:16.010> I

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
understand maybe in but I mean yeah I

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:23.550 
understand maybe in but I mean yeah I
did<00:05:16.820> that<00:05:16.970> for<00:05:17.180> a<00:05:17.240> while<00:05:17.300> it<00:05:17.510> drove<00:05:17.660> me<00:05:17.810> house

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
so it's hard to grow the stock really

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:35.320 
so it's hard to grow the stock really
like<00:05:26.000> longer<00:05:26.540> piece<00:05:26.990> I<00:05:27.110> never<00:05:27.260> go<00:05:27.380> get<00:05:34.090> did<00:05:35.090> you
