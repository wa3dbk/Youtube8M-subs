00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:07.240
 This video card will show closer to 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:07.240

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:17.930

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:58.080
 Greta as in dust from all to landscapes 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:02.780
 difficult as much garbage in the computer 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.780
 is crap 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:10.190
 you can call it the dirtiest 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:16.079
 the computer is what happened after cleaning 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:19.459
 became clean all about him cleaned well 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:22.709
 compressor ordinary compressor 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.810
 pumped with air and blown 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.750
 vacuuming this effect you will not achieve 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.510
 there with a princess need a little brush 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.690
 all this territory is not so good 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.549
 it turns out here you thought true 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.530
 I had to run about three meters later 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.890
 already on the hatch from it 1 saw how many 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:45.510
 this blueberry fan is all important 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.760
 clean contact with the compressor while 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.440
 a place where you blow fans especially 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.030
 hold the fan and because they 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.700
 unwind to such an extent that 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.109
 sleeves are broken due to not 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.340
 then begin to buzz during work 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:04.560
 hold in the power supply 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:06.359
 the same is a fan necessary 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.489
 shove a fire match or nails 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.750
 any fan hold exactly 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.889
 also on the video card 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.690
 or hand hold fan bro 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.370
 clogged if such fans are still 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.410
 You can at least somehow replace it there to buy 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.750
 they are sold freely on sale at 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.639
 video cards are tricky here 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.770
 fans small steps with different 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:30.979
 fixings 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.979
 such find very hard that's all
