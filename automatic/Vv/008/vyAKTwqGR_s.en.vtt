00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
very toxic from what I understand while

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.370 
very toxic from what I understand while
it<00:02:54.360> eats<00:02:54.540> away<00:02:54.690> at<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.989> glass<00:02:55.260> so<00:02:57.050> there<00:02:58.050> you

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
it eats away at the glass so there you

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.990 
it eats away at the glass so there you
got<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:58.590> okay<00:02:58.890> so<00:02:59.130> I'm<00:02:59.489> we're<00:02:59.640> just<00:02:59.760> going<00:02:59.940> to

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
front and it's going to give it a

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.880 
front and it's going to give it a

off the vinyl so here we go okay here is
my<00:03:38.850> completed<00:03:39.480> project<00:03:40.140> if<00:03:40.260> you<00:03:40.350> can<00:03:40.530> kind<00:03:40.770> of

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
my completed project if you can kind of

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.600 
my completed project if you can kind of
see<00:03:41.010> that<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:42.120> looks<00:03:42.240> better<00:03:42.510> in<00:03:42.780> person<00:03:43.080> and

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
see that it looks better in person and

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.650 
see that it looks better in person and
the<00:03:44.610> snowflake<00:03:45.360> is<00:03:45.950> glass<00:03:46.980> on<00:03:47.640> there<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.150> I

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
the snowflake is glass on there and I

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.030 
the snowflake is glass on there and I
might<00:03:48.870> recommend<00:03:49.140> leaving<00:03:49.410> it<00:03:49.620> on<00:03:49.710> a<00:03:49.770> little

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
might recommend leaving it on a little

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.680 
might recommend leaving it on a little
bit<00:03:50.220> longer<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.760> etching<00:03:51.030> cream<00:03:51.150> I<00:03:51.300> only<00:03:51.480> left

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
bit longer the etching cream I only left

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.510 
bit longer the etching cream I only left
it<00:03:51.780> on<00:03:51.840> for<00:03:51.900> 20<00:03:52.230> minutes<00:03:52.500> I<00:03:52.710> might<00:03:53.250> recommend

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
it on for 20 minutes I might recommend

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.180 
it on for 20 minutes I might recommend
30<00:03:53.940> or<00:03:54.090> 40<00:03:54.420> I<00:03:55.110> like<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.620> way<00:03:55.710> mine<00:03:55.920> looks

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
30 or 40 I like the way mine looks

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.740 
30 or 40 I like the way mine looks
because<00:03:56.790> it's<00:03:56.910> really<00:03:57.180> frosted<00:03:57.420> in<00:03:57.690> the

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
because it's really frosted in the

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.260 
because it's really frosted in the
middle<00:03:57.960> and<00:03:58.110> then<00:03:58.200> it's<00:03:58.320> kind<00:03:58.560> of<00:03:59.060> what's<00:04:00.060> that

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
middle and then it's kind of what's that

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.120 
middle and then it's kind of what's that
word<00:04:00.420> just<00:04:01.080> kind<00:04:01.320> of<00:04:01.380> blended<00:04:01.800> in<00:04:01.890> on<00:04:02.010> the

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
word just kind of blended in on the

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.460 
word just kind of blended in on the
sides<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:02.640> I<00:04:02.970> had<00:04:03.150> my<00:04:03.360> lights<00:04:03.630> in<00:04:03.960> it<00:04:04.110> so<00:04:04.350> this

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
sides and I had my lights in it so this

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.960 
sides and I had my lights in it so this
is<00:04:04.590> a<00:04:04.620> great<00:04:04.860> project<00:04:05.070> you<00:04:05.430> can<00:04:05.580> put<00:04:05.730> a<00:04:05.760> bunch

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
is a great project you can put a bunch

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.180 
is a great project you can put a bunch
of<00:04:06.060> different<00:04:06.450> shapes<00:04:07.170> on<00:04:07.410> here<00:04:07.710> and<00:04:07.890> fill<00:04:08.100> it

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
of different shapes on here and fill it

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.650
