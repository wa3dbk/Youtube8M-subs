00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello here he is me on a beer cook 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.460
 yes the autumn starts is also one 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.529
 beautiful time 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.099
 Luckily today, the weather seems too 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.139
 the tardiness weather we do 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.039
 course , of course, and fits 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:21.300
 salad for salads from my raised bed 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:23.630
 self- grown little appetizers like 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.630
 it works 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.879
 yes , we have ourselves for our partners 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.220
 of course, do not need it yet 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.260
 I have mushrooms few herbs 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.640
 rosemary and thyme in field salad 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.350
 of course first washed 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.540
 Here I have a strange thesing that 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.110
 fits the link very well like that 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.780
 is done 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.610
 We would have something down below right now 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.050
 you walk moment because look how it 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.239
 going 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.250
 salt pepper of course a bit 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.760
 Pumpkin seed hazelnuts also become whole 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.700
 nice and a drop and first the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.830
 cleaning mushrooms 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.630
 without water behind a few cloth slightly 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.590
 be humid if that little bit more time 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.820
 have prepared her just from 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.840
 otherwise nothing else can get you 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.180
 simply bad advice 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.380
 that means only better that is easy 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.380
 just not good 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.400
 Put some olive oil in the pan 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.170
 the champignons i stop beer now 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.170
 times 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.579
 herbs to my tournament 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.260
 pepper slightly 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.509
 You can also salt them if you are now 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.130
 even this amount makes therefore 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.409
 usually salt team better 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.280
 later with this small length is that 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.280
 not so important now 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.509
 fry the snake 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.509
 let's go once 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.390
 lost the game goes on, of course, 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:27.400
 betrayed well are then shall 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:27.400
 look beautiful color season with salt 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.550
 then pumpkin seeds corner easily 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.650
 we roast him very easily 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.740
 I do now ever so ahead 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.430
 towards the rest we use 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:46.600
 easy both to bite the 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.600
 pumpkin seeds as well as even 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.580
 franchising 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.920
 Italy 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:23.690
 Whenever courts generally do always 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:28.250
 and just the 357 is always better 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:31.040
 out of those with just 24 you would have 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.360
 now with slight cross thats too 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.870
 not in any culture at all 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:42.130
 desired sugar simply washed and 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.130
 the small root has been pulled out 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.800
 yet again with the once again 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.800
 so we better get him in here 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.950
 st 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.480
 I must expose a bit 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.480
 looks 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.060
 No 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.110
 you give the most beautiful pumpkin cent 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.670
 costs on it 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:17.400
 finished is a very simple one 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:19.350
 appetizer super delicious tor he asks 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.630
