mind<00:02:04.280> and<00:02:04.640> soul<00:02:05.000> in<00:02:05.240> conjunction<00:02:05.960> so<00:02:06.860> first<00:02:07.070> I

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
mind and soul in conjunction so first I

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.620 
mind and soul in conjunction so first I
just<00:02:07.340> took<00:02:07.430> that<00:02:07.490> shade<00:02:07.909> from<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.360> mind

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
just took that shade from the mind

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.210 
just took that shade from the mind
palette<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:09.290> just<00:02:09.410> put<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.619> right<00:02:09.649> into<00:02:09.950> the

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
palette and just put it right into the

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.400 
palette and just put it right into the
crease<00:02:10.519> I'm<00:02:10.790> using<00:02:11.239> my<00:02:11.450> Jessup<00:02:11.840> crease<00:02:12.140> brush

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
crease I'm using my Jessup crease brush

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.380 
crease I'm using my Jessup crease brush
and<00:02:12.709> I<00:02:13.250> kind<00:02:13.430> of<00:02:13.489> forgot<00:02:13.820> to<00:02:14.000> put<00:02:14.180> shadow

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
and I kind of forgot to put shadow

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.759 
and I kind of forgot to put shadow
shields<00:02:14.750> in<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:14.930> first<00:02:15.140> place<00:02:15.320> so<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:15.530> just

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
shields in the first place so I just

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.680 
shields in the first place so I just
added<00:02:15.980> those<00:02:16.250> right<00:02:16.430> on<00:02:16.580> there

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
added those right on there

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.750 
added those right on there

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
Browns in the crease I found just really

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.390 
Browns in the crease I found just really
gave<00:02:32.390> it<00:02:32.540> some<00:02:32.690> nice<00:02:32.810> dimension<00:02:33.410> so<00:02:33.680> taking
