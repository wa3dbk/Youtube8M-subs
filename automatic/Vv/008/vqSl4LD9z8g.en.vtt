making it either way you'll need to cut

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.200 
making it either way you'll need to cut
the<00:00:41.949> sheets<00:00:42.219> to<00:00:42.370> the<00:00:42.460> size<00:00:42.699> that<00:00:42.730> you<00:00:42.969> like

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
the sheets to the size that you like

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.509 
the sheets to the size that you like
I<00:00:43.510> find<00:00:44.050> the<00:00:44.109> sheets<00:00:44.379> the<00:00:44.589> size<00:00:44.829> about<00:00:45.249> a

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
I find the sheets the size about a

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.299 
I find the sheets the size about a
quarter<00:00:46.390> to<00:00:46.629> be<00:00:46.659> perfect<00:00:47.170> now<00:00:48.010> you<00:00:48.039> can<00:00:48.190> also

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
quarter to be perfect now you can also

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.279 
quarter to be perfect now you can also
use<00:00:48.579> gun<00:00:48.819> cotton<00:00:49.269> but<00:00:49.659> it<00:00:49.749> takes<00:00:49.899> a<00:00:50.019> lot<00:00:50.109> longer

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
use gun cotton but it takes a lot longer

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.530 
use gun cotton but it takes a lot longer
to<00:00:50.469> dry

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.660 

okay<00:00:54.570> after<00:00:55.380> the<00:00:55.500> sheets<00:00:55.710> are<00:00:55.860> cut<00:00:56.070> you'll

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
okay after the sheets are cut you'll

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.610 
okay after the sheets are cut you'll
need<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.000> dunk<00:00:57.240> them<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.750> let<00:00:57.990> them<00:00:58.170> soak<00:00:58.440> in

boric<00:02:14.010> acid<00:02:14.300> this<00:02:15.300> is<00:02:15.450> also<00:02:15.810> when<00:02:15.959> I<00:02:16.050> use<00:02:16.290> a

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
boric acid this is also when I use a

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.170 
boric acid this is also when I use a

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
the boric acid dissolved you'll notice

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.490 
the boric acid dissolved you'll notice
that<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.090> does<00:02:21.269> not<00:02:21.450> burn<00:02:21.690> as<00:02:21.900> clean<00:02:22.260> as

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
that it does not burn as clean as

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
acid of all the compounds this was the

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:35.150 
acid of all the compounds this was the
worst<00:02:27.780> at<00:02:27.959> leaving<00:02:28.230> sit<00:02:28.500> behind

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.610 

because<00:02:35.850> of<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.090> suit<00:02:36.330> left<00:02:36.540> by<00:02:36.720> boric<00:02:37.020> acid<00:02:37.170> I

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
because of the suit left by boric acid I

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.470 
because of the suit left by boric acid I
thought<00:02:37.830> I'd<00:02:37.950> try<00:02:38.250> getting<00:02:38.700> green<00:02:39.000> another

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
thought I'd try getting green another

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.470 
thought I'd try getting green another
way<00:02:39.720> by<00:02:40.050> using<00:02:40.230> copper<00:02:40.770> chloride<00:02:41.250> this<00:02:42.150> burned

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
way by using copper chloride this burned

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.850 
way by using copper chloride this burned
much<00:02:42.750> cleaner<00:02:43.110> though<00:02:43.590> gave<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:43.890> lighter<00:02:44.250> green

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
much cleaner though gave a lighter green

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.920 
much cleaner though gave a lighter green
to<00:02:46.860> get<00:02:46.980> purple<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.550> used<00:02:47.760> potassium<00:02:48.510> nitrate

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
to get purple I used potassium nitrate

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.930 
to get purple I used potassium nitrate
this<00:02:49.500> gives<00:02:49.770> a<00:02:49.890> really<00:02:49.920> nice<00:02:50.250> purple<00:02:50.640> that

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
this gives a really nice purple that

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.730 
this gives a really nice purple that
unfortunately<00:02:51.570> my<00:02:51.720> camera<00:02:52.080> doesn't<00:02:52.290> do<00:02:52.500> very

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
unfortunately my camera doesn't do very

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.830 
unfortunately my camera doesn't do very
good<00:02:52.770> Jolla<00:02:53.100> picking<00:02:53.490> up<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:54.420> looks<00:02:54.600> much

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
good Jolla picking up it looks much

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.960 
good Jolla picking up it looks much
better<00:02:55.050> in<00:02:55.200> person<00:02:55.680> if<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.580> water<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:56.940> too

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
better in person if the water is too

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.030 
better in person if the water is too
saturated<00:02:57.360> potassium<00:02:57.840> nitrate<00:02:58.770> when<00:02:58.950> you

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
saturated potassium nitrate when you

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.340 
saturated potassium nitrate when you
soak<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.460> paper<00:02:59.640> I<00:03:00.060> find<00:03:00.630> it<00:03:00.780> becomes<00:03:01.080> very

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
soak the paper I find it becomes very

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.400 
soak the paper I find it becomes very
difficult<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:02.100> light<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.460> paper

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
difficult to light the paper

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.870 
difficult to light the paper
I<00:03:04.500> should<00:03:05.040> also<00:03:05.160> note<00:03:05.460> that<00:03:05.490> potassium

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
I should also note that potassium

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.970 
I should also note that potassium
chloride<00:03:06.450> also<00:03:06.840> gives<00:03:07.020> a<00:03:07.110> nice<00:03:07.290> purple<00:03:07.590> and

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
chloride also gives a nice purple and

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:17.720 
chloride also gives a nice purple and
even<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.370> cleaner<00:03:08.610> burn

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.190 

for<00:03:20.740> blue<00:03:20.950> I<00:03:20.980> used<00:03:21.370> copper<00:03:21.880> ammonium<00:03:22.390> chloride

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
for blue I used copper ammonium chloride

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.330 
for blue I used copper ammonium chloride
I<00:03:23.230> say<00:03:24.040> blue<00:03:24.370> it's<00:03:24.790> really<00:03:25.060> closer<00:03:25.300> to<00:03:25.540> teal

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
I say blue it's really closer to teal

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.000 
I say blue it's really closer to teal

most of the literature I was reading

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.600

by the way if you were wondering while

by the way if you were wondering while
the<00:03:48.650> image<00:03:48.950> is<00:03:49.099> so<00:03:49.250> dark<00:03:49.519> I<00:03:49.730> had<00:03:49.879> to<00:03:49.970> really

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
the image is so dark I had to really

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.479 
the image is so dark I had to really
mess<00:03:50.390> with<00:03:50.569> the<00:03:50.659> camera<00:03:50.930> settings<00:03:51.470> to<00:03:52.250> get<00:03:52.400> it

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
mess with the camera settings to get it

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.449 
mess with the camera settings to get it

to capture the color that being said the

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.399 
to capture the color that being said the
colors<00:03:55.760> are<00:03:55.939> much<00:03:56.090> more<00:03:56.329> vibrant<00:03:56.959> than<00:03:57.230> when<00:03:57.379> I

00:03:57.399 --> 00:03:57.409 
colors are much more vibrant than when I

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:07.360 
colors are much more vibrant than when I
can<00:03:57.620> get<00:03:57.709> my<00:03:57.890> camera<00:03:58.280> to<00:03:58.400> actually<00:03:58.489> show<00:03:58.909> here

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.170 

I<00:04:07.430> saved<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.330> best<00:04:08.480> color<00:04:08.840> red<00:04:09.409> for<00:04:09.980> last<00:04:10.190> of

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
I saved the best color red for last of

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.539 
I saved the best color red for last of
course<00:04:11.390> it's<00:04:11.599> just<00:04:11.659> strontium<00:04:12.290> nitrate<00:04:12.549> this

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
course it's just strontium nitrate this

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.399 
course it's just strontium nitrate this
produced<00:04:13.940> the<00:04:14.120> most<00:04:14.330> striking<00:04:14.690> color<00:04:15.080> of<00:04:15.290> all

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:15.409 
produced the most striking color of all

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:17.890 
produced the most striking color of all
the<00:04:15.440> compounds<00:04:16.160> it<00:04:17.090> was<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.359> only<00:04:17.479> color<00:04:17.780> I

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
the compounds it was the only color I

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.900 
the compounds it was the only color I
could<00:04:18.049> shoot<00:04:18.440> actually<00:04:19.010> using<00:04:19.430> it<00:04:19.519> it's<00:04:19.669> flash

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
could shoot actually using it it's flash

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.810 
could shoot actually using it it's flash
paper<00:04:20.209> and<00:04:20.630> my<00:04:20.720> camera<00:04:21.109> would<00:04:21.229> pick<00:04:21.380> it<00:04:21.530> up<00:04:21.820> if

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
paper and my camera would pick it up if

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.760 
paper and my camera would pick it up if
you<00:04:23.000> only<00:04:23.150> try<00:04:23.510> one<00:04:23.810> of<00:04:23.840> these<00:04:24.020> Tom<00:04:24.290> pounds<00:04:24.650> I

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
you only try one of these Tom pounds I

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:34.900 
you only try one of these Tom pounds I
would<00:04:24.830> highly<00:04:25.220> recommend<00:04:25.280> this<00:04:26.240> one

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.820

okay one more thing you can do cut the

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.969 
okay one more thing you can do cut the
flash<00:04:39.830> paper<00:04:40.069> into<00:04:40.460> long<00:04:40.669> strips<00:04:41.199> then<00:04:42.199> dip

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
flash paper into long strips then dip

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:44.770 
flash paper into long strips then dip
the<00:04:43.190> strip's<00:04:43.520> halfway<00:04:44.120> in<00:04:44.360> one<00:04:44.569> of<00:04:44.690> the

solutions<00:04:45.379> and<00:04:46.009> let<00:04:46.220> it<00:04:46.340> sit<00:04:46.580> for<00:04:46.610> a<00:04:46.819> few

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:46.849 
solutions and let it sit for a few

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:51.219 
solutions and let it sit for a few
minutes<00:04:47.440> then<00:04:48.440> let<00:04:48.590> it<00:04:48.650> dry<00:04:48.919> and<00:04:49.310> then<00:04:50.050> dip<00:04:51.050> the

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
other half in a different solution this

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.730 
other half in a different solution this
will<00:04:54.050> give<00:04:54.199> you<00:04:54.379> multicolored<00:04:55.190> flash<00:04:55.490> paper
