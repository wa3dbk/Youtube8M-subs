pouch which i wouldn't use on a daily

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.460 
pouch which i wouldn't use on a daily
basis<00:03:17.120> because<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:17.690> glasses<00:03:18.020> don't<00:03:18.170> really

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
basis because the glasses don't really

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.590 
basis because the glasses don't really
fit<00:03:18.680> in<00:03:18.830> there<00:03:19.010> you<00:03:19.670> have<00:03:19.790> to<00:03:19.850> force<00:03:20.240> the<00:03:20.420> mean

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
fit in there you have to force the mean

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.350 
fit in there you have to force the mean
and<00:03:20.930> it's<00:03:21.170> not<00:03:21.410> an<00:03:21.560> easy<00:03:21.680> process<00:03:22.040> to<00:03:22.550> be

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
and it's not an easy process to be

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.670
