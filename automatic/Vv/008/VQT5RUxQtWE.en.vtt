with<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.079> probe<00:01:52.259> still<00:01:52.439> coming<00:01:52.710> out<00:01:52.799> at<00:01:52.920> crank

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
with the probe still coming out at crank

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.670 
with the probe still coming out at crank
side<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.060> map<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.450> think<00:01:55.140> it's<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.320> proxy

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
side of the map I think it's the proxy

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.190 
side of the map I think it's the proxy
stalkers<00:01:56.130> yeah<00:01:56.520> yeah<00:01:56.850> it's<00:01:57.540> what<00:01:57.750> he<00:01:57.810> did<00:01:57.990> to

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
stalkers yeah yeah it's what he did to

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.760 
stalkers yeah yeah it's what he did to
knock<00:01:58.500> out<00:01:58.680> um<00:01:59.030> hawk<00:02:00.030> from<00:02:00.479> WCS<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.320> believe<00:02:01.530> oh

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
knock out um hawk from WCS I believe oh

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.069 
knock out um hawk from WCS I believe oh
my<00:02:02.130> god<00:02:02.509> it's<00:02:03.509> how<00:02:03.719> he<00:02:03.780> failed<00:02:04.380> 02<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.460> oh<00:02:06.299> well

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
my god it's how he failed 02 and oh well

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.580 
my god it's how he failed 02 and oh well
that's<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.799> it's<00:02:08.039> done<00:02:08.479> puck<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.780> going<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.500> be

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
that's it it's done puck is going to be

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.520 
that's it it's done puck is going to be
able<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.800> hold<00:02:10.979> this<00:02:11.190> off<00:02:11.459> with<00:02:11.849> ease<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:13.170> mean

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
able to hold this off with ease I mean

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.820 
able to hold this off with ease I mean
yeah<00:02:13.680> gateways<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.520> exact<00:02:14.910> same<00:02:15.120> timing

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
yeah gateways of the exact same timing

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.800 
yeah gateways of the exact same timing
puck<00:02:16.830> is<00:02:17.040> just<00:02:17.250> going<00:02:17.490> to<00:02:17.640> not<00:02:18.030> build<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.480> second

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
puck is just going to not build a second

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.690 
puck is just going to not build a second
a<00:02:18.870> simulator<00:02:19.230> we<00:02:19.860> see<00:02:20.069> there's<00:02:20.280> gateway

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
a simulator we see there's gateway

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.580 
a simulator we see there's gateway
number<00:02:20.940> 24<00:02:21.270> crank<00:02:21.540> puck<00:02:21.810> can<00:02:21.990> easily<00:02:22.230> respond

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
number 24 crank puck can easily respond

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.730 
number 24 crank puck can easily respond
by<00:02:22.709> building<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.069> second<00:02:23.459> gateway<00:02:23.610> himself<00:02:24.120> and

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
by building a second gateway himself and

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.530 
by building a second gateway himself and
easily<00:02:25.740> he'll<00:02:25.920> do<00:02:26.100> so<00:02:26.340> I<00:02:26.550> mean<00:02:26.760> there's<00:02:27.120> such<00:02:27.510> a

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
easily he'll do so I mean there's such a

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.449 
easily he'll do so I mean there's such a
buffer<00:02:28.080> in<00:02:28.200> time<00:02:28.440> between<00:02:28.650> these<00:02:28.890> two<00:02:29.069> bases

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
buffer in time between these two bases

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.390 
buffer in time between these two bases
he's<00:02:30.090> mining<00:02:30.630> 33<00:02:31.230> off<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.590> gas<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:31.830> honestly

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
he's mining 33 off the gas and honestly

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.130 
he's mining 33 off the gas and honestly
it<00:02:32.550> needs<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.819> stop<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:33.600> can<00:02:33.750> leave<00:02:33.870> like

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
it needs to stop that you can leave like

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.309 
it needs to stop that you can leave like
14<00:02:34.590> open<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.860> gas<00:02:35.010> that's<00:02:35.370> fine<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.319> pucks

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
14 open the gas that's fine and pucks

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.020 
14 open the gas that's fine and pucks
gonna<00:02:37.590> take<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:37.860> risk<00:02:38.160> here<00:02:38.400> puck<00:02:38.610> says<00:02:38.850> you

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
gonna take a risk here puck says you

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.110 
gonna take a risk here puck says you
know<00:02:39.120> what<00:02:39.300> those<00:02:39.480> gateways<00:02:39.720> are<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.200> far<00:02:40.470> away

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
know what those gateways are so far away

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.220 
know what those gateways are so far away
they<00:02:42.120> can<00:02:42.270> gateways<00:02:42.540> built<00:02:42.780> at<00:02:42.930> such<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.140> weird

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
they can gateways built at such a weird

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.990 
they can gateways built at such a weird
time<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.010> think<00:02:44.280> yep<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.670> there<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:44.880> is

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
time that I think yep and there it is

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.580 
time that I think yep and there it is
the<00:02:45.150> Cyrus<00:02:45.420> court<00:02:45.600> does<00:02:45.750> get<00:02:45.900> scouted<00:02:46.110> so<00:02:46.410> puck

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
the Cyrus court does get scouted so puck

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.949 
the Cyrus court does get scouted so puck
knows<00:02:46.800> what's<00:02:46.980> coming<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.430> puck<00:02:48.420> says<00:02:48.630> okay

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
knows what's coming and puck says okay

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.320 
knows what's coming and puck says okay
oh<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.500> had<00:02:49.950> my<00:02:50.100> second<00:02:50.430> gateway<00:02:50.580> certainly<00:02:51.090> but

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
oh I had my second gateway certainly but

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.890 
oh I had my second gateway certainly but
not<00:02:51.510> not<00:02:52.320> before<00:02:52.590> my<00:02:52.680> summer<00:02:52.860> squirt<00:02:53.160> oh<00:02:53.900> geez

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
not not before my summer squirt oh geez

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.490 
not not before my summer squirt oh geez
oh<00:02:55.440> god<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:56.730> just<00:02:57.090> so<00:02:57.360> stressful<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:58.110> wash<00:02:58.290> this

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
oh god is just so stressful to wash this

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.020 
oh god is just so stressful to wash this
right<00:02:58.739> now<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:58.980> mean<00:02:59.130> it's<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.310> very<00:02:59.459> exacting

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
right now I mean it's a very exacting

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.530 
right now I mean it's a very exacting
build<00:03:00.269> crank<00:03:00.660> halted<00:03:01.470> at<00:03:01.560> 14<00:03:02.160> of<00:03:02.340> 18<00:03:02.550> is<00:03:03.090> gonna

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
build crank halted at 14 of 18 is gonna

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.470 
build crank halted at 14 of 18 is gonna
build<00:03:03.780> two<00:03:04.050> stalkers<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:04.860> then<00:03:05.730> building<00:03:06.120> sex

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
build two stalkers and then building sex

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.590 
build two stalkers and then building sex
pylon<00:03:07.080> yeah<00:03:07.620> I<00:03:07.650> mean<00:03:08.010> it's<00:03:08.069> a<00:03:08.370> very<00:03:08.600> very

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
pylon yeah I mean it's a very very

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.199 
pylon yeah I mean it's a very very
thinly<00:03:10.290> timed<00:03:10.890> build<00:03:11.280> that<00:03:11.670> can<00:03:11.970> backfire

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
thinly timed build that can backfire

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.750 
thinly timed build that can backfire
very<00:03:12.780> very<00:03:12.989> hard<00:03:13.230> we<00:03:13.440> see<00:03:13.650> puck<00:03:13.980> Crona

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
very very hard we see puck Crona

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.520 
very very hard we see puck Crona
boosting<00:03:15.180> out<00:03:15.300> of<00:03:15.420> mothership<00:03:15.900> core<00:03:16.140> it's

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
boosting out of mothership core it's

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.080 
boosting out of mothership core it's
gonna<00:03:16.680> be<00:03:16.860> very<00:03:17.040> close<00:03:17.310> is<00:03:17.549> actually<00:03:17.880> gonna<00:03:18.000> go

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
gonna be very close is actually gonna go

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.310 
gonna be very close is actually gonna go
for<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.420> second<00:03:18.989> zealot<00:03:19.500> I<00:03:20.239> think<00:03:21.239> POC<00:03:21.750> should

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
for a second zealot I think POC should

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.170 
for a second zealot I think POC should
be<00:03:22.500> okay<00:03:22.860> especially<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.519> third<00:03:23.790> gateway

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
be okay especially the third gateway

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.569 
be okay especially the third gateway
coming<00:03:24.540> down<00:03:24.720> yeah<00:03:25.320> he's<00:03:25.860> gonna<00:03:26.070> make<00:03:26.250> a<00:03:26.310> sell

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
coming down yeah he's gonna make a sell

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.660 
coming down yeah he's gonna make a sell
out<00:03:26.670> here<00:03:26.820> as<00:03:26.940> well<00:03:27.680> this<00:03:28.680> pylon<00:03:29.220> at<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.459> top

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
out here as well this pylon at the top

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.789 
out here as well this pylon at the top
of<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.880> ramp<00:03:30.030> from<00:03:30.660> crank<00:03:31.019> is<00:03:31.200> so<00:03:31.350> that<00:03:31.500> he<00:03:31.650> can

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
of the ramp from crank is so that he can

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.680 
of the ramp from crank is so that he can
have<00:03:31.980> high<00:03:32.310> ground<00:03:32.640> vision<00:03:33.030> he<00:03:33.180> needs<00:03:33.360> to<00:03:33.540> run

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
have high ground vision he needs to run

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.630 
have high ground vision he needs to run
away<00:03:33.930> from<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.170> mothership<00:03:34.530> core<00:03:34.680> for<00:03:35.430> now

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
away from the mothership core for now

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.460 
away from the mothership core for now
but<00:03:36.390> if<00:03:36.450> he<00:03:36.600> doesn't<00:03:36.810> have<00:03:37.079> high<00:03:37.230> ground

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
but if he doesn't have high ground

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.560

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
earlier on it's such a tight bill that

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.120 
earlier on it's such a tight bill that
basically<00:04:53.690> even<00:04:54.690> just<00:04:55.050> that<00:04:55.110> pylon<00:04:55.710> going

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
basically even just that pylon going

ramp which it looks like we'll have to

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.130 
ramp which it looks like we'll have to
wait<00:05:06.240> and<00:05:06.300> see<00:05:06.450> if<00:05:06.540> that<00:05:06.630> is<00:05:06.840> going<00:05:07.020> to<00:05:07.080> be

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
wait and see if that is going to be

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.440 
wait and see if that is going to be
possible<00:05:07.680> then<00:05:08.400> all<00:05:08.520> of<00:05:08.550> a<00:05:08.700> sudden<00:05:08.730> crank<00:05:09.300> is

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
possible then all of a sudden crank is

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.880 
possible then all of a sudden crank is
in<00:05:09.600> in<00:05:09.750> damn<00:05:10.110> near<00:05:10.140> an<00:05:10.380> unwinnable<00:05:10.710> position
