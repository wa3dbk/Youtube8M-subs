this<00:00:11.150> will<00:00:11.420> be<00:00:11.570> for<00:00:11.840> the<00:00:12.160> basic<00:00:13.160> track<00:00:13.430> work

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
this will be for the basic track work

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.080 
this will be for the basic track work
for<00:00:14.000> a<00:00:14.030> first<00:00:14.420> level<00:00:15.340> this<00:00:16.340> is<00:00:16.400> for<00:00:16.730> the<00:00:16.820> first

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
for a first level this is for the first

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.690 
for a first level this is for the first
level<00:00:17.540> of<00:00:17.630> our<00:00:17.840> trains<00:00:18.140> this<00:00:19.070> will<00:00:19.250> give<00:00:19.400> us<00:00:19.430> a

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
level of our trains this will give us a

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.760 
level of our trains this will give us a
wider<00:00:19.970> radius<00:00:20.300> this<00:00:20.869> gives<00:00:21.140> us<00:00:21.320> all<00:00:21.500> the

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
wider radius this gives us all the

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.580 
wider radius this gives us all the
radiuses<00:00:22.310> that<00:00:22.520> we<00:00:22.700> need<00:00:22.910> to<00:00:23.599> do<00:00:24.230> the<00:00:24.410> first

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
radiuses that we need to do the first

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.340 
radiuses that we need to do the first
level<00:00:25.070> and<00:00:25.820> what<00:00:26.119> I'm<00:00:26.270> doing<00:00:26.300> is<00:00:26.660> I<00:00:26.869> just<00:00:26.930> tack

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.350 
level and what I'm doing is I just tack

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.099 
level and what I'm doing is I just tack
it<00:00:27.560> in<00:00:27.680> place<00:00:27.710> and<00:00:28.400> then<00:00:29.150> we<00:00:29.270> come<00:00:29.510> back<00:00:29.539> and<00:00:29.779> do

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
it in place and then we come back and do

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.439 
it in place and then we come back and do
the<00:00:30.289> major<00:00:30.529> Corrections<00:00:31.220> afterwards<00:00:31.789> this

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:32.449 
the major Corrections afterwards this

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:39.220 
the major Corrections afterwards this
will<00:00:32.660> give<00:00:32.809> us<00:00:36.340> to<00:00:37.340> support<00:00:37.699> our<00:00:37.879> track<00:00:38.180> and<00:00:38.480> if

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
will give us to support our track and if

getting to our corners and our radiuses

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.890 
getting to our corners and our radiuses
and<00:01:19.310> it'll<00:01:19.460> bring<00:01:19.640> us<00:01:19.820> around<00:01:20.120> okay<00:01:20.840> you

notice there now to expand our drop

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.940 
notice there now to expand our drop
areas<00:01:23.060> because<00:01:23.870> this<00:01:24.050> will<00:01:24.200> cut<00:01:24.410> out<00:01:24.560> later<00:01:24.830> on

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
areas because this will cut out later on

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.490 
areas because this will cut out later on
as<00:01:25.250> we<00:01:25.400> build<00:01:25.640> our<00:01:25.850> bridges<00:01:26.090> and<00:01:26.690> we<00:01:27.080> build<00:01:27.320> our

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.399 
you can actually work them gives you
accurate<00:01:57.860> accurate<00:01:58.820> measurements<00:01:59.360> and<00:02:00.140> as

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
accurate accurate measurements and as

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.380 
accurate accurate measurements and as
we're<00:02:00.650> putting<00:02:00.920> on<00:02:01.070> fillers<00:02:01.430> in<00:02:01.610> this<00:02:02.240> is

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
we're putting on fillers in this is

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.270 
we're putting on fillers in this is
going<00:02:02.600> to<00:02:02.659> be<00:02:02.750> for<00:02:02.990> our<00:02:03.080> double<00:02:03.500> back<00:02:03.710> dog<00:02:04.010> bone

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
going to be for our double back dog bone

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.630 
going to be for our double back dog bone
this<00:02:05.060> is<00:02:05.270> our<00:02:05.420> first<00:02:05.720> layer<00:02:06.040> and<00:02:07.040> from<00:02:07.250> here<00:02:07.520> we

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
this is our first layer and from here we

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.630 
this is our first layer and from here we
build<00:02:07.909> up<00:02:08.090> but<00:02:08.959> you<00:02:09.229> need<00:02:09.409> to<00:02:09.530> have<00:02:09.709> a<00:02:10.009> wider

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
build up but you need to have a wider

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.330 
build up but you need to have a wider
space<00:02:11.120> in<00:02:11.450> order<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:11.930> support<00:02:12.409> your<00:02:13.010> next

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
space in order to support your next

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.759 
space in order to support your next
layers<00:02:13.580> that's<00:02:14.209> why<00:02:14.450> I<00:02:14.480> went<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.200> eight<00:02:15.620> or

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
layers that's why I went to eight or

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.589 
layers that's why I went to eight or
nine<00:02:15.950> inches<00:02:16.310> because<00:02:16.549> your<00:02:16.879> first<00:02:17.060> track<00:02:17.390> is

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
nine inches because your first track is

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:18.940 
nine inches because your first track is
going<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.840> need<00:02:18.170> four<00:02:18.440> four<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:18.830> a<00:02:18.920> half

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
going to need four four and a half

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.220 
going to need four four and a half
inches<00:02:19.430> for<00:02:19.670> your<00:02:19.790> first<00:02:20.000> track<00:02:20.330> this<00:02:21.050> will

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
inches for your first track this will

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.059 
inches for your first track this will
give<00:02:21.380> you<00:02:21.470> enough

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
give you enough

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.949 
give you enough
we<00:02:22.159> have<00:02:22.310> for<00:02:22.609> you<00:02:22.700> before<00:02:23.030> your<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.599> lay<00:02:23.780> your

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
we have for you before your to lay your

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.920 
we have for you before your to lay your
track<00:02:24.260> we<00:02:25.099> got<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.489> a<00:02:25.519> point<00:02:25.819> where<00:02:26.749> we're

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
track we got to a point where we're

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.619 
track we got to a point where we're
starting<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.319> make<00:02:27.530> our<00:02:28.150> different<00:02:29.150> radiuses

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
starting to make our different radiuses

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.959 
starting to make our different radiuses
we<00:02:29.900> have<00:02:29.989> to<00:02:30.139> make<00:02:30.290> them<00:02:30.439> combine<00:02:30.829> so<00:02:31.459> what<00:02:31.879> we

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:31.969 
we have to make them combine so what we

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:34.030 
we have to make them combine so what we
do<00:02:32.150> is<00:02:32.329> we<00:02:32.510> make<00:02:32.689> our<00:02:32.840> radius<00:02:33.230> as<00:02:33.379> we<00:02:33.560> overlap

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
do is we make our radius as we overlap

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.489 
do is we make our radius as we overlap
if<00:02:34.609> we<00:02:34.790> want<00:02:34.999> a<00:02:35.060> little<00:02:35.299> switchback<00:02:36.200> or<00:02:36.469> a

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:36.499 
if we want a little switchback or a

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:38.619 
if we want a little switchback or a
little<00:02:36.950> scale<00:02:37.189> in<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.519> road<00:02:37.700> we<00:02:38.239> actually

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
little scale in the road we actually

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.360 
little scale in the road we actually
make<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.959> plywood<00:02:39.409> a<00:02:39.439> little<00:02:39.799> wider<00:02:40.010> in<00:02:40.219> that

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
make the plywood a little wider in that

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.640 
make the plywood a little wider in that
space<00:02:40.700> this<00:02:41.389> gives<00:02:41.719> us<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:42.019> chance<00:02:42.200> to<00:02:42.379> make<00:02:42.500> a

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
space this gives us a chance to make a

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.849 
space this gives us a chance to make a
little<00:02:42.859> less<00:02:43.069> curb<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:44.000> fill<00:02:44.269> in<00:02:44.450> this<00:02:44.659> and<00:02:45.260> it

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
little less curb to fill in this and it

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.619 
little less curb to fill in this and it
also<00:02:46.010> puts<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.459> little<00:02:46.609> bit<00:02:46.700> more<00:02:46.790> detail<00:02:47.329> in<00:02:47.540> a

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
also puts a little bit more detail in a

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.830 
also puts a little bit more detail in a
layout<00:02:47.950> next<00:02:48.950> part<00:02:49.400> of<00:02:49.489> this<00:02:49.639> assembly<00:02:50.209> is<00:02:50.239> is

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
layout next part of this assembly is is

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.569 
layout next part of this assembly is is
I've<00:02:51.109> got<00:02:51.319> to<00:02:51.409> make<00:02:51.560> a<00:02:51.590> section<00:02:52.069> that'll<00:02:52.370> come

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
I've got to make a section that'll come

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.909 
I've got to make a section that'll come
off<00:02:52.609> the<00:02:52.969> mainline<00:02:53.389> and<00:02:53.749> go<00:02:54.290> into<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.709> town

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:54.919 
off the mainline and go into the town

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:57.789 
off the mainline and go into the town
for<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.340> industry<00:02:55.879> and<00:02:56.299> for<00:02:56.989> that<00:02:57.139> so<00:02:57.409> as<00:02:57.620> we

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
for the industry and for that so as we

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.129 
for the industry and for that so as we
come<00:02:58.010> as<00:02:58.219> we<00:02:58.400> go<00:02:58.579> forward<00:02:58.909> I'll<00:02:59.510> put<00:02:59.810> the<00:02:59.900> bench

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:00.139 
come as we go forward I'll put the bench

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:02.860 
come as we go forward I'll put the bench
work<00:03:00.409> in<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:01.430> flat<00:03:01.849> sections<00:03:02.329> in<00:03:02.480> that<00:03:02.689> that

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
work in the flat sections in that that

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.349 
work in the flat sections in that that
would<00:03:03.079> actually<00:03:03.230> support<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:04.730> then<00:03:04.939> once<00:03:05.209> we

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
would actually support and then once we

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.020 
would actually support and then once we
get<00:03:05.569> to<00:03:05.719> that<00:03:05.840> part<00:03:06.139> that<00:03:06.469> can<00:03:07.280> be<00:03:07.430> deccan<00:03:07.790> me

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
get to that part that can be deccan me

get to that part that can be deccan me
the<00:03:08.419> stationary<00:03:09.049> do<00:03:09.199> we<00:03:09.319> actually<00:03:09.680> start

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:09.949 
the stationary do we actually start

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:12.280 
the stationary do we actually start
building<00:03:10.219> the<00:03:11.090> rest<00:03:11.480> of<00:03:11.659> our<00:03:11.810> town<00:03:12.049> and

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
building the rest of our town and

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.550 
building the rest of our town and

can be filled in as you go and what

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.170 
can be filled in as you go and what
you're<00:03:21.260> doing<00:03:21.439> your<00:03:21.560> track<00:03:21.769> with<00:03:22.040> so<00:03:22.669> you're

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
you're doing your track with so you're

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.999 
you're doing your track with so you're
getting<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.599> basic<00:03:24.019> in<00:03:24.459> it<00:03:25.459> is<00:03:26.530> it's<00:03:27.530> kind<00:03:27.799> not

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:28.009 
getting the basic in it is it's kind not

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:32.890 
getting the basic in it is it's kind not
critical<00:03:28.639> but<00:03:28.669> it<00:03:29.509> makes<00:03:29.750> it<00:03:31.479> it<00:03:32.479> gives<00:03:32.659> you<00:03:32.780> an

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
critical but it makes it it gives you an

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:41.020 
critical but it makes it it gives you an
idea<00:03:33.049> of<00:03:33.919> what<00:03:34.099> you're<00:03:34.280> doing<00:03:39.790> one<00:03:40.790> of<00:03:40.819> the

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
idea of what you're doing one of the

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.089 
idea of what you're doing one of the
best<00:03:41.269> things<00:03:41.509> I<00:03:41.659> found<00:03:41.959> is<00:03:42.290> that<00:03:42.409> I<00:03:42.620> use<00:03:42.799> type

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
best things I found is that I use type

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.449 
best things I found is that I use type
on<00:03:43.599> trim<00:03:44.599> and<00:03:44.750> molding<00:03:44.780> glue<00:03:45.290> it<00:03:45.979> holds<00:03:46.310> onto
