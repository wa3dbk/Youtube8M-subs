lots of holes in the walls and his

lots of holes in the walls and his
closets<00:00:10.920> go<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.340> new<00:00:11.490> construction<00:00:11.820> mine<00:00:12.389> is

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
closets go and new construction mine is

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.160 
closets go and new construction mine is
pretty<00:00:12.840> small<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:13.969> chose<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.000> stencil<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.900> found

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
pretty small I chose a stencil I found

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.650 
pretty small I chose a stencil I found
on<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.500> Royal<00:00:16.740> Design<00:00:17.130> Studio<00:00:17.580> website<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.510> I

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
on the Royal Design Studio website and I

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.349 
on the Royal Design Studio website and I
decided<00:00:19.050> why<00:00:19.859> not<00:00:19.890> add<00:00:20.310> square<00:00:20.730> footage<00:00:21.150> by

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
decided why not add square footage by

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.990 
decided why not add square footage by
making<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:22.080> glam<00:00:22.380> dressing<00:00:22.890> room<00:00:23.070> so<00:00:23.850> we

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
making it a glam dressing room so we

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.439 
making it a glam dressing room so we
decided<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.449> patch<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.990> walls<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:26.090> I<00:00:27.090> started

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
decided to patch the walls and I started

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.970 
decided to patch the walls and I started
to<00:00:27.570> mix<00:00:27.750> some<00:00:27.960> paint<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.439> already<00:00:28.800> had

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
to mix some paint that I already had

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.800 
to mix some paint that I already had
around<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.369> house<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.939> order<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.570> get<00:00:30.689> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
around the house in order to get the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.840 
around the house in order to get the
effect<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.349> had<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.679> start<00:00:31.980> with<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.219> light<00:00:32.520> wall

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
effect I had to start with a light wall

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.900 
effect I had to start with a light wall
followed<00:00:33.780> by<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:33.989> dark<00:00:34.440> paint<00:00:35.130> over<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.700> top

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
followed by the dark paint over the top

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.229 
followed by the dark paint over the top
I<00:00:36.440> wasn't<00:00:37.440> quite<00:00:37.710> liking<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.430> results<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.210> I

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
I wasn't quite liking the results so I

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.150 
I wasn't quite liking the results so I
kept<00:00:39.540> going<00:00:39.660> back<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.170> my<00:00:40.290> paint<00:00:40.500> lab<00:00:40.710> and

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
kept going back to my paint lab and

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.610 
kept going back to my paint lab and
adding<00:00:41.700> some<00:00:41.910> more<00:00:42.090> shimmer<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:43.410> was

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
adding some more shimmer and this was

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.790 
adding some more shimmer and this was
the<00:00:43.739> final<00:00:44.100> result<00:00:44.250> not<00:00:45.030> what<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.300> wanted<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.930> was

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
the final result not what I wanted I was

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.560 
the final result not what I wanted I was
hoping<00:00:47.190> for<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.430> little<00:00:47.550> more<00:00:47.700> texture<00:00:48.270> and

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
hoping for a little more texture and

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.880 
hoping for a little more texture and
warmth<00:00:49.020> on<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.530> light<00:00:49.800> base<00:00:50.100> coat<00:00:51.890> so

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
warmth on that light base coat so

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.500 
warmth on that light base coat so
instead<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.370> running<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> paint<00:00:54.000> store<00:00:54.090> I

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
instead of running to the paint store I

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.569 
instead of running to the paint store I
ran<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.050> craft<00:00:55.440> store<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:56.219> picked<00:00:56.430> up

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
ran to the craft store and I picked up

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.389 
ran to the craft store and I picked up
some<00:00:56.640> deco<00:00:57.180> art<00:00:57.390> champagne<00:00:58.079> craft<00:00:58.770> paint<00:00:59.129> of

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
some deco art champagne craft paint of

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.729 
some deco art champagne craft paint of
all<00:00:59.579> things<00:00:59.899> applied<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.230> crosshatch

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
all things applied it in a crosshatch

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.009 
all things applied it in a crosshatch
pattern<00:01:01.770> on<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.399> wall<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.600> finally

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
pattern on the wall and this finally

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.770 
pattern on the wall and this finally
gave<00:01:04.260> me<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.530> result<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:04.979> was<00:01:05.100> hoping<00:01:05.159> for

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
gave me the result I was hoping for

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.060 
gave me the result I was hoping for
something<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.110> would<00:01:07.320> be<00:01:07.470> covering<00:01:07.860> up

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
something that I would be covering up

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.289 
something that I would be covering up
anyway<00:01:08.490> with<00:01:08.729> dark<00:01:09.030> paint<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.630> few<00:01:09.840> minutes

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
anyway with dark paint in a few minutes

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.539 
anyway with dark paint in a few minutes
now<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.810> fun<00:01:13.049> part<00:01:13.080> my<00:01:13.920> stencil<00:01:14.340> came

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
now this is the fun part my stencil came

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.609 
now this is the fun part my stencil came
with<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.939> ceiling<00:01:15.330> stencil<00:01:15.780> as<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.229> see<00:01:16.439> up

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
with the ceiling stencil as you see up

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.580 
with the ceiling stencil as you see up
top<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.220> aligned<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.180> Center<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:19.229> kept

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
top I aligned it Center and I kept

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.950 
top I aligned it Center and I kept
repeating<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.310> bigger<00:01:20.520> pattern<00:01:21.030> right<00:01:21.750> and

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
repeating the bigger pattern right and

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.590 
repeating the bigger pattern right and
left<00:01:22.229> until<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.860> was<00:01:23.009> finished<00:01:23.250> using<00:01:24.119> level

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
left until it was finished using level

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.149 
left until it was finished using level
to<00:01:24.689> make<00:01:24.840> sure<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.049> wasn't<00:01:25.470> going<00:01:25.650> up<00:01:25.830> or<00:01:26.130> down

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
to make sure I wasn't going up or down

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.640 
to make sure I wasn't going up or down
hill<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.570> would<00:01:27.720> take<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.080> pattern<00:01:28.470> all

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
hill and I would take the pattern all

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.649 
hill and I would take the pattern all
the<00:01:28.710> way<00:01:28.950> into<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.549> corner<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.150> I'll<00:01:30.479> show

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
the way into the corner and I'll show

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.410 
the way into the corner and I'll show
you<00:01:30.750> how<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.960> do<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.439> just<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.740> few<00:01:31.770> minutes

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
you how to do that in just a few minutes

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.780 
you how to do that in just a few minutes
if<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:34.290> look<00:01:34.470> closely<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:35.130> can<00:01:35.159> see<00:01:35.310> how<00:01:35.729> to

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
if you look closely you can see how to

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.890 
if you look closely you can see how to
align<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.540> pattern<00:01:38.150> to<00:01:39.150> finish<00:01:39.420> along<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
align the pattern to finish along the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.109 
align the pattern to finish along the
ceiling<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.470> left<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.950> half<00:01:41.159> inch<00:01:41.430> gap<00:01:41.520> at<00:01:42.060> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
ceiling I left a half inch gap at the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
going to leave a gap to fill in later
