for<00:01:02.550> yourself<00:01:03.140> right<00:01:04.140> now<00:01:04.170> obviously<00:01:04.890> because

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
for yourself right now obviously because

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
we are using Canon we are going to have

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.760 
we are using Canon we are going to have
to<00:01:08.330> autofocus<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.750> as<00:01:09.900> we<00:01:10.080> press<00:01:10.320> our<00:01:10.530> shutter

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
to autofocus it as we press our shutter

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.679 
to autofocus it as we press our shutter
button<00:01:11.070> during<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.850> video<00:01:12.000> which<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.479> think

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
button during the video which I think

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.270 
button during the video which I think
will<00:01:12.810> definitely<00:01:13.260> make<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.650> big<00:01:13.740> difference

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
will definitely make a big difference

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.520 
will definitely make a big difference
