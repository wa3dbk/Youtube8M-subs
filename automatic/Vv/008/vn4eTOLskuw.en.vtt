00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.049
 Olaf and fierce as today 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:07.759
 we started a very special saga 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.540
 llama captain new build one 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:13.730
 exclusive of fifa world cups 2014 and that 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.410
 better to do with my player that 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.990
 of zero who will play for the selection 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.789
 from Mexico obviously and here we are going to 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.100
 do from scratch is the process of 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.529
 edition and let's see if it can be 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.660
 get to the world cup that we hope 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.910
 that he does it because it's a dream that 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.189
 I can do it was reflected in the fifa 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.290
 world as brasil 2014 that is something that 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.239
 Well, I think we're all excited and 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.219
 It will be exciting you I do not know why you play 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.050
 pitan 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:40.520
 Well, here we are creating my 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.210
 player and today while being a forward 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.579
 is going to be a shooter and good center is going to 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.500
 being a creator is going to be a creator and I'm going to 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.760
 put my stats that are the most 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.949
 similar to me it has 177 conformable 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.660
 averages to normal that we pass a 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.719
 man is called cerecero just like me 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.390
 I was going to the date of birth and also 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.390
 all practices and well let's look 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.610
 the real mode 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.290
 and this is the way that the path that had 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.600
 have to travel through Mexico to reach the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.770
 world cup here small periodicazo 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.080
 with the louse you can say that I 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.610
 needs but then the truth is that 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.140
 We know it's true and you have to try 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.970
 our talent on the court 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.090
 inside the molds we will be able to 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.400
 find the options in this mode of 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.760
 letter in the country because we are going to be able 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.460
 see for example here to the is like this 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.380
 counting is like your ranking within the 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.000
 North selection this and as the 40th place 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.470
 and so many not then and the limits 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.759
 finalists who will attend the 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.890
 purchase of the classic side world and 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.720
 mexico classifies and that you achieve it 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.729
 classify and earn you the confidence of your 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.280
 technically really for this you're going to 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.590
 compete against other players then 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.050
 you have to have good performances this 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.930
 it's my first game against new 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.810
 zealand we have very expected we leave 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:59.020
 until oakland the truth was a very trip 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.060
 very hard and it brings me some memories 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.009
 strangers' play against the new zealand 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.740
 but good is the debut we started with the 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.970
 selection of same as the selection 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.770
 this time we have to have a lot 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.990
 be very careful because we are older 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.820
 you have to go up little by little in 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.080
 this game mode nobody is going to 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.360
 give away anything so we have to 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.640
 demonstrate with our performance here the 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.420
 you have it, you have it, you have zero 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.420
 they were his first move 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:31.680
 I have to be able or it was only you 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.830
 alone alone he opened a lot opened him 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.580
 very much opens the ball here in another 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.240
 move 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.360
 uy but from far away but from far away and 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.980
 very badly we are crushed to the team the 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.620
 truth is that not the simple adaptation 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.680
 here a little bit of control that says the brings 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.900
 the removes it takes a center please 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.060
 uy the forward did not come well but one 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.700
 very good play those last minutes 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.070
 of the first match of 0-0 in the renar 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:04.489
 with mexico who has steals the ball 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.489
 you will be given headquarters will be to throw 88 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:20.530
 the first goal miguel herrera louse and eye 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.959
 have a look brother what a great goal from 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.830
 outside the area and that's the end of the game 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:30.310
 lords 1-0 in favor of mexico in oakland 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.980
 a great match and a goal to be is 0 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.690
 mexico took the victory then 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.580
 against in the game we are going to do 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.739
 our rating and obviously 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.360
 we are fighting the posts with others 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.459
 three players with whom he goes to 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.040
 determine if we keep moving forward in the 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.900
 process or we stayed after that 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.670
 the matches end there will be times 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.260
 in which they have to train like 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.430
 This process will be carried out with 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.100
 the other players because they are 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.019
 competing in this case these passes 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.930
 you can choose the game mode 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.940
 obviously the one that would improve satyrs 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.769
 halts where the central one in this case 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.510
 the countries and companies with 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.360
 committees are also going to be the exercise 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.860
 that you have to try to beat them in the 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.710
 punctuation 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.810
 I as a score is a bit difficult 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.550
 do this exercise because everything in the 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.200
 court is green 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.109
 and the humans are the yellows 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.969
 processing 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.259
 complicated but I really liked that 

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:24.020
 also after training the 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:26.419
 other players equal training 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.520
 from mexico, it's not a shirt 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.039
 generic in the original circuit with the 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.319
 that enters the selection and here we achieve 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:34.789
 make a great score and overcome 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:36.520
 our colleagues with their sections 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:40.000
 complicated 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.470
 so here we are position 43 and 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.919
 we must continue doing to achieve 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.389
 get to position number 23 or be 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.280
 among the 23 selected that goes to 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.909
 attend the world cup in brazil 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.550
 2014 very good and fierce this start of 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:57.310
 this saga let's follow me to my 30 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.590
 virtual which is going to be playing the 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.090
 life and good is the soul to be with the 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.060
 Mexican selection and because the louse 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.310
 Herrera can take it into account and what 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.530
 we will continue through these matches and 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.960
 from this virtual biographical series 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.330
 biographical could nurseries that has been 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.520
 all for that desire heading for the cup of 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.220

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.720
 says them zero and remember sheets of 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.720
