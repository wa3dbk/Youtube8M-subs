hi<00:00:02.320> this<00:00:02.380> is<00:00:02.770> bored<00:00:03.190> FEM<00:00:03.400> and<00:00:03.760> I'm<00:00:04.149> bringing<00:00:04.480> to

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:04.660 
hi this is bored FEM and I'm bringing to

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.320 
hi this is bored FEM and I'm bringing to
the<00:00:04.689> unboxing<00:00:05.319> of<00:00:05.769> the<00:00:06.040> Mafi<00:00:06.580> juice<00:00:07.000> pack

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:07.330 
the unboxing of the Mafi juice pack

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.900 
the unboxing of the Mafi juice pack
power<00:00:08.050> station<00:00:08.650> Pro<00:00:09.040> this<00:00:09.400> is<00:00:09.520> a<00:00:09.550> battery

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:09.910 
power station Pro this is a battery

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.680 
power station Pro this is a battery
charger<00:00:10.480> so<00:00:11.170> it's<00:00:11.320> supposed<00:00:11.530> to<00:00:11.590> be<00:00:12.690> shock

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.690 
charger so it's supposed to be shock

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.560 
charger so it's supposed to be shock
resistant<00:00:14.320> and<00:00:14.590> splash<00:00:15.340> proof<00:00:15.700> so<00:00:16.059> we'll<00:00:16.359> have

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
resistant and splash proof so we'll have

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.710 
resistant and splash proof so we'll have
to<00:00:16.779> test<00:00:17.019> that<00:00:17.109> out<00:00:17.260> let's<00:00:18.190> open<00:00:18.460> this<00:00:18.760> up<00:00:19.000> I<00:00:19.330> do

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
to test that out let's open this up I do

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.890 
to test that out let's open this up I do
like<00:00:20.020> the<00:00:20.200> design<00:00:21.360> packaging<00:00:22.360> is<00:00:22.480> actually

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
like the design packaging is actually

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.779 
like the design packaging is actually
pretty<00:00:23.170> secure<00:00:23.710> so<00:00:23.980> I<00:00:24.010> had<00:00:24.130> to<00:00:24.190> slice<00:00:24.400> some<00:00:24.670> of

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
pretty secure so I had to slice some of

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.540 
pretty secure so I had to slice some of
that<00:00:24.910> open<00:00:28.380> there<00:00:29.380> we<00:00:29.529> go<00:00:29.650> rugged<00:00:30.220> but<00:00:30.400> it's

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
that open there we go rugged but it's

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.169 
that open there we go rugged but it's
also<00:00:30.789> record<00:00:31.210> packaging<00:00:31.689> here<00:00:32.559> we<00:00:32.710> go<00:00:36.179> nice

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:37.179 
also record packaging here we go nice

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:40.459 
also record packaging here we go nice
little<00:00:37.510> rubberized<00:00:37.809> design<00:00:38.409> around<00:00:38.710> the<00:00:38.800> edge

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
little rubberized design around the edge

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.930 
little rubberized design around the edge
nice<00:00:41.469> and<00:00:41.710> lightweight<00:00:41.889> so<00:00:42.609> this<00:00:42.760> has<00:00:42.909> a

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
nice and lightweight so this has a

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.360 
nice and lightweight so this has a
rubber<00:00:43.210> feel<00:00:43.600> to<00:00:43.870> it<00:00:44.050> actually<00:00:44.739> pretty<00:00:44.979> small

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
rubber feel to it actually pretty small

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.369 
rubber feel to it actually pretty small
I<00:00:45.699> mean<00:00:46.120> you<00:00:46.210> still<00:00:46.420> feel<00:00:46.659> some<00:00:46.899> weight<00:00:47.109> to<00:00:47.350> it

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
I mean you still feel some weight to it

do we have for attachments we have the
USB<00:01:04.839> cable<00:01:05.260> to<00:01:06.040> power<00:01:06.250> this<00:01:06.580> up<00:01:06.790> so<00:01:07.210> we'll<00:01:07.840> take

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
USB cable to power this up so we'll take

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.230 
USB cable to power this up so we'll take
a<00:01:08.020> look<00:01:08.260> at<00:01:08.350> them<00:01:08.530> test<00:01:09.190> results<00:01:09.640> on<00:01:09.760> trying

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
a look at them test results on trying

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.270 
a look at them test results on trying
that<00:01:10.420> charging<00:01:10.960> this<00:01:11.080> up<00:01:11.260> and<00:01:11.470> testing<00:01:12.070> on<00:01:12.190> a

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
that charging this up and testing on a

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.640 
that charging this up and testing on a
few<00:01:12.520> devices<00:01:12.750> talk<00:01:13.750> to<00:01:13.900> you<00:01:13.960> taking<00:01:14.410> a<00:01:14.500> little

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
few devices talk to you taking a little

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.610 
few devices talk to you taking a little
closer<00:01:14.980> look<00:01:15.370> at<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.760> Mophie<00:01:16.300> charger<00:01:17.020> so

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
closer look at the Mophie charger so

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.340 
closer look at the Mophie charger so
this<00:01:17.830> is<00:01:17.980> a<00:01:18.010> portable<00:01:18.400> battery<00:01:18.940> charger<00:01:19.350> it's

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
this is a portable battery charger it's

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.580 
this is a portable battery charger it's
six<00:01:20.740> thousand<00:01:21.250> milliamps<00:01:21.880> so<00:01:22.030> in<00:01:22.540> actual<00:01:23.140> use

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
six thousand milliamps so in actual use

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.920 
six thousand milliamps so in actual use
it<00:01:24.040> charged<00:01:24.880> about<00:01:25.120> either<00:01:25.330> like<00:01:25.600> three

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
it charged about either like three

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.260 
it charged about either like three
devices<00:01:26.470> so<00:01:26.680> three<00:01:26.920> smartphones<00:01:27.430> or<00:01:27.760> like<00:01:28.030> two

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
devices so three smartphones or like two

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.020 
devices so three smartphones or like two
on<00:01:28.480> one<00:01:28.690> tablet<00:01:29.160> so<00:01:30.160> it's<00:01:30.310> it<00:01:30.610> actually

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
on one tablet so it's it actually

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.580 
on one tablet so it's it actually
supposed<00:01:31.210> to<00:01:31.240> be<00:01:31.350> water-resistant<00:01:32.350> will

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
supposed to be water-resistant will

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.100 
supposed to be water-resistant will
actually<00:01:32.830> splash<00:01:33.160> resistant<00:01:33.760> and<00:01:34.110> shock

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
actually splash resistant and shock

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.290 
actually splash resistant and shock
resistant<00:01:35.680> so<00:01:35.860> you<00:01:35.920> have<00:01:36.160> nice<00:01:36.520> and<00:01:36.670> cushioned

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
resistant so you have nice and cushioned

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.990 
resistant so you have nice and cushioned
rubber<00:01:37.720> material<00:01:38.410> on<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.650> outside<00:01:39.100> and<00:01:39.460> I<00:01:39.820> did

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
rubber material on the outside and I did

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.720 
rubber material on the outside and I did
try<00:01:40.150> throwing<00:01:40.480> it<00:01:40.750> a<00:01:40.810> bit<00:01:40.990> no<00:01:41.770> indentations

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
try throwing it a bit no indentations

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.149 
try throwing it a bit no indentations
here<00:01:43.570> so<00:01:43.990> it<00:01:44.140> held<00:01:44.290> up<00:01:44.440> pretty<00:01:44.620> well<00:01:44.770> and

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
here so it held up pretty well and

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.580 
here so it held up pretty well and
splash<00:01:46.000> proof<00:01:46.360> so<00:01:46.780> that<00:01:47.080> worked<00:01:47.290> out<00:01:47.440> pretty

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
splash proof so that worked out pretty

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.810 
splash proof so that worked out pretty
well<00:01:47.710> so<00:01:47.950> we<00:01:47.980> need<00:01:48.190> something<00:01:48.400> that's<00:01:48.520> nice

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
well so we need something that's nice

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.870 
well so we need something that's nice
and<00:01:49.030> durable<00:01:49.590> for<00:01:50.590> some<00:01:50.860> of<00:01:50.980> the<00:01:51.070> specs<00:01:51.490> do<00:01:51.760> we

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
and durable for some of the specs do we

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.160 
and durable for some of the specs do we
actually<00:01:52.150> have<00:01:52.330> or<00:01:52.630> just<00:01:52.659> you<00:01:52.990> know<00:01:53.050> the

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
actually have or just you know the

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.350 
actually have or just you know the
hardware<00:01:53.409> itself<00:01:53.770> we<00:01:53.980> have<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.580> power<00:01:54.880> button

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
hardware itself we have the power button

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.570 
hardware itself we have the power button
on<00:01:55.510> the<00:01:55.570> side<00:01:55.990> so<00:01:56.350> you<00:01:56.409> actually<00:01:56.710> press<00:01:57.310> this

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
on the side so you actually press this

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.149 
on the side so you actually press this
button<00:01:57.940> and<00:01:58.240> it'll<00:01:58.900> tell<00:01:59.140> you<00:01:59.290> how<00:01:59.320> charged<00:01:59.950> it

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
button and it'll tell you how charged it

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.100 
button and it'll tell you how charged it
