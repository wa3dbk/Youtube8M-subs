really<00:06:07.000> crazy<00:06:07.180> so<00:06:07.539> I<00:06:07.570> guess<00:06:07.930> the<00:06:08.409> number<00:06:08.530> one

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
really crazy so I guess the number one

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:09.540 
really crazy so I guess the number one

people is to actually go ahead and

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.379 
people is to actually go ahead and
encrypt<00:06:12.190> their<00:06:12.550> phones<00:06:12.880> isn't<00:06:13.180> that<00:06:13.270> right

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:13.389 
encrypt their phones isn't that right

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:15.510 
encrypt their phones isn't that right
that's<00:06:13.659> right<00:06:14.320> it's<00:06:14.620> really<00:06:14.949> easy<00:06:15.220> to<00:06:15.310> do<00:06:15.490> that

let's encrypt your laptop police cannot

let's encrypt your laptop police cannot
break<00:06:26.500> it<00:06:26.560> it's<00:06:26.770> very<00:06:27.030> robust<00:06:28.030> problem<00:06:28.750> is<00:06:28.900> on

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
break it it's very robust problem is on

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.589 
break it it's very robust problem is on
phones<00:06:29.530> you<00:06:30.310> really<00:06:30.610> want<00:06:30.760> that<00:06:30.849> same<00:06:31.419> level

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599

of<00:06:31.779> encryption<00:06:32.020> because<00:06:32.620> police<00:06:33.250> can't<00:06:33.580> hack

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:33.789 
of encryption because police can't hack

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:34.030 
of encryption because police can't hack
it

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:34.040 
it

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.110 
it
do<00:06:34.130> it<00:06:34.250> the<00:06:34.670> problem<00:06:34.880> with<00:06:35.060> the

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
do it the problem with the

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.670 
do it the problem with the
password-protected<00:06:35.930> phone<00:06:36.200> that's<00:06:36.440> not

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
password-protected phone that's not

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.500 
password-protected phone that's not
encrypted<00:06:37.220> is<00:06:37.520> that<00:06:37.730> there<00:06:37.880> are<00:06:37.970> these<00:06:38.090> tools

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:38.510 
encrypted is that there are these tools

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.120 
encrypted is that there are these tools
the<00:06:38.750> police<00:06:38.960> can<00:06:39.140> plug<00:06:39.290> into<00:06:39.470> your<00:06:39.560> phone<00:06:39.830> in

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
the police can plug into your phone in

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.580 
the police can plug into your phone in
five<00:06:40.640> minutes<00:06:41.090> all<00:06:41.330> the<00:06:41.390> data<00:06:41.810> is<00:06:42.200> off<00:06:42.440> your

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.590 
five minutes all the data is off your

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.260 
five minutes all the data is off your
phone<00:06:42.860> on<00:06:43.190> their<00:06:43.520> computer<00:06:43.940> and<00:06:44.030> then<00:06:44.150> they

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
phone on their computer and then they

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.210 
phone on their computer and then they
have<00:06:44.420> free<00:06:45.170> rein<00:06:45.440> to<00:06:45.710> search<00:06:45.920> it

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:46.220 
have free rein to search it

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.580 
have free rein to search it
so<00:06:46.760> encrypting<00:06:47.720> it<00:06:47.810> is<00:06:47.900> the<00:06:48.020> only<00:06:48.170> really

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.590 
so encrypting it is the only really

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.200 
so encrypting it is the only really
surefire<00:06:49.160> way<00:06:49.370> to<00:06:49.430> make<00:06:49.640> sure<00:06:49.760> police<00:06:49.940> can

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210 
surefire way to make sure police can

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.850 
surefire way to make sure police can
access<00:06:50.540> it<00:06:50.690> and<00:06:50.810> as<00:06:51.140> I<00:06:51.230> said<00:06:51.380> earlier<00:06:51.650> they

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
access it and as I said earlier they

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.280 
access it and as I said earlier they
cannot<00:06:52.160> force<00:06:52.550> you<00:06:52.670> to<00:06:52.760> compel<00:06:53.060> the<00:06:53.240> the<00:06:53.840> to

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.290 
cannot force you to compel the the to

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.660 
cannot force you to compel the the to
turn<00:06:54.440> over<00:06:54.620> the<00:06:54.710> key<00:06:54.890> no<00:06:55.220> matter<00:06:55.250> what<00:06:55.520> they

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:55.670 
turn over the key no matter what they

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.250 
turn over the key no matter what they
say<00:06:55.700> you<00:06:56.450> have<00:06:56.480> the<00:06:56.600> right<00:06:56.780> to<00:06:56.840> remain<00:06:56.990> silent

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:57.260 
say you have the right to remain silent

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.250 
say you have the right to remain silent
they<00:06:57.860> cannot<00:06:58.100> force<00:06:58.460> you<00:06:58.550> to<00:06:58.610> compel<00:06:59.260> just
