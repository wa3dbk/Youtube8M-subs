00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:59.319 
the top now here you're literally gonna
to<00:01:57.319> snow<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:58.579> they're<00:01:58.819> going<00:01:58.999> to<00:01:59.060> build<00:01:59.119> one

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
to snow and they're going to build one

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.200 
to snow and they're going to build one
up<00:01:59.479> from<00:01:59.659> that<00:01:59.920> like<00:02:00.920> this

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
up from that like this

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.960 
up from that like this
and<00:02:02.780> that<00:02:03.140> is<00:02:03.320> how<00:02:03.560> this<00:02:03.800> is<00:02:03.860> gonna<00:02:04.040> go<00:02:04.160> and<00:02:04.670> at

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
and that is how this is gonna go and at

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.180 
and that is how this is gonna go and at
the<00:02:05.120> front<00:02:05.590> so<00:02:06.590> it's<00:02:06.710> gonna<00:02:06.800> look<00:02:06.890> like<00:02:07.010> that

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
the front so it's gonna look like that

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.100 
the front so it's gonna look like that
from<00:02:07.400> the<00:02:07.460> back<00:02:07.610> car<00:02:08.420> looks<00:02:08.570> a<00:02:08.630> bit<00:02:08.660> weird<00:02:08.929> and

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
from the back car looks a bit weird and

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.660 
from the back car looks a bit weird and
not<00:02:09.259> like<00:02:09.470> a<00:02:09.500> boss<00:02:09.679> at<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:09.890> moment<00:02:10.190> but<00:02:10.429> it

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
not like a boss at the moment but it

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.020 
not like a boss at the moment but it
will<00:02:10.789> do<00:02:10.970> in<00:02:11.210> a<00:02:11.420> second<00:02:12.220> right<00:02:13.220> now<00:02:13.880> you're

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
will do in a second right now you're

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.340 
will do in a second right now you're
going<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.240> go<00:02:14.360> in<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:14.690> you<00:02:14.780> get<00:02:14.930> your<00:02:15.050> blue

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
going to go in and you get your blue

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.200 
going to go in and you get your blue
stain<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.740> play<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:16.190> can<00:02:16.460> use<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.880> blue<00:02:17.060> wall

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
stain to play you can use the blue wall

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.199 
stain to play you can use the blue wall
for<00:02:17.390> this<00:02:17.510> but<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:18.500> know<00:02:18.590> this<00:02:18.740> kind<00:02:18.980> of<00:02:19.040> looks

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
for this but you know this kind of looks

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.670 
for this but you know this kind of looks
it<00:02:20.209> kind<00:02:20.450> of<00:02:20.480> goes<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.750> snow<00:02:20.959> more<00:02:21.140> in<00:02:21.440> my

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
it kind of goes to the snow more in my

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.560 
it kind of goes to the snow more in my
opinion<00:02:22.040> this<00:02:22.700> is<00:02:22.760> going<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.060> go<00:02:23.180> here<00:02:23.390> right

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
opinion this is going to go here right

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.930 
opinion this is going to go here right
guys<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:24.070> you<00:02:25.070> are<00:02:25.220> going<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.430> repeat<00:02:25.640> that<00:02:25.790> on

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
guys and you are going to repeat that on

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.370 
guys and you are going to repeat that on
exact<00:02:26.300> same<00:02:26.510> side<00:02:27.010> so<00:02:28.010> this<00:02:28.610> now<00:02:29.480> I<00:02:29.750> think<00:02:30.080> is

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
exact same side so this now I think is

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.650 
exact same side so this now I think is
the<00:02:30.470> one<00:02:30.560> yes<00:02:30.890> is<00:02:31.220> there<00:02:31.400> goes<00:02:31.520> under<00:02:31.790> here<00:02:31.940> and

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
the one yes is there goes under here and

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.530 
the one yes is there goes under here and
over<00:02:33.350> like<00:02:34.070> that<00:02:34.280> exactly<00:02:35.060> same<00:02:35.300> on<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.480> other

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
over like that exactly same on the other

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.990 
over like that exactly same on the other
side<00:02:35.630> guys<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.890> then<00:02:37.190> you're<00:02:37.730> going<00:02:37.820> to<00:02:37.880> do

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
side guys and then you're going to do

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.020 
side guys and then you're going to do
this<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.959> exact<00:02:39.290> same<00:02:39.410> pattern<00:02:39.730> so<00:02:40.730> kind<00:02:40.970> of

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
this the exact same pattern so kind of

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.660 
this the exact same pattern so kind of
under<00:02:41.270> laps<00:02:41.450> orange<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.110> into<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.500> blue<00:02:42.670> just
