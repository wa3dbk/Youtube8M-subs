00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.500
 the properties of this fruit where it 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.719
 cultivate as is the treaty of the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.180
 production of this good fruit will 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.880
 grows throughout the hot zone more than 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.300
 nothing 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.460
 there are some trees planted in a part 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.290
 high almost have no production as 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.720
 ideal in the area like martínez a 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.270
 Rafael Acosta all that area is this 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.420
 propitious for the yaca the process that 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.670
 we have is now manual can not be 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.110
 do it differently if you want to 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.970
 I show how the boys do it 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.650
 alone we pass here 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.210
 yes, so I invite you, let's go 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.130
 to come here to tell us more 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.420
 or less how is the process of the difficult 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.900
 of this fruit sometimes that people 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.970
 learn to remove the pulp 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.610
 the fruit by its size 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.560
 to start it costs a person 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.500
 move it you have to open it in four 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.020
 pieces and dishearten the once you 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.330
 Descorazona opens and begin to 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.270
 remove the bulbs by removing the bone and 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.960
 a cuticle that has all of that inside 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.920
 it has to be done with a little oil 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.390
 because the fruit of one of his 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.950
 features that contains a rubber 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.330
 that sticks as if it were resistol 5000 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.030
 it sticks on your fingers stick the 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.550
 knives and you can observe look is 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.430
 all stuck what they only do is 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.310
 put edible oil and it is removed from 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.350
 all perfect of properties we can 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.320
 find in this fruit within your 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.420
 properties we have ascorbic acid 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.470
 many minerals many vitamins have 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.890
 proteins and within the literature that 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.200
 we have found contains something very 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.819
 similar to sildenafil that is something 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.609
 responsible for hydrating blood vessels 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.650
 perfect as we could the 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:30.459
 human beings obviously consume this 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.950
 fruit as fresh we already have 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.010
 what is pulp fresh pulp 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.900
 frozen and a byproduct would already be the 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.030
 orange juice combined with the yaca 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.090
 that we are already beginning 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.370
 here in the martínez area 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.769
 later we will have other 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.530
 byproducts like jam some 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:53.739
 dressing and we're working on a in 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.019
 a creme caramel wine cream the flavor what 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.329
 we could find like sweet and sour sweet 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.639
 salty as is the flavor its flavor is 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:04.329
 totally sweet is a mixture of 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:08.469
 flavors of mango banana pineapple melon 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:11.049
 peach papaya apple and at the same time 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:13.540
 none and as I tell many people 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.849
 from here the proof is that it makes you laugh 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.159
 There are many people that I tell you 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.379
 is that you know that you know better I'm going to 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.020
 to remember remember chewing gum to motita 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:25.920
 what was there before 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.810
 you do not have that taste of chewing gum 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.720
 so that's also why people 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.820
 The taste is very good, it is something 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.470
 more than you want to give us so that 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.080
 people know a little more about this 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.820
 this fruit, since you can 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.820
 consume fresh you can make a 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.820
 liquefied can be made in water you can 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:48.750
 making desserts depends on the ingenuity of the 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:51.150
 cook or cook, well, there she is 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.130
 friends here is a new variety 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.540
 in fruit, so we invite you to 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.470
 they know it and that they also come to 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:02.080
 try here at the expoferia martínez 2014 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.080
 There are signals to signals 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.430
