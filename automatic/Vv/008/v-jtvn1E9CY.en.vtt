to<00:00:52.590> be<00:00:52.710> slightly<00:00:52.949> outside<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.579> can't<00:00:53.760> go<00:00:53.850> too

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
to be slightly outside you can't go too

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.880

far away or else this won't work but
just<00:00:56.129> do<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> simple<00:00:57.510> jump<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:58.020> keep<00:00:58.170> on

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
just do a simple jump just keep on

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.260 
just do a simple jump just keep on
jumping<00:00:58.770> up<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.010> down<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.489> this<00:01:00.120> was

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
jumping up and down and this was

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.580 
jumping up and down and this was
actually<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.629> type<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.809> thing<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.199> use<00:01:01.320> back<00:01:01.559> in

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
actually a type of thing you use back in

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.770 
actually a type of thing you use back in
black<00:01:02.070> ops<00:01:02.280> 1<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.879> get<00:01:03.000> past<00:01:03.239> death<00:01:03.480> barriers

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780

and<00:01:04.019> stuff<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.409> lot<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.559> situations<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.489> it

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
and stuff in a lot of situations and it

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.450 
and stuff in a lot of situations and it
actually<00:01:06.450> kind<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.840> lets<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.140> go<00:01:07.320> past<00:01:07.619> this

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
actually kind of lets you go past this

actually kind of lets you go past this
little<00:01:08.610> warning<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.900> can<00:01:09.990> just<00:01:10.110> keep<00:01:10.229> on

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
little warning so you can just keep on

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.020 
little warning so you can just keep on
jumping<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.040> warning<00:01:11.340> will<00:01:11.460> go<00:01:11.580> away

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
jumping and the warning will go away

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.520 
jumping and the warning will go away
it's<00:01:12.330> not<00:01:12.510> quite<00:01:12.689> as<00:01:12.780> good<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.140> side<00:01:13.350> but

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
it's not quite as good on this side but

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.050 
it's not quite as good on this side but
that<00:01:14.100> last<00:01:14.340> side<00:01:14.490> there<00:01:14.700> was<00:01:14.760> like<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> little

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
that last side there was like a little

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.580 
that last side there was like a little
corner<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.600> can<00:01:15.750> continue<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.140> jump<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.470> on

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
corner that I can continue to jump in on

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.289 
corner that I can continue to jump in on
and<00:01:16.830> it's<00:01:17.310> pretty<00:01:17.460> much<00:01:17.549> one<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.210> best

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
and it's pretty much one of the best

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.940 
and it's pretty much one of the best
hiding<00:01:18.659> spots<00:01:18.900> on<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> map<00:01:19.350> as<00:01:19.530> nobody's

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
hiding spots on the map as nobody's

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.289 
hiding spots on the map as nobody's
gonna<00:01:20.100> be<00:01:20.250> looking<00:01:20.520> outside<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.150> map

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
gonna be looking outside of the map

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.380 
gonna be looking outside of the map
behind<00:01:21.990> wall<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.920> here<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.790> another<00:01:23.939> spot

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
behind wall and here is another spot

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.170 
behind wall and here is another spot
just<00:01:24.750> like<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.140> on<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:26.009> map<00:01:26.220> combine<00:01:26.880> and

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
just like that on the map combine and

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.030 
just like that on the map combine and
it's<00:01:27.570> behind<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:28.020> giant<00:01:28.680> wall<00:01:28.799> right<00:01:29.009> here

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
it's behind this giant wall right here

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.800 
it's behind this giant wall right here
it's<00:01:29.549> pretty<00:01:29.729> much<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.060> same<00:01:30.090> concept<00:01:30.450> just

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
it's pretty much the same concept just

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.510 
it's pretty much the same concept just
to<00:01:30.930> jump<00:01:31.170> around<00:01:31.320> right<00:01:31.680> here<00:01:31.860> go<00:01:32.100> around<00:01:32.220> this

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
to jump around right here go around this

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.280 
to jump around right here go around this
little<00:01:32.729> fence<00:01:33.030> area<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.540> there's<00:01:33.960> some<00:01:34.079> rocks

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
little fence area and there's some rocks

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.690 
little fence area and there's some rocks
so<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:34.650> just<00:01:34.770> do<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.220> just<00:01:35.369> keep<00:01:35.549> on

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
so you can just do this on just keep on

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.580 
so you can just do this on just keep on
jumping<00:01:36.090> up<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.299> down<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:37.200> won't<00:01:37.409> die

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
jumping up and down and you won't die

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.960 
jumping up and down and you won't die
you'll<00:01:37.799> be<00:01:37.860> able<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.040> bypass<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.610> warning

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
you'll be able to bypass that warning

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.219 
you'll be able to bypass that warning
and<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.210> got<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.360> nice<00:01:39.509> little<00:01:39.540> line-of-sight

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
and you got a nice little line-of-sight

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.740 
and you got a nice little line-of-sight
at<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.650> doorway<00:01:40.890> right<00:01:41.159> there<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:42.299> I'm<00:01:42.689> sure
