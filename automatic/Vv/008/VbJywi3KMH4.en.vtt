00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
continuous process we continually

customer insights what the consumer
wants<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:49.800> was<00:00:50.039> what<00:00:50.280> SC<00:00:50.850> nano<00:00:51.750> was

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
wants and this was what SC nano was

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.900 
wants and this was what SC nano was
launched<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.260> 2009<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:53.280> five<00:00:53.520> years<00:00:53.730> customers

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
launched in 2009 in five years customers

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.090

evolve<00:00:54.690> their<00:00:55.020> expectations<00:00:55.620> have<00:00:55.770> gone<00:00:55.920> up

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
evolve their expectations have gone up

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.369 
evolve their expectations have gone up
so<00:00:56.579> we<00:00:56.820> naturally<00:00:57.120> do<00:00:57.539> lot<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.809> insights<00:00:58.140> on

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
so we naturally do lot of insights on

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.740 
so we naturally do lot of insights on
that<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.770> customer<00:00:59.219> clinics<00:00:59.579> that<00:01:00.149> indicated

the customer wanted these type of things

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.640 
the customer wanted these type of things
so<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.489> package<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.480> their<00:01:03.809> value<00:01:04.260> concept

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
so we package it and their value concept

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.469 
so we package it and their value concept

put a number on that what I look for is

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.080 
put a number on that what I look for is
that<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:16.320> typically<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:16.890> India<00:01:17.159> compact<00:01:17.939> car

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090
