good<00:00:02.929> morning<00:00:03.350> folks<00:00:03.590> we<00:00:04.040> might<00:00:04.310> have<00:00:04.340> an

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:04.640 
good morning folks we might have an

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.179 
good morning folks we might have an
inconsistency<00:00:05.510> so<00:00:06.349> yesterday<00:00:06.800> we<00:00:06.950> saw<00:00:07.130> the

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:07.189 
inconsistency so yesterday we saw the

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.810 
inconsistency so yesterday we saw the
CME<00:00:07.910> impact<00:00:08.420> dense<00:00:08.930> but<00:00:09.349> slow<00:00:09.740> however<00:00:10.430> the

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
CME impact dense but slow however the

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.810 
CME impact dense but slow however the
