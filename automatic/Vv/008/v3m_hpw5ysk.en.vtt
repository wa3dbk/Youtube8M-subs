bottom so which is here and we're going
to<00:03:12.220> put<00:03:12.519> a<00:03:12.880> redstone<00:03:13.269> torch

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.500 

which<00:03:17.319> I'll<00:03:17.500> deactivate<00:03:17.680> this<00:03:18.280> I'm<00:03:19.239> going<00:03:19.420> to

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
which I'll deactivate this I'm going to

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.229 
which I'll deactivate this I'm going to
take<00:03:19.690> this<00:03:20.310> going<00:03:21.310> off<00:03:21.459> to<00:03:21.790> a<00:03:21.819> redstone

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
take this going off to a redstone

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:28.440 
take this going off to a redstone
repeater<00:03:25.920> which<00:03:26.920> then<00:03:27.159> goes<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.400> this<00:03:27.730> Scrolls

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
repeater which then goes to this Scrolls

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.210 
repeater which then goes to this Scrolls
to<00:03:28.599> that<00:03:29.879> know<00:03:30.879> so<00:03:31.120> it's<00:03:31.390> does<00:03:31.989> this<00:03:32.170> then<00:03:33.099> I'm

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
to that know so it's does this then I'm

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.369 
to that know so it's does this then I'm
going<00:03:33.340> to<00:03:33.370> have<00:03:33.489> to<00:03:33.610> go<00:03:33.730> it<00:03:33.819> round<00:03:34.060> again<00:03:36.090> like

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
going to have to go it round again like

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:44.100 
going to have to go it round again like
so<00:03:38.379> and<00:03:39.370> it's<00:03:40.000> going<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.269> go<00:03:41.400> back<00:03:43.110> through

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
so and it's going to go back through

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.180 
so and it's going to go back through
like<00:03:44.410> this<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:46.650> then<00:03:47.650> we're<00:03:47.769> going<00:03:47.890> to<00:03:47.950> get

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
like this and then we're going to get

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.199 
like this and then we're going to get
out

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
out

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.110 
out
we<00:03:49.480> need<00:03:49.599> a<00:03:49.629> rest<00:03:49.870> on<00:03:50.079> compat<00:03:50.769> eraser<00:03:51.160> is<00:03:51.549> it

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
we need a rest on compat eraser is it

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.530 
we need a rest on compat eraser is it
think<00:03:53.190> and<00:03:54.599> i'm<00:03:55.599> going<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:55.870> add<00:03:56.170> that<00:03:57.480> add<00:03:58.480> that

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
think and i'm going to add that add that

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:12.430 
think and i'm going to add that add that
in<00:04:00.180> here<00:04:02.129> there<00:04:03.129> we<00:04:03.250> go

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.949 

long<00:04:13.440> then

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.570 

alright<00:04:18.959> ok<00:04:19.400> maybe<00:04:20.400> not<00:04:20.549> just<00:04:21.860> make<00:04:22.860> this<00:04:23.070> like

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
alright ok maybe not just make this like

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.260 
alright ok maybe not just make this like
this<00:04:23.820> and<00:04:24.120> then<00:04:25.020> you've<00:04:25.260> got<00:04:25.470> most<00:04:25.650> of<00:04:25.860> it<00:04:25.919> done

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
this and then you've got most of it done

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.290 
this and then you've got most of it done
and<00:04:27.270> then<00:04:27.860> you<00:04:28.860> can<00:04:29.070> use<00:04:29.250> daylight<00:04:29.520> senses<00:04:30.090> but

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
and then you can use daylight senses but

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.150 
and then you can use daylight senses but
you<00:04:30.570> know<00:04:30.720> it's<00:04:30.870> not<00:04:31.610> this<00:04:33.230> but<00:04:34.230> in<00:04:34.560> and<00:04:35.070> they

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
you know it's not this but in and they

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.800 
you know it's not this but in and they
actually<00:04:35.340> make<00:04:35.730> another<00:04:36.060> tutorial<00:04:36.210> on<00:04:36.630> how<00:04:36.780> to

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
actually make another tutorial on how to

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.030 
actually make another tutorial on how to
do<00:04:37.050> that<00:04:37.230> later<00:04:37.410> on<00:04:37.730> so<00:04:38.730> we're<00:04:38.880> yeah<00:04:39.889> now<00:04:40.889> once

it to a block see any color sorry yes
you<00:05:14.280> can<00:05:14.460> but<00:05:15.180> there<00:05:15.919> maybe<00:05:16.919> not<00:05:17.160> just<00:05:17.370> add

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
you can but there maybe not just add

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.610 
you can but there maybe not just add
other<00:05:18.150> redstone<00:05:18.540> view<00:05:18.750> and<00:05:18.930> so<00:05:19.080> it's<00:05:19.229> or<00:05:19.350> delay

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
other redstone view and so it's or delay

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.170 
other redstone view and so it's or delay
then<00:05:20.520> here<00:05:20.850> we<00:05:21.000> are

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
then here we are
