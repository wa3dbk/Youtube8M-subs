okay<00:00:02.129> here<00:00:02.580> it<00:00:02.700> is<00:00:02.730> the<00:00:03.000> flight<00:00:03.240> design<00:00:03.629> CT<00:00:13.009> all

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
okay here it is the flight design CT all

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:46.140 
okay here it is the flight design CT all
carbon<00:00:14.639> fiber

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:55.050 

not<00:00:47.150> very<00:00:47.420> big<00:00:47.660> i'd<00:00:48.110> say<00:00:48.470> i<00:00:49.810> don't<00:00:50.810> know<00:00:50.900> maybe

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.060 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.920 

about<00:00:56.060> 20<00:00:56.360> feet<00:00:56.810> maybe<00:00:57.080> 25<00:00:57.320> feet<00:00:57.830> across<00:00:58.930> this

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
about 20 feet maybe 25 feet across this

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.480 
about 20 feet maybe 25 feet across this
is<00:01:00.170> not<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:01.060> CTLs<00:01:02.060> this<00:01:02.930> is<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:03.320> CW<00:01:03.980> which<00:01:04.309> has

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:04.490 
is not the CTLs this is the CW which has

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.330 
is not the CTLs this is the CW which has
the<00:01:04.699> shorter<00:01:05.500> fuselage<00:01:06.500> and<00:01:06.830> it<00:01:06.950> does<00:01:07.130> not

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
the shorter fuselage and it does not

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.390 
the shorter fuselage and it does not
have<00:01:07.550> the<00:01:07.700> additional<00:01:07.940> rear<00:01:08.360> window<00:01:09.250> but<00:01:10.250> it

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
have the additional rear window but it

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.540 
have the additional rear window but it
does<00:01:10.550> have<00:01:10.760> all<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:11.120> same<00:01:11.270> electronics<00:01:12.550> the

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
does have all the same electronics the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
does have all the same electronics the
gear<00:01:13.850> is<00:01:13.880> fixed<00:01:14.800> it's<00:01:16.060> fixed<00:01:17.060> gear<00:01:17.420> um<00:01:19.570> inside

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
gear is fixed it's fixed gear um inside

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.730 
gear is fixed it's fixed gear um inside
of<00:01:20.750> here<00:01:21.170> there's<00:01:21.440> a<00:01:21.830> out<00:01:22.070> a<00:01:22.430> wing<00:01:23.150> of<00:01:23.740> aluminum

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
of here there's a out a wing of aluminum

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.880 
of here there's a out a wing of aluminum
tubes<00:01:26.710> here<00:01:27.710> the<00:01:28.610> nose<00:01:28.820> wheel<00:01:29.680> I'm<00:01:30.680> not<00:01:30.830> even

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
tubes here the nose wheel I'm not even

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.830 
tubes here the nose wheel I'm not even
sure<00:01:31.070> if<00:01:31.280> it's<00:01:31.430> terrible<00:01:31.880> or<00:01:32.030> not<00:01:32.210> I'm

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
sure if it's terrible or not I'm

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.530 
sure if it's terrible or not I'm
guessing<00:01:33.320> it<00:01:33.440> probably<00:01:33.470> is<00:01:34.400> yeah<00:01:35.090> it<00:01:35.360> looks

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
guessing it probably is yeah it looks

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.090 
guessing it probably is yeah it looks
like<00:01:35.660> it's<00:01:35.840> terrible<00:01:36.320> is<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.460> exhaust<00:01:39.100> no

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
like it's terrible is the exhaust no

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.170 
like it's terrible is the exhaust no
rivets<00:01:40.490> to<00:01:40.580> check<00:01:40.940> and<00:01:42.340> we'll<00:01:43.340> get<00:01:43.700> a<00:01:43.729> view<00:01:43.970> the

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
rivets to check and we'll get a view the

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.400 
rivets to check and we'll get a view the
inside<00:01:44.540> here<00:01:44.810> in<00:01:44.930> a<00:01:45.020> moment<00:01:45.400> um<00:01:47.200> kind<00:01:48.200> of<00:01:48.290> see

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
inside here in a moment um kind of see

00:01:48.410 --> 00:02:01.290 
inside here in a moment um kind of see
the<00:01:48.530> connections<00:01:49.990> here

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:08.690 

it's<00:02:02.140> just<00:02:02.440> a<00:02:02.560> bolt<00:02:02.860> here<00:02:03.280> holding<00:02:03.880> it<00:02:07.470> and

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
it's just a bolt here holding it and

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.340 
it's just a bolt here holding it and
then<00:02:09.700> it's<00:02:09.940> a<00:02:10.030> pull<00:02:10.240> pull<00:02:10.479> system<00:02:10.960> kind<00:02:11.230> of

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
then it's a pull pull system kind of

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.290 
then it's a pull pull system kind of
like<00:02:11.470> on<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:11.680> model<00:02:12.160> basically<00:02:16.140> there's<00:02:17.140> your

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
like on a model basically there's your

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.200 
like on a model basically there's your
cables<00:02:19.300> to<00:02:19.480> pull<00:02:19.750> pull<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:21.370> elevator<00:02:21.850> I<00:02:21.970> don't

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
cables to pull pull the elevator I don't

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:35.470 
cables to pull pull the elevator I don't
know<00:02:22.270> if<00:02:22.330> you<00:02:22.420> could<00:02:22.540> see<00:02:22.600> it

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:45.910 

you<00:02:36.019> can<00:02:36.379> see<00:02:36.620> this<00:02:36.769> is<00:02:36.950> all<00:02:37.239> carbon<00:02:38.239> fiber<00:02:44.920> all

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
you can see this is all carbon fiber all

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.280 
you can see this is all carbon fiber all
right
