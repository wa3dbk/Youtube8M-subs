gauge<00:00:24.550> is<00:00:24.579> is<00:00:24.999> that<00:00:25.210> it<00:00:25.329> doesn't

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:25.359 
gauge is is that it doesn't

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.200 
gauge is is that it doesn't
automatically<00:00:26.199> reset<00:00:26.829> itself<00:00:27.220> if<00:00:27.429> the<00:00:27.909> oils

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
automatically reset itself if the oils

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.460 
automatically reset itself if the oils
been<00:00:28.300> changed<00:00:28.449> it's<00:00:28.989> not<00:00:29.109> like<00:00:29.259> there's<00:00:29.409> some

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
been changed it's not like there's some

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.950 
been changed it's not like there's some
sensor<00:00:30.039> and<00:00:30.189> your<00:00:30.310> motor<00:00:30.550> that<00:00:31.149> changes<00:00:31.749> it

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
sensor and your motor that changes it

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.910 
sensor and your motor that changes it
back<00:00:32.920> to<00:00:33.250> full<00:00:33.760> oil<00:00:34.210> life<00:00:34.600> or<00:00:34.900> good<00:00:35.260> oil<00:00:35.530> or

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
back to full oil life or good oil or

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.300 
back to full oil life or good oil or
however<00:00:36.100> you<00:00:36.310> want<00:00:36.460> to<00:00:36.490> phrase<00:00:36.820> it<00:00:38.220> when<00:00:39.220> the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.310 
however you want to phrase it when the

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.160 
however you want to phrase it when the
mechanic<00:00:39.730> changes<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.150> oil<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:40.480> mechanic<00:00:40.990> or

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
mechanic changes the oil the mechanic or

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.290 
mechanic changes the oil the mechanic or
the<00:00:41.290> dealer<00:00:41.560> has<00:00:42.220> to<00:00:42.430> go<00:00:42.550> in<00:00:42.730> there<00:00:42.940> and<00:00:43.060> change

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
the dealer has to go in there and change

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.360 
the dealer has to go in there and change
it<00:00:43.420> so<00:00:43.600> I<00:00:43.630> guess<00:00:43.990> the<00:00:44.110> question<00:00:44.440> is<00:00:44.590> if<00:00:44.800> you've

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
it so I guess the question is if you've

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.950 
it so I guess the question is if you've
just<00:00:45.730> got<00:00:45.880> your<00:00:45.910> oil<00:00:46.180> change<00:00:46.570> you<00:00:46.750> know

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
they've changed the oil and your

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.860 
they've changed the oil and your
your-your-your<00:00:49.800> change<00:00:50.800> oil<00:00:51.600> indicator<00:00:52.600> is

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
your-your-your change oil indicator is

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.410 
your-your-your change oil indicator is
