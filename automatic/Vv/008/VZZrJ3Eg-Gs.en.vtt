 Herbs for hiking or during the stage gps

 Meogu nyeondeul tell those who use simple aggregation tell these people 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:22.989
 The best model, the 412, is a simple explanation of sin. 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:35.160
 This time, 115 counselors 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:38.160
 The memory is large and will require its electronic compass, then why 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.340
 This horizontal rotation 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:46.680
 I do not know what to do. 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:51.870
 When you took your destination 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:57.390
 If such suspension Baek model vaccine and evil where there is no fat 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:02.550
 Wooden measuring and moving gps in any direction or whatever 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:06.000
 We have occasional times and have received with one sight sight and this person is now 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.420
 After determining that you are going north and now going south 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:15.240
 The objective c direction will now tell And now 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:19.229
 410 plates with no growth models such as Toka Project Group x 110 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.080
 If the destination side continues ah 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:27.720
 The court will always strike direction 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:31.890
 coming up this screen from the default gp First it must first be immature 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.070
 You need to check the status of your partner by clicking on the status. 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:40.229
 At least the green bar graph presented frontline 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.420
 I'm taking a picture of myself. 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.420
 It's an outdoor place. 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:50.640
 It describes the issues and the check do naegae 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:56.580
 So when the site came into the site with this information 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:59.610
 The coordinates will show another side of the ship a few minutes meta fixed on the body, m errors 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:04.170
 Now 42m is very big, 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:07.770
 I got a signal through one of those hymns . 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:12.690
 Something up in beta when something like that and not a formula 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.070
 It will be displayed little toad tree that nothing can coordinate display joggers doejil 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.610
 This'm out 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.610
 And then 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.120
 Go to the map screen and press the band now 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.930
 If a question mark comes out, it's not a formula either. 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:36.580
 I think our office is the remaining vertical . 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:42.850
 So, first of all, after you set up your car and set up your car , 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:46.540
 You have to save that until I came to the second or occasional e 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.150
 On this screen, make sure that the coordinates are displayed, 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:55.300
 After checking it, 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:58.989
 Additional points Sashimi kicks are shaped like pins I just press the button 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:02.890
 It's called the coordinates . 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:08.590
 Be based ganeunghasin who are more icons in the yoge 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:12.370
 His talk on the arrow to move here. Subsidiaries Table of ivory, but 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:16.720
 If you set up your car for a car deal 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.640
 When you go to save the display as a teacher in the shape of a true look yoge 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.150
 Next to the two selves 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:27.459
 Here arrows to the destination guide Taro Kowen 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:30.489
 p1 and it pushes the car show as a navigation destination in its den so t 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:34.900
 Press once again to enter the gps 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:37.570
 Doejyo directed distance is 100m away and now teach me the way 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.840
 Now , in the case of Baek, 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.280
 If you move like this in stop, it does not show any direction 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.829
 Come and go 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:50.480
 Then there is the next to go, even just walking on the four vaccine status at rest 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:55.400
 I'll play the direction. 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:04:01.160
 Yoreotge not it is now heard in the direction of the arrow 33 now eoyeo 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:03.349
 Why are we now combine the stave in sorghum window very nervous 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.580
 Because I am at the window 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:12.080
 On'm going to receive a very anxious to do so wobbly 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:15.950
 When it disappears, it is when it is not able to do occasionally at all 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.970
 That's right. So it's time to get some time, maybe some time. 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.639
 It's not. 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.120
 There's a way to go and see it. 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.120
 Another way 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.789
 I went out of the way with guidance and I was taken away from where I was 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:34.620
 Let me write it down. 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:34.620
 P I'll also pressing the difference between cases pt come save 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:40.840
 Then the destination guide b2 method 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:52.630
 I get out of here and go to the map. 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:57.639
 Now the yellow line looks a little on the screen here , but I see a yellow line. 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:05:01.240
 Discrete discourse with the destination of the clothes are gonna save, 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:05.229
 The important thing is always in the air above the north in the gp 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:09.160
 Because of the above reason, the upper side, wherein the second 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:14.979
 There are 2 3- way destinations, 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:16.750
 Not that easy because not stretch to the back burner to be above the need to go to the north of here. 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:21.789
 The clothes are marked for thought . 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:24.540
 This stroll kkeumssik move in the rally in front of the pointed part of the triangle 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:28.650
 This model needs to be moved. 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:33.690
 Getting to this because it is not haejwoya the map in such a way yes 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:39.450
 There is the easiest way to another destination in the North boring blank Toro Guide 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:44.030
 It would be most convenient to look at the arrows and see the remaining distance 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.030
 Yes . 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:52.680
 If you wish to smoking what did not need to point out what needed to erase or 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:58.259
 Then you can choose blood and interdisciplinarity from faith 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:06:02.009
 Did you try to remove the battery and remove and turned Does the source or p 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:09.180
 Please note that the dirt is always gum gps 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:10.110
 This would not have been remembered by mistake assuming that the gp p submission 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.020
 Case 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:18.060
 There is a mistake of the person who leads. 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:21.210
 When such a satellite has to turn at first I dont tongs from the Book Review gp 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:26.550
 The first point taken is recorded on its own 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:27.419
 Of course, I loved it, but Paderi seemed to be a lot different. 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:32.580
 If you turn it back on 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:35.770
 Jasi If the car is located in the Can I Have So if a record is a record 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:39.400
 You can not do it. 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:44.080
 Or maybe that map 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:46.120
 All go in on the icon that says so well on 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.900
 Magnifying and eye 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:52.960
 Because this is the King's place at the rally, 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:58.930
 I'm afraid I'm pushing the pins. 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:07:02.760
 Then came did so to save freedom of a car where you are now a visible display 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.760
 Later, you can even place it so the Record 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:15.360
 If you forgot and forgot and chased the car and did not record it vertically 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:21.200
 Parts moved a later time, place the cursor where you want the marked cooking 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:21.200
 I can add it by clicking on the Add Continue button . 

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:32.590
 I briefly explained how to use it in 410 herbal walks. 

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:37.080
 Afterwards 

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:37.080
 I 'll explain separately how it was used in the last year.
