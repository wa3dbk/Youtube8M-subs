00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.939 
trying not to leave the twists in for so
long<00:01:00.210> because<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.840> was<00:01:01.020> leaving<00:01:01.350> them<00:01:01.500> into<00:01:01.770> so

long because I was leaving them into so

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.229 
long because I was leaving them into so
long<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.340> then<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.489> was<00:01:02.579> having<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.059> much

and<00:02:26.490> actually<00:02:27.490> it's<00:02:28.000> getting<00:02:28.300> bigger<00:02:28.480> because

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
and actually it's getting bigger because

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.720 
and actually it's getting bigger because
my<00:02:29.080> hairline<00:02:29.350> has<00:02:29.530> been<00:02:29.710> receding<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.400> I

think it's because I've been pulling my
hair<00:02:32.650> back<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.250> lot<00:02:33.760> but<00:02:34.510> not<00:02:35.470> with<00:02:35.650> a<00:02:35.680> lot<00:02:35.890> of
