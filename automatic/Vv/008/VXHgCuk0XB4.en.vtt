00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.830 
I also recommend using some gloves too I
actually<00:00:41.610> didn't<00:00:42.059> use<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.360> gloves<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
actually didn't use the gloves in the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.240 
actually didn't use the gloves in the
video<00:00:43.079> but<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.680> should<00:00:43.890> definitely<00:00:44.219> use

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
video but you should definitely use

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.209 
video but you should definitely use
gloves<00:00:44.579> paint<00:00:44.940> remover<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.559> it<00:00:46.559> hurts<00:00:46.829> and
