 get a job 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.980

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:27.819
 education 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:31.479
 this school in the suburban of the river in technical courses on Saturdays to

 adults at 31 years old alexsandro has moved to a history college that has a course 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.290
 technician

 the work 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.040

 according to the saidinha 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.050
 so it was 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.730
 did i become technical 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.280
 the pope shares the good wage 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.430
 what is known but this also believe that a technical course 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.190
 can open doors and no one complains last Saturday in a laboratory 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.570
 interest in mechatronics changed the life of gerson in this case the students by 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.810
 teacher 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.610
 it was a chat 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:22.960
 exemplary

 thing that I saw in college or have passed the technical course 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.300
 somehow

 had no contact 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.429
 with this universe of museums one of the two public technical bodies 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.030
 You can have your job. 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.400
