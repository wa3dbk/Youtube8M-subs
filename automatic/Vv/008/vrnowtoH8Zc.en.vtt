00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:10.429
 in rallies one of the situations 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.170
 most photographed is the jump that is 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.710
 when the machine detaches the wheels from 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.180
 land a pilot who starts his own 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.150
 competitive career 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.050
 the first photo he wants to have of 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.630
 his first race 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.180
 here is the car with the wheels in flight 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.770
 with the car in flight I never have 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.320
 understand why we land animals 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.109
 we want to fly also because 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.910
 actually when you have wheels 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:35.540
 in flight when the wheels are detached 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.600
 from the ground 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:43.520
 the machine loses speed then do 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.340
 a very high or very long jump does not have 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.320
 no meaning at the level of 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.940
 performance undoubtedly has a large 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.280
 meaning at the level of sympathy of 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.780
 public popularity of applause 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.610
 also by photographers 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.539
 because they manage to make 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.760
 shots of exceptional beauty though 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.980
 first of all it involves great risks 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.780
 the landing that can be brutal 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.389
 compromising the car's trim 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.219
 if not even the breaking of the 

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:13.639
 shock absorbers rather than others 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:16.569
 mechanical details and then the loss 

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:16.569
 the same time 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.450
 when we see Finnish pilots 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.430
 we face jumps because we are excited about it 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.320
 let's see that they do both high jumps and 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.590
 of long jumps 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.110
 I state that in the races like the 1000 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.940
 lakes in finland 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.340
 one third of the race is done with the 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.270
 wheels detached from the ground because why 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.380
 the land conforms to the various 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.330
 undulations of the road surface and so on 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.030
 lead to the car often flying between 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.470
 one a hump and the other 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.570
 but here too there are two techniques 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.580
 different to deal with this type of 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:03.560
 skip the tooth jump, which means I jump a lot 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.560
 a very high angle then one 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.619
 uphill step should be addressed in 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.709
 deceleration at the entrance of the 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.840
 hump jump to then give it a shot 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.570
 of accelerator in the climax part 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.800
 of this jump so that the car 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:24.050
 I take an upward and downward momentum 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.140
 flight path does not go to 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.209
 plant the in between the nose of the 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.500
 machine on the ground during the phase of 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.709
 landing 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.230
 while in the softer jump then in 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.480
 a very long hump that faces to 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.390
 a higher speed 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.850
 the pilot must never detach the 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.170
 pedal the foot from the accelerator or the 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.970
 gas pedal 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.310
 just because the car has to go 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.239
 of momentum and takes a trajectory 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.160
 very very parallel to the ground for one 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.989
 very very long distance 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.610
 logically as I said earlier, minus 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.870
 minos system stamp before you can 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.380
 to accelerate 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.870
 the important thing is to accompany the jump that 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.239
 make sure that the car rides in 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.510
 detached from the ground for or almost in 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.580
 same direction as the road surface 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.350
 so two techniques in a lot of jumps 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.780
 acute slow down make the leap into 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.600
 acceleration in very long jumps 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.070
 make it incomplete speed 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.239
 I state that it is very important 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:28.040
 especially in the landing phase 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.630
 wait to accelerate because why 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.890
 first of all we risk having a 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.240
 out of engine speed because not 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.400
 there being wheels 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.820
 in the ground because the laps are in flight 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.500
 of the engine increases dramatically and 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.810
 so easy to break or break 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.090
 some particular mechanics and then 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.830
 also important in the phase of 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.690
 landing and here the image of the sky 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.820
 prove to wait a moment 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.850
 speed up because why speed 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.280
 of the car that flew is no longer 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.070
 equal to the speed of the wheels when 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.150
 they came off they detached from the 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.360
 ground 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.760
 therefore, the difference in speed and 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.650
 the inertia of the wheels can 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.630
 go and break the transmission then 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.790
 to wait to land 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.800
 just the car and the pilot hears it 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.960
 for the blow he put the wheels on the ground 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.549
 then heart speed up because the wheels 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.940
 they are going at the same speed 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.940
 of the car 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.500
 to
