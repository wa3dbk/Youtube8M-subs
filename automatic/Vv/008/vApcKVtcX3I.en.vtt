00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
much as I can using this gyro sensor the

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.140 
much as I can using this gyro sensor the
sensor<00:02:05.530> at<00:02:05.979> least<00:02:06.280> allows<00:02:06.610> me<00:02:06.820> to<00:02:06.970> have<00:02:07.000> a

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
sensor at least allows me to have a

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.880 
sensor at least allows me to have a
little<00:02:07.450> more<00:02:07.690> immersion<00:02:08.080> into<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.440> game<00:02:08.590> as<00:02:08.860> a

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
little more immersion into the game as a

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.199 
little more immersion into the game as a

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
new ground the sensor to your

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.120 
new ground the sensor to your
relationship<00:02:10.929> and<00:02:11.560> as<00:02:11.770> you<00:02:11.920> could<00:02:12.070> see

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
relationship and as you could see

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.460 
relationship and as you could see
through<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.640> gameplay<00:02:13.209> it's<00:02:13.990> really<00:02:14.320> the

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
through the gameplay it's really the

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.440 
through the gameplay it's really the
