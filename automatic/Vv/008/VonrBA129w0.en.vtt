 newspaper channel let's greet them ni 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.910
 more or less than their friendship and by aga 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.820
 débora in our channel we will present 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.130
 gameplays reviews tutorials and news 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.259
 of the jungle legend on this occasion 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.640
 to reopen the channel and 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.640
 We will present a review of 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.670
 the legend of zelda ocarina of time 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:42.400
 in 1996 work began on the 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.160
 new cell project no more and no less 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.200
 that a cell for nintendo 64 the 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.970
 expectation was huge because I had to 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.580
 overcome the last success of the super 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.739
 nintendo the aud into the past 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.200
 and so it was nintendo surprised with a 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.270
 game that for many is considered the 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.340
 best game of zelda and for the most 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.340
 daring the best game in the world 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.600
 ocarina of time was the first delivery 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.119
 in incorporating a world of third 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.940
 dimension with the graphic potential of 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.890
 nintendo 64 they explored many new 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.899
 commands of movements with 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.149
 controls that the objects were used 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.070
 which was much more practical than in 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.680
 previous deliveries where only 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.930
 you could have one object at a time without a doubt 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.000
 the most transcendental command and that 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.880
 endures so far is the approach 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.030
 inavic 11 is indispensable at the time of 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.920
 many battles still feels first has 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.500
 been fantastic that the 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.390
 boots on the buttons and thus save the 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.679
 Tedious visits to the menu in the temple 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.679
 of water and subsequent 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.960
 for many the ocarina of time event 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.000
 It is the best in the world and it is not for less 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.700
 Well the world of hardware 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.009
 offers a very sui generis landscape from 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.140
 the mountains to the desert from the 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.390
 forest to the cemetery every temple 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.759
 offers a completely different challenge to 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.619
 the previous one the enemies are colorful and 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.119
 entertained I want to forget the 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.160
 eternal confrontations that we gave ourselves 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.590
 with the spaces in the nights of the 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.110
 cyrus fields and the bosses follow me 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.209
 Alternate riddles are the best 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.160
 they are also very entertaining and they make 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.590
 the game is never over like the search 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.959
 of the pieces of the heart or the scales 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.180
 gilts as well as the sale of masks and 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.569
 the sometimes endless I think that 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.909
 is to get it bigger answer 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.780
 you can not ask much of a console 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:37.120
 of 1996 but for its time it was a game 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.069
 of advanced graphics textures 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.319
 they were remarkable and the animations of the 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.239
 fights were perfect not to mention the 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.370
 graphic bingo that was given by lalín tute 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.230
 peace to the ocarina and the attractiveness 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.629
 visual that offered in the landscapes as 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.790
 the fields jairo the colossus of the desert 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.790
 or the inya lake that were awesome 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.220
 the soundtrack of ocarina of time is 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.230
 collection the most songs 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.300
 representative and remembered of the game 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.300
 they are the cell lullaby 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.700
 the song of time 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:36.800
 and the Sharia song in the fields 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.260
 Jairo will change the classic theme that 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.510
 had from the 1 cent and it is addressed another 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.250
 same web at every moment of the 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.110
 story you play a song 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.390
 fully in line at the time 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.090
 you live what makes you transport yourself to 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.950
 where are you playing 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.840
 It would be a sin not to stress the 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.480
 vital importance that music has in 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.940
 this game is with the ocarina with the 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.620
 you can transport yourself and make it rain 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.840
 even be day or night with a 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.180
 song whose quality is not for nothing 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.580
 despicable are played with the genres 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.799
 of high culture songs minutes 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.360
 boleros requiem is a whole repertoire 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.360
 musical worthy of host art 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.989
 ocarina of time is the one of legend of zelda 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.000
 par excellence was my first zelda and of 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.550
 sure also that of many the gameplay 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.470
 It is excellent and with the ship company 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.380
 the eternal and annoying in the companion 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.030
 better transports you through many places and 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:34.530
 is a game that you can never 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:36.540
 boring so you spend it 25 8 11 times then 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.240
 you will never finish discovering all your 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.370
 secrets although in reality to me 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.410
 would have liked to play for example the 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.420
 temple of light some other little things 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.490
 like the medallions of the wise 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.070
 they had powers or that the 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.740
 trifuerza in order despite my 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.540
 Caprices is an excellent game and although 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.630
 we know that it is an overrated game 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.340
 over other cells like all actresses 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.560
 skyward sword does not take away from being a 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.960
 magnificent game that may not be the 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.509
 best in the world but 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.430
 in newspapers of jaime we give a 10 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:09.949
 'honoris causa' to this game 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.110
 transcendental in the legend of zelda 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.580
 I am falls down here evora and I say goodbye 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.889
