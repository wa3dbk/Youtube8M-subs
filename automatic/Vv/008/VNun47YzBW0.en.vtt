one of the things to notice on or to
point<00:02:05.909> out<00:02:06.090> on<00:02:06.329> Rocksteady<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.319> we<00:02:07.710> in

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
point out on Rocksteady is that we in

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.260 
point out on Rocksteady is that we in
package<00:02:08.700> these<00:02:09.420> come<00:02:09.990> reversed<00:02:10.880> not<00:02:11.880> from<00:02:12.120> leg

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
package these come reversed not from leg

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.199 
package these come reversed not from leg
the<00:02:12.390> leg<00:02:12.569> but<00:02:13.170> they<00:02:13.620> are<00:02:13.880> they're<00:02:14.880> swapped

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
the leg but they are they're swapped

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.910 
the leg but they are they're swapped
around<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:15.780> they're<00:02:16.470> actually<00:02:16.620> like<00:02:16.830> if

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
around so that they're actually like if

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.980 
around so that they're actually like if
you<00:02:16.980> took<00:02:17.459> them<00:02:17.610> off<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.000> turn<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.870> whole

at<00:02:21.270> this<00:02:21.390> pin<00:02:22.040> they're<00:02:23.040> on<00:02:23.160> backwards<00:02:23.640> you

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
at this pin they're on backwards you

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.670 
at this pin they're on backwards you
have<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.300> heat<00:02:24.420> them<00:02:24.570> up<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.080> kind<00:02:25.410> of<00:02:25.470> pry

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
have to heat them up and kind of pry

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.650 
have to heat them up and kind of pry
them<00:02:25.890> off<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.160> pin<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.580> swap<00:02:27.180> this<00:02:27.390> part

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
them off the pin and swap this part

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.790 
them off the pin and swap this part
around<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:27.930> can<00:02:28.050> pop<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.380> foot<00:02:28.530> off

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
around you can pop the foot off

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.730 
around you can pop the foot off
you<00:02:28.890> want<00:02:29.390> but<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.480> since<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.050> foot<00:02:31.290> swivels

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
you want but the since the foot swivels

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.350 
you want but the since the foot swivels
around<00:02:31.800> basically<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:32.880> would<00:02:32.940> be<00:02:33.000> like<00:02:33.090> if<00:02:33.270> the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
around basically it would be like if the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.570 
around basically it would be like if the
foot<00:02:33.540> came<00:02:33.720> like<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:34.200> but<00:02:34.920> then<00:02:35.040> attached<00:02:35.370> at

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
foot came like this but then attached at

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.150 
foot came like this but then attached at
the<00:02:35.610> knee<00:02:35.850> around<00:02:36.540> backwards<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:38.010> if<00:02:38.100> you

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
the knee around backwards and if you

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.590 
the knee around backwards and if you
turn<00:02:38.340> him<00:02:38.370> around<00:02:38.490> they<00:02:38.730> fit<00:02:38.970> much<00:02:39.180> better<00:02:39.210> and

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
turn him around they fit much better and

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.840 
turn him around they fit much better and
they're<00:02:39.690> much<00:02:39.810> nicer<00:02:40.230> it's<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.950> lot<00:02:41.070> of<00:02:41.160> work

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
they're much nicer it's a lot of work

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.790 
they're much nicer it's a lot of work
there's<00:02:42.300> tutorials<00:02:42.870> online<00:02:43.050> but<00:02:43.530> just<00:02:43.710> know

so yeah they're really cool bee-bop's

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.780 
so yeah they're really cool bee-bop's
the<00:02:49.080> same<00:02:49.260> way<00:02:49.410> he's<00:02:49.650> got<00:02:49.800> a<00:02:49.860> like<00:02:50.130> his<00:02:50.610> head

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790

the same way he's got a like his head
move<00:02:50.940> it's<00:02:51.090> limited<00:02:51.510> but<00:02:51.660> he<00:02:51.900> can<00:02:52.110> turn<00:02:52.290> side

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
move it's limited but he can turn side

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.990 
move it's limited but he can turn side
to<00:02:52.710> side<00:02:52.890> he<00:02:53.040> can<00:02:53.160> go<00:02:53.280> up<00:02:53.460> and<00:02:53.580> down<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.760> little

to side he can go up and down a little

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.090 
to side he can go up and down a little
bit<00:02:54.210> he<00:02:54.960> doesn't<00:02:55.200> have<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.320> huge<00:02:55.650> ab<00:02:55.830> crunch

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
like this so yeah they're a little I

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.210 
like this so yeah they're a little I
think<00:04:21.750> technically<00:04:22.230> up<00:04:22.350> to<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.710> top<00:04:22.919> of<00:04:23.100> their

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
think technically up to the top of their

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.000 
think technically up to the top of their
heads<00:04:23.490> bebop<00:04:24.060> and<00:04:24.210> rocksteady<00:04:24.650> have<00:04:25.650> just<00:04:25.919> a

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
heads bebop and rocksteady have just a

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.280 
heads bebop and rocksteady have just a
slight<00:04:26.280> height<00:04:26.790> advantage<00:04:27.030> on<00:04:27.390> Michelangelo

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
slight height advantage on Michelangelo

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.590 
slight height advantage on Michelangelo
not<00:04:28.740> by<00:04:28.919> much<00:04:29.190> if<00:04:29.430> any<00:04:29.640> I<00:04:29.880> think<00:04:30.120> I<00:04:30.300> think<00:04:30.480> it's

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
not by much if any I think I think it's

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.450 
not by much if any I think I think it's
like<00:04:30.690> it's<00:04:30.810> really<00:04:30.930> Bebop's<00:04:31.410> Mohawk<00:04:31.890> if

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
like it's really Bebop's Mohawk if

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.090 
like it's really Bebop's Mohawk if
anything<00:04:32.850> that<00:04:32.970> puts<00:04:33.150> him<00:04:33.270> taller<00:04:33.600> than

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
anything that puts him taller than

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.620 
anything that puts him taller than
Michelangelo<00:04:35.180> and<00:04:36.180> then<00:04:36.300> that's<00:04:36.480> a<00:04:36.510> little

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
Michelangelo and then that's a little

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.180 
Michelangelo and then that's a little
disappointing<00:04:37.169> because<00:04:37.260> like<00:04:37.560> I<00:04:37.800> was

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
disappointing because like I was

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.029 
disappointing because like I was
expecting<00:04:38.640> to<00:04:38.729> be<00:04:38.850> more<00:04:39.150> in<00:04:40.080> scale<00:04:40.590> I<00:04:40.620> guess

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
expecting to be more in scale I guess

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:42.140 
expecting to be more in scale I guess
with<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.700> Turtles

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
with the Turtles

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.030 
with the Turtles
because<00:04:42.510> well<00:04:42.960> like<00:04:43.230> I<00:04:43.440> don't<00:04:43.620> think<00:04:43.770> I<00:04:43.980> don't

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
because well like I don't think I don't

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.020 
because well like I don't think I don't
think<00:04:44.160> people<00:04:44.340> in<00:04:44.520> Rocksteady<00:04:44.910> were

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
think people in Rocksteady were

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.570 
think people in Rocksteady were
necessarily<00:04:45.390> huge<00:04:46.020> in<00:04:46.350> the<00:04:46.710> old<00:04:46.860> cartoon<00:04:47.280> and

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
necessarily huge in the old cartoon and

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.070 
necessarily huge in the old cartoon and
like<00:04:47.670> any<00:04:47.910> old<00:04:48.120> cartoon<00:04:48.510> there<00:04:48.690> are<00:04:48.780> scale

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
like any old cartoon there are scale

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.770 
like any old cartoon there are scale
issues<00:04:49.410> in<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.590> animation<00:04:50.070> but<00:04:50.730> they<00:04:51.660> were

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
issues in the animation but they were

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.020 
issues in the animation but they were
definitely<00:04:52.050> bigger<00:04:52.410> than<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:52.710> turtles<00:04:53.040> and<00:04:53.250> I

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
definitely bigger than the turtles and I

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.090 
definitely bigger than the turtles and I
can<00:04:54.210> hear<00:04:54.510> you<00:04:54.600> can<00:04:54.690> see<00:04:54.900> like<00:04:55.080> even<00:04:55.260> when<00:04:55.980> you

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
consider that Bebop's taller like it and

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.890 
consider that Bebop's taller like it and
especially<00:04:58.650> what<00:04:59.040> Mikey<00:04:59.730> and<00:04:59.970> and<00:05:00.180> Rocksteady

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
especially what Mikey and and Rocksteady

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.070 
especially what Mikey and and Rocksteady
there<00:05:01.140> Mikey<00:05:01.800> has<00:05:01.950> more<00:05:02.430> mass<00:05:03.020> and<00:05:04.020> that

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
there Mikey has more mass and that

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
wasn't the case on the old cartoon so so

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.330

to<00:05:20.760> the<00:05:21.060> turtles<00:05:21.360> themselves<00:05:21.840> I<00:05:21.990> think

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
to the turtles themselves I think

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.770 
to the turtles themselves I think
they're<00:05:22.500> all<00:05:22.590> great<00:05:22.770> figures<00:05:23.420> the<00:05:24.420> turtles

think you said they've taken some

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.610

liberties<00:05:54.600> with<00:05:54.840> the<00:05:54.990> design<00:05:55.380> they're

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
liberties with the design they're

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.980 
liberties with the design they're
