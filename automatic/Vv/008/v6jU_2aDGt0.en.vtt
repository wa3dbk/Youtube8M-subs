00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.650
 very good guys we are again in 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.080
 minecraft to bring you a new one to 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.970
 minecraft 1.7 points 2 called oit in 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.590
 sets works according to that so we 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.720
 you come charging to install it and good 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.700
 Well, we got what the mod is about 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.100
 times we have so many trunks here 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.360
 put 6 for putting something but let's 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.210
 put that our survival world 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.550
 we have 50 trunks and all the trunks 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.150
 we have them as we have a 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.540
 paula yes is even like that and all that 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:42.420
 We have full of kobe or orÃ©s etc. 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.160
 and we can not find any object 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.960
 then maybe we have here a 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.359
 boat was looking for a boat who 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.090
 You know why but we did not find it 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:53.370
 then we are going to help us because 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.100
 will point us in what part of what 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.870
 chest is the object that we are not 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.269
 looking for we just have to know 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.649
 the name in English is then worth 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.080
 example right now that I'm in 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.670
 inventory in creative I have several uses 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.740
 he is using it while he is getting 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.260
 some of the objects within these 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.820
 chests and for example I'm going to look for a 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.600
 Apple is really worth going to put 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.909
 search 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.740
 space apple and as you see it will appear 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.630
 an incognito first 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.790
 an weather star plus an apple 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.860
 here even in the name of apple in the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.689
 chest and in the part of the chest in which 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.640
 is the apple for example if 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.380
 I open this because as you can see it is in this 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.869
 upper part of the chest so it is 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.670
 on the left side and it would be the apple 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.520
 and in this case, we have the chest 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.500
 normal to be charged only and what 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.899
 we also have in this part if I put 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.700
 for example we are going to put diamonds 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.990
 word that I have another one as well as 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.030
 you see we have the diamond sword too 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.729
 indicated in this chest and it is just going to 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.080
 pass the same thing if I put that bow by 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.020
 example let's see we have the 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.459
 arcs we have a here and another one in this 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.170
 another part does not matter if the arch is already 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:57.899
 enchanted and others we simply look for 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.270
 a bow and we will find it and then I do not know 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.890
 we also have a boat here 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.360
 as the one who got here as those who 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.819
 also here is tucked two chests 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.530
 and even the TNT that has also seen 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.479
 while I was looking in the chests that 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.459
 I was also around here at the end I'm not going 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.980
 to play write it there but not like 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.900
 you see this chest I have tnt and here is 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.430
 where it appears we have a problem with 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.959
 this mode is good, we really have 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.220
 two problems on the one hand we have to 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.660
 use because to the latest version 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:27.440
 because from the version 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.360
 and 1,065 if I'm not mistaken, it's a 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.550
 from what works if you do not 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.140
 we use because then not only not 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.700
 the mod will work but it will create 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.170
 minecraft every time we try this way 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.600
 that if you have the problem that you play 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.430
 the mod and class to minecraft or 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.840
 it's just that you do not have to go to the 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.700
 jorge page to download the new 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.610
 version and it will work perfectly 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.590
 without any fault we also have 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.080
 another problem like that for example we have 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.210
 here I do not know we had here as a 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.130
 carrot is worth but I for example I have 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.980
 this way I have the chests in this way 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.710
 and the carrot happens that 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.820
 is in the lower part of the chest 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.680
 so I put search carrot and although 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.140
 here it appears here I have a 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.550
 carrot here is not seen because because 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.560
 is inside this chest then yes 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.440
 will open this chest would even be a 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.570
 little the letters as you see but of course 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.090
 This box does is cover if 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.760
 something like that you see how the carrot turns and 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.230
 I can see it but it's much more 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.730
 difficult to find objects in this way 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.890
 therefore I would recommend if you go to 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.540
 use this mode to go to the chests 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.420
 in this way at least good this what 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.030
 you can do for example 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.860
 and put them next to each other but 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.810
 always have a separation in the 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.550
 height a separation of a block to 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.790
 able to see the letters and see the 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.260
 objects that you have in each box not 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.090
 so I think it's pretty good 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.950
 I think it's pretty cool this way 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.569
 just like utility and good guys 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.489
 If I have put a small cut here 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.709
 because I tried if it worked in 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.200
 multiplayer before saying goodbye to this 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.269
 video however it does not work so 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.250
 It will only work in your games of 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.440
 in single player where you have objects 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.209
 lost will not work like cac so 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.010
 I'm happy a lot we have a lot of 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.810
 that does not work as cac because it would 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.330
 a lot of advantage for example in games 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.190
 of hunger 'and at least on the servers 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.380
 I've proven that there have been some 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.970
 premium and others not premium because it has not 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.370
 worked neither in games of hunger nor in 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.959
 survival or in any other type of game 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.370
 so guys I end up with this mode 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.870
 I hope you liked it a lot 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.400
 well press like and favorites we'll see you in 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.150
 the next video 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.150
 see you later
