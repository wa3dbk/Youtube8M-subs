his
a<00:04:23.210> sick<00:04:24.210> vest<00:04:25.199> on<00:04:26.039> I<00:04:26.520> know<00:04:27.120> before<00:04:27.630> I<00:04:28.069> unboxed

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:29.069 
a sick vest on I know before I unboxed

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:33.710 
a sick vest on I know before I unboxed
him<00:04:29.250> completely<00:04:30.060> that<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.259> seat<00:04:31.680> is<00:04:32.720> damaged

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
him completely that the seat is damaged

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.920 
him completely that the seat is damaged
and<00:04:33.990> that<00:04:34.020> is<00:04:34.319> a<00:04:34.349> major<00:04:35.330> quality<00:04:36.330> control<00:04:36.720> flaw

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
and that is a major quality control flaw

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.909 
and that is a major quality control flaw
but<00:04:37.740> I<00:04:38.599> know<00:04:39.599> this<00:04:39.930> is<00:04:40.020> gonna<00:04:40.110> sound<00:04:40.199> weird<00:04:40.530> but

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
but I know this is gonna sound weird but

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.409 
but I know this is gonna sound weird but
I<00:04:40.949> kind<00:04:41.039> of<00:04:41.340> like<00:04:41.550> how<00:04:41.699> it<00:04:41.849> looks<00:04:42.060> better<00:04:42.300> I

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
I kind of like how it looks better I

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.020 
I kind of like how it looks better I
know<00:04:42.539> it's<00:04:42.870> totally<00:04:43.319> inaccurate<00:04:44.280> but<00:04:44.430> it<00:04:44.580> it

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
know it's totally inaccurate but it it

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.029 
know it's totally inaccurate but it it
looks<00:04:45.330> like<00:04:45.509> it's<00:04:45.660> battle<00:04:46.080> damaged<00:04:46.560> or<00:04:46.740> a<00:04:46.770> new

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
looks like it's battle damaged or a new

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:48.950 
looks like it's battle damaged or a new
design<00:04:47.430> and<00:04:47.460> I<00:04:47.699> think<00:04:47.729> it<00:04:48.030> actually<00:04:48.240> looks

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
design and I think it actually looks

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.760 
design and I think it actually looks
pretty<00:04:49.050> cool<00:04:49.789> but<00:04:50.789> it<00:04:51.660> is<00:04:51.990> a<00:04:52.440> flaw<00:04:52.970> and<00:04:54.650> it's<00:04:55.650> a

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
pretty cool but it is a flaw and it's a

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.129 
pretty cool but it is a flaw and it's a
pretty<00:04:55.979> glaring<00:04:56.699> flaw<00:04:56.940> if<00:04:57.180> you<00:04:57.419> ask<00:04:57.630> me<00:04:57.930> I

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
pretty glaring flaw if you ask me I

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.650 
pretty glaring flaw if you ask me I
don't<00:04:58.919> know<00:04:59.009> how<00:04:59.190> this<00:04:59.460> made<00:04:59.820> it<00:05:00.000> out<00:05:00.330> of<00:05:00.599> the

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
don't know how this made it out of the

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.510 
don't know how this made it out of the
production<00:05:01.110> line<00:05:01.139> because<00:05:02.360> it's<00:05:03.360> pretty<00:05:03.539> bad

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
production line because it's pretty bad

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.860 
production line because it's pretty bad
do<00:05:05.520> you<00:05:05.580> guys<00:05:05.759> think<00:05:06.000> that's<00:05:06.150> as<00:05:06.330> bad<00:05:06.570> as<00:05:06.630> I'm

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
do you guys think that's as bad as I'm

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.020 
do you guys think that's as bad as I'm
making<00:05:07.020> it<00:05:07.289> out<00:05:07.410> to<00:05:07.440> be<00:05:07.590> let<00:05:08.550> me<00:05:08.580> know<00:05:08.849> in<00:05:09.000> the

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
making it out to be let me know in the

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.570 
making it out to be let me know in the
comments<00:05:09.539> and<00:05:09.630> also<00:05:09.810> I<00:05:10.289> think<00:05:10.800> this<00:05:11.039> review<00:05:11.430> is

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
comments and also I think this review is

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.430 
comments and also I think this review is
done<00:05:11.789> because<00:05:12.300> I<00:05:12.389> basically<00:05:12.570> said<00:05:13.169> that<00:05:13.320> this

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
done because I basically said that this

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.110 
done because I basically said that this
is<00:05:13.650> sick<00:05:14.009> and<00:05:14.250> that<00:05:14.610> you<00:05:14.699> should<00:05:14.849> probably

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
is sick and that you should probably

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.370 
is sick and that you should probably
pick<00:05:15.360> it<00:05:15.509> up<00:05:15.599> and<00:05:15.750> I'm<00:05:15.840> kind<00:05:16.050> of<00:05:16.080> glad<00:05:16.199> that

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
pick it up and I'm kind of glad that

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.529 
pick it up and I'm kind of glad that
they<00:05:16.680> have<00:05:16.889> three<00:05:17.250> per<00:05:17.460> case<00:05:17.759> even<00:05:18.449> though

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:18.539 
they have three per case even though

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:20.570 
they have three per case even though
it's<00:05:18.690> upsetting<00:05:19.169> that<00:05:19.440> sergeant<00:05:20.280> slaughter

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
it's upsetting that sergeant slaughter

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.260 
it's upsetting that sergeant slaughter
and<00:05:20.909> trish<00:05:21.210> stratus<00:05:21.240> are<00:05:21.870> short<00:05:22.800> packed<00:05:23.270> that

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
and trish stratus are short packed that

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.450 
and trish stratus are short packed that
means<00:05:24.630> that<00:05:25.050> you<00:05:25.169> most<00:05:25.470> likely<00:05:25.889> can<00:05:26.039> get<00:05:26.190> this

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
means that you most likely can get this
