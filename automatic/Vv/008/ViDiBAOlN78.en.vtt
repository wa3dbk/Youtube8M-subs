00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
of questions about and I'm pretty much

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.070 
of questions about and I'm pretty much
tired<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:11.309> answering<00:00:11.670> entering<00:00:12.630> them<00:00:12.809> each

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
tired of answering entering them each

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.470 
tired of answering entering them each
and<00:00:13.290> every<00:00:13.410> time<00:00:13.590> first<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.759> foremost<00:00:14.940> my

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480

enchanting<00:00:15.990> drill<00:00:16.260> yes<00:00:16.949> this<00:00:17.190> diamond<00:00:17.490> drill

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
enchanting drill yes this diamond drill

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.570 
enchanting drill yes this diamond drill
has<00:00:18.090> an<00:00:18.210> efficiency<00:00:18.630> X<00:00:19.050> in<00:00:19.380> chant<00:00:19.650> which<00:00:20.340> means

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
has an efficiency X in chant which means

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.150 
has an efficiency X in chant which means
it<00:00:20.789> breaks<00:00:21.029> stuff<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.480> lot<00:00:21.600> faster<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.199> as<00:00:22.980> far

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
it breaks stuff a lot faster and as far

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.099 
it breaks stuff a lot faster and as far
as<00:00:23.220> i<00:00:23.369> know<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.789> enchanted<00:00:24.300> drill<00:00:24.480> breaks

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
as i know that enchanted drill breaks

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.859 
as i know that enchanted drill breaks
everything<00:00:25.560> pretty<00:00:25.949> much<00:00:26.039> as<00:00:26.369> fast<00:00:26.609> as

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
everything pretty much as fast as

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.019 
everything pretty much as fast as
anything<00:00:27.869> can<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.400> can't<00:00:29.400> go<00:00:29.670> any<00:00:29.849> faster

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
anything can you can't go any faster

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.530 
anything can you can't go any faster
than<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.359> as<00:00:30.599> far<00:00:30.750> as<00:00:30.810> i<00:00:30.960> know<00:00:31.140> however<00:00:31.949> you

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
than that as far as i know however you

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.810 
than that as far as i know however you
pretty<00:00:33.540> much<00:00:33.600> cannot<00:00:34.110> create<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.649> anymore<00:00:35.040> why

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
pretty much cannot create it anymore why

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.090 
pretty much cannot create it anymore why
is<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.000> because<00:00:36.270> as<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:37.350> see<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.800> diamond

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
is that because as you see the diamond

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.139 
is that because as you see the diamond
drill<00:00:38.309> ID<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:39.590> 30-23<00:00:40.590> for<00:00:40.860> now<00:00:41.700> if<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.940> try<00:00:42.120> to

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
drill ID is 30-23 for now if you try to

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.750 
drill ID is 30-23 for now if you try to
take<00:00:42.450> out<00:00:42.660> any<00:00:43.079> other<00:00:43.559> drill<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.219> see<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.579> has

take out any other drill you see it has
column<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.809> then<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.440> durability<00:00:46.770> count<00:00:47.190> and

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
column and then the durability count and

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.049 
column and then the durability count and
if<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.750> try<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.930> enchant<00:00:49.520> and<00:00:50.520> that's<00:00:50.760> for

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
if you try to enchant and that's for

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.330 
if you try to enchant and that's for
instance<00:00:51.329> let's<00:00:51.719> have<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.500> source<00:00:53.160> for

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
instance let's have a source for

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.340 
instance let's have a source for
comparison<00:00:53.879> if<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.329> try<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.539> enchant<00:00:54.989> with

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
comparison if you try to enchant with

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
the drill you cannot this is something

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.760 
the drill you cannot this is something
you<00:01:13.950> simply<00:01:14.100> cannot<00:01:14.490> do<00:01:14.760> even<00:01:15.390> if<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.810> take

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
you simply cannot do even if you take

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.890 
you simply cannot do even if you take
the<00:01:16.950> drill<00:01:17.250> while<00:01:17.759> shift<00:01:18.330> clicking<00:01:18.720> and

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
the drill while shift clicking and

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.830 
the drill while shift clicking and
supposedly<00:01:19.560> heat<00:01:20.040> as<00:01:20.250> no<00:01:20.549> durability<00:01:20.909> as<00:01:21.720> you

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
supposedly heat as no durability as you

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.980 
supposedly heat as no durability as you
can<00:01:21.990> see<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:23.130> not<00:01:23.250> acting<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.700> way<00:01:24.000> it's

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
can see it's not acting the way it's

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.429 
can see it's not acting the way it's
supposed<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.500> act<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.090> reason<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:28.049> way

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
supposed to act so the reason I the way

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.929 
supposed to act so the reason I the way
I<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.920> drill<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.220> simply<00:01:29.640> because<00:01:29.909> I

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
I have this drill is simply because I

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.149 
I have this drill is simply because I
had<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.360> before<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:31.049> change<00:01:31.619> was<00:01:31.770> made<00:01:31.829> to

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
had it before a change was made to

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.850 
had it before a change was made to
industrialcraft<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.240> which<00:01:34.200> made<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.619> drill

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
industrialcraft and which made the drill

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.100 
industrialcraft and which made the drill
possible<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.460> use<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.600> way<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.750> still<00:01:36.930> keep

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
possible to use and the way I still keep

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.230 
possible to use and the way I still keep
it<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.500> because<00:01:37.770> i'm<00:01:37.890> using<00:01:37.920> any<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.340> since

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
it it's because i'm using any I since

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.730 
it it's because i'm using any I since
you<00:01:39.360> can<00:01:39.509> save<00:01:40.280> loaded<00:01:42.500> configurations<00:01:43.500> I

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
you can save loaded configurations I

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.069 
you can save loaded configurations I
have<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.790> configuration<00:01:45.210> with<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.750> shanty

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
have this configuration with the shanty

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.230 
have this configuration with the shanty
drill<00:01:46.290> saved<00:01:46.619> over<00:01:46.860> since<00:01:47.490> previous<00:01:47.729> previous

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
drill saved over since previous previous

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.880 
drill saved over since previous previous
versions<00:01:49.369> so<00:01:50.540> if<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.840> want<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.380> get<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.680> type

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
versions so if you want to get this type

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.270 
versions so if you want to get this type
of<00:01:53.159> drill<00:01:53.880> yourself<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:55.500> only<00:01:55.710> solution<00:01:56.159> I

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
of drill yourself the only solution I

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.780 
of drill yourself the only solution I
can<00:01:56.310> think<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.329> by

are in cheat mode you can simply

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.770 
are in cheat mode you can simply
right-click<00:02:29.380> some<00:02:30.380> weather<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:31.660> if<00:02:32.660> you

I did so it's a very useful option and

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.470 
I did so it's a very useful option and
last<00:02:47.420> but<00:02:47.480> not<00:02:47.660> least<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:50.060> way<00:02:50.209> I'm

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
last but not least and the way I'm

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.470 
last but not least and the way I'm

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160

I<00:02:58.040> really<00:02:58.280> like<00:02:58.670> flying<00:02:59.470> while<00:03:00.470> building<00:03:01.190> of

I and for testing purposes you can
simply<00:03:23.540> take<00:03:23.900> it<00:03:24.019> out<00:03:24.110> of<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.610> inventory<00:03:25.610> here

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
simply take it out of the inventory here

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.970 
simply take it out of the inventory here
and<00:03:27.080> unlike<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.840> unlike<00:03:29.840> any<00:03:30.019> other<00:03:30.260> flying

mechanism<00:03:31.700> that<00:03:32.060> other<00:03:32.660> multiply<00:03:33.200> this<00:03:33.950> one

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
mechanism that other multiply this one

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.330 
mechanism that other multiply this one
doesn't<00:03:34.700> have<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:34.940> ability<00:03:35.390> doesn't<00:03:35.810> consume

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
doesn't have the ability doesn't consume

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.430 
doesn't have the ability doesn't consume
item<00:03:37.340> doesn't<00:03:37.549> consume<00:03:37.880> anything<00:03:38.150> it<00:03:38.959> simply

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
item doesn't consume anything it simply

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.430 
item doesn't consume anything it simply
works<00:03:39.790> so<00:03:40.790> it's<00:03:41.180> a<00:03:41.239> very<00:03:41.269> great<00:03:41.780> solution<00:03:42.260> for

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
works so it's a very great solution for

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.940 
works so it's a very great solution for
