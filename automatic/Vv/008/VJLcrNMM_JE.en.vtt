 My laptop trading cards are back here 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.230
 Welcome to us on the 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.380

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.090
 yukio openings i say extra openings 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.420
 because we have two things right 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.640
 But first of all we are new 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.650
 cover with the new structure and the 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.660
 this is rampage structure deck 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.629
 As always German edition first edition 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.390
 that's what things look like in our work 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:41.540
 briefly with what you are standing behind 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.150
 and catch the gear here 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.710
 monsters running amok collecting their powers 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.150
 and powerful machines 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.430
 looking forward to the battle 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.619
 this feature day brings you an army 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.729
 of machines driven by living 

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:58.250
 be driven blablabla so monster 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:59.690
 cards came clean cards came extra 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.159
 Thick as that is with such a work 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.710
 prefabricated 38.2 ultra 2 super he one 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.590
 operation game document we look 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.120
 but everything more accurate and indeed 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.290
 I would say 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:18.140
 by brutally tearing up here 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.760
 as we always do and then hide 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.610
 within this leaks first time 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.890
 that we once have the package 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.140
 with the cards that was why first to 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.390
 page 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:33.740
 a short info and that's how you play 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.600
 So help this thick info gear 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.760
 gear then discovers the next gear 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.040
 to insert a short explanation on the 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.040
 back blanco means for me 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.890
 paper waste this plastic finger is that 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.170
 everything 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.260
 Let's take a moment to talk about it 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.000
 the gambling pad that is very 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.970
 idyllic game documents that is 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.680
 namely hard printed what she is just up 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.750
 paper printed but still 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.760
 Of course we have to look at each other 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:11.110
 for the sake of completeness and the 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:17.160
 starts here and looks like that 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:20.710
 is the gambling repository of ghd 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.480
 So we start together again 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.760
 honestly, I do not have any 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.810
 use for these things at the landing 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.030
 us in the paper waste i have somehow i 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.040
 do not know how finished are the 50 ticks 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.720
 or so and when I do that gradually 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.190
 All the uprising will be these games 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.630
 all documents sometime in the paper waste 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.240
 should land there any interest 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.100
 have to contact us if you have 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.110
 us the postage pays you the things 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.260
 In any case like to have or throw 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.660
 as I said, just in the garbage 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.950
 but now to the essentials 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.650
 Essentials are in such a victory 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.780
 Of course the cards are back 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.390
 back yes well and we start x i 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.739
 make the thing for the people in the 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.700
 know web chat you might know 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.040
 this glue here 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.290
 that is a foil the Christians never 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.910
 back off your finger now works 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.320
 but usually one is five 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.170
 minutes on the fingers 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.390
 I do not know yet how those of you 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.070
 who got himself some relax 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.840
 have to watch the video now because they are 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.370
 Just want to see what's in there 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.350
 the new track was so in there 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.120
 maybe write my your comments 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.950
 if he also with this film around so 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.480
 is covered around so huge problems has 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.160
 depends partly two minutes on the 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.050
 Fingering is static electrostatic 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.110
 The Christians do not dismiss as 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.750
 just shit this with you 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:39.000

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:44.519
 an ultra ria card was that way 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:49.840
 that's gearbox year giant giant xg 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:52.180
 the short cut we are looking for it is dgr the 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.370
 text of the card is eck 25 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.159
 113 first edition respectively 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.989
 limited edition a first edition 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:02.349
 is that she is all natural, of course 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.670
 thing so back in wide angle and 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.829
 then we start with this 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:10.870
 drive a gear giant xg one 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:18.150

 this is gear jano mp3s dgr de 001 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:35.530
 super and gear attacker the next 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:38.190
 barrier and then we are through with 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.240
 our approach so two ultra 2 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.400
 and then we'll take a look 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.270
