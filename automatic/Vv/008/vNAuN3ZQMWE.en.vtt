00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
vladimir and as we saw he could have

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.649 
vladimir and as we saw he could have
actually<00:01:29.100> killed<00:01:29.400> him<00:01:29.610> twice<00:01:29.790> i<00:01:30.119> think<00:01:30.360> what

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
actually killed him twice i think what

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.870 
actually killed him twice i think what
he<00:01:30.810> didn't<00:01:31.110> use<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.439> ignite<00:01:31.680> don't<00:01:32.130> know<00:01:32.220> why

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
he didn't use the ignite don't know why

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.990 
he didn't use the ignite don't know why
but<00:01:33.439> he<00:01:34.439> could<00:01:34.590> have<00:01:34.710> went<00:01:34.890> way<00:01:35.400> more<00:01:35.640> ballsy

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
but he could have went way more ballsy

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.710 
but he could have went way more ballsy
darian<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.860> he<00:01:37.860> didn't<00:01:38.159> do<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.310> but<00:01:38.720> vladimir

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
darian so he didn't do it but vladimir

and how does he fit into the matter
right<00:01:54.540> now<00:01:54.600> how<00:01:55.200> strong<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.530> he<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:56.549> volley

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
right now how strong is he so volley

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.569 
right now how strong is he so volley
beer<00:01:57.450> i<00:01:57.750> personally<00:01:58.229> didn't<00:01:58.740> see<00:01:59.159> him<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.430> lot

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
beer i personally didn't see him a lot

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.240 
beer i personally didn't see him a lot
so<00:02:00.060> he<00:02:01.020> was<00:02:01.170> pretty<00:02:01.469> new<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.770> me<00:02:01.890> as<00:02:01.950> well<00:02:02.009> but

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
so he was pretty new to me as well but

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.520 
so he was pretty new to me as well but
it<00:02:02.729> seemed<00:02:03.030> strong<00:02:03.390> if<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:04.079> could<00:02:04.259> have<00:02:04.350> been

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
it seemed strong if you could have been

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.089 
it seemed strong if you could have been
more<00:02:05.130> in<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.759> skirmish<00:02:06.060> or<00:02:06.329> in<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:07.320> fight<00:02:07.530> earlier

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
more in a skirmish or in a fight earlier

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.910 
more in a skirmish or in a fight earlier
in<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.459> game<00:02:08.489> i<00:02:08.879> think<00:02:09.119> they<00:02:09.629> could<00:02:09.840> have<00:02:09.959> put

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
in the game i think they could have put

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.360 
in the game i think they could have put
a<00:02:11.129> bigger<00:02:12.120> lead<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.599> think<00:02:13.560> he<00:02:13.650> did<00:02:13.800> great<00:02:14.040> them

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
a bigger lead I think he did great them

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.030 
a bigger lead I think he did great them
if<00:02:14.700> he<00:02:14.940> was<00:02:15.090> in<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.330> fight<00:02:15.540> but<00:02:16.170> there<00:02:16.739> is<00:02:16.830> such

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
if he was in the fight but there is such

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.289 
if he was in the fight but there is such
a<00:02:17.069> comp<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:18.950> sorry<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.430> common<00:02:21.030> hang<00:02:21.120> wall

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
a comp the sorry the common hang wall

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.199 
a comp the sorry the common hang wall
said<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:23.040> was<00:02:23.220> really<00:02:23.459> hard<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.700> catch<00:02:23.879> someone

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
said it was really hard to catch someone

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.300 
said it was really hard to catch someone
with<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.480> Q<00:02:24.659> everyone<00:02:25.409> had<00:02:25.590> kind<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:25.980> escaped

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
with the Q everyone had kind of escaped

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.820 
with the Q everyone had kind of escaped
a<00:02:26.340> pool<00:02:26.700> or<00:02:26.909> the<00:02:27.239> rift<00:02:27.540> work<00:02:27.720> or<00:02:27.959> something<00:02:28.260> so

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
a pool or the rift work or something so

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.979 
a pool or the rift work or something so
um<00:02:29.420> maybe<00:02:30.420> not<00:02:31.409> the<00:02:31.560> smartest<00:02:32.010> pick<00:02:32.280> but<00:02:32.989> yeah

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
um maybe not the smartest pick but yeah

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.259 
um maybe not the smartest pick but yeah
overall<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.650> think<00:02:34.890> volley<00:02:35.190> beers<00:02:35.489> still

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
overall I think volley beers still

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.899 
overall I think volley beers still
viable<00:02:36.450> so<00:02:37.019> about<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.440> game<00:02:37.620> itself<00:02:37.769> then<00:02:38.310> we

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
viable so about the game itself then we

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.580 
viable so about the game itself then we
had<00:02:39.030> creature<00:02:39.269> actually<00:02:39.510> saying<00:02:39.930> they<00:02:40.230> got

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
had creature actually saying they got

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.319 
had creature actually saying they got
into<00:02:40.769> positions<00:02:41.400> gambit<00:02:41.819> where<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.090> thought

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
into positions gambit where you thought

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.270 
into positions gambit where you thought
okay<00:02:43.079> they're<00:02:43.290> gonna<00:02:43.409> see<00:02:43.709> ch<00:02:43.739> now<00:02:44.010> they're

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
okay they're gonna see ch now they're

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.069 
okay they're gonna see ch now they're
gonna<00:02:44.430> try<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:44.909> take<00:02:45.060> down<00:02:45.299> some<00:02:45.510> towels<00:02:45.720> but

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
gonna try and take down some towels but

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.630 
gonna try and take down some towels but
never<00:02:46.260> really<00:02:46.680> got<00:02:46.859> to<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.129> stage<00:02:47.160> do<00:02:47.549> you

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
never really got to that stage do you

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.460 
never really got to that stage do you
think<00:02:47.819> they<00:02:47.940> could<00:02:48.000> have<00:02:48.299> done<00:02:48.510> more<00:02:49.200> at

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
think they could have done more at

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.900 
think they could have done more at
certain<00:02:49.799> stages<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.310> game<00:02:50.519> where<00:02:50.700> they<00:02:50.790> were

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
certain stages that game where they were

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.630 
certain stages that game where they were
ahead<00:02:51.049> so<00:02:52.049> it's<00:02:52.530> always<00:02:52.799> hard<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.310> push

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
ahead so it's always hard to push

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.869 
ahead so it's always hard to push
against<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.000> cigs<00:02:54.239> it's<00:02:55.170> really<00:02:55.620> hard<00:02:55.920> he<00:02:56.700> has

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
against the cigs it's really hard he has

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.720 
against the cigs it's really hard he has
so<00:02:57.120> many<00:02:57.299> abilities<00:02:57.959> that<00:02:58.500> can<00:02:58.560> interrupt<00:02:59.370> you

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
so many abilities that can interrupt you

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.339 
so many abilities that can interrupt you
that<00:02:59.909> can<00:03:00.120> actually<00:03:00.299> kill<00:03:00.629> you<00:03:00.780> even<00:03:00.930> if<00:03:01.170> your

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
that can actually kill you even if your

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.630 
that can actually kill you even if your
output<00:03:01.859> out<00:03:02.519> of<00:03:02.849> position<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:04.019> um<00:03:04.319> I<00:03:04.829> think

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
output out of position so um I think

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.940 
output out of position so um I think
they<00:03:06.060> could<00:03:06.239> have<00:03:06.269> maybe<00:03:06.620> not<00:03:07.620> actually<00:03:07.859> they

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
they could have maybe not actually they

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.830 
they could have maybe not actually they
tried<00:03:08.250> it's<00:03:08.670> right<00:03:08.849> like<00:03:09.209> with<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.629> split

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
tried it's right like with the split

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.240 
tried it's right like with the split
push<00:03:09.959> of<00:03:10.079> the<00:03:10.109> dimmer<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.560> didn't<00:03:10.769> trying<00:03:11.040> to

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
push of the dimmer and didn't trying to

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.899 
push of the dimmer and didn't trying to
gank<00:03:11.670> that<00:03:11.790> line<00:03:11.970> but<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.840> think<00:03:13.730> came<00:03:14.730> but

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
gank that line but I think came but

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:16.819 
gank that line but I think came but
really<00:03:15.510> counted<00:03:15.989> that<00:03:16.109> really<00:03:16.409> well<00:03:16.530> with<00:03:16.799> a

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
really counted that really well with a

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.520 
really counted that really well with a
volley<00:03:17.489> being<00:03:17.909> around<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.389> even<00:03:18.630> Edward

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
volley being around and even Edward

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.970 
volley being around and even Edward
going<00:03:19.799> there<00:03:19.980> so<00:03:20.669> um<00:03:20.910> I<00:03:21.650> think<00:03:22.650> they<00:03:22.799> did

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
going there so um I think they did

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.949 
going there so um I think they did
everything<00:03:23.400> right<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:23.970> i'ma<00:03:24.419> just<00:03:24.660> counted

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
everything right and i'ma just counted

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.259 
everything right and i'ma just counted
it<00:03:25.079> really<00:03:25.319> well<00:03:25.470> let's<00:03:26.430> look<00:03:26.609> ahead<00:03:26.760> then<00:03:27.060> to

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
it really well let's look ahead then to

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.940 
it really well let's look ahead then to
game<00:03:27.510> two<00:03:27.750> when<00:03:27.870> we<00:03:28.019> talk<00:03:28.200> about<00:03:28.230> gamut<00:03:28.739> a<00:03:28.799> lot

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
match it did fight really hard and they

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.729 
match it did fight really hard and they
didn't<00:03:36.510> make<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:36.690> what<00:03:37.379> do<00:03:37.440> you<00:03:37.470> think<00:03:37.560> the

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
didn't make it what do you think the

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:38.960 
didn't make it what do you think the
mindset<00:03:38.099> is<00:03:38.190> like<00:03:38.340> do<00:03:38.430> you<00:03:38.519> think<00:03:38.730> they<00:03:38.819> have

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
mindset is like do you think they have

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.210 
mindset is like do you think they have
what<00:03:39.000> it<00:03:39.180> takes<00:03:39.389> to<00:03:39.480> come<00:03:39.599> back<00:03:39.780> so<00:03:40.709> I'm<00:03:40.980> i

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
what it takes to come back so I'm i

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.610 
what it takes to come back so I'm i
think<00:03:41.609> gambit<00:03:42.030> is<00:03:42.150> always<00:03:42.450> when<00:03:43.349> they<00:03:43.470> lose

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
think gambit is always when they lose

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.710 
think gambit is always when they lose
they're<00:03:43.889> really<00:03:44.160> down<00:03:44.370> I<00:03:44.639> feel<00:03:45.419> like<00:03:45.510> that

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
they're really down I feel like that

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.199 
they're really down I feel like that
they<00:03:46.530> really<00:03:47.040> have<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.280> push<00:03:47.430> them<00:03:47.639> up<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:48.090> get

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
they really have to push them up to get

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.860 
they really have to push them up to get
after<00:03:48.569> a<00:03:48.599> loose<00:03:48.840> really<00:03:49.739> good<00:03:49.919> again<00:03:50.129> and

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
after a loose really good again and

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.589 
after a loose really good again and
motivated<00:03:51.870> and<00:03:52.079> to<00:03:52.560> really<00:03:53.220> want<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.639> win<00:03:53.790> but

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
motivated and to really want to win but

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.199 
motivated and to really want to win but
I<00:03:55.079> think<00:03:55.650> they<00:03:56.040> know<00:03:56.190> what's<00:03:56.489> on<00:03:56.639> the<00:03:56.669> line<00:03:56.790> and

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
I think they know what's on the line and

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.720 
I think they know what's on the line and
I<00:03:57.299> think<00:03:57.540> they<00:03:57.660> will<00:03:57.810> shape<00:03:58.169> up<00:03:58.379> and<00:03:58.680> I<00:03:59.310> think

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
I think they will shape up and I think

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.339 
I think they will shape up and I think
they<00:03:59.819> will<00:03:59.970> put<00:04:00.269> some<00:04:00.690> good<00:04:00.870> performance

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
they will put some good performance

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:02.900 
they will put some good performance
still<00:04:01.500> after<00:04:01.769> they<00:04:01.859> lose<00:04:01.980> yeah<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.579> I<00:04:02.669> think

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
still after they lose yeah and I think

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.849 
still after they lose yeah and I think
one<00:04:03.239> important<00:04:03.720> factor<00:04:04.049> for<00:04:04.079> gambit<00:04:04.530> here<00:04:04.739> is

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
one important factor for gambit here is

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.379 
one important factor for gambit here is
that<00:04:05.099> groove<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.579> manager<00:04:06.000> is<00:04:06.060> here<00:04:06.090> as<00:04:06.359> well

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
that groove the manager is here as well

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.110 
that groove the manager is here as well
as<00:04:06.660> you<00:04:06.780> see<00:04:06.930> him<00:04:06.989> backstage<00:04:07.349> so<00:04:07.799> if<00:04:08.370> anyone

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
as you see him backstage so if anyone

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.089 
as you see him backstage so if anyone
can<00:04:09.419> kind<00:04:09.750> of<00:04:09.840> pick<00:04:10.049> gambit<00:04:10.470> up<00:04:10.560> off<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:10.949> floor

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
can kind of pick gambit up off the floor

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.619 
can kind of pick gambit up off the floor
and<00:04:11.459> get<00:04:11.639> him<00:04:11.760> going<00:04:11.970> again<00:04:12.150> which<00:04:12.480> they

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
and get him going again which they

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.509 
and get him going again which they
obviously<00:04:12.870> need<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.379> do<00:04:13.530> now<00:04:13.709> be<00:04:13.859> 10<00:04:14.370> behind

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
obviously need to do now be 10 behind

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.879 
obviously need to do now be 10 behind
then<00:04:15.180> its<00:04:15.329> groove<00:04:15.599> is<00:04:15.780> here<00:04:15.989> so<00:04:16.229> that's<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:16.769> good

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
then its groove is here so that's a good

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.529 
then its groove is here so that's a good
thing<00:04:16.949> for<00:04:17.250> gambit<00:04:17.609> will<00:04:17.729> see<00:04:17.940> in<00:04:18.000> game<00:04:18.209> 2<00:04:18.419> if

thing for gambit will see in game 2 if

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.060 
thing for gambit will see in game 2 if
