the stand pretty simple has a kind of

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.069 
the stand pretty simple has a kind of
salut<00:00:34.920> manam<00:00:35.160> looks<00:00:35.370> like<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.809> material<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:36.960> the

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
salut manam looks like a material in the

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.630 
salut manam looks like a material in the
middle<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.590> then<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.040> side<00:00:38.250> here<00:00:38.430> we<00:00:38.520> have

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
middle and then on the side here we have

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.639 
middle and then on the side here we have
some<00:00:38.760> rubber<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.329> kind<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.079> feet<00:00:40.290> on<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.500> I

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
some rubber on kind of feet on it I

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.139 
some rubber on kind of feet on it I
guess<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:40.950> will<00:00:41.010> help<00:00:41.219> keep<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.610> stable<00:00:42.000> on

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
guess this will help keep it stable on

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.970 
guess this will help keep it stable on
the<00:00:42.329> surface<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.840> also<00:00:43.020> keep<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.350> laptop<00:00:43.530> on

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
the surface and also keep the laptop on

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.770 
the surface and also keep the laptop on
it<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.370> basically<00:00:44.760> just<00:00:45.030> pops<00:00:45.239> open<00:00:45.420> just

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
it and basically just pops open just

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.150 
it and basically just pops open just
like<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.260> got<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.410> little<00:00:46.559> triangle

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
like this and you got a little triangle

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.709 
like this and you got a little triangle
and<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.520> can<00:00:47.700> use<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.090> for<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.480> couple

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
and you can use this for a couple

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.540 
and you can use this for a couple
different<00:00:48.989> ways<00:00:49.320> here<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:49.770> your<00:00:49.920> laptop<00:00:50.309> show

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
idea you know it kind of folds up like

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.550 
idea you know it kind of folds up like
this<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:08.970> then<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.990> gives<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> nice<00:01:10.350> little

this and then it gives you a nice little

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.830 
this and then it gives you a nice little
stand<00:01:10.890> for<00:01:11.189> nice<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.880> know<00:01:12.060> typing<00:01:12.510> angle

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
stand for nice a you know typing angle

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.780 
stand for nice a you know typing angle
of<00:01:13.409> course<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.920> not<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> cover<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.729> know

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
of course this is not a cover you know

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.370 
of course this is not a cover you know
this<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:14.970> just<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.360> stand<00:01:15.600> itself<00:01:15.930> but<00:01:16.110> kind<00:01:16.320> of

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
this is just a stand itself but kind of

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.289 
this is just a stand itself but kind of
same<00:01:16.710> idea<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> way<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.790> works<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.270> just

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
same idea so the way this works it just

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.060 
same idea so the way this works it just
folds<00:01:18.600> open<00:01:18.810> makes<00:01:19.200> like<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> little<00:01:19.619> triangle

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
folds open makes like a little triangle

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.310 
folds open makes like a little triangle
and<00:01:20.159> then<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.340> put<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.670> laptop<00:01:21.420> right<00:01:21.810> on<00:01:21.869> top

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
and then you put the laptop right on top

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.899 
and then you put the laptop right on top
so<00:01:22.830> if<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:22.979> put<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.189> like<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.790> know

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
so if you put it like this you know

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.520 
so if you put it like this you know
it'll<00:01:24.090> kind<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.360> sit<00:01:24.840> there<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.020> little<00:01:25.170> bit<00:01:25.350> but

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
it'll kind of sit there a little bit but

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.929 
it'll kind of sit there a little bit but
it<00:01:25.650> might<00:01:25.770> spring<00:01:26.070> open<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.490> little<00:01:26.610> bit<00:01:26.729> it

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
it might spring open a little bit it

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.429 
it might spring open a little bit it
really<00:01:27.119> seems<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.420> work<00:01:27.570> best<00:01:27.900> if<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.350> have

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
really seems to work best if you have

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.929 
really seems to work best if you have
some<00:01:28.619> weight<00:01:28.829> on<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.310> then<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.549> makes<00:01:29.759> it

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
some weight on it and then that makes it

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.429 
some weight on it and then that makes it
nice<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.390> stable<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.020> pretty<00:01:31.200> strong

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
nice and stable and it's pretty strong

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.080 
nice and stable and it's pretty strong
you<00:01:31.560> know<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.770> isn't<00:01:32.040> going<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.220> really<00:01:32.880> go

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
you know this isn't going to really go

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.300 
you know this isn't going to really go
anywhere<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.750> design<00:01:34.110> here<00:01:34.500> seems<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.100> be<00:01:35.280> a

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
anywhere the design here seems to be a

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.859 
anywhere the design here seems to be a
pretty<00:01:35.579> pretty<00:01:36.000> sturdy<00:01:36.270> one<00:01:36.479> kind<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
pretty pretty sturdy one kind of the

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.569 
pretty pretty sturdy one kind of the
triangle<00:01:37.290> design<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:38.159> let's<00:01:38.310> get<00:01:38.400> this

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
triangle design so let's get this

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.280 
triangle design so let's get this
underneath<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.360> laptop<00:01:39.810> give<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.140> an<00:01:40.200> idea

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
underneath the laptop give you an idea

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.280 
underneath the laptop give you an idea
how<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:40.740> works<00:01:41.840> okay<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.049> can<00:01:43.110> use<00:01:43.259> it

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
how this works okay so you can use it

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.719 
how this works okay so you can use it
like<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.560> because<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> nice<00:01:44.100> little<00:01:44.130> angle

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
like this because it a nice little angle

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.550 
like this because it a nice little angle
you<00:01:45.270> know<00:01:45.360> if<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.509> want<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.750> open<00:01:45.930> up<00:01:46.290> the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
you know if you want to open up the

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.469 
you know if you want to open up the
laptop<00:01:46.979> alright<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:48.060> will<00:01:48.240> give<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.450> a

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
laptop alright so this will give you a

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.270 
laptop alright so this will give you a
nice<00:01:48.600> little<00:01:48.750> typing<00:01:49.110> angle<00:01:49.290> or<00:01:49.680> if<00:01:50.100> you

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
nice little typing angle or if you

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.859 
nice little typing angle or if you
happen<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.640> be<00:01:50.790> standing<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.630> guess<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.840> a

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
happen to be standing I guess in a

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.960 
happen to be standing I guess in a
different<00:01:52.200> position<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.710> could<00:01:52.860> also<00:01:53.070> put<00:01:53.880> it

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
different position you could also put it

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.249 
different position you could also put it
down<00:01:54.149> here<00:01:56.299> like<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.750> guess<00:01:57.930> maybe<00:01:58.110> if

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
down here like this so I guess maybe if

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.380 
down here like this so I guess maybe if
you're<00:01:58.380> standing<00:01:58.740> up<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.070> you'd<00:01:59.729> like<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.119> and

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
you're standing up and you'd like to and

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.580 
you're standing up and you'd like to and
you're<00:02:00.479> kind<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.659> standing<00:02:00.930> over<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.380> guess

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
you're kind of standing over I guess

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.870 
you're kind of standing over I guess
that's<00:02:01.680> another<00:02:01.979> option<00:02:02.189> but<00:02:02.520> probably<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
that's another option but probably the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.090 
that's another option but probably the
most<00:02:03.030> common<00:02:03.299> what<00:02:03.750> we<00:02:03.840> see<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.229> most<00:02:04.439> laptops

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
most common what we see in most laptops

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.219 
most common what we see in most laptops
is<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.390> get<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.600> little<00:02:06.719> angle<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.170> it

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
is that you get this little angle and it

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.839 
is that you get this little angle and it
lists<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.560> up<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.829> nice<00:02:08.069> little<00:02:08.220> angle<00:02:08.550> makes<00:02:08.729> it

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
lists it up a nice little angle makes it

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.520 
lists it up a nice little angle makes it
nice<00:02:09.060> easy<00:02:09.360> for<00:02:09.690> typing<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.259> there<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.440> go

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
nice easy for typing so there you go

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.780 
nice easy for typing so there you go
guys<00:02:10.590> will<00:02:10.830> look<00:02:10.950> at<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.129> portable<00:02:11.610> quick

of other laptop stands they can be a
