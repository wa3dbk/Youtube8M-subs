00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.500
 we started the preparation that are the 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:08.830
 fritters with piloncillo honey we are going to 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:13.620
 start making honey let's put 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.620
 a pan with water 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.779
 let's leave it for a long time 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.779
 water we put piloncillo 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.250
 and we're also going to dramatize with cinnamon 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.439
 let's put a bit of a branch of 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.439
 cinnamon 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.750
 and we are going to put mixed nails of 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.059
 cooks some cloves about three or 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.059
 four nails for that perfume 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.760
 no no 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.760
 and a lot 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.780
 but no 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.640
 a lot like 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.570
 come now with our dough to 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.570
 prepare the fritters 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.380
 let's put in the reason we're going to 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.380
 mix flour 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:43.840
 and let's place yeast let's put 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:46.950
 yeast yeast powder and we're going to 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.950
 mix in the blender 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.690
 very slow 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:56.070
 to the mixture 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.070
 while the more prepared 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.130
 the preparation 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.860
 I'm going to put another 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.860
 she 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.320
 and I'm going to finish with water 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.590
 I'm just going to put the amount that 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:34.430
 I see that the dough requires 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.350
 sometimes we put a lot of water and the 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.300
 masses have pain 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.300
 you have to add little by little water 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.750
 of a time of rest 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.739
 they ask me for the yeast to start 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.739
 Act 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:05.300
 and I'm going to put it to rest in a bowl 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.300
 about half an hour 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.930
 the dough look very good 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.870
 It is fine to work but 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.640
 he needs his rest time during the 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.560
 time we 're going to leave it at rest 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:24.560
 I will take advantage to clean my table 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.560
 and prepare to spread the fritters 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.900
 As much as I 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.900
 chacón 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.620
 our dough has rested has worked the 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.230
 yeast properly and let's start 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.880
 to make donuts I want children 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.670
 little ones I do not want some kids the very 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:51.950
 large that can be later 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:55.670
 accompany our coffee or 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:04:00.760
 a chocolate or just like a 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.760
 delicious treat can extend it 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:07.500
 I already put in case of copper to heat 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.780
 oil and our reduction of brown sugar 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.660
 it is not also of piloncillo follow 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.410
 working like this let's start to 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.410
 extend it 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.090
 we are going to work 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.750
 with the roller 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.449
 this is a donut of those who are called 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.809
 on knees 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:38.479
 because still in some places 

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:40.249
 the ladies are still getting used to 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:43.009
 women outside 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:43.639
 at the door of his house they get to 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.929
 make them 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:50.029
 on the knees and there they sell them 

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:53.940
 that we call this donut what 

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:56.880
 we know as knee donuts 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.210
 with very different sizes throughout the 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.210
 country 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.620
 always she makes us very happy hum 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.620
 a donut 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.330
 we have stretching the mass 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.410
 of flour when 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:28.929
 my mass is ready, let's review 

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:31.490
 that the oil is already with 

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:33.710
 enough temperature 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.849
 I'm missing a bit but what I'm going to do 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:40.909
 now I'll punch 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:44.249
 to prick the dough a little so that it does not 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:47.039
 Meanwhile 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:49.909
 before putting it in our oil well 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:49.909
 very hot 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:03.120
 we submerged them to make this 

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:06.510
 double even 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:09.210
 if you have a very nice donut 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:12.390
 and we also have a tray ready 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:15.000
 with absorbent paper so that as soon as 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:16.710
 get out there we are going to put them and 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.270
 let's go placing all the fritters 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.270
 What are we going to do today 

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:26.689
 let's leave a little golden 

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:39.239
 chacón 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.740
 8 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.930
 all right 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.800
 putting together some more fritters 

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:23.070
 we already have the honey we make 

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:26.580
 all the time based on 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:29.130
 cinnamon and clove piloncillo is already 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:34.160
 in the perfect production and we're going to 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:34.160
 let's place inside the flights 

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.870
 I'm going to clean the base
