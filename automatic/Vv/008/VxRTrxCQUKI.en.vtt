00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
it's really a pc but i thought that

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.000 
it's really a pc but i thought that
everything<00:02:25.420> inside<00:02:25.990> of<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.440> would<00:02:26.830> be

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
everything inside of it would be

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.010 
everything inside of it would be
different<00:02:27.310> united<00:02:28.270> mean<00:02:28.390> I<00:02:28.540> throw<00:02:28.720> everything

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
different united mean I throw everything

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.140 
different united mean I throw everything
inside<00:02:29.380> of<00:02:29.800> it<00:02:29.950> would<00:02:30.130> be<00:02:30.250> built<00:02:30.610> different

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
inside of it would be built different

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.370 
inside of it would be built different
that<00:02:31.840> way<00:02:32.110> they<00:02:32.440> can<00:02:32.620> have<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:33.070> price<00:02:34.350> can<00:02:35.350> be

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
that way they can have the price can be

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.100 
that way they can have the price can be
in<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.770> same<00:02:36.040> range<00:02:36.400> as<00:02:36.610> a<00:02:36.820> conscience<00:02:37.570> but<00:02:38.080> I

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
in the same range as a conscience but I

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.620 
in the same range as a conscience but I
thought<00:02:38.380> watch<00:02:38.620> this<00:02:38.920> do<00:02:39.220> take<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:39.940> apart<00:02:40.300> I

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
thought watch this do take it apart I

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.490 
thought watch this do take it apart I
saw<00:02:41.410> that<00:02:41.709> it's<00:02:41.890> nothing<00:02:42.340> but<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:43.170> PC<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.410> a

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
saw that it's nothing but a PC and a

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.360 
saw that it's nothing but a PC and a
small<00:02:44.950> form-factor<00:02:45.520> case<00:02:46.240> now<00:02:46.900> this<00:02:47.770> dude<00:02:48.010> he

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
small form-factor case now this dude he

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.640 
small form-factor case now this dude he
received<00:02:48.820> this<00:02:49.510> thing<00:02:49.810> box<00:02:50.080> had<00:02:50.320> a<00:02:50.350> gtx<00:02:51.360> 780

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
received this thing box had a gtx 780

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.090 
received this thing box had a gtx 780
right<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:53.920> there<00:02:54.220> was<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.400> full-sized<00:02:55.560> gtx<00:02:56.560> 780

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
right and there was a full-sized gtx 780

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.949 
right and there was a full-sized gtx 780
like<00:02:57.370> i<00:02:57.489> said<00:02:57.550> when<00:02:57.880> i<00:02:57.910> first<00:02:58.600> heard<00:02:58.780> about

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
like i said when i first heard about

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.320 
like i said when i first heard about
this<00:02:59.260> i<00:02:59.440> thought<00:02:59.620> that<00:03:00.459> somehow<00:03:00.880> they<00:03:01.209> were

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
this i thought that somehow they were

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.570 
this i thought that somehow they were
going<00:03:01.540> to<00:03:02.190> rebuild<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.700> GPU<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:04.989> cpu<00:03:05.739> and<00:03:06.130> it

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
going to rebuild the GPU and cpu and it

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.460 
going to rebuild the GPU and cpu and it
wouldn't<00:03:06.850> be<00:03:06.970> like<00:03:07.150> full<00:03:07.510> size<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.170> it<00:03:08.260> just

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
wouldn't be like full size and it just

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.470 
wouldn't be like full size and it just
be<00:03:08.620> like<00:03:08.830> you<00:03:09.220> know<00:03:09.250> redone<00:03:09.940> kind<00:03:10.239> of<00:03:10.330> like

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
be like you know redone kind of like

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.470 
be like you know redone kind of like
consoles<00:03:11.110> that<00:03:11.350> way<00:03:12.040> it<00:03:12.190> could<00:03:12.400> compete<00:03:13.270> with

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
consoles that way it could compete with

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.870 
consoles that way it could compete with
consoles<00:03:13.989> you<00:03:14.890> know<00:03:15.010> at<00:03:15.250> that<00:03:15.310> price<00:03:15.820> point

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
consoles you know at that price point

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.840 
consoles you know at that price point
but<00:03:16.540> when<00:03:17.200> I<00:03:17.230> looked<00:03:17.590> at<00:03:17.770> his<00:03:17.950> breakdown<00:03:18.340> when

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
but when I looked at his breakdown when

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.840 
but when I looked at his breakdown when
he<00:03:18.910> took<00:03:19.090> it<00:03:19.239> apart<00:03:19.799> everything<00:03:20.799> in<00:03:21.250> there<00:03:21.519> was

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
he took it apart everything in there was

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.770 
he took it apart everything in there was
nothing<00:03:22.840> but<00:03:23.019> pc<00:03:23.680> parts<00:03:24.010> in<00:03:24.310> a<00:03:25.000> small<00:03:25.390> case

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
nothing but pc parts in a small case

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.280 
nothing but pc parts in a small case
then<00:03:26.769> i'm<00:03:27.010> saying<00:03:27.250> here<00:03:27.430> at<00:03:27.519> a<00:03:27.610> gtx<00:03:28.269> 780<00:03:28.810> that

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
then i'm saying here at a gtx 780 that

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.150 
then i'm saying here at a gtx 780 that
shit<00:03:29.620> was<00:03:29.799> a<00:03:29.830> full<00:03:30.220> size<00:03:30.720> normal<00:03:31.720> gtx<00:03:32.620> 780

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
shit was a full size normal gtx 780

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.370 
shit was a full size normal gtx 780
which<00:03:33.519> is<00:03:33.670> five<00:03:33.970> hundred<00:03:34.360> dollars<00:03:34.750> in<00:03:34.930> he<00:03:35.170> had

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
which is five hundred dollars in he had

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.970 
which is five hundred dollars in he had
and<00:03:35.709> I<00:03:36.130> seven<00:03:36.730> I<00:03:36.910> think<00:03:37.299> it<00:03:37.390> was<00:03:37.510> a<00:03:37.590> 3770k<00:03:38.590> or

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
and I seven I think it was a 3770k or

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.060 
and I seven I think it was a 3770k or
afford<00:03:39.430> a<00:03:39.610> 4770<00:03:40.570> I'm<00:03:40.810> not<00:03:41.049> really<00:03:41.290> sure<00:03:41.380> but

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
afford a 4770 I'm not really sure but

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
afford a 4770 I'm not really sure but
either<00:03:42.340> way<00:03:42.670> both<00:03:43.060> of<00:03:43.120> those<00:03:43.769> CPUs<00:03:44.769> are<00:03:45.070> 300<00:03:46.000> to

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
either way both of those CPUs are 300 to

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.500 
either way both of those CPUs are 300 to
350<00:03:46.870> dollars<00:03:47.470> and<00:03:47.799> then<00:03:47.950> GPU<00:03:48.640> is<00:03:48.670> five<00:03:49.090> hundred

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
350 dollars and then GPU is five hundred

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.759 
350 dollars and then GPU is five hundred
dollars<00:03:49.870> now<00:03:50.760> how<00:03:51.760> is<00:03:52.269> this<00:03:52.660> possibly<00:03:53.440> going

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
dollars now how is this possibly going

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.380 
dollars now how is this possibly going
to<00:03:53.950> compete<00:03:54.580> with<00:03:55.330> consoles<00:03:55.989> I<00:03:56.820> really<00:03:57.820> I'm

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
to compete with consoles I really I'm

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.930 
to compete with consoles I really I'm
not<00:03:58.540> getting<00:03:58.930> it<00:03:59.019> right<00:03:59.170> now<00:03:59.380> man<00:03:59.650> I<00:03:59.769> know<00:03:59.830> no<00:04:00.670> I

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.620 
already know stem cells is crazy but I
don't<00:04:08.080> really<00:04:08.230> think<00:04:08.350> games<00:04:08.980> can<00:04:09.310> pull<00:04:09.519> off

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
don't really think games can pull off

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
model with the gtx 780 I don't think you

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.830 
model with the gtx 780 I don't think you
can<00:04:15.220> pull<00:04:15.430> off<00:04:15.459> selling<00:04:16.090> that<00:04:16.180> shit<00:04:16.239> for<00:04:16.600> five

steam<00:04:23.110> would<00:04:23.800> be<00:04:23.950> losing<00:04:24.430> so<00:04:24.790> much<00:04:25.060> money<00:04:25.120> it's

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
steam would be losing so much money it's

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.020 
steam would be losing so much money it's
not<00:04:26.080> even<00:04:26.410> funny<00:04:26.680> so<00:04:27.310> I'm<00:04:27.430> trying<00:04:27.669> to<00:04:27.790> figure
