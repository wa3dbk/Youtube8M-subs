set<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.660> apart<00:00:39.809> from<00:00:40.230> any<00:00:40.920> other<00:00:41.010> boot<00:00:41.399> out

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
set this apart from any other boot out

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.069 
set this apart from any other boot out
there<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:42.000> going<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.300> be<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> fact<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.870> it's

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
there is going to be the fact that it's

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.459 
there is going to be the fact that it's
got<00:00:43.760> what<00:00:44.760> we<00:00:44.879> call<00:00:45.030> crossbone<00:00:45.780> tech<00:00:46.079> which

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
got what we call crossbone tech which

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.500 
got what we call crossbone tech which
it's<00:00:47.039> got<00:00:47.160> an<00:00:47.280> articulating<00:00:47.940> cuff<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
it's got an articulating cuff on the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.950 
it's got an articulating cuff on the
inside<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.430> actually<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> little<00:00:51.120> carbon<00:00:51.719> rod

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
inside and actually a little carbon rod

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.080 
inside and actually a little carbon rod
stitched<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.739> outside<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.489> can<00:00:53.520> flex

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
stitched on the outside so you can flex

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.330 
stitched on the outside so you can flex
inward<00:00:54.690> where<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.110> want<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.410> flex<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.100> grab

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
inward where you want that flex to grab

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.790 
inward where you want that flex to grab
your<00:00:56.550> board<00:00:56.820> tweak<00:00:57.539> out<00:00:57.870> any<00:00:58.170> grabs<00:00:58.590> or

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800

your board tweak out any grabs or
anything<00:00:59.070> like<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.250> but<00:01:00.030> then<00:01:00.180> when<00:01:00.300> you're

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
leaning into a press or leaning into a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.429 
leaning into a press or leaning into a
turn<00:01:03.329> you've<00:01:03.570> got<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.870> support<00:01:04.170> on<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
turn you've got the support on the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.270 
turn you've got the support on the
outside<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> boot<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.900> kind<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:06.990> that

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
outside of the boot so kind of that

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.030 
outside of the boot so kind of that
support<00:01:08.280> where<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.460> need<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.950> kind<00:01:10.950> of

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
support where you need it and kind of

support where you need it and kind of
where<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.340> need<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.790> yep<00:01:12.150> flex<00:01:12.570> where<00:01:12.780> you

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
where you need it to yep flex where you

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.380 
where you need it to yep flex where you
need<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.460> also<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.790> boot<00:01:15.030> has<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
need it so also this boot has the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.179 
need it so also this boot has the
imprint<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.960> liner<00:01:16.200> which<00:01:16.500> compared<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
imprint to liner which compared to the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.980 
imprint to liner which compared to the
imprint<00:01:17.549> one<00:01:17.700> which<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.210> lower<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.780> but

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
imprint one which is on lower and but

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.460 
imprint one which is on lower and but
boots<00:01:19.939> it's<00:01:20.939> going<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.270> actually<00:01:21.780> have<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.140> cuff

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
boots it's going to actually have a cuff

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.530 
boots it's going to actually have a cuff
that<00:01:22.500> links<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.310> liner<00:01:23.610> down<00:01:24.090> into<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
that links this liner down into the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.090 
that links this liner down into the
shell<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.140> makes<00:01:25.290> them<00:01:25.409> become<00:01:25.740> more<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:25.979> a

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
shell so it makes them become more of a

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.920 
shell so it makes them become more of a
single<00:01:26.430> unit<00:01:26.759> really<00:01:26.970> gives<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.630> even<00:01:27.780> more

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
single unit really gives you even more

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.980 
single unit really gives you even more
he'll<00:01:28.380> hold<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:28.950> boot<00:01:29.659> also<00:01:30.659> something

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
he'll hold in this boot also something

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.990 
he'll hold in this boot also something
kind<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.350> unique<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.860> boot<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.759> fact

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.499 
to have your strap running into that
hook<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.790> takes<00:01:53.939> away<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.180> pressure

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
hook and so it takes away a pressure

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.139 
hook and so it takes away a pressure

so tell me about man fur and shrinkage
man<00:02:17.740> fur<00:02:18.040> is<00:02:18.220> going<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.460> be<00:02:18.580> this<00:02:18.790> nice<00:02:19.570> soft

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
man fur is going to be this nice soft

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.340 
man fur is going to be this nice soft
little<00:02:20.500> fur<00:02:21.400> on<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.760> top<00:02:21.970> of<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.210> boot<00:02:22.420> that

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
little fur on the top of the boot that

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.040 
little fur on the top of the boot that
just<00:02:23.860> gives<00:02:24.010> you<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.340> added<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:24.970> little<00:02:25.180> feel

just gives you that added a little feel

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.780 
just gives you that added a little feel
of<00:02:26.080> nice<00:02:26.620> plushness<00:02:27.310> when<00:02:27.490> you're<00:02:27.610> putting

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
of nice plushness when you're putting

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.700 
of nice plushness when you're putting
your<00:02:27.880> foot<00:02:28.120> in<00:02:28.180> this<00:02:28.360> thing<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:28.900> then<00:02:29.380> also

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
your foot in this thing and then also

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.040 
your foot in this thing and then also
this<00:02:30.370> boot<00:02:30.580> has<00:02:30.610> what<00:02:31.000> we<00:02:31.030> call<00:02:31.120> shrinkage<00:02:31.840> as

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
this boot has what we call shrinkage as

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.720 
this boot has what we call shrinkage as
well<00:02:32.200> as<00:02:32.290> many<00:02:32.530> other<00:02:32.710> boots<00:02:32.980> in<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.190> Burton

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
well as many other boots in the Burton

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.950 
well as many other boots in the Burton
line<00:02:34.350> shrinkage<00:02:35.350> is<00:02:35.530> basically<00:02:36.040> going<00:02:36.190> to

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
line shrinkage is basically going to

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.290 
line shrinkage is basically going to
minimize<00:02:37.960> the<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:39.340> footprint<00:02:39.760> of<00:02:39.850> this<00:02:40.030> boot

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
minimize the the footprint of this boot

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.180 
minimize the the footprint of this boot
and<00:02:40.680> yet<00:02:42.420> still<00:02:43.420> allowed<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:43.960> go<00:02:44.110> into<00:02:44.320> smaller

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
and yet still allowed to go into smaller

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.580 
and yet still allowed to go into smaller
bindings<00:02:45.850> and<00:02:46.240> kind<00:02:46.780> of<00:02:46.870> cut<00:02:47.050> down<00:02:47.230> on<00:02:47.350> weight

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
bindings and kind of cut down on weight

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.320 
bindings and kind of cut down on weight
so<00:02:47.950> say<00:02:48.820> this<00:02:49.630> boots<00:02:49.900> a<00:02:50.110> size<00:02:50.590> 9<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:52.060> actually

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
so say this boots a size 9 it actually

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.630 
so say this boots a size 9 it actually
would<00:02:52.630> have<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:53.020> footprint<00:02:53.830> of<00:02:53.950> most<00:02:54.520> other

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
would have the footprint of most other

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.850 
would have the footprint of most other
companies<00:02:54.940> size<00:02:55.450> 8<00:02:55.720> just<00:02:56.080> because<00:02:56.500> of<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.740> way

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
companies size 8 just because of the way

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.820 
companies size 8 just because of the way
we<00:02:56.890> actually<00:02:57.430> shape<00:02:57.730> this<00:02:58.330> boot<00:02:58.630> and<00:02:58.900> minimize

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
we actually shape this boot and minimize

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.010 
we actually shape this boot and minimize
all<00:03:00.070> the<00:03:00.190> materials<00:03:00.670> on<00:03:00.820> it<00:03:00.970> so<00:03:01.270> cool<00:03:01.660> you<00:03:01.870> can

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
all the materials on it so cool you can

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.570 
all the materials on it so cool you can
fit<00:03:02.170> in<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.350> smaller<00:03:02.620> binding<00:03:03.040> like<00:03:03.190> ya<00:03:03.370> head

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
fit in a smaller binding like ya head

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.270 
fit in a smaller binding like ya head
and<00:03:03.880> great<00:03:04.410> alright<00:03:05.410> well<00:03:05.710> make<00:03:06.010> sure<00:03:06.040> to

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
and great alright well make sure to
