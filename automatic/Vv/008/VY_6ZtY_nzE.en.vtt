track of that I think this should be

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.630 
track of that I think this should be
good<00:01:31.350> for<00:01:31.500> keeping<00:01:31.650> me<00:01:31.920> motivated<00:01:31.950> too

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.319 
the house like I do vacuuming and
cleaning<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.470> gardening<00:01:41.280> even<00:01:41.790> sometimes

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
cleaning and gardening even sometimes

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.450 
cleaning and gardening even sometimes
and<00:01:42.750> running<00:01:43.079> around<00:01:43.140> after<00:01:43.380> kids<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.040> so

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
and running around after kids and so

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.639 
and running around after kids and so
this<00:01:44.759> keeps<00:01:45.360> track<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.810> all<00:01:45.960> your<00:01:46.140> steps<00:01:46.439> that

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
this keeps track of all your steps that

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.499 
this keeps track of all your steps that
you<00:01:46.710> take<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.189> keeps<00:01:47.490> track<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.729> all<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.270> and

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
you take and keeps track of all that and

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.749 
you take and keeps track of all that and
I<00:01:48.840> think<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.439> will<00:01:49.619> be<00:01:49.649> motivating<00:01:50.369> for<00:01:50.579> me

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
I think that will be motivating for me

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.730 
I think that will be motivating for me
because<00:01:51.180> it'll<00:01:51.689> show<00:01:51.720> me<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.409> know<00:01:52.500> if<00:01:52.649> I

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
because it'll show me that you know if I

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.960 
because it'll show me that you know if I
have<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.920> more<00:01:53.130> active<00:01:53.280> date<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.759> actually

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
have a more active date that I actually

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.200 
have a more active date that I actually
did<00:01:54.299> burn<00:01:54.570> off<00:01:55.040> some<00:01:56.040> calories<00:01:56.250> or<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.700> did<00:01:56.939> burn

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
did burn off some calories or I did burn

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.789 
did burn off some calories or I did burn
off<00:01:57.390> some<00:01:57.600> energy<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.140> that's<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.439> really<00:01:58.619> good

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
off some energy so that's a really good

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.200 
off some energy so that's a really good
thing<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.310> other<00:01:59.460> thing<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.700> tracks<00:02:00.000> is

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
thing the other thing that tracks is

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.760 
thing the other thing that tracks is
your<00:02:00.360> sleep<00:02:00.689> which<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.079> also<00:02:01.590> pretty

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
your sleep which is also pretty

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.109 
your sleep which is also pretty
important<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.460> that's<00:02:02.579> something<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:03.000> I'm

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
important and that's something that I'm

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.120 
important and that's something that I'm
not<00:02:03.149> getting<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.750> lot<00:02:03.899> off<00:02:04.140> recently<00:02:04.500> because

hand-in-hand<00:03:10.579> with<00:03:10.909> the<00:03:11.030> tracking<00:03:11.780> your

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
hand-in-hand with the tracking your

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.649 
hand-in-hand with the tracking your
steps<00:03:12.079> is<00:03:12.500> to<00:03:13.310> try<00:03:13.609> and<00:03:13.669> do<00:03:13.819> something<00:03:14.090> active

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:14.659 
steps is to try and do something active

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.259 
steps is to try and do something active
every<00:03:15.530> single<00:03:15.859> day<00:03:16.099> and<00:03:16.519> that<00:03:16.579> could<00:03:17.209> be

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
every single day and that could be

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.089 
every single day and that could be
anything<00:03:17.629> like<00:03:17.900> I<00:03:18.409> said<00:03:18.769> it<00:03:18.919> could<00:03:19.069> be

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
anything like I said it could be

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.249 
anything like I said it could be
vacuuming<00:03:19.729> it<00:03:20.419> could<00:03:20.659> be<00:03:20.810> running<00:03:21.139> right

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:21.259 
vacuuming it could be running right

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:24.369 
vacuuming it could be running right
after<00:03:21.620> your<00:03:21.709> kids<00:03:21.949> playing<00:03:22.310> like<00:03:23.379> football

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
after your kids playing like football

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:25.899 
after your kids playing like football
with<00:03:24.739> your<00:03:24.889> kids<00:03:25.129> if<00:03:25.400> you<00:03:25.489> know<00:03:25.609> how<00:03:25.729> to<00:03:25.759> play

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:25.909

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:29.289 
football I don't actually know how to
play<00:03:27.349> football<00:03:27.439> but<00:03:27.979> I<00:03:28.129> can<00:03:28.609> pretend<00:03:29.030> that<00:03:29.239> I

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
play football but I can pretend that I

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:30.460 
play football but I can pretend that I
don't<00:03:29.419> have<00:03:29.629> to<00:03:29.720> play<00:03:29.870> football<00:03:30.079> when<00:03:30.379> I'm

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
don't have to play football when I'm

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.229 
don't have to play football when I'm
hurt<00:03:30.650> when<00:03:31.040> I<00:03:31.069> played<00:03:31.340> with<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.579> media<00:03:31.819> taking

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
hurt when I played with the media taking

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.349 
hurt when I played with the media taking
your<00:03:32.329> dogs<00:03:32.509> for<00:03:32.689> a<00:03:32.870> walk<00:03:33.519> maybe<00:03:34.519> even<00:03:35.269> if

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
your dogs for a walk maybe even if

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:36.879 
your dogs for a walk maybe even if
something<00:03:35.629> as<00:03:35.720> simple<00:03:35.870> as<00:03:36.079> taking<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:36.560> stairs

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
something as simple as taking the stairs

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:38.770 
something as simple as taking the stairs
rather<00:03:37.189> than<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:37.519> elevator<00:03:37.609> or<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.209> lift<00:03:38.449> I

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
rather than the elevator or the lift I

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.629 
rather than the elevator or the lift I
mean<00:03:39.590> it<00:03:39.769> could<00:03:39.889> be<00:03:39.919> that<00:03:40.009> simple

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
mean it could be that simple

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.909 
mean it could be that simple
but<00:03:40.819> try<00:03:41.030> and<00:03:41.120> do<00:03:41.239> something<00:03:41.650> active<00:03:42.650> and

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:42.919 
but try and do something active and

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.619 
but try and do something active and
something<00:03:43.280> that<00:03:43.909> gets<00:03:44.120> your<00:03:44.209> heart<00:03:44.269> rate<00:03:44.599> up

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
something that gets your heart rate up

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:46.780 
something that gets your heart rate up
every<00:03:45.139> day<00:03:45.259> doesn't<00:03:45.590> matter<00:03:45.650> how<00:03:46.069> long<00:03:46.280> or<00:03:46.699> how

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
every day doesn't matter how long or how

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.689 
every day doesn't matter how long or how
short<00:03:47.319> but<00:03:48.319> just<00:03:48.709> try<00:03:48.919> and<00:03:49.040> get<00:03:49.159> those<00:03:49.280> steps

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:49.699

ourselves
and<00:04:18.109> think<00:04:18.799> about<00:04:18.829> the<00:04:19.099> positive

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
and think about the positive

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.790 
and think about the positive
because<00:04:20.479> life<00:04:21.479> is<00:04:21.509> too<00:04:21.840> short<00:04:21.870> as<00:04:22.500> soon<00:04:22.620> as<00:04:22.710> you

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
because life is too short as soon as you

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.749 
because life is too short as soon as you
start<00:04:23.039> thinking<00:04:23.430> you<00:04:23.490> had<00:04:23.580> something

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 
start thinking you had something

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:25.760 
start thinking you had something
negative<00:04:24.030> about<00:04:24.389> yourself<00:04:24.930> try<00:04:25.440> and<00:04:25.560> push

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
negative about yourself try and push

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.860 
negative about yourself try and push
that<00:04:25.979> thought<00:04:26.220> away<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:26.759> think<00:04:27.060> instead<00:04:27.630> of

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
that thought away and think instead of

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.240 
that thought away and think instead of
it<00:04:27.990> something<00:04:28.380> that<00:04:28.500> you<00:04:28.620> do<00:04:28.800> like<00:04:28.979> about

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
it something that you do like about

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.790 
it something that you do like about
yourself<00:04:29.340> or<00:04:29.910> focus<00:04:30.210> on<00:04:30.330> something<00:04:30.509> positive

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
yourself or focus on something positive

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.460 
yourself or focus on something positive
so<00:04:31.800> for<00:04:32.220> example<00:04:32.819> if<00:04:33.150> you<00:04:33.599> are<00:04:33.630> thinking<00:04:34.289> in

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
so for example if you are thinking in

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.110 
so for example if you are thinking in
your<00:04:34.560> head<00:04:34.860> or<00:04:35.610> you're<00:04:35.759> looking<00:04:36.000> in<00:04:36.090> the

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
body part like so for example I hate my

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.100 
body part like so for example I hate my
flabby<00:04:41.160> belly<00:04:41.759> that<00:04:42.090> would<00:04:42.270> be<00:04:42.389> mine<00:04:42.690> I<00:04:42.900> wish

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
flabby belly that would be mine I wish

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.260 
flabby belly that would be mine I wish
it<00:04:43.259> was<00:04:43.380> tighter<00:04:43.849> instead<00:04:44.849> of<00:04:44.940> thinking<00:04:45.210> that

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
it was tighter instead of thinking that

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.120 
it was tighter instead of thinking that
stop<00:04:45.960> yourself<00:04:46.169> from<00:04:46.349> thinking<00:04:46.710> that<00:04:46.889> and

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
stop yourself from thinking that and

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.999 
stop yourself from thinking that and
instead<00:04:47.910> think<00:04:48.599> about<00:04:48.720> well<00:04:49.229> you<00:04:49.259> know<00:04:49.560> what

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 
instead think about well you know what

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.820 
instead think about well you know what
my<00:04:50.819> legs<00:04:51.060> are<00:04:51.270> looking<00:04:51.569> pretty<00:04:51.810> good<00:04:52.020> today<00:04:52.199> so

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
my legs are looking pretty good today so

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.920 
my legs are looking pretty good today so
focus<00:04:53.220> on<00:04:53.340> this<00:04:53.520> stuff<00:04:53.729> that<00:04:54.180> is<00:04:54.360> positive

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
focus on this stuff that is positive

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.320 
focus on this stuff that is positive
rather<00:04:55.169> than<00:04:55.289> negative<00:04:55.620> because<00:04:56.370> life<00:04:57.060> is

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
rather than negative because life is

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.540 
rather than negative because life is
just<00:04:57.630> way<00:04:57.960> too<00:04:58.020> short<00:04:58.470> everybody<00:04:59.159> has<00:04:59.370> things

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
just way too short everybody has things

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.529 
just way too short everybody has things
that<00:04:59.699> they<00:04:59.789> don't<00:05:00.000> like<00:05:00.150> about<00:05:00.180> themselves

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
that they don't like about themselves

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.050 
that they don't like about themselves
and<00:05:01.050> it's<00:05:01.500> just<00:05:01.710> normal<00:05:02.039> to<00:05:02.490> feel<00:05:02.639> like<00:05:02.849> that

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
and it's just normal to feel like that

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.120 
and it's just normal to feel like that
but<00:05:03.630> sometimes<00:05:03.990> it<00:05:04.169> can<00:05:04.289> really<00:05:04.560> get<00:05:04.770> you<00:05:04.889> down

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130
