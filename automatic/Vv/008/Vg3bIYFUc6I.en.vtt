00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.660
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.160
 twelfth video of an ex no life tinkering 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.700
 devoted to dressing around a 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.680
 Velux 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.630
 let's start from the beginning with the 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.210
 material you will need a plate of 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.369
 plasterboard of 13 mm 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.439
 amounts a placo davis flat that a 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.330
 screwdrivers drills a jigsaw from 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.939
 plaster a sander a cutter a 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.430
 paint pencil the coating a 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.019
 spatula an angular hand saw from 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.030
 Scotch tape for protecting chopsticks 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:39.370
 Silicone wood and without nail or screw 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.110
 the cost will be between 60 and 100 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.949
 euros according to equipment and beers 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.530
 you already have 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.180
 step number one is preparing the site 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.979
 by cutting cleanly the remains of 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.019
 placo of bamboo dishes finally everything 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:51.339
 that you will find for that used a 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.350
 jigsaw or renovator 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:54.850
 be precise in your measurements and 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.600
 cuts more you will be and me you 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.549
 will have to recap 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.369
 in short be in minecraft minecraft hours in 

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:02.680
 making net cuts 

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:03.909
 step number of their dressing we're going 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.159
 make the neurons work for 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.390
 find the solution that will allow you 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.520
 to hold your placo tips 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.720
 solidly for the sides I have bowl 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.070
 I have my red hair that is in 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.270
 withdrawal of a few centimeters by 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.979
 report at the edge of velux 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.659
 so I'm going to life that's an amount on 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.659
 May chevron I prefer to scholar 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.609
 ease the pose and I saw them small 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.679
 isolation point following studies between 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:25.749
 25 and 30% of your losses 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:27.460
 thermal are by the roof so it 

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:29.530
 do not treat this point lightly 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.570
 provided, of course, to have room 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.159
 it's stupid but without it even with any 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.229
 the goodwill of the world it will not serve 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.579
 nothing strange it's my case 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.979
 impossible to put enough 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:39.969
 insulators so that it really serves me 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.740
 will still be foam 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:43.299
 expansive years and older to do well 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.829
 than anything else because anyway the 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.299
 thermal bridge will be made by the way is 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.700
 the amount if you have room 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.390
 less than 20 cm of glass wool or 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.249
 Rock 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.990
 and there you will have a real isolation the 

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:54.939
 little boring but useful parenthesis is 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.460
 finished i'm thinking about cutting out my placo 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.289
 I take the measurements I cut my 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.539
 placo with a cutter and I give a 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.100
 small step to break it I give a 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.450
 second cutter on the other side 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.369
 to finish the cut 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.800
 you can also use up 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.149
 a shrink or a jigsaw I 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.709
 position my plate that is if it 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.420
 difficult to enter the groove of the 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.220
 skylight made in France spot on the edge 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.800
 from the plate with a plane to 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.240
 chamfered like I do not have and that 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.710
 I do not want to buy it because I am 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.980
 a clip I make them a robot 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.629
 standard is longer 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.250
 and it works I put some vices 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.569
 that I rise immediately I dismount my 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.760
 plate by putting this time the foam 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.860
 polyurethane and I put back the plate that 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.690
 I completely rev this time small 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.129
 accuracy was soon revived if not 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.860
 the foam will have swollen and you will not be able 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:39.470
 more put back your plate in place does 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.940
 the same operation for the other side the 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.180
 up and down 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.920
 step number three the finishes called 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.660
 also pain in the ass part one 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.610
 reloads the biggest holes with 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.290
 the coating is waiting for it to dry during 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.269
 at least 24 hours and we start again 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.310
 until all the holes 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.750
 be plugged in entirely for myself 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.370
 make life easier I do it in several 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.360
 time but if you are talented you can 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.709
 do it in one go 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.090
 finish it off by sinking the plaster 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.010
 for smooth touch to home 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.930
 say we will now hide our 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.640
 angles by putting chopsticks in 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.319
 measuring and cutting with angular saw 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.280
 the hardest hand this will do in 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:10.819
 so that the angles fit together 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.470
 perfectly 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.629
 if there is a little game do not panic 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.190
 rebouche rec swimmable mastic or 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.260
 silicone if you use chopsticks 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.510
 white paste them with without nail nor 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.459
 screw if necessary but you are d and es or 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.049
 school so that it does not fall put 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.060
 of the under layer on the pieces of 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.970
 plaster and then repaint 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.380
 with multiple layers and type number 4 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.730
 it's not really a stage these are 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.319
 ideas for needles on 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.150
 solutions to fix your pieces of 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.560
 placo you'll see either we have nothing for 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.810
 screw and despite everything it must 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.280
 be solid so will have to improvise as 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.019
 here where I fixed two placo plates 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.489
 between them I used for this a 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.079
 cleat that I avoid is on the edge of the 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.060
 placo and the other side at my time 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.750
 despite appearances the result is 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.130
 really solid 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.200
 go another example because you 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.359
 have been wise here I live at my time 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.859
 on the wall I had to make cuts to 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.810
 the grinder to spend my life is my 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.400
 life this zh it will have to be inventive and 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.200
 especially well master the system of 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.299
 the important thing is to see nothing 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.950
 once the ticket round this is this 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.690
 second video is now over 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.370
 a huge thank you to you for this 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.010

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.500
 50000 view on my channel a huge thank you 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.750
 also to edith cuche as well as to 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.079
 pro vertex company for the redesign of 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.700
 logo 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.889
 they are specialized in computer graphics 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.690

 description of the video 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.720
 thank you all very soon and do not forget 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.460
