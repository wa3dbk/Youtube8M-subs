00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 hi guys in algeria and today we will see 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.170
 has literary goals for 2015 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.210
 What do I want to do on the channel and one? 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.330
 a little about the book I'm 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.330
 writing 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.590
 so first I'll start with 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.710
 The books I want to remember 2015 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.869
 I hope and 52 books of that year being 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.660
 four books a month a book by 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.670
 week is like this is the most basic goal of 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.470
 everyone but she could make a goal 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.150
 a little bigger than that because I do not 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.510
 I'm sure I can not knock. 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.640
 the goal of 52 books as you know 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.949
 as well as several other Portuguese us 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.379
 we work there is no way to stay the day 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:51.379
 Entire leno if I could I would read about 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.420
 130 books a year or so but 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.879
 I have not as I can only read of 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.860
 night and the weekend 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.160
 so I hope I can reach 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.899
 this goal of 52 books for the channel I 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.550
 I also have some ideas 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.020
 I would very much like to get from 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.390
 to now bet a little more 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.640
 regularity here on youtube and on my 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.860
 blog I do not know if it will be possible but 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.080
 the idea of ​​fetching at least two videos 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.580
 per week and has not yet decided on 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.840
 the days I'm going to post because I 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.060
 I need to know what day I'm going 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.399
 to actually record such I think 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.770
 I'll see if I can create regularity of 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.689
 posting videos here on channel I 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.560
 I also wanted to create a series of videos 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:32.240
 here on the channel on controversial opinions 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.369
 literary things that we can 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.049
 to discuss a little more about the 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.640
 books that you are reading I do not 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.350
 I can explain a little more without giving 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.420
 examples but left an example here 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.159
 I will run out of things to discuss 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.710
 my first video but it's things 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.930
 controversies usually I can have zebu 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.899
 our bookstore or there was talking about 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.600
 example of the hypocrisy of having two films 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.750
 the hunger games moc money 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.329
 hope and what they are most critical in 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.079
 The story of the film is 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.460
 capital 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.979
 That kind of thing, so we go. 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.689
 discuss in this series of videos that I 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.759
 I'm thinking of doing the channel and also 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.250
 the channel along with others 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.769
 Portuguese, we have created a group of 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.620
 long income reading in which we go 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.690
 Every month he read the book. 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.730
 together and then we'll discuss the 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.790
 end of the month the Portuguese who are 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.370

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.459
 the group we are not still hitting 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.230

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.349

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:59.079
 comments and now a little note 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.140
 More personal I was going to talk a little about 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:04.140
 The book is just a very question about the 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.450
 book when I'm going to release and when should I 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.370
 end only he is at last I will speak 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.260
 just a little bit about this I started to 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.709
 write the book in October more or 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.480
 less and I already have around 52 thousand 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.549
 written words and I'm more or 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.500
 less in the middle of the book I participated 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.049
 of the year raynaud this year but it was so 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.660
 was the total when I started in the neighborhood already 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.840
 I had 25,000 words and from there I wrote 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.700
 around 23 24 thousand and from my 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.010
 neighborhood, I could only write some more 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.959
 three thousand words or so only then 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.599
 You're being a failure to me for 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.190
 while I finish my book but I 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.530
 I promised myself that from 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.750
 now from January I would dedicate myself a lot 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.760
 too much for my book and I want 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.190
 have a lot of it I love you too much to 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.049
 passionate story about my book and me 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.750
 I put it so that other people can 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:55.030
 read it also a book is of my genre 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.250
 favorite that dystopia and many people 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.769
 Do not like sofia, but I do. 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.389
 I love climbing. I love stories about 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.790
 oppression and another story about 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:06.099
 then of course it's about 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.139
 what my book is the book he too 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.449
 not necessarily young adult he is 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:12.160
 a little bit almost in the new 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:14.919
 adult my main character has 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.799
 20 years of age and the main premise 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:19.349
 main theme of the book 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.389
 It's that Chinese bank so the 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:23.129
 main character of the book discovers 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:27.180
 that she is heir to the throne of the country where 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:29.699
 she lived and obviously cause and romance and 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.800
 a lot of war and a lot happens 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.479
 so I really want to devote myself to 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.610
 finish soon and be able to start 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.110
 revisions of the book because there is so much 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.879
 I need to add from such 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.819
 book has no ideas about various things 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:43.949
 so I need to get back all the river from the 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:45.990
 first chapter to be able to review 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.659
 completely but I still have terminals
