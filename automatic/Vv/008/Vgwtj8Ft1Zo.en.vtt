00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:04.120
 Even though the photo last summer, 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.660
 It's alive. 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.130
 80s 3. 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.230
 Explanation of the various residents that the camera has 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.109
 I think this will be ambitious. 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:13.979
 The government has to deal with Santana 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:16.429
 A little more today 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:17.619
 I lost my concentration. 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.919
 Then you can say what you 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.919
 I will try to fit in and explain in advance. 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.509
 One local law is about the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.560
 Persons with disabilities and the name Peugeot 207 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.460
 Yesterday was the local 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.390
 Do you talk 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.280
 Product name Semicons sitting in the living room is a product 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.569
 This time 

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:44.459
 One manufacturing company has recalled a statement of affidavits and cones 

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:46.580
 Hanson products 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.050
 Next is the 23rd with the market 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.050
 lancet rt12.8 Then 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:55.600
 The rest of the world is the first 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.060
 I've got this book. 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.459
 Would you do it before you went to bed? 

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:04.459
 Are you in a local tourism business? 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.830
 Our camera is a camera lens 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.830
 If you use it as a strong will 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.900
 We should have a wide-angle lens. 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.050
 The resident tax 59. Shin Jung-ah case 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.340
 Not a tourist attraction. 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.100
 It's not imitation, it's open to the world 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.090
 It means that there is not. 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.750
 Is he such a surface that this product should be eliminated 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.110
 This product 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.430
 Each product means a unique number. 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.090
 You 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.450
 A variety of cameras If I have ever been, I will be studying Jesus 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.400
 One thing you might drink is the weekend 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.740
 I think it would be better if I padded it. 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.890
 If you lost your camera lens 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.240
 An important clue that this could be the next is Paris serial 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.680
 I will be number 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.610
 Hopefully with the top of the camera. 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.650
 Camera news is limited 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.740
 I already have the right level of focus. 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.280
 If you look at the bottom of that, 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.190
 Bonds I have not come yet 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.450
 After focusing, the distance is divided into numbers 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.589
 That's what Pittsburgh City is all about. 

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:12.909
 It would be a good idea to take a walk. 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:14.169
 If you scrape 

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:17.540
 2 4 It is said that the reformer is also the criminal. 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.249
 64 nervous 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:22.049
 I'll tell you again later. 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.219
 The case is said to be early Christians. 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:26.879
 Number to reduce 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.400
 71.4% to 16% reduction in dietary 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.209
 Is the power false? 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.140
 Creation and Name and Resident 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.109
 What are you doing and what you are doing 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:39.129
 If you look at some of the categories 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.129
 Benjamin, because you guys did something in your life. 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.659
 Third, Ranges clearly describes what you are looking for. 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:49.089
 I'm going to focus on it. 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:50.789
 After that 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:51.909
 In the mainstream 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.359
 A mother I have not come yet 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:55.849
 Will not 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.629
 How much you invest 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:58.889
 There's a way. 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:02:59.810
 Then 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.809
 The focal length is thus glance 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:06.169
 I know what the rest of the liver is. 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:09.199
 Then, depending on the state of the emergency 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.880
 Four 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.880
 Global Neuroscience Gold Hostage is marked 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:17.039
 Transactions are measured with the municipality clear distance 

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.979
 I'm responsible. 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.789
 It is divided into mit and specialty 

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:24.159
 The focal length, as I said last time, 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.879
 From the center 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.189
 Tells you the distance you need or up to 17 days 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:31.189
 The standard is divided into tourism 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:34.309
 You should limit nf exports. 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:35.829
 Disappearing 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.709
 The only thing that ends 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.359
 When it was pr 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.659
 out of course 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.139
 I will make various changes. 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.139
 How does global talent fit into the storyline? 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.979
 It's simple, and last time on the site 

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:54.569
 In addition to the autofocus system, 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:55.419
 If I told you 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:58.419
 The way I'm talking about right now 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.919
 Last year and in the camera, 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:03.549
 In the manual way 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.779
 In digital cameras, it's called winning. 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.959
 How the system works 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.019
 There for 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.969
 Let me give you an example. 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:13.969
 After a year of hard work, 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.589
 Dongbuwon is administered. 

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.269
 As a dramatist, 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.520
 After the jobless contest finished and the Spurs went to Chungcheong 

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:24.540
 Stick 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.090
 I see how I can get it right. 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:30.580
 Lee Jun Ki stick 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.990
 As an example 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.409
 I went straight to the direct exile. I captured what was the image. 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:38.159
 It's a dream. 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:41.939
 In this way, we divide the small circles of this area in half 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:45.909
 As we celebrate our 32nd anniversary, 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:47.209
 It's a method.
