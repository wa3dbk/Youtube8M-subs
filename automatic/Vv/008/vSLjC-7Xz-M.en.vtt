00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
catchers were masked so to think of the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.620 
catchers were masked so to think of the
difference<00:00:47.090> of<00:00:47.150> a<00:00:47.270> hundred-mile-an-hour

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
would they do that I don't think they

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.280 
would they do that I don't think they
had<00:01:04.909> anything<00:01:05.150> at<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:05.509> time<00:01:05.689> that<00:01:05.930> was<00:01:06.049> even

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
had anything at the time that was even

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.440 
had anything at the time that was even
remotely<00:01:06.320> good<00:01:07.040> enough<00:01:07.310> to<00:01:07.490> stay<00:01:07.700> and<00:01:08.210> take

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
remotely good enough to stay and take

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.480 
remotely good enough to stay and take
the<00:01:08.570> puck<00:01:08.780> to<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.109> face<00:01:09.170> and<00:01:09.979> I<00:01:10.039> think<00:01:10.100> him

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
the puck to the face and I think him

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.739 
the puck to the face and I think him
being<00:01:10.759> the<00:01:10.939> kind<00:01:11.090> of<00:01:11.179> the<00:01:11.270> innovator<00:01:11.570> going

00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:11.749

me<00:01:16.009> it<00:01:16.249> won't<00:01:16.429> kill<00:01:16.729> me<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.060> his<00:01:17.270> coach<00:01:17.479> did

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:17.749 
me it won't kill me and his coach did

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:19.330 
me it won't kill me and his coach did
not<00:01:17.869> like<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.320> idea<00:01:18.590> of<00:01:18.649> him<00:01:18.770> wearing<00:01:19.100> a<00:01:19.159> mask

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
not like the idea of him wearing a mask

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.130 
not like the idea of him wearing a mask
so<00:01:19.549> he<00:01:20.149> would<00:01:20.270> wear<00:01:20.420> it<00:01:20.509> in<00:01:20.569> practice<00:01:20.960> and<00:01:21.079> his

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
so he would wear it in practice and his

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.149 
so he would wear it in practice and his
coach<00:01:21.319> was<00:01:21.469> just<00:01:21.499> tell<00:01:21.679> him<00:01:21.740> to<00:01:21.799> take<00:01:21.920> it<00:01:22.039> off

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
coach was just tell him to take it off

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.099 
coach was just tell him to take it off
because<00:01:22.310> he<00:01:22.609> didn't<00:01:22.819> want<00:01:23.060> he<00:01:23.659> thought<00:01:23.899> that

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:24.109 
because he didn't want he thought that

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:26.319 
because he didn't want he thought that
it<00:01:24.229> would<00:01:24.319> impede<00:01:24.619> his<00:01:24.679> eyesight<00:01:25.240> for<00:01:26.240> the

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
it would impede his eyesight for the

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.510 
it would impede his eyesight for the
puck<00:01:26.539> and<00:01:26.810> what<00:01:27.499> would<00:01:27.649> happened<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.399> night

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
puck and what would happened the night

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.539 
puck and what would happened the night
that<00:01:28.700> he<00:01:28.850> actually<00:01:30.009> came<00:01:31.009> out<00:01:31.039> with<00:01:31.159> the<00:01:31.340> mask

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
that he actually came out with the mask

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.489 
that he actually came out with the mask
was<00:01:31.850> he<00:01:32.420> actually<00:01:32.539> told<00:01:32.780> his<00:01:32.990> coach<00:01:33.170> I<00:01:33.350> won't

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:33.499

other backup so I'm going to actually
let<00:01:40.729> him<00:01:40.819> play<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:41.420> he<00:01:41.659> came<00:01:41.840> out<00:01:42.020> he<00:01:42.380> finished

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
let him play and he came out he finished

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.260 
let him play and he came out he finished
the<00:01:42.829> game<00:01:42.950> won<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.429> game<00:01:43.579> and<00:01:43.609> that<00:01:43.999> was<00:01:44.119> it

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
the game won the game and that was it

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.179 
the game won the game and that was it
because<00:01:44.659> any<00:01:44.840> warden<00:01:45.229> said<00:01:45.469> he<00:01:45.740> never<00:01:45.859> took<00:01:46.069> it

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
because any warden said he never took it

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.289 
because any warden said he never took it
off<00:01:46.280> because<00:01:46.459> he<00:01:46.639> just<00:01:46.819> told<00:01:46.939> the<00:01:46.999> coach<00:01:47.179> I'm

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
off because he just told the coach I'm

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:48.459 
off because he just told the coach I'm
not<00:01:47.450> going<00:01:47.569> to<00:01:47.659> get<00:01:47.749> off<00:01:47.869> so<00:01:48.200> then<00:01:48.350> another

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469 
not going to get off so then another

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:50.050 
not going to get off so then another
goalie<00:01:48.799> started<00:01:49.189> wearing<00:01:49.369> it<00:01:49.579> was<00:01:49.700> kind<00:01:49.999> of

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
goalie started wearing it was kind of

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.789 
goalie started wearing it was kind of
that<00:01:50.149> pretty<00:01:50.359> it<00:01:50.509> slowly<00:01:51.049> started<00:01:51.530> going

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
that pretty it slowly started going

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.760 
that pretty it slowly started going
through<00:01:51.829> the<00:01:52.130> league<00:01:52.310> and<00:01:52.969> then<00:01:53.149> as<00:01:53.450> as

does<00:02:12.049> he<00:02:12.140> have<00:02:12.230> scars<00:02:12.590> or<00:02:12.950> I<00:02:13.250> guess

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
does he have scars or I guess

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.300 
does he have scars or I guess
sorry<00:02:13.900> no<00:02:14.200> actually<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.710> pictures<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.070> they

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
sorry no actually the pictures that they

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.310 
sorry no actually the pictures that they
gave<00:02:15.520> us<00:02:15.730> were<00:02:15.910> we're<00:02:16.420> usually<00:02:16.720> very<00:02:16.900> early<00:02:17.230> in

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
gave us were we're usually very early in

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.110 
gave us were we're usually very early in
their<00:02:17.410> career<00:02:17.770> because<00:02:18.490> they<00:02:18.640> got<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.850> lot<00:02:19.090> more

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
their career because they got a lot more

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.030 
their career because they got a lot more
I<00:02:19.330> think<00:02:19.510> they<00:02:19.750> got<00:02:19.930> better<00:02:20.380> pictures<00:02:20.830> of<00:02:20.950> the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
I think they got better pictures of the

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.360 
I think they got better pictures of the
rookies<00:02:21.430> than<00:02:21.700> of<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.710> veterans<00:02:24.160> and

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
rookies than of the the the veterans and

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.770 
rookies than of the the the veterans and
it's<00:02:24.790> probably<00:02:24.970> because<00:02:25.360> they<00:02:25.480> told<00:02:25.690> the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
it's probably because they told the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.390 
it's probably because they told the
rookies<00:02:26.050> to<00:02:26.200> stay<00:02:26.350> there<00:02:26.560> for<00:02:26.800> pictures<00:02:27.220> for

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
rookies to stay there for pictures for

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.500 
rookies to stay there for pictures for
like<00:02:27.550> newspapers<00:02:28.060> yeah

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
like newspapers yeah

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.180 
like newspapers yeah
it<00:02:28.720> just<00:02:28.990> looked<00:02:29.200> more<00:02:29.440> like<00:02:29.500> that<00:02:29.830> when<00:02:30.040> we

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
it just looked more like that when we

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.710 
it just looked more like that when we
got<00:02:30.310> our<00:02:30.430> reference<00:02:30.760> that's<00:02:31.210> why<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.480> lot<00:02:31.540> of

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
got our reference that's why a lot of

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.440 
got our reference that's why a lot of
the<00:02:31.780> players<00:02:31.960> look<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.260> little<00:02:32.350> bit<00:02:32.530> younger

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
the players look a little bit younger

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.850 
the players look a little bit younger
but<00:02:34.450> like<00:02:34.780> I<00:02:34.810> said<00:02:35.080> it<00:02:35.170> looks<00:02:35.320> very<00:02:35.470> mainly

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
but like I said it looks very mainly

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.600 
but like I said it looks very mainly
from<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.130> 50s<00:02:36.490> and<00:02:36.670> 60s<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.220> first<00:02:39.430> time

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
from the 50s and 60s so the first time

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.840 
from the 50s and 60s so the first time
ever<00:02:39.820> we<00:02:40.060> have<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.650> goalie<00:02:41.650> without<00:02:42.580> a<00:02:42.610> man

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
ever we have a goalie without a man

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.810 
ever we have a goalie without a man
without<00:02:43.090> a<00:02:43.210> mask<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:44.080> I'll<00:02:44.500> get<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:44.860> a<00:02:45.070> stoppage

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
without a mask so I'll get to a stoppage

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.150 
without a mask so I'll get to a stoppage
and<00:02:46.600> then<00:02:46.780> I<00:02:46.900> will<00:02:47.050> show<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.260> that<00:02:47.410> okay<00:02:47.950> what

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
sticks that they used to have in the 70s

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.040 
sticks that they used to have in the 70s
and<00:04:00.230> earlier<00:04:00.530> with<00:04:01.250> the<00:04:01.430> old<00:04:02.060> retro<00:04:02.450> Sherwood

and earlier with the old retro Sherwood

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.920 
and earlier with the old retro Sherwood
on<00:04:03.170> it<00:04:03.290> yeah<00:04:03.700> instead<00:04:04.700> of<00:04:04.820> now<00:04:04.940> they<00:04:05.060> have<00:04:05.180> swd

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
so it it was kind of an effort made on

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.680 
so it it was kind of an effort made on
our<00:04:09.830> part<00:04:10.100> to<00:04:10.310> try<00:04:10.550> and<00:04:11.000> get<00:04:11.120> everything<00:04:11.390> as
