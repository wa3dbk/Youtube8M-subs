00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:11.710 
hello today I'm going to show you a

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.570 
hello today I'm going to show you a
zombie<00:00:12.160> based<00:00:12.580> storage<00:00:13.390> system<00:00:14.310> for<00:00:15.310> a<00:00:15.340> long

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 
zombie based storage system for a long

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.580 
zombie based storage system for a long
long<00:00:16.209> time<00:00:16.830> there<00:00:17.830> was<00:00:17.950> a<00:00:18.810> key<00:00:19.810> portion<00:00:20.440> of

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
long time there was a key portion of

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.800 
long time there was a key portion of
automatic<00:00:21.490> farming<00:00:21.820> missing<00:00:22.210> and<00:00:22.450> that<00:00:22.540> was

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
automatic farming missing and that was

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.429 
automatic farming missing and that was
that<00:00:23.230> you<00:00:24.330> know<00:00:25.330> it's<00:00:25.509> automatic<00:00:26.050> is<00:00:26.140> you<00:00:26.259> make

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
that you know it's automatic is you make

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.030 
that you know it's automatic is you make
something<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:28.119> have<00:00:28.300> to<00:00:28.330> be<00:00:28.630> in<00:00:28.960> the<00:00:29.470> area<00:00:29.619> to

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.040 
something you have to be in the area to

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.920 
something you have to be in the area to
collect<00:00:30.189> items<00:00:30.520> so<00:00:31.210> you<00:00:31.270> know<00:00:31.450> you<00:00:31.509> can<00:00:31.689> chuck

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
collect items so you know you can chuck

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.540 
collect items so you know you can chuck
an<00:00:32.110> item<00:00:32.650> in<00:00:32.710> a<00:00:32.770> chest<00:00:33.010> here

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
an item in a chest here

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.460 
an item in a chest here
you<00:00:33.910> know<00:00:33.970> store<00:00:34.300> itself<00:00:34.540> that<00:00:34.780> doesn't<00:00:34.960> that

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
you know store itself that doesn't that

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.360 
you know store itself that doesn't that
doesn't<00:00:35.560> work<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:38.260> basically<00:00:39.010> how<00:00:39.160> this<00:00:39.310> works

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
doesn't work so basically how this works

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.530 
doesn't work so basically how this works
is<00:00:40.030> if<00:00:40.090> we<00:00:40.360> go<00:00:40.480> up<00:00:40.570> here<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.920> wait<00:00:42.160> for<00:00:42.670> a<00:00:42.910> short

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
is if we go up here and wait for a short

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.260 
is if we go up here and wait for a short
period<00:00:44.410> of<00:00:44.710> time<00:00:44.770> I'll<00:00:45.550> get<00:00:45.700> back<00:00:45.880> to<00:00:45.910> you<00:00:46.090> in<00:00:46.210> a

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
period of time I'll get back to you in a

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.580 
period of time I'll get back to you in a
minute<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:47.580> soft<00:00:48.580> show<00:00:48.760> you<00:00:48.820> why<00:00:49.240> I<00:00:49.270> mean<00:00:49.590> it's

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
minute I soft show you why I mean it's

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.070 
minute I soft show you why I mean it's
down<00:00:50.770> here<00:00:50.950> what<00:00:51.100> we've<00:00:51.220> got<00:00:51.400> is<00:00:51.690> some<00:00:52.690> zombies

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
down here what we've got is some zombies

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.170 
down here what we've got is some zombies
which<00:00:53.770> have<00:00:53.920> obviously<00:00:54.220> spawned<00:00:54.580> from<00:00:55.120> a

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
which have obviously spawned from a

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.710 
which have obviously spawned from a
spawner<00:00:55.510> up<00:00:55.690> here<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:57.430> they<00:00:57.700> just<00:00:58.060> spawn<00:00:58.330> go

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
spawner up here so they just spawn go

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.320 
spawner up here so they just spawn go
down<00:00:58.900> the<00:00:58.990> hole<00:00:59.170> and<00:00:59.470> land<00:00:59.890> in<00:01:00.040> this<00:01:00.100> area<00:01:00.330> now

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
down the hole and land in this area now

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.840 
down the hole and land in this area now
something<00:01:01.960> somewhat<00:01:02.740> new<00:01:02.950> to<00:01:03.310> the<00:01:03.400> game<00:01:03.550> is

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
something somewhat new to the game is

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.840 
something somewhat new to the game is
that<00:01:04.030> if<00:01:04.509> you<00:01:04.689> throw<00:01:05.019> an<00:01:05.140> item<00:01:05.259> act<00:01:06.040> P<00:01:06.490> zombie

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
that if you throw an item act P zombie

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.630 
that if you throw an item act P zombie
it<00:01:07.450> will<00:01:07.689> pick<00:01:07.869> it<00:01:07.990> up<00:01:08.110> and<00:01:08.350> if<00:01:08.710> it's<00:01:08.860> a<00:01:09.040> armas

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
it will pick it up and if it's a armas

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.539 
it will pick it up and if it's a armas
or<00:01:09.759> thing<00:01:09.939> like<00:01:10.060> a<00:01:10.119> funky<00:01:10.570> never<00:01:10.750> wear<00:01:10.990> it<00:01:11.549> so

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
or thing like a funky never wear it so

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.340 
or thing like a funky never wear it so
basically<00:01:13.149> what<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.840> whole<00:01:13.869> point<00:01:14.140> of<00:01:14.200> this

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
basically what the whole point of this

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.700 
basically what the whole point of this
little<00:01:14.530> system<00:01:14.859> here<00:01:14.890> is<00:01:15.249> to<00:01:16.590> filter<00:01:17.590> out

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
little system here is to filter out

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.389 
little system here is to filter out
zombies<00:01:18.100> because<00:01:19.409> about<00:01:20.409> 20<00:01:20.950> percent<00:01:21.249> of

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
zombies because about 20 percent of

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.999 
zombies because about 20 percent of
zombies<00:01:21.850> on<00:01:22.149> Hart<00:01:22.479> just<00:01:23.259> know<00:01:23.499> it's<00:01:23.649> on<00:01:23.770> hard

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
zombies on Hart just know it's on hard

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.880 
zombies on Hart just know it's on hard
on<00:01:24.310> hard<00:01:24.999> 20<00:01:25.479> percent<00:01:25.749> of<00:01:25.780> zombies<00:01:26.200> can<00:01:26.560> have

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
on hard 20 percent of zombies can have

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.039 
on hard 20 percent of zombies can have
this<00:01:27.069> ability<00:01:27.340> so<00:01:27.850> not<00:01:28.030> all<00:01:28.179> of<00:01:28.359> the<00:01:28.509> zombies

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
this ability so not all of the zombies

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.649 
this ability so not all of the zombies
have<00:01:29.079> it<00:01:29.350> but<00:01:29.759> 20<00:01:30.759> percent<00:01:30.999> of<00:01:31.060> them<00:01:31.210> do<00:01:31.390> so

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
have it but 20 percent of them do so

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.569 
have it but 20 percent of them do so
this<00:01:31.780> is<00:01:31.840> to<00:01:32.229> filter<00:01:32.619> them<00:01:32.740> out<00:01:32.829> so<00:01:33.310> basically

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
this is to filter them out so basically

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.139 
this is to filter them out so basically
how<00:01:33.700> it<00:01:33.789> works<00:01:33.819> is<00:01:35.520> because<00:01:36.520> they've<00:01:36.880> got<00:01:37.030> this

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
how it works is because they've got this

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.649 
how it works is because they've got this
helmet<00:01:38.020> on<00:01:38.200> they<00:01:38.439> don't<00:01:38.649> take<00:01:38.889> sun<00:01:39.609> damage<00:01:40.090> so

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
helmet on they don't take sun damage so

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.200 
helmet on they don't take sun damage so
a<00:01:40.689> regular<00:01:40.990> zombie<00:01:41.729> because<00:01:42.729> it<00:01:42.819> can't<00:01:43.030> pick

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
a regular zombie because it can't pick

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.609 
a regular zombie because it can't pick
up<00:01:43.299> an<00:01:43.420> item<00:01:43.509> it<00:01:43.960> will<00:01:44.139> not<00:01:44.229> pick<00:01:44.409> up<00:01:44.499> the

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
up an item it will not pick up the

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.469 
up an item it will not pick up the
pumpkin<00:01:44.829> wear<00:01:45.100> on<00:01:45.189> his<00:01:45.310> head<00:01:45.520> so<00:01:46.090> it<00:01:46.179> will<00:01:46.299> burn

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
pumpkin wear on his head so it will burn

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.179 
pumpkin wear on his head so it will burn
in<00:01:46.659> the<00:01:46.719> sunlight<00:01:48.929> so<00:01:49.929> the<00:01:50.889> one<00:01:51.009> to<00:01:51.100> the

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
in the sunlight so the one to the

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.039 
in the sunlight so the one to the
pumpkin<00:01:51.490> heads<00:01:51.700> can<00:01:52.060> pick<00:01:52.270> up<00:01:52.420> stuff<00:01:52.659> and<00:01:52.959> that

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
pumpkin heads can pick up stuff and that

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.179 
pumpkin heads can pick up stuff and that
is<00:01:53.170> key<00:01:53.380> here<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.880> if<00:01:54.939> we<00:01:54.999> come<00:01:55.179> around<00:01:55.299> here

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
is key here so if we come around here

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.459 
is key here so if we come around here
let's<00:01:57.189> imagine<00:01:57.490> we've<00:01:57.939> got<00:01:58.179> a<00:01:58.389> an<00:01:58.869> automatic

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
let's imagine we've got a an automatic

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:00.870 
let's imagine we've got a an automatic
fire<00:01:59.679> and<00:01:59.799> so<00:01:59.920> we've<00:02:00.069> got<00:02:00.159> a<00:02:00.189> skeleton

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
fire and so we've got a skeleton

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.070 
fire and so we've got a skeleton
Harvester

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
Harvester

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.980 
Harvester
the<00:02:04.080> items<00:02:04.380> would<00:02:05.190> come<00:02:05.490> down<00:02:05.730> the<00:02:05.820> stream<00:02:06.150> in

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
the items would come down the stream in

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.550 
the items would come down the stream in
there<00:02:07.260> and<00:02:08.060> okay<00:02:09.060> if<00:02:09.990> we<00:02:10.050> come<00:02:10.200> back<00:02:10.320> round

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
there and okay if we come back round

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.400 
there and okay if we come back round
here<00:02:13.010> can<00:02:14.010> see<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.610> guy<00:02:14.850> is<00:02:15.150> holding<00:02:15.450> bones

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
here can see that guy is holding bones

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.310 
here can see that guy is holding bones
so<00:02:16.980> he's<00:02:17.130> holding<00:02:17.490> them<00:02:18.290> he<00:02:19.290> just

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
so he's holding them he just

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.960 
so he's holding them he just
automatically<00:02:19.920> picks<00:02:20.340> them<00:02:20.520> up<00:02:20.580> because<00:02:20.820> he

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
automatically picks them up because he

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.150 
automatically picks them up because he
has<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.300> special<00:02:21.690> ability<00:02:23.630> so<00:02:24.630> if<00:02:24.840> we<00:02:25.160> kill

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
has that special ability so if we kill

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:35.740 
has that special ability so if we kill
them<00:02:31.670> see<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:33.660> he<00:02:33.810> dropped<00:02:34.050> those<00:02:34.350> bones<00:02:34.650> so

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
them see that he dropped those bones so

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.300 
them see that he dropped those bones so
basically<00:02:36.750> what<00:02:37.140> he<00:02:37.290> was<00:02:37.320> doing<00:02:37.709> was<00:02:38.010> he<00:02:38.040> was

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
basically what he was doing was he was

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.470 
basically what he was doing was he was
holding<00:02:38.610> these<00:02:38.790> bones<00:02:39.300> for<00:02:39.630> us<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:41.480> basically

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
holding these bones for us and basically

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.780 
holding these bones for us and basically
what<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.200> idea<00:02:43.230> behind<00:02:43.680> this<00:02:43.860> is<00:02:44.070> that<00:02:44.100> the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
what the idea behind this is that the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.120 
what the idea behind this is that the
zombies<00:02:45.540> are<00:02:45.690> gonna<00:02:45.780> hold<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.320> store<00:02:46.980> your

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
zombies are gonna hold you store your

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.449 
zombies are gonna hold you store your
items<00:02:47.250> for<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:48.350> so<00:02:49.350> because<00:02:49.680> one<00:02:50.190> of<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.340> big

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
items for you so because one of the big

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.710 
items for you so because one of the big
flaws<00:02:50.790> with<00:02:51.320> like<00:02:52.320> I<00:02:52.970> mentioned<00:02:53.970> if<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:54.420> stand

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
flaws with like I mentioned if you stand

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.240 
flaws with like I mentioned if you stand
here<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:54.989> can<00:02:55.350> stand<00:02:55.590> there<00:02:55.920> but<00:02:56.130> eventually

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
here you can stand there but eventually

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.520 
here you can stand there but eventually
your<00:02:56.870> inventory<00:02:57.870> is<00:02:57.930> gonna<00:02:58.050> be<00:02:58.170> filled<00:02:58.380> up

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
your inventory is gonna be filled up

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.210 
your inventory is gonna be filled up
with<00:02:58.820> items<00:03:00.470> you<00:03:01.470> can<00:03:01.650> send<00:03:01.920> them<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.160> the

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
with items you can send them to the

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.180 
with items you can send them to the
nether<00:03:02.690> there<00:03:03.690> are<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:04.080> couple<00:03:04.350> problems<00:03:04.860> with

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
nether there are a couple problems with

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.729 
nether there are a couple problems with
that<00:03:05.280> but<00:03:05.850> with<00:03:06.239> multiplayer<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.900> can<00:03:07.049> be<00:03:07.170> it's

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
that but with multiplayer it can be it's

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.720 
that but with multiplayer it can be it's
not<00:03:07.940> always<00:03:08.940> safe<00:03:09.239> so<00:03:09.870> with<00:03:10.019> this<00:03:10.700> you<00:03:11.700> are

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
not always safe so with this you are

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.640 
not always safe so with this you are
continuous<00:03:12.299> stream<00:03:12.600> of<00:03:12.630> zombies<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.200> some<00:03:13.530> of

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
continuous stream of zombies and some of

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.610 
continuous stream of zombies and some of
them<00:03:13.769> are<00:03:13.950> going<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.190> be<00:03:15.170> these<00:03:16.170> special

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
them are going to be these special

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.090 
them are going to be these special
zombies<00:03:16.890> they<00:03:17.010> can<00:03:17.130> pick<00:03:17.280> stuff<00:03:17.459> up<00:03:17.610> so<00:03:19.100> with

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
zombies they can pick stuff up so with

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.729 
zombies they can pick stuff up so with
that<00:03:20.250> in<00:03:20.549> mind<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:21.330> can<00:03:21.660> add<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.780> constant<00:03:22.410> farm

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
that in mind you can add a constant farm

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.340 
that in mind you can add a constant farm
like<00:03:22.950> a<00:03:23.040> melon<00:03:23.340> farm<00:03:23.610> a<00:03:23.670> cactus<00:03:24.000> farm

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
like a melon farm a cactus farm

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.220 
like a melon farm a cactus farm
sugarcane<00:03:25.350> farm<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:26.540> it<00:03:27.540> was<00:03:27.660> coming<00:03:27.989> come

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
sugarcane farm and it was coming come

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.520 
sugarcane farm and it was coming come
along<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.680> they'll<00:03:29.070> pick<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.430> items<00:03:29.760> up<00:03:30.530> so

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
along and they'll pick the items up so

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.390 
along and they'll pick the items up so
basically<00:03:31.830> we<00:03:31.980> got<00:03:32.010> is<00:03:32.519> a<00:03:33.590> an<00:03:34.590> unlimited

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
basically we got is a an unlimited

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.479 
basically we got is a an unlimited
storage<00:03:35.820> system<00:03:36.360> basically<00:03:37.160> so<00:03:38.160> as<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.370> can

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
storage system basically so as you can

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.190 
storage system basically so as you can
see<00:03:38.549> the<00:03:39.150> one<00:03:39.269> is<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.480> complicated<00:03:39.900> stuff<00:03:40.019> up

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
see the one is the complicated stuff up

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.800 
see the one is the complicated stuff up
will<00:03:40.380> just<00:03:40.530> die<00:03:40.709> and<00:03:41.010> you<00:03:41.760> see<00:03:41.910> he's<00:03:42.120> holding

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
will just die and you see he's holding

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.930 
will just die and you see he's holding
the<00:03:42.959> sugar<00:03:43.530> in<00:03:43.739> so<00:03:44.310> that's<00:03:44.459> basically<00:03:44.760> how<00:03:44.910> it

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
the sugar in so that's basically how it

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.500 
the sugar in so that's basically how it
works<00:03:45.590> it's<00:03:46.590> pretty<00:03:47.090> simple<00:03:48.090> little<00:03:48.209> thing

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
works it's pretty simple little thing

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.920 
works it's pretty simple little thing
but<00:03:49.290> I<00:03:50.190> mean<00:03:50.310> extremely<00:03:50.760> handful<00:03:51.360> and<00:03:51.570> he

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
but I mean extremely handful and he

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.640 
but I mean extremely handful and he
handle<00:03:52.410> Andy<00:03:53.130> for<00:03:53.840> storage<00:03:54.840> well<00:03:55.260> not<00:03:55.530> be

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
handle Andy for storage well not be

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.350 
handle Andy for storage well not be
storage<00:03:56.100> if<00:03:56.489> you're<00:03:56.670> just<00:03:56.820> solving<00:03:57.030> around

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
storage if you're just solving around

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.090 
storage if you're just solving around
he's<00:03:57.660> not<00:03:57.810> going<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:57.959> be<00:03:58.079> necessary<00:03:58.530> but<00:03:58.769> you

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
he's not going to be necessary but you

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.830 
he's not going to be necessary but you
know<00:03:59.640> if<00:03:59.730> you're<00:03:59.880> away<00:04:00.209> from<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.450> keyboard

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
know if you're away from the keyboard

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.430 
know if you're away from the keyboard
for<00:04:01.049> a<00:04:01.320> couple<00:04:01.769> hours<00:04:02.959> your<00:04:03.959> inventories

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
for a couple hours your inventories

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.809 
for a couple hours your inventories
eventually<00:04:04.890> gonna<00:04:04.950> get<00:04:05.130> full

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
eventually gonna get full

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.920 
eventually gonna get full
so<00:04:06.239> with<00:04:06.450> this<00:04:08.360> it's<00:04:09.360> not<00:04:09.420> going<00:04:09.569> to<00:04:09.659> be<00:04:09.750> fought

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
so with this it's not going to be fought

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
so with this it's not going to be fought
because<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.260> zombie<00:04:10.530> is<00:04:10.590> going<00:04:10.739> to<00:04:10.799> hold

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
because the zombie is going to hold

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.619 
because the zombie is going to hold
everything<00:04:11.340> for<00:04:11.519> you<00:04:11.670> and<00:04:11.909> as<00:04:12.269> long<00:04:12.359> as<00:04:12.510> you're

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
everything for you and as long as you're

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.750 
everything for you and as long as you're
up<00:04:12.689> within<00:04:12.900> 24<00:04:13.409> blocks<00:04:14.010> I<00:04:14.189> think<00:04:14.370> is<00:04:14.549> that<00:04:14.670> they

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
up within 24 blocks I think is that they

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.979 
up within 24 blocks I think is that they
will<00:04:14.909> not<00:04:15.060> de-spawn<00:04:15.390> so<00:04:15.599> you<00:04:15.689> can<00:04:15.780> come<00:04:15.959> back

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
will not de-spawn so you can come back

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.199 
will not de-spawn so you can come back
and<00:04:16.380> get<00:04:16.470> all<00:04:16.650> of<00:04:16.829> your<00:04:16.919> items<00:04:17.039> and<00:04:17.519> that<00:04:17.940> is

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
and get all of your items and that is

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.550 
and get all of your items and that is
that<00:04:19.549> to<00:04:20.549> summarize<00:04:20.970> this<00:04:21.419> is<00:04:21.750> a<00:04:21.930> system<00:04:22.350> that

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
that to summarize this is a system that

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.159 
that to summarize this is a system that
completes<00:04:23.039> automation<00:04:23.970> it<00:04:24.180> is<00:04:24.479> a<00:04:24.539> 100%

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
completes automation it is a 100%

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.129 
completes automation it is a 100%
automatic<00:04:25.770> feature<00:04:26.669> so<00:04:27.120> at<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.570> end<00:04:27.660> of<00:04:27.870> all

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
automatic feature so at the end of all

this scenario because the zombies
holding<00:05:01.560> them<00:05:01.680> they're<00:05:01.800> not<00:05:01.889> nearly<00:05:02.099> spawn

that<00:05:04.860> is<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.520> advantage<00:05:05.940> over<00:05:06.270> just<00:05:06.930> sending

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 
that is the advantage over just sending

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:09.279 
that is the advantage over just sending
them<00:05:07.349> to<00:05:07.440> a<00:05:07.470> different<00:05:07.620> chunk<00:05:07.919> in<00:05:08.310> the<00:05:08.580> nether
