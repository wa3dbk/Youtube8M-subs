00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
first thing that came to mind to do was

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.609 
first thing that came to mind to do was
an<00:00:12.420> origami<00:00:12.960> balloon<00:00:14.480> which<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.719> supposed<00:00:16.289> to

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
an origami balloon which is supposed to

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.080 
an origami balloon which is supposed to
be<00:00:16.740> an<00:00:16.859> easy<00:00:17.190> model<00:00:17.990> I<00:00:19.730> have<00:00:20.730> my<00:00:20.850> thoughts

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
be an easy model I have my thoughts

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.830 
be an easy model I have my thoughts
about<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:22.039> but<00:00:23.039> today<00:00:23.369> then<00:00:23.910> loss<00:00:24.119> are<00:00:24.510> we<00:00:24.689> are

about it but today then loss are we are
going<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.230> make<00:00:25.380> an<00:00:25.800> origami<00:00:25.980> bloom<00:00:26.550> um<00:00:27.949> this

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
going to make an origami bloom um this

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.420 
going to make an origami bloom um this
cat's<00:00:29.310> always<00:00:29.820> in<00:00:30.090> here<00:00:31.969> so<00:00:32.969> we're<00:00:33.180> just<00:00:33.210> dart

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
cat's always in here so we're just dart

cat's always in here so we're just dart
never<00:00:35.430> got<00:00:35.730> any<00:00:35.880> balloon<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.780> it's<00:00:37.559> actually

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
never got any balloon so it's actually

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.830 
never got any balloon so it's actually
pretty<00:00:38.160> easy<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.700> do<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.180> involves<00:00:39.629> blowing

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
pretty easy to do and involves blowing

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.280 
pretty easy to do and involves blowing
it<00:00:40.079> up<00:00:40.200> which<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:41.149> kind<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.270> weird<00:00:42.450> they<00:00:43.140> should

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
it up which is kind of weird they should

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.750 
it up which is kind of weird they should
have<00:00:43.440> like<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> thing<00:00:43.980> for<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.399> because<00:00:44.610> you

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
have like a thing for that because you

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.660 
have like a thing for that because you
have<00:00:44.910> origami<00:00:45.320> which<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.500> just<00:00:46.680> folding<00:00:47.190> then

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
have origami which is just folding then

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.459 
have origami which is just folding then
you<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:47.879> kirigami<00:00:48.390> which<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.899> where<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.200> cut

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
you have kirigami which is where you cut

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.889 
you have kirigami which is where you cut
n<00:00:49.710> fold<00:00:50.039> now<00:00:50.550> they<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:50.820> like<00:00:50.850> sticky<00:00:51.660> paper

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
n fold now they have like sticky paper

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.439 
n fold now they have like sticky paper
origami<00:00:52.289> which<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.129> like<00:00:53.280> called<00:00:53.550> something

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
origami know and now they should have

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.920 
origami know and now they should have
one<00:00:57.750> that's<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:59.329> air<00:01:00.329> origami<00:01:01.199> I'd<00:01:02.100> be<00:01:02.250> cool

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
one that's like air origami I'd be cool

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.299 
one that's like air origami I'd be cool
alright<00:01:03.930> anything<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.769> blowing<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.250> up

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
looking so you got it a nice now we're

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.039 
looking so you got it a nice now we're
going<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.119> be<00:01:51.240> something<00:01:51.540> that's<00:01:51.720> really

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
going to be something that's really

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.630 
going to be something that's really
similar<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:55.250> diamondback<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.399> time

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
similar to the diamondback this time

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.240 
similar to the diamondback this time
it's<00:01:56.790> with<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:56.969> square<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:58.079> stick<00:01:59.009> your<00:01:59.189> thumb

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
it's with a square so stick your thumb

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.850 
it's with a square so stick your thumb
in<00:01:59.810> and<00:02:00.810> now<00:02:00.930> this<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.229> really<00:02:01.380> weird<00:02:01.710> and

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
in and now this is really weird and

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.740 
in and now this is really weird and
foreign<00:02:03.079> and<00:02:04.079> push<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.280> down<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:06.119> your

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
foreign and push it down and your

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.650 
foreign and push it down and your
triangle<00:02:07.439> okay<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.009> i<00:02:08.069> doing

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
triangle okay and i doing

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:19.510 
triangle okay and i doing
said<00:02:17.740> sometimes<00:02:18.740> those<00:02:18.890> are<00:02:18.920> hard<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.280> push

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
said sometimes those are hard to push

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.410 
said sometimes those are hard to push
down<00:02:20.650> okay<00:02:22.630> okay<00:02:23.860> triangle<00:02:24.860> right<00:02:25.820> so<00:02:26.060> now<00:02:26.210> you

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
down okay okay triangle right so now you

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.860 
down okay okay triangle right so now you
got<00:02:26.600> to<00:02:26.720> flip<00:02:26.930> it<00:02:27.050> up<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.530> line<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:28.750> get<00:02:29.750> up

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
got to flip it up to the line and get up

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.230 
got to flip it up to the line and get up
to<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.200> lines<00:02:30.440> so<00:02:30.890> like<00:02:31.070> that<00:02:31.310> and<00:02:31.670> again<00:02:34.240> you

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
to the lines so like that and again you

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.500 
to the lines so like that and again you
really<00:02:35.510> can't<00:02:35.750> tell<00:02:35.810> what<00:02:36.170> I'm<00:02:36.200> doing<00:02:36.590> see<00:02:37.510> and

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
really can't tell what I'm doing see and

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.030 
really can't tell what I'm doing see and
then<00:02:38.660> flip<00:02:38.870> it<00:02:38.990> and<00:02:39.110> do<00:02:39.290> they'll<00:02:39.470> manage<00:02:39.680> that

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
then flip it and do they'll manage that

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:48.700 
then flip it and do they'll manage that
