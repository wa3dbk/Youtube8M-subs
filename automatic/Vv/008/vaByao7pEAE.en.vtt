guy who has a Camaro he will only be in

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.899 
guy who has a Camaro he will only be in
the<00:01:04.110> Camaro<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:04.769> I'm<00:01:04.830> not<00:01:04.920> saying<00:01:05.220> about<00:01:05.400> about

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
the Camaro so I'm not saying about about

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.870 
the Camaro so I'm not saying about about
all<00:01:06.119> Camaro<00:01:06.540> owners<00:01:06.900> but<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:08.189> happens<00:01:08.610> very

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
all Camaro owners but that happens very

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.480 
all Camaro owners but that happens very
very<00:01:09.600> often<00:01:09.780> with<00:01:10.290> American<00:01:10.890> muscle<00:01:11.130> car<00:01:11.310> guys

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
very often with American muscle car guys

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.910 
very often with American muscle car guys
I<00:01:11.700> think<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.270> lot<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.450> Volkswagen<00:01:13.320> owners<00:01:13.650> do

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
I think a lot of Volkswagen owners do

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.359 
I think a lot of Volkswagen owners do
this<00:01:14.070> too<00:01:14.340> they<00:01:15.320> respect<00:01:16.320> all<00:01:16.500> Volkswagens

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
this too they respect all Volkswagens

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.179 
this too they respect all Volkswagens
but<00:01:17.970> pretty<00:01:18.360> much<00:01:18.420> exclude<00:01:19.140> anyone<00:01:20.009> else

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
but pretty much exclude anyone else

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.280 
but pretty much exclude anyone else
outside<00:01:20.430> their<00:01:20.759> little<00:01:21.030> group<00:01:21.659> sometimes

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
outside their little group sometimes

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.929 
outside their little group sometimes
they'll<00:01:22.619> be<00:01:22.680> like<00:01:22.920> oh<00:01:23.100> it's<00:01:23.340> an<00:01:23.460> Audi<00:01:23.610> it's

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
they'll be like oh it's an Audi it's

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.090 
they'll be like oh it's an Audi it's
okay<00:01:24.240> but<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.810> think<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.350> lot<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.530> Volkswagen

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
okay but I think a lot of Volkswagen

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.520 
okay but I think a lot of Volkswagen
owners<00:01:26.280> are<00:01:26.549> pretty<00:01:26.759> self-centered<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:28.320> not
