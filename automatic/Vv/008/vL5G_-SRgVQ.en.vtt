00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
would've been apparently and two they

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.610 
would've been apparently and two they
more<00:02:33.510> like<00:02:33.630> what<00:02:33.750> across<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.140> dinner<00:02:34.320> missed

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
more like what across the dinner missed

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.980 
more like what across the dinner missed
anyway<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:35.160> I<00:02:35.610> kind<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.180> just<00:02:36.330> ruined<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.810> for

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
anyway so I kind of just ruined it for

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.530 
anyway so I kind of just ruined it for
my<00:02:37.080> team<00:02:37.320> one-nil<00:02:38.070> down<00:02:38.130> at<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.580> halftime<00:02:38.910> and

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
my team one-nil down at the halftime and

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.540 
my team one-nil down at the halftime and
hopefully<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.560> does<00:02:40.739> look<00:02:40.920> like<00:02:41.010> we<00:02:41.160> could<00:02:41.370> get

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
hopefully it does look like we could get

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.309 
hopefully it does look like we could get
taken<00:02:41.940> off<00:02:42.030> because<00:02:42.330> we<00:02:42.450> are<00:02:42.600> still<00:02:42.930> injured

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
taken off because we are still injured

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.890 
taken off because we are still injured
as<00:02:43.530> well<00:02:43.590> which<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.489> kind<00:02:45.239> of<00:02:45.330> retaining<00:02:45.720> that

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
as well which is kind of retaining that

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.510 
as well which is kind of retaining that
said<00:02:46.200> we<00:02:46.290> could<00:02:46.440> be<00:02:46.530> up<00:02:46.620> for<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.860> few<00:02:47.100> weeks<00:02:47.280> but

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
said we could be up for a few weeks but

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.670 
said we could be up for a few weeks but
anyway<00:02:47.790> we<00:02:47.940> did<00:02:48.150> do<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.480> again<00:02:48.870> taking<00:02:49.260> off<00:02:49.380> and

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
anyway we did do it again taking off and

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.910 
anyway we did do it again taking off and
never<00:02:50.070> midfielder<00:02:50.670> does<00:02:50.880> come<00:02:51.090> on<00:02:51.239> for<00:02:51.510> our

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
into the midfield against chelsea in my

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.740 
into the midfield against chelsea in my

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
opinion is a big achievement because

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.920 
opinion is a big achievement because
just<00:05:03.750> do<00:05:03.900> the<00:05:04.020> fact<00:05:04.259> that<00:05:04.379> right<00:05:05.189> if<00:05:05.969> I'm<00:05:06.330> gonna
