Kelvin<00:00:09.630> light<00:00:09.870> meter<00:00:10.170> we're<00:00:10.800> going<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.040> be

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
Kelvin light meter we're going to be

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.249 
Kelvin light meter we're going to be
testing<00:00:11.580> this<00:00:11.730> unit<00:00:12.090> relatively<00:00:12.900> right<00:00:13.110> out

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
testing this unit relatively right out

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.770 
testing this unit relatively right out
of<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.440> box<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.130> see<00:00:14.309> how<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:14.969> performs<00:00:15.420> in

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
of the box and to see how it performs in

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.330 
of the box and to see how it performs in
terms<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.230> reading<00:00:16.949> kelvins<00:00:17.580> for<00:00:17.970> typical<00:00:18.570> and

terms of reading kelvins for typical and

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.240 
terms of reading kelvins for typical and
common<00:00:20.340> use<00:00:21.020> applications<00:00:22.020> with<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.289> no

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
running gun video shooting style okay so

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.769 
running gun video shooting style okay so
you're<00:00:26.430> probably<00:00:26.580> wondering<00:00:27.210> what's<00:00:27.539> up

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
you're probably wondering what's up

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.200 
you're probably wondering what's up
what's<00:00:28.109> up<00:00:28.260> what<00:00:28.980> did<00:00:29.130> joules<00:00:29.369> do<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.970> color

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
what's up what did joules do the color

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.269 
what's up what did joules do the color
looks<00:00:30.510> awful<00:00:31.109> well<00:00:31.320> that's<00:00:31.470> exactly<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.040> case

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
looks awful well that's exactly the case

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.120 
looks awful well that's exactly the case
and<00:00:32.550> that's<00:00:32.610> exactly<00:00:33.059> why<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.870> bought<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.620> c500

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
and that's exactly why I bought the c500

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.280 
and that's exactly why I bought the c500
you<00:00:36.090> know<00:00:36.180> sometimes<00:00:36.630> you're<00:00:36.840> in<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> field

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
you know sometimes you're in the field

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.110 
you know sometimes you're in the field
and<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.739> colors<00:00:38.129> are<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.309> off<00:00:38.730> here<00:00:39.090> you

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
and the colors are just off here you

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.780 
and the colors are just off here you
can't<00:00:39.540> look<00:00:40.110> up<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.410> sky<00:00:40.710> sage<00:00:41.070> hmm<00:00:41.610> that

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
can't look up the sky sage hmm that

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.850 
can't look up the sky sage hmm that
looks<00:00:41.820> like<00:00:42.090> about<00:00:42.239> 4,800<00:00:43.200> Calvin<00:00:43.590> or<00:00:43.739> that

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
looks like about 4,800 Calvin or that

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.279 
looks like about 4,800 Calvin or that
looks<00:00:44.070> like<00:00:44.160> about<00:00:44.629> 2000<00:00:45.629> Kelvin<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:46.050> just

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
looks like about 2000 Kelvin you just

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.350 
looks like about 2000 Kelvin you just
don't<00:00:46.559> know<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.129> really<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:47.820> don't<00:00:48.000> like

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
don't know and really I don't like

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.139 
don't know and really I don't like
editing<00:00:48.750> color<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.260> post<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.829> mean<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.039> do<00:00:50.219> but

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
editing color and post I mean I do but

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.119 
editing color and post I mean I do but
the<00:00:51.300> thing<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.539> that's<00:00:52.289> mostly<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.739> tweak

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
the thing is that's mostly to tweak

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.189 
the thing is that's mostly to tweak
things<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.760> like<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.030> get<00:00:54.149> color<00:00:54.390> right<00:00:54.809> out<00:00:55.140> of

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
things I like to get color right out of

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.220 
things I like to get color right out of
the<00:00:55.590> box<00:00:55.949> correct<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.360> way<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.840> colors

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the box correct so that way the colors

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.950 
the box correct so that way the colors
look<00:00:58.530> good<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.520> that's<00:01:00.120> why<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.449> bought<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
look good so that's why I bought the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.939 
look good so that's why I bought the
c500

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
c500

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.889 
c500
the<00:01:02.399> other<00:01:02.550> reason<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.000> bought<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.329> c5<00:01:03.719> hook

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
the other reason I bought the c5 hook

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.070 
the other reason I bought the c5 hook
500<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.920> because<00:01:05.309> often<00:01:05.700> times<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.299> use<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.720> gray

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
500 is because often times I use a gray

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.200 
500 is because often times I use a gray
card<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.650> great<00:01:07.860> cards<00:01:08.250> well<00:01:08.460> they're<00:01:09.180> very

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
card in great cards well they're very

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.469 
card in great cards well they're very
effective<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.640> they<00:01:11.640> do<00:01:11.700> exactly<00:01:12.360> what

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
effective and they do exactly what

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.030 
effective and they do exactly what
they're<00:01:12.600> supposed<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.900> do<00:01:13.049> white<00:01:13.590> balance

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
they're supposed to do white balance

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.490 
they're supposed to do white balance
your<00:01:14.159> image<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.820> color<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.150> bang-on<00:01:15.630> but

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
your image so the color is bang-on but

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.990 
your image so the color is bang-on but
the<00:01:16.590> thing<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.280> they're<00:01:17.549> kind<00:01:17.820> of

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
the thing is is that they're kind of

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.670 
the thing is is that they're kind of
tedious<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.720> sometimes<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.350> don't<00:01:19.500> have

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
tedious and sometimes you don't have

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.190 
tedious and sometimes you don't have
something<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.189> hold<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:21.210> light<00:01:21.509> out<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
something to hold the light out in the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.960 
something to hold the light out in the
field<00:01:22.500> sorry<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.250> gray<00:01:23.430> card<00:01:23.700> out<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:23.909> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
field sorry in a gray card out in the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.719 
field sorry in a gray card out in the
field<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:25.049> wanted<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.590> be<00:01:25.710> able<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.979> know

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
field so I wanted to be able to know

field so I wanted to be able to know
when<00:01:27.119> I'm<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.450> site<00:01:27.810> on<00:01:28.020> particular<00:01:28.380> shoot

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
when I'm on site on particular shoot

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.260 
when I'm on site on particular shoot
I've<00:01:28.770> got<00:01:28.950> my<00:01:29.070> camera<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.640> holding<00:01:30.030> it's<00:01:30.150> like

c500 click it and be able to know
exactly<00:01:35.579> what<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.000> color<00:01:36.509> temperature<00:01:37.140> is

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
exactly what that color temperature is

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.920 
exactly what that color temperature is
so<00:01:38.159> that's<00:01:38.820> why<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.119> bought<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.689> particular

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
there you go so I just started reading

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.560 
there you go so I just started reading
on<00:01:49.259> my<00:01:49.409> face<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.890> it's<00:01:50.430> telling<00:01:50.970> me<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
on my face and it's telling me that the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.690 
on my face and it's telling me that the
light<00:01:51.840> here<00:01:52.439> on<00:01:52.649> my<00:01:52.950> face<00:01:53.189> at<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:53.729> time<00:01:54.030> is

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
light here on my face at this time is

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.350 
light here on my face at this time is
3690<00:01:56.700> Kelvin

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
3690 Kelvin

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.330 
3690 Kelvin
hmm<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.200> doesn't<00:01:58.560> seem<00:01:58.740> about<00:01:59.040> right<00:01:59.100> I

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
hmm that doesn't seem about right I

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.459 
hmm that doesn't seem about right I
would<00:01:59.640> think<00:01:59.790> I'd<00:01:59.969> be<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.180> more<00:02:00.329> about<00:02:00.570> 7000

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
would think I'd be it more about 7000

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.980 
would think I'd be it more about 7000
but<00:02:01.649> hey<00:02:02.280> what<00:02:02.759> do<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:02.909> know<00:02:03.030> say<00:02:03.420> connick<00:02:03.810> you

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
but hey what do I know say connick you

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.590 
but hey what do I know say connick you
guys<00:02:04.170> are<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.500> experts<00:02:04.579> so<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.969> meter<00:02:06.360> is

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
guys are the experts so the meter is

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.619 
guys are the experts so the meter is
timing<00:02:06.840> 36<00:02:07.560> 90<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.129> in<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.340> next<00:02:08.520> shot<00:02:08.970> what

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
timing 36 90 so in the next shot what

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.449 
timing 36 90 so in the next shot what
I'm<00:02:09.750> gonna<00:02:09.959> do<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.410> I'm<00:02:10.560> going<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.950> set<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
I'm gonna do is I'm going to set the

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.630 
I'm gonna do is I'm going to set the
Kelvin<00:02:11.879> meter

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
Kelvin meter

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.850 
Kelvin meter
36:19<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.380> see<00:02:15.370> what<00:02:15.520> happens<00:02:16.410> okay<00:02:17.410> so<00:02:17.650> I

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
36:19 and see what happens okay so I

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.800 
36:19 and see what happens okay so I
just<00:02:18.400> set<00:02:18.550> my<00:02:18.700> camera<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:20.220> 3,700<00:02:21.220> Calvin<00:02:21.790> uh<00:02:22.120> to

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
just set my camera to 3,700 Calvin uh to

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.130 
just set my camera to 3,700 Calvin uh to
basically<00:02:23.310> show<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:25.390> colors<00:02:25.660> kind<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:25.990> off

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
basically show the colors kind of off

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.780 
basically show the colors kind of off
here<00:02:26.950> I'm<00:02:27.010> gonna<00:02:27.100> take<00:02:27.250> a<00:02:27.310> picture<00:02:27.490> of<00:02:27.700> the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
here I'm gonna take a picture of the

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.080 
here I'm gonna take a picture of the
monitor<00:02:28.209> here<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:30.220> you'll<00:02:30.580> be<00:02:30.700> able<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.940> see

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
monitor here so you'll be able to see

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.020 
monitor here so you'll be able to see
the<00:02:31.270> 3700<00:02:32.080> Calvin<00:02:32.470> I<00:02:32.560> set<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:32.950> actual<00:02:33.370> camera

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
the 3700 Calvin I set the actual camera

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.190 
the 3700 Calvin I set the actual camera
to<00:02:34.570> 3,700<00:02:35.560> Calvin<00:02:35.950> per<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.820> c500<00:02:37.240> so<00:02:37.720> they

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
to 3,700 Calvin per the c500 so they

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.710 
to 3,700 Calvin per the c500 so they
were<00:02:38.260> at<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.500> scene<00:02:38.650> 500<00:02:39.160> told<00:02:39.340> me<00:02:39.459> to<00:02:39.580> do<00:02:39.760> but

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
were at the scene 500 told me to do but

I'm<00:02:40.900> looking<00:02:41.200> at<00:02:41.320> a<00:02:41.350> monitor<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:42.100> I'm<00:02:42.190> looking

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
I'm looking at a monitor and I'm looking

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.670 
I'm looking at a monitor and I'm looking

sickly so I'm gonna try a different way
to<00:02:54.550> white<00:02:54.820> balance<00:02:55.000> it<00:02:55.450> I'm<00:02:55.690> not<00:02:55.870> gonna<00:02:56.140> rely

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
to white balance it I'm not gonna rely

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.770 
to white balance it I'm not gonna rely
on<00:02:56.560> this<00:02:56.830> thousand<00:02:57.430> dollar<00:02:57.580> device<00:02:57.970> 1100<00:02:58.660> ish

woods I'm gonna try a great card and see
what<00:03:02.709> happens<00:03:03.100> okay<00:03:03.610> so<00:03:03.880> I'm<00:03:04.209> zooming<00:03:04.239> into<00:03:04.780> my

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
what happens okay so I'm zooming into my

gray card right now and white balance
but<00:03:08.920> it's<00:03:09.880> a<00:03:10.060> 700<00:03:10.840> Kelvin

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.460 

going<00:03:13.810> to<00:03:15.300> change<00:03:16.300> it<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:16.720> whoops<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.260> color

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
going to change it and whoops the color

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.050 
going to change it and whoops the color
just<00:03:17.709> changed<00:03:18.370> its<00:03:19.290> 5700<00:03:20.290> Kelvin<00:03:20.950> I'm<00:03:21.610> a<00:03:21.670> zoom

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
just changed its 5700 Kelvin I'm a zoom

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:30.150 
just changed its 5700 Kelvin I'm a zoom
out<00:03:22.269> and<00:03:24.000> he<00:03:26.040> told<00:03:27.040> me<00:03:28.080> that's<00:03:29.080> me<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:29.769> you<00:03:30.010> can

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
out and he told me that's me and you can

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.050 
out and he told me that's me and you can
see<00:03:31.590> my<00:03:32.590> skin<00:03:32.830> tones<00:03:33.040> look<00:03:33.130> a<00:03:33.280> lot<00:03:33.400> better

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
see my skin tones look a lot better

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.410 
see my skin tones look a lot better
I<00:03:34.120> still<00:03:34.660> again<00:03:34.840> just<00:03:35.080> to<00:03:35.200> recap<00:03:35.349> the<00:03:36.420> say

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
I still again just to recap the say

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.710 
I still again just to recap the say
Connick<00:03:37.890> c500<00:03:38.890> telling<00:03:39.160> me<00:03:39.220> 3700<00:03:40.209> Kelvin

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
Connick c500 telling me 3700 Kelvin

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.710 
Connick c500 telling me 3700 Kelvin
not<00:03:41.500> quite<00:03:41.920> right<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.879> gray<00:03:43.180> card<00:03:43.569> was

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
not quite right the gray card was

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.990 
not quite right the gray card was
telling<00:03:43.989> me<00:03:44.280> 5700<00:03:45.280> Kelvin

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
telling me 5700 Kelvin

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.150 
telling me 5700 Kelvin
I<00:03:46.110> think<00:03:47.110> that's<00:03:47.290> more<00:03:47.470> accurate<00:03:47.680> you'd<00:03:48.069> be

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
I think that's more accurate you'd be

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.160 
I think that's more accurate you'd be
the<00:03:48.310> judge<00:03:48.549> my<00:03:48.849> skin<00:03:49.180> tones<00:03:49.450> look<00:03:49.630> a<00:03:49.750> lot<00:03:49.930> more

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
the judge my skin tones look a lot more

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.370 
the judge my skin tones look a lot more
natural<00:03:50.680> at<00:03:51.209> 5700<00:03:52.209> Kelvin<00:03:52.829> so<00:03:54.150> conclusion

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
natural at 5700 Kelvin so conclusion

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.930 
natural at 5700 Kelvin so conclusion
don't<00:03:56.380> really<00:03:56.680> like<00:03:56.860> this<00:03:57.069> device<00:03:57.459> I<00:03:57.730> don't

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
don't really like this device I don't

you<00:04:44.380> can<00:04:44.639> figure<00:04:45.639> out<00:04:45.820> and<00:04:46.060> make<00:04:46.120> a<00:04:46.240> device

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
you can figure out and make a device

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.990 
you can figure out and make a device
more<00:04:47.020> reliable<00:04:47.560> so<00:04:47.740> if<00:04:47.919> I<00:04:48.070> tell<00:04:48.310> it<00:04:48.490> you<00:04:48.910> know

more reliable so if I tell it you know

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.900 
more reliable so if I tell it you know
it's<00:04:49.210> X<00:04:49.510> the<00:04:49.780> value<00:04:49.960> of<00:04:50.530> the<00:04:50.770> Kelvin<00:04:51.250> then<00:04:51.850> I

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
it's X the value of the Kelvin then I

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.670 
it's X the value of the Kelvin then I
could<00:04:52.150> put<00:04:52.300> it<00:04:52.419> into<00:04:52.600> my<00:04:52.720> camera<00:04:53.020> so<00:04:53.410> I<00:04:53.440> know
