00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.470
 Hello everyone, today I am going to teach you 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.200
 prepare this bunch of chupa chups that is 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.760
 a very simple craft and that 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.170
 commented on an ideal detail for 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.740
 deliver for example on a birthday 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.970
 child or at a wedding for children 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.970
 so let's see how it's done 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.650
 to prepare our bouquet of sucks 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.200
 chups we're going to need the chupa chups 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.400
 that we have chosen 11 sucks 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.280
 chups so that a real milestone more or 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.540
 less like the size that you have seen 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.760
 scissors elongated sticks pinocho paper 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.750
 zeal and a rope or loop that 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.750
 we will use at the end 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.330
 The first thing we are going to do is unite the 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.880
 chupa chups to the stick then what 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:55.780
 we are going to do is put it under the 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:58.040
 chupa chups and secure it with a little 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.120
 zeal 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.120
 so that it does not come out 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.860
 we will repeat this operation with all 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.860
 the chupa chups 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.750
 when we have already joined all the sucks 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.790
 chups with chopsticks we can start 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.580
 ride the tail first thing we have 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.810
 what to do 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.970
 is to put it in shape 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.500
 It will depend on us how we want 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.660
 we can modify the points of the 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:37.090
 colors and then to ensure it well 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:41.729
 we add 0 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.729
 very strong so they do not get out 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.909
 as you see they are already united and they are already well 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.310
 subjects and then we have to cut the 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.830
 piece of stick that we have more or more 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.740
 less around here 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.340
 so we see cutting everything more or less to the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.340
 same cream 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.230
 we have already cut it then now 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.510
 it is necessary to put pinocho paper to form 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.040
 the bouquet then for this you have to 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.470
 choose two colors that more or less 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.740
 combine we have chosen the rose 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.870
 and the green then we take first one 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.920
 of the two 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:31.590
 and I roll around the sucks 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.590
 chups giving a little bit of shape 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.310
 and to make sure we put 0 as this goes 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:46.680
 to be the first layer that then goes to 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.849
 be covered with the second we can 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.849
 put enough zeal 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.840
 now we put the second layer 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.560
 Be careful because this is going to be more 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.560
 Visible does not have to look good 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.680
 we assure with a zeal 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.319
 finally to make it look more beautiful 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.930
 let's make a loop with a ribbon 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.140
 color we prefer 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.060
 then what we have to do 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.500
 highlight options in the area 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:36.750
 plugging zero as possible 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.750
 and we go with the money 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.990
 and this is the final result if it has 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.700
