mirrors and a main body and a chances so
that<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.379> 18<00:00:49.980> parts<00:00:50.250> on<00:00:50.370> all<00:00:50.899> and<00:00:51.899> look<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.469> just

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
that is 18 parts on all and look I just

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.279 
that is 18 parts on all and look I just
really<00:00:53.010> looking<00:00:53.250> at<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.579> pattern<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:55.079> see

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
it's like as a coffin shape it's like

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.520 
it's like as a coffin shape it's like
wider<00:02:28.850> in<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:29.330> top<00:02:29.570> but<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:30.050> then<00:02:30.290> it<00:02:30.410> gets

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
wider in the top but it then it gets

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.770 
wider in the top but it then it gets
narrower<00:02:31.070> when<00:02:31.580> it<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:31.760> when<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.510> reach<00:02:32.750> the

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
narrower when it you when you reach the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.420 
narrower when it you when you reach the
feet<00:02:33.350> stop<00:02:34.250> falling<00:02:35.350> stop<00:02:36.350> falling<00:02:36.950> PAGASA

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
feet stop falling stop falling PAGASA

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.960 
feet stop falling stop falling PAGASA
okay<00:02:38.239> so<00:02:40.150> gets<00:02:41.150> narrow<00:02:41.420> when<00:02:41.780> it<00:02:41.900> goes<00:02:42.140> down<00:02:42.970> it

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
okay so gets narrow when it goes down it

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.729 
okay so gets narrow when it goes down it
comes<00:02:44.360> with<00:02:44.630> an<00:02:44.750> occupied<00:02:45.200> energy<00:02:45.530> playing

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
comes with an occupied energy playing

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.670 
comes with an occupied energy playing
this<00:02:45.829> is<00:02:46.010> a<00:02:46.190> game<00:02:46.489> at<00:02:46.610> power<00:02:47.200> really<00:02:48.200> nice<00:02:48.380> and

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
this is a game at power really nice and

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.330 
this is a game at power really nice and

saw<00:03:09.620> me<00:03:09.739> tuck<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:09.980> arms<00:03:10.220> a<00:03:10.310> while<00:03:10.430> ago<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:10.989> put

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
saw me tuck the arms a while ago and put

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.850 
saw me tuck the arms a while ago and put
that<00:03:12.200> head<00:03:12.470> in<00:03:13.269> then

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.140 

insert<00:03:17.730> this<00:03:18.360> really<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:18.810> like<00:03:19.050> this<00:03:19.230> because

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
insert this really I like this because

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.400 
insert this really I like this because
before<00:03:21.150> I<00:03:21.390> had<00:03:21.540> a<00:03:21.570> problem<00:03:21.840> with<00:03:22.230> the

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
before I had a problem with the

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.460 
before I had a problem with the
inserting<00:03:22.830> of<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.100> those<00:03:23.400> two<00:03:23.640> things<00:03:24.470> into

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
inserting of the those two things into

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.070 
inserting of the those two things into
the<00:03:26.300> back<00:03:27.300> into<00:03:28.050> the<00:03:28.980> body<00:03:29.190> but<00:03:29.490> now<00:03:29.730> I<00:03:29.760> don't

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
the back into the body but now I don't

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.170 
the back into the body but now I don't
and<00:03:31.080> then<00:03:31.290> just<00:03:31.530> fold<00:03:31.710> that<00:03:31.920> because<00:03:32.630> form<00:03:35.180> so

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
and then just fold that because form so

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.440 
and then just fold that because form so
that<00:03:36.210> is<00:03:36.660> buck<00:03:37.620> assigned<00:03:38.040> gmod<00:03:38.550> lots<00:03:39.150> of<00:03:39.300> lead

that is buck assigned gmod lots of lead

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:46.490 
that is buck assigned gmod lots of lead

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
lots of detail look Oh fog lights then

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.440 
lots of detail look Oh fog lights then
there's<00:03:46.860> like<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.630> front<00:03:49.670> then<00:03:50.670> which<00:03:50.850> I<00:03:51.060> had

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
there's like the front then which I had

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.900 
there's like the front then which I had
prompt<00:03:52.350> to<00:03:52.500> problems<00:03:52.920> in<00:03:53.070> this<00:03:53.220> making<00:03:53.760> this

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
prompt to problems in this making this

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.250

one<00:03:54.690> was<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.050> grille<00:03:55.260> bumper<00:03:55.500> thing<00:03:56.120> because

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
one was the grille bumper thing because

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.550 
one was the grille bumper thing because
gluing<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.380> fog<00:03:58.560> lights<00:03:58.770> really<00:03:59.070> difficult

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
gluing the fog lights really difficult

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.460 
gluing the fog lights really difficult
and<00:04:01.940> the<00:04:02.940> other<00:04:03.060> is<00:04:04.040> this<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:06.780> fender<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.410> the

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
and the other is this the fender and the

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.310 
and the other is this the fender and the
wheel<00:04:07.739> problem<00:04:08.370> for<00:04:08.760> me<00:04:09.050> because<00:04:10.050> you<00:04:10.140> have<00:04:10.230> to

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
wheel problem for me because you have to

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.170 
wheel problem for me because you have to
estimate<00:04:10.530> where<00:04:11.010> you<00:04:11.820> have<00:04:11.940> to<00:04:12.030> estimate

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
inside yours except if you just be

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.520 
inside yours except if you just be
careful<00:04:27.030> because<00:04:27.419> these<00:04:28.020> are<00:04:28.169> really<00:04:28.290> small

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
careful because these are really small

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.830 
careful because these are really small
parts<00:04:28.890> especially<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.790> fog<00:04:30.000> lights<00:04:30.270> and<00:04:30.510> the

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
side mirrors they can easily easily be

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.270 
side mirrors they can easily easily be
be<00:04:34.200> lost<00:04:34.550> with<00:04:35.550> the<00:04:36.680> occupied<00:04:37.680> energy<00:04:37.950> frame<00:04:38.130> I

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
be lost with the occupied energy frame I

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.060 
be lost with the occupied energy frame I
think<00:04:38.640> you<00:04:38.910> have<00:04:39.120> to<00:04:39.150> you<00:04:39.510> can<00:04:39.690> just<00:04:39.890> slip<00:04:40.890> him

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
think you have to you can just slip him

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.800

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
lots of small parts looks good so let me

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.860 
lots of small parts looks good so let me
