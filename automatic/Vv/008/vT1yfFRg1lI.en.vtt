00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 I say reluctant but sharpshooters 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.700
 Round team deathmatch good day and 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.469
 Welcome to a new series of call 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.809
 of Duty is the sniper and me 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.929
 we are not one but it is asked 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:23.449
 quite a round a follow a sequence 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:23.449
 with ski and rifle and yes I do it 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.510
 we need to get it he has seen 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.349
 Everyone would have got that but we did not 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.700
 because we're using sniper rifles 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.410
 have nothing on hat, respectively 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:40.290
 not so much what is that for you 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.600
 oh that's the type of calle the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:48.559
 hunted all the time on the terrace 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.559
 usually with us 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:02.699
 as a sniper which not quite 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:04.839
 Surprisingly oh that can not be 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:11.710
 but I believe that those are valid 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:18.160
 already such pillows too much for us me 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:19.900
 I have never sex with you 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.770
 obvious position where you as 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:27.460
 sheep remains or is therefore one 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:35.440
 a little bit further here, everything is on the ball 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:37.210
 free unfortunately you live as 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.170
 Sniper is not that easy 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:46.530
 just can not find any opponents 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.530
 and then you do not get damned 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:57.480
 delta have to do us we stood there 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:02:00.960
 very long if we have one 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.310
 there are the well you see if I 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.670
 I am not a spectacle 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.590
 to which the rapid spring kill war 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.070
 Schopen I'm more of the Hartz copy 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.570
 sniper because that's how I define one 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.350
 Sniper is not very far 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.350
 at the front 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:25.110
 Nevertheless, we are the people I was 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.780
 but now and then 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:32.010
 I also want the sentix there and 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.430
 But then the short process will be 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:39.080
 pistole if there is a chance 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.080
 is one to go with the pistol though 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.209
 No extras for ours 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.280
 sniper rifle because I am with it 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.620
 not so often or not at all 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.950
 that's why we do not care 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.769
 sorry if you have expected something different 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:03.120
 but I never like to be a sharpshooter 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:07.380
 but now, and yet I'm second 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.690
 still I am on the second place 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.459
 Sorry, that too 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:16.160
 what's going on with the others? 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.160
 i am only sniper all the time 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.310
 it turns out oh I wanted the now 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.310
 pistols did not work 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.310
 damned 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:46.130
 unfortunately one of your own 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.310
 not got our gun 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:52.770
 yawoll turned the king as 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.420
 sniper will shoot at that time 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.830
 At the same time I do not think we hit 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:06.000
 we were a bit over there 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:08.580
 his head look as even I can with 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.110
 his sniper rifle play that 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.660
 means there is nothing special if there 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.310
 make people kills 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:18.720
 I think I spend a little bit of time and money 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:21.230
 then this will go well with the glory 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.230
 sneakers 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:33.000
 it did not look like a corpse 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:39.930
 he just lies with the rum says nothing 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:50.629
 penner so far to disney has now 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:50.629
 a drone for our schnieper no 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.110
 I think that would be a dream with a theme 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.139
 But I think so synonymous a topic 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.680
 However , it is not so nice for around 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.680
 sniff 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:06.590
 no but not saved 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:15.680
 13 12 in the first place you want 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.680
 I'm kidding I'm lugging around 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.620
 there you have my team a bit more 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.620
 do 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:41.150
 as soon as I see something I am here 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.150
 im moving it is dead 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:52.500
 No, I can not do that 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:54.060
 it hurts we take the hgr a3 and 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.100
 red dot and grab I think 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:04.140
 parabolic microphone very likely 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:08.660
 few beans microphone then comes one 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.660
 with ner tech nineteen and kill us 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:19.889
 to one less 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:27.450
 can one shoot by that no, oh 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.450
 what a shame 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.600
 At the end there is a bit light 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.700
 what brought 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:50.160
 and one more drone from me for 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.160
 your team makes out of it the pigs 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:02.729
 that 's not okay so mainz macnee 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:06.710
 must do well now to have a go here and 

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:06.710
 just turn things when it still works 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.040
 Eight of the pampa's makes the eye then 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:28.240
 makes the good tight spaces was there 

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:29.500
 and then well, despite the fact 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.350
 In the end, I could no longer be people 

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.800
 I'm sorry it hurts to 

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.800
 deliver 

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.780
 21 17 

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:43.330
 Well, as I said the roomz deliver 

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.820
 you can still improve and then will 

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:48.420
 but we will not run up too 

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.420
 next time bye
