you

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.550 

interesting<00:00:20.240> questions<00:00:20.660> I<00:00:20.810> suppose<00:00:21.140> really

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
interesting questions I suppose really

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.679 
interesting questions I suppose really
are<00:00:21.650> always<00:00:21.830> wary<00:00:22.189> of<00:00:22.430> new<00:00:23.029> products<00:00:23.480> that<00:00:23.600> are

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
are always wary of new products that are

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.359 
are always wary of new products that are
supposed<00:00:23.930> to<00:00:24.020> give<00:00:24.260> you<00:00:24.410> something<00:00:25.160> extra

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
supposed to give you something extra

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.659 
supposed to give you something extra
this<00:00:26.029> day<00:00:26.300> and<00:00:26.360> age<00:00:26.510> of<00:00:27.340> excellent<00:00:28.340> oils

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:28.669 
this day and age of excellent oils

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:30.490 
this day and age of excellent oils
excellent<00:00:29.119> fuels<00:00:29.450> you're<00:00:29.779> a<00:00:29.960> little<00:00:30.380> bit

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
excellent fuels you're a little bit

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.460 
excellent fuels you're a little bit
weary<00:00:30.740> but<00:00:31.730> certainly<00:00:32.029> an<00:00:32.419> hour<00:00:32.599> Dino<00:00:32.840> tests

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
weary but certainly an hour Dino tests

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.890 
weary but certainly an hour Dino tests
then<00:00:33.770> we<00:00:34.190> obtained<00:00:34.850> with<00:00:35.510> two<00:00:35.690> different

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
then we obtained with two different

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.979 
then we obtained with two different
engines<00:00:36.410> I<00:00:36.650> think<00:00:36.860> about<00:00:37.129> one<00:00:37.460> we<00:00:38.300> yours<00:00:38.600> power

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
engines I think about one we yours power

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.500 
engines I think about one we yours power
gate<00:00:39.290> we<00:00:39.769> also<00:00:39.949> increase<00:00:40.460> the<00:00:40.610> top<00:00:40.850> by<00:00:41.180> about

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
gate we also increase the top by about

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.950 
gate we also increase the top by about
14<00:00:42.050> pound<00:00:43.000> which<00:00:44.000> took<00:00:44.210> us<00:00:44.269> into<00:00:44.540> the<00:00:44.720> murmur

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
14 pound which took us into the murmur

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.890 
14 pound which took us into the murmur
of<00:00:45.110> torque<00:00:45.410> figure<00:00:45.769> the<00:00:46.699> torque<00:00:47.239> curve<00:00:47.570> was

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:47.900 
of torque figure the torque curve was

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.689 
of torque figure the torque curve was
slightly<00:00:48.199> flatter<00:00:48.589> as<00:00:48.830> well<00:00:49.070> which<00:00:49.370> was<00:00:49.519> also

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
slightly flatter as well which was also

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:51.729 
slightly flatter as well which was also
been<00:00:49.970> looking<00:00:50.239> for<00:00:50.480> that<00:00:50.510> it's<00:00:51.050> not<00:00:51.260> a<00:00:51.500> nice

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
been looking for that it's not a nice

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.250 
been looking for that it's not a nice
easy<00:00:51.950> bike<00:00:52.280> to<00:00:52.460> ride<00:00:52.670> and<00:00:53.030> I<00:00:53.809> think<00:00:54.050> the<00:00:54.140> most

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
easy bike to ride and I think the most

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.740 
easy bike to ride and I think the most
impressive<00:00:54.800> thing<00:00:54.980> that<00:00:55.160> we<00:00:55.280> saw<00:00:55.520> really<00:00:56.450> was

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
impressive thing that we saw really was

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.029 
impressive thing that we saw really was
acceleration<00:00:57.620> from<00:00:57.829> 0<00:00:58.190> to<00:00:58.640> about<00:00:58.789> 150<00:00:59.829> then<00:01:00.829> we

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
acceleration from 0 to about 150 then we

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.270 
acceleration from 0 to about 150 then we
were<00:01:01.160> about<00:01:01.460> point<00:01:01.850> three<00:01:02.360> quicker<00:01:03.020> on<00:01:03.680> five

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
were about point three quicker on five

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.900 
were about point three quicker on five
rooms<00:01:04.580> that<00:01:05.570> we<00:01:05.690> did<00:01:05.930> so<00:01:06.500> you<00:01:07.340> know<00:01:07.490> Evan<00:01:07.820> Lee

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
rooms that we did so you know Evan Lee

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.820 
rooms that we did so you know Evan Lee
that<00:01:08.060> on<00:01:08.210> an<00:01:08.330> honor<00:01:08.509> on<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.050> circuit<00:01:09.619> and<00:01:09.800> I

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
that on an honor on the circuit and I

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.590 
that on an honor on the circuit and I
lap<00:01:10.039> is<00:01:10.490> it's<00:01:11.030> really<00:01:11.330> what<00:01:11.450> we're<00:01:11.570> looking

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
lap is it's really what we're looking

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.560 
lap is it's really what we're looking
for<00:01:11.810> so<00:01:12.530> overall<00:01:12.830> certainly<00:01:13.789> earlier<00:01:14.270> we're

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
for so overall certainly earlier we're

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.690 
for so overall certainly earlier we're
very<00:01:14.780> very<00:01:14.810> impressed<00:01:15.350> with<00:01:15.410> the<00:01:15.590> product

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
very very impressed with the product

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.239 
very very impressed with the product
we<00:01:18.700> don't<00:01:18.909> risk<00:01:19.329> when<00:01:20.049> we<00:01:20.170> touch<00:01:20.439> the<00:01:20.469> top<00:01:20.829> part

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:21.249 
we don't risk when we touch the top part

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:23.429 
we don't risk when we touch the top part
we<00:01:21.640> got<00:01:21.819> them<00:01:21.969> onto<00:01:22.299> a<00:01:22.329> lap<00:01:22.899> pace<00:01:23.170> that<00:01:23.319> the

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
we got them onto a lap pace that the

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.800 
we got them onto a lap pace that the
Luther<00:01:23.740> we<00:01:23.829> doing<00:01:24.069> comfortably<00:01:24.670> and<00:01:25.420> then<00:01:25.630> we

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
Luther we doing comfortably and then we

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.550 
Luther we doing comfortably and then we
added<00:01:26.259> occitane<00:01:27.069> both<00:01:27.880> riders<00:01:28.270> bought<00:01:28.869> the

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
added occitane both riders bought the

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.429 
added occitane both riders bought the
bike<00:01:29.829> fell<00:01:30.280> better<00:01:30.490> they<00:01:31.149> both<00:01:31.450> lap<00:01:31.810> slightly

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
bike fell better they both lap slightly

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.429 
bike fell better they both lap slightly
quicker<00:01:32.939> not<00:01:33.939> a<00:01:33.969> great<00:01:34.209> deal<00:01:34.420> quicker<00:01:34.719> but

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
quicker not a great deal quicker but

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:36.990 
quicker not a great deal quicker but
then<00:01:35.590> again<00:01:35.619> it<00:01:35.979> was<00:01:36.099> early<00:01:36.310> seas<00:01:36.579> and<00:01:36.789> track

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
then again it was early seas and track

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.599 
then again it was early seas and track
was<00:01:37.149> cold<00:01:37.450> so<00:01:37.689> we're<00:01:37.869> not<00:01:37.990> looking<00:01:38.170> for<00:01:38.619> a<00:01:39.280> huge

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609 
was cold so we're not looking for a huge

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:45.870 
was cold so we're not looking for a huge
amount<00:01:39.939> i<00:01:43.469> think<00:01:44.469> the<00:01:44.590> TT<00:01:45.039> can<00:01:45.280> be<00:01:45.459> very

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
amount i think the TT can be very

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.760 
amount i think the TT can be very
interesting<00:01:46.420> because<00:01:47.700> two<00:01:48.700> of<00:01:48.729> the<00:01:48.969> bikes<00:01:49.209> are

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
interesting because two of the bikes are

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.619 
interesting because two of the bikes are
stop<00:01:50.770> road<00:01:51.039> engines<00:01:51.520> I'm<00:01:51.759> expecting<00:01:52.420> there<00:01:52.599> to

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:52.629 
stop road engines I'm expecting there to

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:54.719 
stop road engines I'm expecting there to
see<00:01:52.869> it<00:01:53.020> slightly<00:01:53.229> larger<00:01:53.679> game<00:01:53.890> I<00:01:54.099> realize

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
see it slightly larger game I realize

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.429 
see it slightly larger game I realize
they're<00:01:54.969> also<00:01:55.149> claiming<00:01:55.629> that<00:01:55.869> it's<00:01:56.020> greener

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
they're also claiming that it's greener

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.169 
they're also claiming that it's greener
because<00:01:56.950> there<00:01:57.129> again<00:01:57.399> if<00:01:57.520> we<00:01:57.549> could<00:01:57.819> run<00:01:57.939> less

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
because there again if we could run less

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:59.999 
because there again if we could run less
fuel<00:01:58.450> load<00:01:58.719> certainly<00:01:59.289> that<00:01:59.469> would<00:01:59.619> be<00:01:59.829> a<00:01:59.860> big

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
fuel load certainly that would be a big

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.160 
fuel load certainly that would be a big
bonus<00:02:00.280> than<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.640> old<00:02:00.759> man<00:02:01.030> where<00:02:01.239> most<00:02:02.079> of

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
bonus than the old man where most of

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.529 
bonus than the old man where most of
your<00:02:02.319> tanks<00:02:02.920> now<00:02:03.159> you<00:02:03.909> have<00:02:04.030> to<00:02:04.179> run<00:02:04.299> certain

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
your tanks now you have to run certain

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.779 
your tanks now you have to run certain
elite<00:02:04.869> rich<00:02:05.140> you<00:02:05.829> can<00:02:05.890> only<00:02:06.129> run<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:06.399> certain

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
elite rich you can only run a certain

elite rich you can only run a certain
interest<00:02:07.119> so<00:02:07.440> quite<00:02:08.440> a<00:02:08.470> few<00:02:08.709> people<00:02:09.069> still

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
interest so quite a few people still

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.800 
interest so quite a few people still
keep<00:02:09.489> running<00:02:09.729> out<00:02:09.879> on<00:02:10.090> refueling<00:02:10.629> laps

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
keep running out on refueling laps

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.509 
keep running out on refueling laps
enough<00:02:11.049> to<00:02:11.170> push<00:02:11.319> back<00:02:11.530> in<00:02:11.739> so<00:02:12.010> we're<00:02:12.190> hoping

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
enough to push back in so we're hoping

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.210 
enough to push back in so we're hoping
that<00:02:12.579> will<00:02:12.819> help<00:02:12.940> is<00:02:13.120> that

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.810 

so<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.560> less<00:02:19.560> emissions<00:02:19.980> from<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.340> which<00:02:20.670> is

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
so the less emissions from it which is

good if I can only see a benefit if the

good if I can only see a benefit if the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
change in life makes makes them by easy

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.820 
change in life makes makes them by easy
for<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.450> writer<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:27.840> ride<00:02:28.200> that's<00:02:28.500> how<00:02:28.650> much

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
for a writer to ride that's how much

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.010 
for a writer to ride that's how much
must<00:02:29.010> be<00:02:29.160> safer<00:02:29.580> so<00:02:29.850> anything<00:02:30.570> that<00:02:30.600> makes<00:02:30.870> it

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
must be safer so anything that makes it

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.050 
must be safer so anything that makes it
safer<00:02:31.410> for<00:02:31.440> super<00:02:31.830> bikes<00:02:32.130> then<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.610> if<00:02:32.850> we're

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
safer for super bikes then and if we're

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.790 
safer for super bikes then and if we're
all<00:02:33.210> on<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.570> it's<00:02:33.780> like<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:33.960> controlled<00:02:34.500> tire

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
all on it it's like the controlled tire

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.400 
all on it it's like the controlled tire
and<00:02:35.400> we're<00:02:35.580> already<00:02:35.730> uncontrolled<00:02:36.420> fuel<00:02:36.720> if

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
and we're already uncontrolled fuel if

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.400 
and we're already uncontrolled fuel if
it<00:02:37.560> was<00:02:37.680> good<00:02:37.860> if<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.340> contains<00:02:38.870> occitane<00:02:39.870> and

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
it was good if it contains occitane and

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:50.770 
it was good if it contains occitane and
we're<00:02:41.310> away<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.670> problem

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.810 

Oh
