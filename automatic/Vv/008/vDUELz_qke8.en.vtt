00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.080
 series of categories as they are science and 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.700

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.560

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.910

 we close this little publicity 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.570
 [Music] 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.900
 and how come here is the channel 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.060
 it looks a bit slow to me because I'm 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.680
 recording the screen of my device 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.480
