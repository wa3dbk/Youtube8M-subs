 boot just come to cover the papal covered mouth 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:28.170
 There's more to this one than the one that reads that black 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:44.360
 I'm going to play and I 'm going to play 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:49.260
 version two cables and two cables one 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:52.920
 containing a microphone here fully 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.989
 smooth with nothing I do not have any other do not have 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:05.460
 It's what I do not have not only apprehensive 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:07.560
 This black well is mine is available in the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.710
 website of the company that I'm going to talk to you 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.710
 emmit freelance 25 16 women 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.960
 the cars are gold plated 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:39.130
 I realize here for you is sensitivity 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:47.030
 104 descends descents is transmits decibels 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:49.850
 that the weight of it is 248 weight range of the handset 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:55.430
 There you have to speak to whoever was mine. 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:58.009
 I'll make it clear to the Angolan government. 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.190
 do not ask technical 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:06.200
 I think that's what matters is a 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:17.690
 very comfortable movie is here on the headphones 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:22.250
 seems like a technical course at the head of 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:31.640
 two sides then no problem who 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:38.750
 john disproportionate head and one of 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:41.769
 factors I replied that he has a 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.230
 on a positive 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:47.030
 Whoever is outside does not listen to you. 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.080
 you're listening when he's in your 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.920
 head 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:58.910
 and who's on the phone does not listen that I 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:01.330
 to act was from the background a good show of 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.330
 ball 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:11.239
 the advice the microphone I do not have with 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:14.019
 hunger here he does not consider 27 tests 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:23.230
 He is a considered insect to me. 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:23.230
 because it divides channels because 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:32.830
 I turn on a PC before turning on an adapter and 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:37.090

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:44.830
 mick and I went there it works with quality 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:50.020
 It's pretty good here in the 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:51.910
 mouth a good sensitivity and if people 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:58.920
 there is nothing for now I 'm 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:04:02.250

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:22.480
 computer trip when I find it 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:29.650

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:50.340
 a video of the Sunday he spoke and 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:02.590
 also they played all the time and I think 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:06.900
 so he wants to spend a gaucho doctor 280 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:12.380
 real at most this is the stove 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:16.010
 You can catch there have your games. 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:18.770
 very good graph response has no 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:22.220
 channel should connect team other than the 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.270
 height of the year with ball from here my pc 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.290
 on here 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:32.590
 He knows the language birÃ³ she goes. 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:35.590
 to face what I know and with that in a 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.590
 archive 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.350
 OK 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:28.510
 so a default as suppose rock show 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:32.740
 good size but they are the best 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:37.090
 fans that have and do not leave the business 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:40.030
 of the adapter influence so much that 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:42.120
 It's silly always if you solve your problem. 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.980
 problem 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.340
 The ball for who's a handset, so it was. 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:50.020
 a thud where it did not touch personal beauty 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:53.770

00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:00.250
 brega is coming as a novelty not to 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:04.440

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.440
