playoff experience here but the biggest

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:13.910 
playoff experience here but the biggest
thing<00:00:12.870> I've<00:00:13.049> learned<00:00:13.230> in<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.590> end<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:13.830> the

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
thing I've learned in the end of the

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.070 
thing I've learned in the end of the
stress<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.370> defense<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.179> think<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.990> know

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
stress is defense and I think you know

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.660 
stress is defense and I think you know
defensively<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.740> can<00:00:16.890> add<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.039> lot<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.490> team

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
defensively it can add a lot to the team

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.450 
defensively it can add a lot to the team
that's<00:00:18.390> something<00:00:18.660> we<00:00:19.439> pride<00:00:19.920> ourselves<00:00:20.130> in
