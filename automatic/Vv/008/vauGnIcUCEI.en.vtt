00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.300
 This video we want to draw attention to 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.460
 eight year repair to our apartment then 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.780
 there is an apartment of our friends 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.270
 where we did the repairs wrong we start with 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.610
 the corridor 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.510
 right we have a niche and a curtain matched 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.080
 under the wallpaper 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:44.309
 yes this is not our edge on the cathedral 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:47.769
 the corridor is similar to the nozzle entrance to the kitchen 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.379
 the corridor on the right is the entrance to the bath and 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:54.100
 whether the boxes were always on top 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:57.309
 different spiders bugs were going to dust here 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:01.720
 we dismantled the boxes and made the arch 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:06.340
 the arch itself is made of foam 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:09.340
 that is, out of two pieces and got 100 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:13.360
 millimeters and the thickness of the arch which 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:16.270
 cut and set the grid after that 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:22.450
 plaster wallpaper and stuff all as 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:25.470

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:31.480

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.170
