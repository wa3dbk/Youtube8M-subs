hey folks matt from art of the image
comm<00:00:02.939> so<00:00:03.659> we've<00:00:04.020> got<00:00:04.200> the<00:00:04.319> nikon<00:00:04.770> d610<00:00:05.549> out<00:00:05.879> now

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
comm so we've got the nikon d610 out now

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.060 
comm so we've got the nikon d610 out now
the<00:00:07.020> update<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.280> nikon<00:00:08.700> d600<00:00:09.510> and

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
the update to the nikon d600 and

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.850 
the update to the nikon d600 and
basically<00:00:11.070> it's<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.849> pretty<00:00:12.330> minor<00:00:12.750> update<00:00:13.440> to

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
basically it's a pretty minor update to

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.120 
basically it's a pretty minor update to
the<00:00:13.950> 600<00:00:14.630> my<00:00:15.630> feeling<00:00:16.080> basically<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.980> that

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
the 600 my feeling basically is is that

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.390 
the 600 my feeling basically is is that
Nikon<00:00:17.490> kind<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.880> dropped<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.240> ball<00:00:18.330> or<00:00:19.369> got<00:00:20.369> a

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
Nikon kind of dropped the ball or got a

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.519 
Nikon kind of dropped the ball or got a
problem<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.180> they've<00:00:21.510> since<00:00:21.750> corrected<00:00:22.410> it

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
problem and they've since corrected it

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.750 
problem and they've since corrected it
by<00:00:23.189> bringing<00:00:24.119> out<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.420> 610<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.109> update

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
by bringing out the 610 the update

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.160 
by bringing out the 610 the update
normally<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.820> see<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.029> much<00:00:27.390> longer<00:00:27.869> life

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
normally you see a much longer life

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.070 
normally you see a much longer life
cycle<00:00:28.710> on<00:00:28.859> these<00:00:29.220> cameras<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.929> we're<00:00:30.929> only

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
cycle on these cameras and we're only

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.889 
cycle on these cameras and we're only
thirteen<00:00:31.830> months<00:00:32.630> before<00:00:33.630> we<00:00:33.719> got<00:00:33.870> a

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
thirteen months before we got a

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.880 
thirteen months before we got a
replacement<00:00:34.320> for<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> 600<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.190> it's<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.760> 610

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
replacement for the 600 and it's the 610

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.760 
replacement for the 600 and it's the 610
great<00:00:37.890> cameras<00:00:38.520> but<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.000> 610<00:00:39.690> had<00:00:40.649> an

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
great cameras but the 610 had an

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.130 
great cameras but the 610 had an
inherent<00:00:41.160> problem<00:00:41.489> where<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.149> was<00:00:42.510> basically

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
inherent problem where it was basically

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.500 
inherent problem where it was basically
shredding<00:00:44.129> parts<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.640> its<00:00:44.820> shutter<00:00:45.239> in

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
shredding parts of its shutter in

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.750 
shredding parts of its shutter in
operation<00:00:46.170> putting<00:00:46.800> particles<00:00:47.190> into<00:00:47.579> there

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
operation putting particles into there

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.580 
operation putting particles into there
and<00:00:47.910> causing<00:00:48.300> dust<00:00:48.600> bunnies<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.200> all<00:00:49.289> sorts

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
and causing dust bunnies and all sorts

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.200 
and causing dust bunnies and all sorts
of<00:00:49.680> nonsense<00:00:49.800> on<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.309> sensor<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.059> we're

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
of nonsense on the sensor so we're

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.810 
of nonsense on the sensor so we're
having<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.539> lot<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.780> problems<00:00:52.230> with<00:00:53.039> spots<00:00:53.460> and

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
having a lot of problems with spots and

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.970 
having a lot of problems with spots and
dust<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.360> pieces<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:54.930> particle<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.500> from<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
dust and pieces of particle it from the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.990 
dust and pieces of particle it from the
shutter<00:00:56.250> on<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.520> sensor<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:58.850> probably<00:00:59.850> not

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
shutter on the sensor so probably not

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.080 
shutter on the sensor so probably not
great<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:01.140> nikons<00:01:01.730> credit<00:01:02.730> or<00:01:02.850> anything

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
great on to nikons credit or anything

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.230 
great on to nikons credit or anything
why<00:01:03.510> they<00:01:04.140> didn't<00:01:04.820> address<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:06.060> problem

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
why they didn't address this problem

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.570 
why they didn't address this problem
better<00:01:06.630> really<00:01:07.380> if<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.560> have<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.740> 600<00:01:08.250> Nikon

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
better really if you have a 600 Nikon

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.210 
better really if you have a 600 Nikon
should<00:01:08.760> probably<00:01:09.000> give<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> d610<00:01:10.439> for<00:01:10.979> free

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
should probably give you a d610 for free

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.539 
should probably give you a d610 for free
because<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.420> an<00:01:12.510> inherent<00:01:12.900> problem<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.549> it

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
because it's an inherent problem and it

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.850 
because it's an inherent problem and it
really<00:01:15.000> wasn't<00:01:15.750> taken<00:01:16.259> care<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.500> very<00:01:16.619> well

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
really wasn't taken care of very well

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.240 
really wasn't taken care of very well
but<00:01:17.430> heads<00:01:17.670> now<00:01:17.970> we<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.869> Nikon<00:01:19.259> d610<00:01:19.799> and

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
but heads now we have the Nikon d610 and

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.620 
but heads now we have the Nikon d610 and
here<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.119> we've<00:01:21.960> got<00:01:23.060> some<00:01:24.060> updates

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
here it is and we've got some updates

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.320 
here it is and we've got some updates
obviously<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.590> shutter<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:25.979> one<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.369> them<00:01:26.490> as

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
obviously the shutter is one of them as

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.960 
obviously the shutter is one of them as
I<00:01:27.750> said<00:01:27.810> it's<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.200> minor<00:01:28.500> update<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.130> 6/10<00:01:29.549> over

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
I said it's a minor update to 6/10 over

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.210 
I said it's a minor update to 6/10 over
the<00:01:30.090> 600<00:01:30.600> but<00:01:31.049> there's<00:01:31.229> basically<00:01:31.710> four

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
the 600 but there's basically four

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.060 
the 600 but there's basically four
updates<00:01:32.970> for<00:01:33.570> reasons<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.530> might<00:01:34.710> want<00:01:34.770> to

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
updates for reasons you might want to

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.420 
updates for reasons you might want to
get<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.340> 610<00:01:35.930> over<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.259> 600<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:37.950> as<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.369> said

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
get the 610 over the 600 and as I said

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.149 
get the 610 over the 600 and as I said
honestly<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.540> think<00:01:39.659> Nikon<00:01:40.380> anybody<00:01:41.009> that's

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
honestly I think Nikon anybody that's

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.460 
honestly I think Nikon anybody that's
bought<00:01:41.369> six<00:01:41.759> hundred<00:01:42.090> pretty<00:01:42.869> much<00:01:43.020> almost<00:01:43.320> as

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
bought six hundred pretty much almost as

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.749 
bought six hundred pretty much almost as
Otis<00:01:43.649> 610<00:01:44.450> from<00:01:45.450> Nikon<00:01:46.520> probably<00:01:47.520> not<00:01:47.640> going

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
Otis 610 from Nikon probably not going

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.120 
Otis 610 from Nikon probably not going
to<00:01:47.850> happen<00:01:48.030> but<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.320> would<00:01:49.680> be<00:01:49.890> very

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
to happen but I would be very

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.950 
to happen but I would be very
disappointed<00:01:50.700> having<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.030> 600<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.659> knowing

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
disappointed having a 600 and knowing

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.569 
disappointed having a 600 and knowing
that<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.200> basically<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.829> shutter<00:01:53.159> problem

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
that this basically the shutter problem

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.340 
that this basically the shutter problem
is<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:53.850> much<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.240> an<00:01:54.360> issue<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.840> seeing<00:01:55.140> how

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
is this much of an issue and seeing how

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.350 
is this much of an issue and seeing how
they've<00:01:55.560> they've<00:01:55.920> dealt<00:01:56.159> with<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:56.460> here<00:01:56.759> so

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
they've they've dealt with this here so

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.929 
they've they've dealt with this here so
anyways<00:01:57.899> we've<00:01:58.170> got<00:01:58.380> four<00:01:59.070> reasons<00:01:59.430> obviously

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
anyways we've got four reasons obviously

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.719 
anyways we've got four reasons obviously
first<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.869> foremost<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:02.189> new<00:02:02.430> shutter

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
first and foremost is a new shutter

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.840 
first and foremost is a new shutter
mechanism<00:02:02.939> mechanism<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.890> that's<00:02:05.610> obviously

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
mechanism mechanism so that's obviously

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.330 
mechanism mechanism so that's obviously
very<00:02:06.299> important<00:02:06.930> since<00:02:07.170> we<00:02:07.649> had<00:02:07.740> such<00:02:07.979> issues

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
very important since we had such issues

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.790 
very important since we had such issues
with<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.729> d600<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.989> hopefully<00:02:10.649> this

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
with the d600 is that hopefully this

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.260 
with the d600 is that hopefully this
shutter<00:02:11.129> mechanism<00:02:11.310> has<00:02:11.760> resolved

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
shutter mechanism has resolved

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.470 
shutter mechanism has resolved
everything

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
everything

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.820 
everything
it's<00:02:13.599> no<00:02:13.780> longer<00:02:13.989> problem<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:14.620> you're<00:02:14.739> gonna

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
it's no longer problem so you're gonna

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.040 
it's no longer problem so you're gonna
want<00:02:15.099> the<00:02:15.220> camera<00:02:15.580> basically<00:02:16.420> for<00:02:16.900> that

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
want the camera basically for that

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.399 
want the camera basically for that
reason<00:02:17.500> alone<00:02:17.790> hence<00:02:18.790> why<00:02:19.000> I<00:02:19.030> also<00:02:19.239> say<00:02:19.629> you

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
reason alone hence why I also say you

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.110 
reason alone hence why I also say you
know<00:02:20.500> it's<00:02:20.650> something<00:02:20.920> would<00:02:21.790> have<00:02:21.879> been<00:02:21.970> nice

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
know it's something would have been nice

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.520 
know it's something would have been nice
if<00:02:22.269> Nikon<00:02:22.599> just<00:02:22.810> said<00:02:22.930> hey<00:02:23.019> you<00:02:23.080> want<00:02:23.379> to<00:02:23.409> do

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
if Nikon just said hey you want to do

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.670 
if Nikon just said hey you want to do
600<00:02:23.980> we<00:02:24.099> want<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.340> give<00:02:24.430> you<00:02:24.519> a<00:02:24.549> 6/10<00:02:25.680> number

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
600 we want to give you a 6/10 number

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.339 
600 we want to give you a 6/10 number
two<00:02:26.860> faster<00:02:27.730> frame<00:02:27.970> rate<00:02:28.030> of<00:02:28.239> six<00:02:28.599> frames<00:02:29.019> per

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
two faster frame rate of six frames per

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.460 
two faster frame rate of six frames per
second<00:02:29.860> so<00:02:29.980> we<00:02:30.400> had<00:02:30.790> five<00:02:31.000> point<00:02:31.269> five<00:02:31.420> on<00:02:31.750> the

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
second so we had five point five on the

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.309 
second so we had five point five on the
600<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.370> at<00:02:33.519> a<00:02:33.849> very<00:02:34.180> nominal<00:02:34.450> frame<00:02:35.110> rate<00:02:35.290> you

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
600 so at a very nominal frame rate you

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.570 
600 so at a very nominal frame rate you
almost<00:02:35.620> wonder<00:02:35.890> if<00:02:35.920> you<00:02:36.040> can<00:02:36.160> play<00:02:36.340> with<00:02:36.459> the

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
almost wonder if you can play with the

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.660 
almost wonder if you can play with the
numbers<00:02:36.879> to<00:02:37.060> get<00:02:37.150> half<00:02:37.360> a<00:02:37.480> frame<00:02:37.690> second<00:02:38.260> there

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
numbers to get half a frame second there

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.360 
numbers to get half a frame second there
anyways<00:02:39.670> it<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:40.239> on<00:02:40.599> paper<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.530> faster<00:02:42.160> frame

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
anyways it is on paper a faster frame

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.030 
anyways it is on paper a faster frame
rate<00:02:42.599> number<00:02:43.599> three<00:02:43.870> new<00:02:44.319> and<00:02:44.470> improved<00:02:44.769> auto

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
rate number three new and improved auto

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.740 
rate number three new and improved auto
white<00:02:45.340> balance<00:02:45.370> now<00:02:45.940> I<00:02:45.970> have<00:02:46.180> heard<00:02:46.390> from<00:02:46.510> some

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
white balance now I have heard from some

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.009 
white balance now I have heard from some
people<00:02:47.049> that<00:02:47.170> this<00:02:47.379> is<00:02:47.560> indeed<00:02:48.129> a<00:02:48.790> better<00:02:49.510> and

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
people that this is indeed a better and

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.660 
people that this is indeed a better and
improved<00:02:50.440> auto<00:02:50.739> white<00:02:51.040> balance<00:02:51.069> so<00:02:51.519> that's

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
improved auto white balance so that's

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.430 
improved auto white balance so that's
always<00:02:51.879> welcome<00:02:52.150> although<00:02:53.079> I<00:02:53.109> don't<00:02:53.230> think

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
always welcome although I don't think

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.789 
always welcome although I don't think
the<00:02:53.709> 600<00:02:54.220> was<00:02:54.340> terrible<00:02:54.910> per<00:02:55.120> se<00:02:55.329> anyways<00:02:55.799> but

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
the 600 was terrible per se anyways but

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.589 
the 600 was terrible per se anyways but
we'll<00:02:56.950> give<00:02:57.069> it<00:02:57.099> as<00:02:57.310> a<00:02:57.340> third<00:02:57.700> point<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.120> then

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
we'll give it as a third point and then

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.170 
we'll give it as a third point and then
the<00:02:58.720> fourth<00:02:59.019> point<00:02:59.260> is<00:02:59.440> we<00:02:59.620> have<00:02:59.739> this<00:02:59.890> new

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
the fourth point is we have this new

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.420 
the fourth point is we have this new
quiet<00:03:01.180> continuous<00:03:01.900> shooting<00:03:02.410> mode<00:03:02.620> so<00:03:03.310> this

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
quiet continuous shooting mode so this

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.809 
quiet continuous shooting mode so this
is<00:03:03.579> kind<00:03:03.760> of<00:03:03.790> interesting<00:03:03.989> and<00:03:05.489> myself<00:03:06.489> I

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
is kind of interesting and myself I

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.880 
is kind of interesting and myself I
don't<00:03:06.879> know<00:03:07.239> how<00:03:07.930> well<00:03:08.170> that's<00:03:08.349> going<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.620> the

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
don't know how well that's going to the

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.000 
don't know how well that's going to the
pan<00:03:09.129> out<00:03:09.370> it's<00:03:09.849> a<00:03:09.940> new<00:03:10.120> feature<00:03:10.500> it's<00:03:11.500> designed

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
pan out it's a new feature it's designed

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.250 
pan out it's a new feature it's designed
to<00:03:12.069> work<00:03:12.220> at<00:03:12.400> three<00:03:12.790> frames<00:03:13.150> per<00:03:13.450> second<00:03:13.870> so

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
to work at three frames per second so

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.869 
to work at three frames per second so
we'll<00:03:14.440> see<00:03:14.620> if<00:03:14.829> people<00:03:15.370> are<00:03:15.459> finding<00:03:15.700> that

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
we'll see if people are finding that

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.150 
we'll see if people are finding that
advantageous<00:03:16.750> we'll<00:03:17.379> see<00:03:17.590> if<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.799> actually

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
advantageous we'll see if it actually

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.650 
advantageous we'll see if it actually
ends<00:03:18.370> up<00:03:18.430> working<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.940> way<00:03:19.060> it's<00:03:19.209> supposed<00:03:19.239> to

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
ends up working the way it's supposed to

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.629 
ends up working the way it's supposed to
or<00:03:20.560> if<00:03:20.919> it's<00:03:21.040> just<00:03:21.130> one<00:03:21.310> of<00:03:21.370> those<00:03:21.459> features

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
or if it's just one of those features

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.640 
or if it's just one of those features
that<00:03:21.910> you<00:03:22.030> don't<00:03:22.150> ever<00:03:22.299> use<00:03:22.540> on<00:03:22.690> a<00:03:22.720> camera<00:03:22.989> so

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
that you don't ever use on a camera so

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.610 
that you don't ever use on a camera so
those<00:03:23.799> are<00:03:23.919> four<00:03:24.250> things<00:03:25.049> one<00:03:26.049> biggie

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
those are four things one biggie

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.860 
those are four things one biggie
and<00:03:26.769> that's<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.280> new<00:03:27.430> shutter<00:03:27.760> mechanism<00:03:28.000> the

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
and that's the new shutter mechanism the

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.089 
and that's the new shutter mechanism the
rest<00:03:29.169> of<00:03:29.410> them<00:03:29.819> minor<00:03:30.819> things<00:03:31.799> kind<00:03:32.799> of<00:03:32.919> just

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
rest of them minor things kind of just

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:34.740 
rest of them minor things kind of just
probably<00:03:33.340> thrown<00:03:33.730> in<00:03:33.880> there<00:03:34.060> that<00:03:34.209> you<00:03:34.630> know

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
probably thrown in there that you know

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.610 
probably thrown in there that you know
we're<00:03:34.900> always<00:03:35.019> worried<00:03:35.230> if<00:03:35.349> we're<00:03:35.470> going<00:03:35.560> to

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
we're always worried if we're going to

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.140 
we're always worried if we're going to
put<00:03:35.799> it<00:03:35.889> a<00:03:35.950> new<00:03:36.130> body<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.549> address<00:03:36.880> an<00:03:37.030> issue

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
put it a new body to address an issue

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.089 
put it a new body to address an issue
let's<00:03:37.540> put<00:03:37.750> as<00:03:37.870> many<00:03:38.230> little<00:03:38.590> tweaks<00:03:38.829> as<00:03:38.980> we

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
let's put as many little tweaks as we

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.069 
let's put as many little tweaks as we
can<00:03:39.280> in<00:03:39.430> there<00:03:39.579> but<00:03:39.970> that's<00:03:40.030> four<00:03:40.540> points<00:03:40.720> why

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
can in there but that's four points why

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.620 
can in there but that's four points why
