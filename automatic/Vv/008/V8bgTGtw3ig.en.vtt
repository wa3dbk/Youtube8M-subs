they<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.360> at<00:00:39.510> Walmart<00:00:40.070> and<00:00:41.070> they<00:00:41.190> would<00:00:41.399> work

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
they have at Walmart and they would work

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.459 
they have at Walmart and they would work
but<00:00:42.329> then<00:00:42.480> when<00:00:42.690> they<00:00:42.989> would<00:00:43.110> get<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.440> a

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
but then when they would get to a

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.549 
but then when they would get to a
certain<00:00:43.860> point<00:00:44.129> they<00:00:44.489> would<00:00:44.700> break<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:47.000> also

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
certain point they would break and also

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.869 
certain point they would break and also
when<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.590> get<00:00:49.829> out<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.100> bathtub<00:00:50.340> at<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
when I get out of the bathtub at the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.500 
when I get out of the bathtub at the
shower<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.390> do<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.870> dishes<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:53.059> have<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.180> be<00:00:54.300> very

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
shower I do the dishes I have to be very

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.990 
shower I do the dishes I have to be very
careful<00:00:54.899> because<00:00:55.050> my<00:00:55.379> nails<00:00:55.620> will<00:00:56.190> just<00:00:56.460> you

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
careful because my nails will just you

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.479 
careful because my nails will just you
know<00:00:57.120> what<00:00:57.270> peel<00:00:57.570> off<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:57.989> paper<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:59.190> they're

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
know what peel off like paper so they're

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.880 
know what peel off like paper so they're
very<00:00:59.879> thin<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.480> then<00:01:00.629> getting<00:01:01.260> acrylics

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
very thin and then getting acrylics

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.690 
very thin and then getting acrylics
probably<00:01:02.699> has<00:01:02.850> not<00:01:03.059> helped<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:05.010> went

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
probably has not helped that so I went

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.410 
probably has not helped that so I went
to<00:01:05.820> Sally's<00:01:06.680> Sally<00:01:07.680> beauty<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:09.060> saw<00:01:09.270> that

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
to Sally's Sally beauty and I saw that

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.280 
to Sally's Sally beauty and I saw that
they<00:01:09.600> had<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:13.939> nail<00:01:14.939> life<00:01:15.299> now<00:01:15.600> revitalizer

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
they had this nail life now revitalizer

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.380 
they had this nail life now revitalizer
and<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.400> believe<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.790> was<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:19.430> think<00:01:20.430> like<00:01:20.610> six<00:01:21.000> or

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
and I believe it was I think like six or

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.280 
and I believe it was I think like six or
seven<00:01:21.450> dollars<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.979> bought<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.479> I

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
seven dollars so I bought this and I

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.380 
seven dollars so I bought this and I
started<00:01:26.159> putting<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.700> my<00:01:26.790> nails<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.210> it

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
started putting this on my nails so it

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.420 
started putting this on my nails so it
says<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.840> put<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.170> every<00:01:28.530> day<00:01:28.710> for<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> week

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
says to put it on every day for a week

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.359 
says to put it on every day for a week
and<00:01:29.700> then<00:01:29.850> once<00:01:30.420> your<00:01:30.689> week<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.049> up<00:01:31.259> take<00:01:32.250> it

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
and then once your week is up take it

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.359 
and then once your week is up take it
all<00:01:32.490> off<00:01:32.520> with<00:01:32.970> remover<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:34.140> apply<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.100> I

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
some people this might not be long but I

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.020

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.179 
would say that my nails have definitely
gotten<00:01:54.030> longer<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.540> they<00:01:54.840> are<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.740> know<00:01:55.860> very

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.530 
then I I'll rub my fingers in it and

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.410 
then I'll massage it onto my cuticles
and<00:02:25.750> my<00:02:25.989> nails<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.819> that<00:02:27.819> helps<00:02:28.090> keep<00:02:28.269> them

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
and my nails and that helps keep them

and my nails and that helps keep them
stronger<00:02:28.780> too<00:02:29.049> so<00:02:30.150> someone<00:02:31.150> who<00:02:31.299> couldn't

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
stronger too so someone who couldn't

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.780 
stronger too so someone who couldn't
grow<00:02:32.440> their<00:02:32.650> nails<00:02:32.829> up<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.280> certain<00:02:33.489> point

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
grow their nails up to a certain point

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.240 
grow their nails up to a certain point
and<00:02:34.120> couldn't<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:35.739> know<00:02:35.799> get<00:02:35.980> out<00:02:36.069> of<00:02:36.159> the

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250

and couldn't you know get out of the
shower<00:02:36.430> without<00:02:36.730> ripping<00:02:37.269> their<00:02:37.390> nails<00:02:37.599> off<00:02:37.840> I

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
shower without ripping their nails off I

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.720 
shower without ripping their nails off I
would<00:02:38.079> say<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:38.700> this<00:02:39.700> has<00:02:41.730> definitely

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
would say that this has definitely

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.349 
would say that this has definitely
helped<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:44.549> if<00:02:45.549> you<00:02:45.760> are<00:02:45.879> trying<00:02:46.120> to<00:02:46.180> grow

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
helped and if you are trying to grow

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.970 
helped and if you are trying to grow
your<00:02:46.390> nails<00:02:46.660> so<00:02:46.959> I<00:02:47.290> would<00:02:47.769> recommend<00:02:49.980> clipping

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
your nails so I would recommend clipping

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.099 
your nails so I would recommend clipping
them<00:02:51.190> don't<00:02:51.910> tear<00:02:52.480> them<00:02:52.720> off<00:02:52.870> I<00:02:53.049> know

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
them don't tear them off I know

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.470 
them don't tear them off I know
sometimes<00:02:53.530> if<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:53.739> get<00:02:53.859> a<00:02:53.920> jagged<00:02:54.459> nail<00:02:55.030> you

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
sometimes if you get a jagged nail you

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.050 
sometimes if you get a jagged nail you
want<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:55.930> just<00:02:56.140> tear<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:56.769> off<00:02:56.890> but<00:02:57.280> if<00:02:57.849> you

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
want to just tear it off but if you

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.000 
want to just tear it off but if you
could<00:02:58.180> just<00:02:58.239> like<00:02:58.450> keep<00:02:58.659> a<00:02:58.810> nail<00:02:59.140> file<00:02:59.470> handy

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
could just like keep a nail file handy

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.360 
could just like keep a nail file handy
and<00:03:00.220> use<00:03:00.640> that<00:03:00.940> I<00:03:01.709> found<00:03:02.709> that<00:03:02.920> helps<00:03:03.220> a<00:03:03.310> lot

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
and use that I found that helps a lot

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.990 
and use that I found that helps a lot
too<00:03:03.609> because<00:03:03.760> your<00:03:04.690> net<00:03:04.870> it<00:03:05.019> makes<00:03:05.230> your<00:03:05.379> nails

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
too because your net it makes your nails

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.220 
too because your net it makes your nails
stronger<00:03:07.000> when<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.209> cut<00:03:07.420> them<00:03:07.480> with<00:03:07.629> a<00:03:07.690> nail

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
stronger when you cut them with a nail

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.199 
stronger when you cut them with a nail
clipper<00:03:08.260> then<00:03:08.799> just<00:03:09.129> when<00:03:09.519> you<00:03:09.609> tear<00:03:09.849> them<00:03:10.030> off

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
clipper then just when you tear them off

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.289 
clipper then just when you tear them off
because<00:03:10.420> it<00:03:10.690> makes<00:03:10.870> them<00:03:11.019> weak<00:03:11.430> so<00:03:12.430> if<00:03:12.819> you<00:03:13.090> are

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
because it makes them weak so if you are

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.300 
because it makes them weak so if you are
trying<00:03:13.599> to<00:03:13.720> grow<00:03:13.900> your<00:03:13.959> nails<00:03:14.230> though<00:03:14.500> these

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
trying to grow your nails though these

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.879 
trying to grow your nails though these
are<00:03:15.609> two<00:03:16.000> products<00:03:16.510> I<00:03:16.750> really<00:03:17.079> recommend<00:03:17.680> and
