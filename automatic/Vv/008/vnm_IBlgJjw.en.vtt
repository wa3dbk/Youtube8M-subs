00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
that lick so you kind of get the idea

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:54.710 
that lick so you kind of get the idea
right<00:03:46.200> okay<00:03:47.200> here<00:03:47.380> he<00:03:47.500> comes

all<00:03:55.720> right<00:03:55.840> that's<00:03:56.080> the<00:03:56.170> lick<00:03:57.750> here<00:03:58.750> it<00:03:58.810> is

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
all right that's the lick here it is

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.070 
all right that's the lick here it is
again

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.660 

now<00:04:05.080> I'm<00:04:05.140> going<00:04:05.290> to<00:04:05.380> kind<00:04:05.560> of<00:04:05.650> improvise<00:04:06.040> with

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
now I'm going to kind of improvise with

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:25.700 
now I'm going to kind of improvise with
it

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.770 

here<00:04:26.710> this<00:04:26.889> again

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:40.350 

I<00:04:30.910> kind<00:04:31.910> of<00:04:31.940> messed<00:04:32.090> it<00:04:32.240> up<00:04:32.500> do<00:04:33.500> it<00:04:33.590> again

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.320 

that's<00:04:41.360> good<00:04:42.760> okay<00:04:43.760> so<00:04:43.820> hopefully<00:04:44.060> you<00:04:44.270> get

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
that's good okay so hopefully you get

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.870 
that's good okay so hopefully you get
the<00:04:44.389> idea<00:04:44.900> that<00:04:45.230> once<00:04:45.860> you<00:04:45.980> learn<00:04:46.190> just<00:04:46.400> one

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
the idea that once you learn just one

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.740 
the idea that once you learn just one
lick<00:04:47.320> the<00:04:48.320> next<00:04:48.880> learn<00:04:49.880> another<00:04:50.300> lick<00:04:50.570> so

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
lick the next learn another lick so

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.000 
lick the next learn another lick so
let's<00:04:50.900> go<00:04:51.020> ahead<00:04:51.110> and<00:04:51.200> do<00:04:51.350> that<00:04:51.470> now<00:04:51.710> let<00:04:51.950> me

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
let's go ahead and do that now let me

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.750 
let's go ahead and do that now let me
give<00:04:52.130> you<00:04:52.190> another<00:04:52.250> one

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
give you another one

00:04:52.760 --> 00:05:01.810 
give you another one
and<00:04:53.120> it<00:04:53.210> goes<00:04:53.300> like<00:04:53.360> this<00:04:59.950> now<00:05:00.950> you<00:05:01.010> might<00:05:01.580> have

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
and it goes like this now you might have

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.000 
and it goes like this now you might have
recognized<00:05:02.450> that<00:05:02.810> right<00:05:03.200> you<00:05:03.770> might<00:05:03.890> have

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
recognized that right you might have

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.560 
recognized that right you might have
recognized<00:05:04.430> a<00:05:04.460> portion<00:05:04.940> of<00:05:05.000> that<00:05:05.060> well<00:05:05.330> all<00:05:05.540> I

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
recognized a portion of that well all I

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.390 
recognized a portion of that well all I
did<00:05:05.840> was<00:05:05.960> I<00:05:06.080> took<00:05:06.140> a<00:05:06.320> lick<00:05:06.590> that<00:05:06.770> I<00:05:06.860> just<00:05:07.130> showed

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
did was I took a lick that I just showed

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.670 
did was I took a lick that I just showed
you<00:05:07.430> I<00:05:07.910> added<00:05:08.900> a<00:05:08.930> little<00:05:09.020> bit<00:05:09.200> to<00:05:09.290> it<00:05:09.560> actually

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
you I added a little bit to it actually

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.070 
you I added a little bit to it actually
I<00:05:09.860> put<00:05:10.010> it<00:05:10.130> on<00:05:10.250> at<00:05:10.340> the<00:05:10.370> beginning<00:05:10.520> and<00:05:11.090> then<00:05:12.050> I

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
I put it on at the beginning and then I

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.230 
I put it on at the beginning and then I
kind<00:05:12.410> of<00:05:12.470> created<00:05:13.010> more<00:05:13.370> of<00:05:13.520> a<00:05:13.610> solo<00:05:13.880> and

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
kind of created more of a solo and

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.570 
kind of created more of a solo and
that's<00:05:14.419> the<00:05:14.690> process<00:05:15.020> you<00:05:15.410> just<00:05:15.440> you<00:05:16.280> start

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
that's the process you just you start

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.070 
that's the process you just you start
kind<00:05:16.760> of<00:05:16.850> fooling<00:05:17.240> around<00:05:17.480> with<00:05:17.630> the<00:05:17.750> scale

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
kind of fooling around with the scale

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.680 
kind of fooling around with the scale
you<00:05:18.530> figure<00:05:18.800> out<00:05:18.830> what<00:05:18.980> key<00:05:19.220> you're<00:05:19.430> in<00:05:19.690> you

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
you figure out what key you're in you

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.350 
you figure out what key you're in you
kind<00:05:21.590> of<00:05:21.680> take<00:05:22.130> one<00:05:22.490> lick<00:05:22.790> and<00:05:23.060> then<00:05:23.180> you<00:05:23.240> say

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
kind of take one lick and then you say

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.150 
kind of take one lick and then you say
okay<00:05:23.600> how<00:05:23.720> can<00:05:23.780> I<00:05:23.930> expand<00:05:24.410> that<00:05:24.440> or<00:05:24.800> can<00:05:24.919> I<00:05:24.950> add

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
okay how can I expand that or can I add

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.620 
okay how can I expand that or can I add
some<00:05:25.370> to<00:05:25.520> the<00:05:25.640> beginning<00:05:26.030> of<00:05:26.120> it<00:05:26.240> can<00:05:26.390> I<00:05:26.479> add

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
some to the beginning of it can I add

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.780 
some to the beginning of it can I add
something<00:05:26.660> to<00:05:27.169> the<00:05:27.260> end<00:05:27.290> of<00:05:27.620> it<00:05:27.740> can<00:05:27.950> I<00:05:28.100> instead

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
something to the end of it can I instead

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
of doing a full bin can I do a half it

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.500 
of doing a full bin can I do a half it
instead<00:05:31.370> of<00:05:31.460> doing<00:05:31.550> a<00:05:31.760> pull<00:05:31.970> off<00:05:32.120> can<00:05:32.270> I<00:05:32.330> do<00:05:32.389> a
