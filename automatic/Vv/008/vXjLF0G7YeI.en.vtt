00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:09.850 
was so far in this series that we were

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.660 
was so far in this series that we were
up<00:00:09.969> to<00:00:10.090> 26<00:00:10.630> videos<00:00:10.809> so<00:00:11.260> far<00:00:11.500> and<00:00:11.679> this<00:00:12.340> series

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:12.670 
up to 26 videos so far and this series

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.180 
up to 26 videos so far and this series
only<00:00:12.790> started<00:00:13.210> when<00:00:13.389> she<00:00:13.750> knew<00:00:14.139> gen<00:00:14.440> GTA<00:00:14.650> came

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
only started when she knew gen GTA came

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.400 
only started when she knew gen GTA came
out<00:00:15.400> so<00:00:15.670> it's<00:00:16.240> good<00:00:16.599> to<00:00:16.720> see<00:00:16.869> that<00:00:16.900> we<00:00:17.170> were

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
out so it's good to see that we were

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.099 
out so it's good to see that we were
still<00:00:17.760> getting<00:00:18.760> on<00:00:19.029> with<00:00:19.210> that<00:00:19.420> you<00:00:19.600> know<00:00:19.720> and

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:20.109 
still getting on with that you know and

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:21.330 
still getting on with that you know and
I<00:00:20.230> think<00:00:20.440> this<00:00:20.529> is<00:00:20.590> one<00:00:20.800> of<00:00:20.830> my<00:00:20.980> longest

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
I think this is one of my longest

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.670 
I think this is one of my longest
running<00:00:21.520> series<00:00:21.640> now<00:00:22.180> and<00:00:22.359> it<00:00:22.420> has<00:00:22.449> it<00:00:23.289> is<00:00:23.439> just

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
running series now and it has it is just

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.290 
running series now and it has it is just
a<00:00:23.770> catch-all<00:00:24.189> series<00:00:24.670> where<00:00:24.850> I<00:00:24.880> can<00:00:25.090> talk

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
really from events to random ramblings

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.869 
really from events to random ramblings
like<00:00:30.789> today<00:00:31.090> for<00:00:31.119> example<00:00:32.040> it's<00:00:33.040> it's<00:00:33.519> one<00:00:33.730> of

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879 
like today for example it's it's one of

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:36.299 
like today for example it's it's one of

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
the sort of staples of my channel a

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.400 
the sort of staples of my channel a
squishy<00:00:36.550> could<00:00:36.760> say<00:00:36.969> and<00:00:37.180> yeah<00:00:37.840> it's<00:00:38.200> good

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
squishy could say and yeah it's good

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.830 
squishy could say and yeah it's good
though<00:00:38.530> we're<00:00:38.980> still<00:00:39.329> going<00:00:40.329> on<00:00:40.510> with<00:00:40.690> that

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
though we're still going on with that

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.440 
though we're still going on with that
and<00:00:40.989> getting<00:00:41.190> getting<00:00:42.190> up<00:00:42.430> to<00:00:42.579> the<00:00:42.730> newly

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
and getting getting up to the newly

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.139 
and getting getting up to the newly
thirty<00:00:43.750> 30<00:00:44.739> videos<00:00:44.980> in<00:00:45.370> this<00:00:45.489> series<00:00:45.550> and<00:00:46.090> the

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
thirty 30 videos in this series and the

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:47.700 
thirty 30 videos in this series and the
next<00:00:46.300> one<00:00:46.480> will<00:00:46.600> probably<00:00:46.870> be<00:00:46.989> even<00:00:47.350> more

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
next one will probably be even more

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.139 
next one will probably be even more
interesting<00:00:48.070> because<00:00:48.460> it's<00:00:48.730> going<00:00:48.910> to<00:00:49.000> be

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
interesting because it's going to be

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.170 
interesting because it's going to be
covering<00:00:49.750> in<00:00:49.960> more<00:00:50.800> depth<00:00:51.070> the<00:00:51.399> new<00:00:51.579> cars<00:00:51.940> that

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
covering in more depth the new cars that

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.900 
covering in more depth the new cars that
we<00:00:52.300> see<00:00:52.539> in<00:00:52.719> a<00:00:52.870> few<00:00:53.079> days<00:00:53.200> time<00:00:53.559> but<00:00:54.280> that's<00:00:54.699> all

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
we see in a few days time but that's all

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.130 
we see in a few days time but that's all
in<00:00:55.000> the<00:00:55.090> future<00:00:55.420> and<00:00:55.480> that's<00:00:55.600> not<00:00:55.780> what<00:00:55.899> I<00:00:55.960> want

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
in the future and that's not what I want

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.720 
in the future and that's not what I want
to<00:00:56.199> talk<00:00:56.320> about<00:00:56.379> today<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:57.399> thing<00:00:57.579> that<00:00:57.670> I

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
to talk about today the thing that I

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.850 
to talk about today the thing that I
want<00:00:57.879> to<00:00:57.910> talk<00:00:58.059> about<00:00:58.090> in<00:00:58.360> this<00:00:58.449> video<00:00:58.600> is<00:00:58.989> that

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
want to talk about in this video is that

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.209 
want to talk about in this video is that
I<00:01:00.190> think<00:01:00.730> from<00:01:00.969> this<00:01:01.180> point<00:01:01.510> on<00:01:01.809> we<00:01:02.620> may<00:01:02.920> see<00:01:02.980> a

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
I think from this point on we may see a

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.510 
I think from this point on we may see a
bit<00:01:03.460> of<00:01:03.489> a<00:01:03.809> golden<00:01:04.809> period<00:01:05.140> for<00:01:05.740> my<00:01:05.950> channel<00:01:06.340> if

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
bit of a golden period for my channel if

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.880 
bit of a golden period for my channel if
you<00:01:06.850> like<00:01:07.030> I've<00:01:07.689> got<00:01:07.990> a<00:01:08.020> lot<00:01:08.350> of<00:01:08.380> videos

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:10.790 
think and and hopefully I can keep your

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.640 
think and and hopefully I can keep your
fingers<00:07:11.240> crossed<00:07:11.270> I<00:07:11.600> can<00:07:11.630> keep<00:07:11.960> posting<00:07:12.440> one

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.550 
fingers crossed I can keep posting one
video<00:07:12.919> every<00:07:12.980> day<00:07:13.340> it<00:07:13.850> should<00:07:14.270> be<00:07:14.300> doable<00:07:14.660> but

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:15.560
