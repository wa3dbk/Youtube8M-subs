00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.140
 first challenge the keeper will have to 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.200
 kill without zombies 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.140

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.649

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.520
 can weaken total agitation among them 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.100
 buy do the zombie to come and go 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.909
 even the ball is the goal and all this I 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.680
 I put that odeon that daniel buzz 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.470
 in all rushing home try a 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.280
 output 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:20.540
 We're not going to put it, but it's already going to be 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:24.800
 Hot, we got this pyramid in the middle. 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.790
 it's like the challenges of man 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.650
 as he will do in the challenges to 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.500
 according to the challenges a complete dream 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:37.370
 is in the mass 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.560
 it seems that the one from where it is 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.979
 but at least until 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:49.450
 the mother lets explain it here rafael 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:49.450
 There is a zombie who also pays the 50th 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:01.049
 orge gold needle 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:04.500
 ah ah ah ih ih ok but I had to think 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:09.590
 that this pyramid is here every time 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:13.739
 the volleyball was fulfilling a challenge will 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.780
 lowering a floor of this crowd comes 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.200
 as after the low all 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.129
 floors more 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:26.910
 special challenge is going to be something 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:26.910
 different is it seems that the village 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:35.480
 let's follow the dirty blood fight 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.480
 are getting pretty beef 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.320
 four o'clock 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.430
 I do not lose any 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.930
 and with the golden armor came back 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:57.340
 enchanted is that the enchanted master alone 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.970
 Back The Money Story 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.970
 sang sits down 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.860
 now in relation to the economy 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.160
 forget that you are ready it was a 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.160
 village 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:27.940
 Now you're going to kill me, that's it. 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.940
 to 1 for the guaratinguetÃ¡ trainer 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.330
 the dance 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.960
 there goes rolim 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:52.810
 and now the worst comes and goes without 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.810
 forget clear here 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:00.129
 our lady 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.129
 It's easy for him but the chapter 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.050
 the challenges does not influence the 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.050
 Last 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:16.450
 then I also plan to install moddy's 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.450
 Go there, the male for gold chuchu. 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:26.710
 They also say use only molds that bring there 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:29.500
 different battles all disadvantages 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:34.210
 I want it to be 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:36.240
 yes I will not have to give a spoiler that 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.690
 for you 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.930
 one of the special challenges and we always 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:46.500
 probably not first but has 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:49.370
 some monsters that fight among themselves and 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:55.460
 will get rid of these special challenges 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:59.310
 and not skeleton-like verses that laws do not 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:06.470
 if the mom is going to be right on time 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:12.659
 boring even stopped steel had the ball 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:16.139
 he will give up and as long as you 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:19.650

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:22.050

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:26.849
 cut and went when it was ending here 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:29.220
 I include zombies and I come back moments 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:35.430

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:41.940
