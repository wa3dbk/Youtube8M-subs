post of the Dutch East India Company in
Japan<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.640> think<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:39.060> lot<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.659> book<00:01:39.810> is

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
Japan and I think a lot of the book is

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.539 
Japan and I think a lot of the book is
about<00:01:40.079> perhaps<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.500> culture<00:01:40.950> clash<00:01:41.250> between

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
about perhaps the culture clash between

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.789 
about perhaps the culture clash between
East<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.240> West<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.079> on<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.290> trade<00:01:43.590> list

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
East and West this is on the trade list

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:44.990 
East and West this is on the trade list
by<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.009> way<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.189> actually<00:01:44.399> wasn't<00:01:44.820> able<00:01:44.880> to

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
by the way I actually wasn't able to

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.700 
by the way I actually wasn't able to
find<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.450> book<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.049> would<00:01:46.409> recommend

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
find a book that I would recommend

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.380 
find a book that I would recommend
written<00:01:47.220> by<00:01:47.340> an<00:01:47.460> author<00:01:47.520> from<00:01:47.790> Asia<00:01:48.090> there

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
written by an author from Asia there

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.700 
written by an author from Asia there
were<00:01:48.509> some<00:01:48.869> books<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.200> found<00:01:49.500> but<00:01:49.649> I

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
were some books that I found but I

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.440 
were some books that I found but I
didn't<00:01:50.070> enjoy<00:01:50.220> them<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.700> much<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.180> figured

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
didn't enjoy them that much so I figured

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.240 
didn't enjoy them that much so I figured
I<00:01:51.570> would<00:01:51.600> go<00:01:51.930> for<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.560> read<00:01:52.710> list<00:01:52.920> for<00:01:53.130> this

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
I would go for the to read list for this

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.999 
I would go for the to read list for this
one<00:01:53.430> then<00:01:53.759> we<00:01:53.850> have<00:01:53.880> 1q84<00:01:54.390> by<00:01:54.990> Haruki<00:01:55.470> Murakami

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
one then we have 1q84 by Haruki Murakami

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.530 
one then we have 1q84 by Haruki Murakami
really<00:01:56.520> really<00:01:56.729> well-known<00:01:57.030> author<00:01:57.240> and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
really really well-known author and

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.630 
really really well-known author and
translator<00:01:57.719> from<00:01:58.320> Japan<00:01:58.770> actually<00:01:59.369> has<00:01:59.460> three

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
translator from Japan actually has three

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.100 
translator from Japan actually has three
parts<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.240> just<00:02:00.420> part<00:02:00.750> one<00:02:00.840> is

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
parts and this is just part one is

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.510 
parts and this is just part one is
because<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.409> book<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:01.860> massive<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.280> they

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
because the book is so massive that they

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.130 
because the book is so massive that they
split<00:02:02.759> up<00:02:02.939> in<00:02:03.060> three<00:02:03.210> parts<00:02:03.390> for<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:03.780> edition

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
split up in three parts for this edition

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.450 
split up in three parts for this edition
and<00:02:04.350> if<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.680> like<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.040> I'm<00:02:05.250> definitely

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
and if I like this I'm definitely

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.119 
and if I like this I'm definitely
planning<00:02:05.880> on<00:02:06.299> diving<00:02:06.719> into<00:02:07.170> more<00:02:07.380> Haruki

Murakami<00:02:08.250> books<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.209> then<00:02:09.330> maybe<00:02:09.479> book<00:02:09.660> those
