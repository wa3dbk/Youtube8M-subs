it's a personal choice for everyone the
thing<00:01:45.600> when<00:01:45.990> you're<00:01:46.110> starting<00:01:46.380> out<00:01:46.560> young<00:01:46.920> you

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
thing when you're starting out young you

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.310 
thing when you're starting out young you
you<00:01:47.399> want<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.700> develop<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.210> good<00:01:48.390> base<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:49.229> want

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
you want to develop a good base you want

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.109 
you want to develop a good base you want
to<00:01:49.439> develop<00:01:49.649> nice<00:01:50.009> strong<00:01:50.399> healthy<00:01:50.790> muscles

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
to develop nice strong healthy muscles

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.819 
to develop nice strong healthy muscles
before<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.600> kind<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.869> move<00:01:51.990> Indian<00:01:52.380> into<00:01:52.710> any

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
before you kind of move Indian into any

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.639 
before you kind of move Indian into any
of<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.100> because<00:01:53.280> along<00:01:54.270> with<00:01:54.479> steroid<00:01:55.409> use

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
of that because along with steroid use

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.609 
of that because along with steroid use
also<00:01:55.920> comes<00:01:56.490> low<00:01:57.299> testosterone<00:01:57.689> levels<00:01:58.049> when

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
also comes low testosterone levels when

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.639 
also comes low testosterone levels when
you<00:01:58.710> come<00:01:58.890> off<00:01:59.930> atrophy<00:02:00.930> from<00:02:01.500> low

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
you come off atrophy from low

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.160 
you come off atrophy from low
testosterone<00:02:02.040> levels<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:03.030> there's<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.020> whole

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
testosterone levels and there's a whole

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.170 
testosterone levels and there's a whole
gamut<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.560> problems<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.009> could<00:02:05.159> occur<00:02:05.399> while

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
gamut of problems that could occur while

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.839 
gamut of problems that could occur while
you're<00:02:06.360> on<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.659> cycle<00:02:07.310> but<00:02:08.310> staying<00:02:08.640> natural

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
you're on the cycle but staying natural

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.249 
you're on the cycle but staying natural
while<00:02:09.239> you're<00:02:09.390> young<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.720> building<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.080> good

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
while you're young and building a good

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.520 
while you're young and building a good
base<00:02:10.530> is

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
base is

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.690 
base is
something<00:02:11.890> that's<00:02:12.040> very<00:02:12.160> important<00:02:12.610> because

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
something that's very important because

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.090 
something that's very important because
if<00:02:12.880> you<00:02:13.000> do<00:02:13.120> decide<00:02:13.270> to<00:02:13.420> go<00:02:13.660> that<00:02:13.840> route<00:02:14.170> it's

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
if you do decide to go that route it's

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.559 
if you do decide to go that route it's
going<00:02:15.370> to<00:02:15.430> just<00:02:15.670> enhance<00:02:15.880> what<00:02:16.450> you've

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
going to just enhance what you've

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.180 
going to just enhance what you've
already<00:02:16.720> built<00:02:17.110> but<00:02:17.350> if<00:02:17.470> you<00:02:17.590> start<00:02:17.950> using

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
already built but if you start using

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.840 
already built but if you start using
them<00:02:18.520> without<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.030> good<00:02:19.270> base<00:02:19.590> you're<00:02:20.590> going<00:02:20.620> to

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
them without a good base you're going to

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.490 
them without a good base you're going to
come<00:02:21.850> across<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.180> lot<00:02:22.510> of<00:02:22.660> problems<00:02:23.050> kind<00:02:23.410> of

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
come across a lot of problems kind of

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.710 
come across a lot of problems kind of
unhealthy<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.610> start<00:02:24.880> and<00:02:25.090> most<00:02:25.270> muscle

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
unhealthy to start and most muscle

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.750 
unhealthy to start and most muscle
tissue<00:02:26.380> doesn't<00:02:26.709> really<00:02:27.130> mature<00:02:27.400> until<00:02:27.670> your

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
tissue doesn't really mature until your

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
late 20s early 30s anyway a lot of

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.380 
late 20s early 30s anyway a lot of
people<00:02:29.980> jump<00:02:30.400> into<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.700> steroid<00:02:31.060> use<00:02:31.209> too

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
people jump into the steroid use too

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.449 
people jump into the steroid use too
early<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:31.959> they<00:02:32.470> knock<00:02:32.709> out<00:02:32.920> what<00:02:33.160> they<00:02:33.280> could

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
early and they knock out what they could

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.000 
early and they knock out what they could
have<00:02:33.489> potentially<00:02:34.150> done<00:02:34.360> naturally<00:02:34.600> I<00:02:35.110> mean

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
have potentially done naturally I mean

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.650 
have potentially done naturally I mean
it's<00:02:36.160> it's<00:02:36.370> all<00:02:36.550> natural<00:02:36.970> it's<00:02:37.120> a<00:02:37.150> lot<00:02:37.330> of<00:02:37.420> diet

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
it's it's all natural it's a lot of diet

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.390 
it's it's all natural it's a lot of diet
and<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.900> lot<00:02:38.020> of<00:02:38.110> hard<00:02:38.290> work<00:02:38.350> but<00:02:38.739> it's<00:02:38.890> fun<00:02:39.160> it's
