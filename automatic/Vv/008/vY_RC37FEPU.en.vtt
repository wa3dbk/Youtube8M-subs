going<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.860> probably<00:01:47.159> be<00:01:47.310> tempted<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.610> put<00:01:47.759> this

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
going to probably be tempted to put this

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.340 
going to probably be tempted to put this
on<00:01:48.000> for<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.180> couple<00:01:48.240> days<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.540> try<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.899> out<00:01:48.990> so

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350

see on the chrono itself you have the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.990 
see on the chrono itself you have the
two<00:02:24.989> that<00:02:25.739> you<00:02:25.800> have<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.040> seconds<00:02:26.489> for<00:02:26.879> the

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
two that you have the seconds for the

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
for the normal timing you have a large

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.000 
for the normal timing you have a large
second<00:02:28.800> hand<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.280> then<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.690> minute<00:02:31.349> but<00:02:31.830> what's

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
second hand and then a minute but what's

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.080 
second hand and then a minute but what's
really<00:02:32.160> neat<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.400> on<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.700> right<00:02:32.849> hand<00:02:33.000> side

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
really neat is on the right hand side

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.330 
really neat is on the right hand side
there's<00:02:33.450> actually<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:33.720> 24<00:02:34.170> hour<00:02:34.290> timer<00:02:34.620> so

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
there's actually a 24 hour timer so

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.770 
there's actually a 24 hour timer so
that's<00:02:35.640> really<00:02:35.819> helpful<00:02:36.090> especially<00:02:36.299> if<00:02:36.720> you

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
that's really helpful especially if you

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.140 
that's really helpful especially if you
don't<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.200> like<00:02:37.769> myself<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.610> don't<00:02:38.819> really

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
don't and like myself I don't really

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.580 
don't and like myself I don't really
know<00:02:39.330> 24<00:02:39.720> hour<00:02:39.870> timing<00:02:40.140> right<00:02:40.230> off<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.440> top<00:02:40.530> of

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
know 24 hour timing right off the top of

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.199 
know 24 hour timing right off the top of
my<00:02:40.709> head<00:02:40.769> so<00:02:41.190> this<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:41.819> a<00:02:41.849> good<00:02:42.000> quick

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
my head so this is a good quick

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.140 
my head so this is a good quick
reference<00:02:42.480> for<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:42.959> also<00:02:43.260> has<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:44.150> date

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
reference for it also has a date

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.080 
reference for it also has a date
function<00:02:45.180> so<00:02:46.140> what's<00:02:46.290> powering<00:02:46.650> this<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.190> my

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
function so what's powering this is my

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.449 
function so what's powering this is my
Oda<00:02:48.590> OS<00:02:49.590> 20<00:02:50.390> quartz<00:02:51.390> movement<00:02:51.810> so<00:02:52.459> good

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
Oda OS 20 quartz movement so good

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.120 
Oda OS 20 quartz movement so good
Japanese<00:02:54.000> movement<00:02:54.420> will<00:02:54.540> work<00:02:54.660> perfectly<00:02:55.130> on

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
Japanese movement will work perfectly on

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.120 
Japanese movement will work perfectly on
the<00:02:56.370> crown<00:02:56.940> here<00:02:57.209> it's<00:02:57.450> got<00:02:57.599> chron<00:02:58.130> protector

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
the crown here it's got chron protector

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.430 
the crown here it's got chron protector
bars<00:02:59.340> which<00:02:59.730> is<00:02:59.880> also<00:03:00.060> very<00:03:00.630> nice<00:03:00.900> gives<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.349> a

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
bars which is also very nice gives it a

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.530 
bars which is also very nice gives it a
nice<00:03:01.560> big<00:03:01.829> sturdy<00:03:02.099> feel<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:03.030> little<00:03:03.390> bit

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
nice big sturdy feel a little bit

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.180 
nice big sturdy feel a little bit
thinner<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:03.930> I<00:03:03.959> thought<00:03:04.140> it<00:03:04.230> would<00:03:04.319> be<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.709> lot

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
thinner that I thought it would be a lot

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.500 
thinner that I thought it would be a lot
of<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.340> pictures<00:03:05.489> i<00:03:05.700> saw<00:03:05.879> in<00:03:06.000> line<00:03:06.180> i<00:03:06.209> thought

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
of the pictures i saw in line i thought

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.850 
of the pictures i saw in line i thought
i<00:03:06.540> was<00:03:06.629> going<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.810> be<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.900> big<00:03:07.140> thick<00:03:07.379> wash<00:03:07.590> but

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
i was going to be a big thick wash but

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.720 
i was going to be a big thick wash but
it's<00:03:07.980> actually<00:03:08.069> quite<00:03:08.370> thin<00:03:10.069> this<00:03:11.069> this<00:03:11.430> band

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
it's actually quite thin this this band

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.970 
it's actually quite thin this this band
i<00:03:11.849> like<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.060> lot<00:03:12.299> it's<00:03:12.690> um<00:03:12.989> it's<00:03:13.530> actually<00:03:13.829> got

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
i like a lot it's um it's actually got

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.410 
i like a lot it's um it's actually got
these<00:03:14.129> little<00:03:14.280> kind<00:03:14.579> of<00:03:14.730> like<00:03:14.819> they<00:03:15.269> look<00:03:15.360> like

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
these little kind of like they look like

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.020 
these little kind of like they look like
tire<00:03:15.720> marks<00:03:16.049> but<00:03:16.310> well<00:03:17.310> i<00:03:17.340> think<00:03:17.700> they<00:03:17.910> give

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
tire marks but well i think they give

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.400 
tire marks but well i think they give
you<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.120> little<00:03:18.239> bit<00:03:18.420> of<00:03:18.480> traction<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:19.140> they

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
you a little bit of traction and they

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
you a little bit of traction and they
also<00:03:19.560> give<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:19.860> a<00:03:19.890> little<00:03:20.099> bit<00:03:20.190> of

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
also give you a little bit of

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.970 
also give you a little bit of
breathability<00:03:21.150> as<00:03:21.450> well<00:03:21.660> so<00:03:22.319> screw<00:03:22.620> down<00:03:22.709> case

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
breathability as well so screw down case

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.180 
breathability as well so screw down case
on<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.280> back<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:24.530> then<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.620> buckle<00:03:25.920> on<00:03:26.040> this

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
on the back and then the buckle on this

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.400 
on the back and then the buckle on this
guy<00:03:26.400> is<00:03:26.639> a<00:03:26.700> little<00:03:27.299> bit<00:03:27.420> smaller<00:03:27.690> so<00:03:28.200> really

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
guy is a little bit smaller so really

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.680 
guy is a little bit smaller so really
bold<00:03:31.410> watch<00:03:31.829> it's<00:03:32.280> uh<00:03:32.459> it<00:03:32.849> looks<00:03:32.910> simple<00:03:33.389> from
