00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.270
 the Golden Lord trilogy comes to an end 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.070
 with the third installment for pc and a 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.620
 generation of consoles ending their 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.970
 cycle will have got mercury without creating 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.900
 a good memory in the historical 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.900
 castlevania franchise 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.430
 at 82 he starts where he finished the 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.040
 first game with a dracula in a 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.140
 city â€‹â€‹of the weak and hidden present will be 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.050
 who goes in his search to ally 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.760
 before a common enemy satan this villain 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.680
 is preparing his return since 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.720
 Dracula had been presumed dead by 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.700
 that we must recover our powers and 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.010
 hunt down the satan acolytes for the 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.750
 different districts of the city play 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.490
 mirror of fate the second part of the 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.290
 trilogy is highly recommended for 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.030
 understand certain elements and characters 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.720
 although at the beginning we will be 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.720
 summary of what happened 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.039
 not everything develops in the present 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.049
 to begin with we start playing a 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:22.210
 spectacular level that belongs to the day 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.369
 in which Dracula was defeated and makes 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.929
 appearance to the place the mystery of what 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.939
 happens that day will be revealed to the 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:29.649
 end of the game plus the title is 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.390
 develops half between the city of 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.770
 present and the old castle of 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.780
 dracula so we have two 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.909
 atmosphere is very differentiated between 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.439
 those who can travel at the beginning 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.909
 game is linear and it is guiding us but 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.520
 later on we can move freely 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.229
 and explore all areas of both the 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.090
 city like from the castle to our 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.459
 craving mainly to get 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.380
 all the improvements and objects what is 

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:53.939
 missing in order to move better is a 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.939
 complete map of the scenarios 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.260
 christina had all the elements 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.840
 necessary to conclude the trilogy of 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.670
 an epic form , but it has not been like the 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.560
 characters are very untapped 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.450
 mainly the dracula itself that does not 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.460
 It gives a feeling of being powerful in no 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.410
 moment also the story is wrong 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.480
 Spinning from one target to another 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.400
 sometimes meaningless there is no coherence 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.200
 plot and many aspects that so 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.390
 diffuse as the existence of the castle 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.190
 of dracula I do not play and to finish the 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.900
 final does not imply the promised conclusion 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.380
 and it is difficult to satisfy the 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.380
 players 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.930
 in terms of playability the fighting 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.220
 they are the most solid aspect of the game it 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.870
 has perfected what seen in the first 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.459
 title and the way of 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.709
 fight as well as most of the 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.299
 combos on this occasion is the sword of 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.040
 empty the one responsible for spending the 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.840
 Vacuum energy you can recover 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.269
 life and the clutches of chaos with which 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.950
 we spend the powerful energy of chaos the 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.840
 whip of blood will act as the 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.700
 cross combat again the fighting 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.409
 are demanding and evolve during the 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.420
 game being very complete besides 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.040
 as we fight we win the experience 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.540
 to improve skills and get 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.310
 new and the more we use the 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.019
 different combos we can fill the 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.190
 master bar of each weapon for 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.190
 make them more powerful 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.910
 the objects are also important 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.710
 side in combat as well as in 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.360
 exploration can become 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.430
 fog to cross bars and throw 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.530
 projectiles or create clouds of bats 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.970
 to distract enemies in any case 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.440
 outside the fighting the rest of 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.300
 situations do not stand out and 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.580
 platforms make us die sometimes 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.230
 for being poorly designed especially 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.210
 alarming are the new phases of 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.430
 stealth more numerous at the beginning of 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.680
 game do not bring anything interesting to the 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.210
 development are a mere formality and are the 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.680
 antithesis of what a 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.420
 castlevania even make us 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.780
 transform us into a rat so as not to be 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.780
 seen 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.110
 dubbing and music follow the 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.700
 height of the first 2 to 2 but not 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.040
 we can say the same of the section 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.930
 technically graphically some elements and 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.240
 textures are very careless about 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.290
 everything in the areas of the present xbox 360 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.880
 and playstation3 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.320
 have already come to an end but it seems that 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.930
 not even have fully exploited 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.820
 there are tedious load times even is 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.560
 easy to suffer some bug but it is in the 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.270
 design where the disappointment comes next 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.310
 of two outstanding titles in this 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.960
 aspect the world of the castle will be the 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.670
 Unique that looks beautiful and impressive 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.500
 but artistically the city is 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.150
 monotonous and insipid ending 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.460
 corroborate that a setting of 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.350
 future does not house with a castlevania at 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.910
 less a free camera has been implanted 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.910
 to better observe the scenarios 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.270
 in the dot net kingdom we have been 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.550
 cool as dracula with the new 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.960
 castlevania lords of shadow ' 2 las 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.210
 promises without ambition with this trilogy 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.310
 have resulted in disappointment with a title 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.960
 nothing stands out not only in the 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.669
 fight the castle areas and 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.680
 some moments with final bosses we 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.180
 have kept playing it is true that 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.770
 some secondary objectives like the 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.569
 inclusion of a series of challenges 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.430
 special matches and get all 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:55.229
 the game objects are interesting and 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.180
 can extend the 15 hours duration 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.610
 base but may not draw attention 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.289
 if the rest of the game fails starting 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.880
 of the first title mercurysteam had 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.470
 margin to improve while maintaining 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.270
 premises that made it good but the 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.430
 Spanish study has risked mixing 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.530
 different elements and the result has 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.180
 it was even worse if from us 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.009
 it depends if the sun rises and this 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.600
 prince of darkness is hidden 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:17.870
 forever 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.800
 in anima 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.800
