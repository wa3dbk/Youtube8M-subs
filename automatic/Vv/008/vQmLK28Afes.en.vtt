hello<00:00:02.100> there<00:00:02.280> my<00:00:02.460> name<00:00:02.610> is<00:00:02.730> Thomas<00:00:03.030> Chapman

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
hello there my name is Thomas Chapman

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.530 
hello there my name is Thomas Chapman
and<00:00:03.570> we<00:00:03.840> are<00:00:04.020> going<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.319> run<00:00:04.529> through<00:00:04.770> a

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
and we are going to run through a

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.410 
and we are going to run through a
tutorial<00:00:06.540> for<00:00:07.109> baking<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.919> Oh<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.400> our<00:00:08.849> vertices

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
tutorial for baking a Oh to our vertices

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.410 
tutorial for baking a Oh to our vertices
here<00:00:10.519> we're<00:00:11.519> gonna<00:00:11.639> do<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:12.000> we're<00:00:12.300> gonna

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
here we're gonna do that we're gonna

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.150 
here we're gonna do that we're gonna
throw<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.719> in<00:00:12.750> unity<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.410> then<00:00:13.950> we're<00:00:14.070> gonna

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
throw it in unity and then we're gonna

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.700 
throw it in unity and then we're gonna
build<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.730> shader<00:00:14.940> in<00:00:15.120> shader<00:00:15.299> forge<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.900> make

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
build the shader in shader forge to make

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
build the shader in shader forge to make
the<00:00:17.930> vertex<00:00:18.930> color<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.439> diffuse<00:00:20.430> texture

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
the vertex color and diffuse texture

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.480 
the vertex color and diffuse texture
work<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:21.150> unity<00:00:21.420> using<00:00:21.960> shader<00:00:22.170> Forge<00:00:22.430> so<00:00:23.430> you

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
work in unity using shader Forge so you

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.060 
work in unity using shader Forge so you
have<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.180> get<00:00:24.300> up<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:24.600> stage<00:00:24.859> get<00:00:25.859> your

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
have to get up to this stage get your

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.700 
have to get up to this stage get your
object<00:00:26.640> happy<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.090> level<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.420> want<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.779> be

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
object happy to a level you want it be

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.259 
object happy to a level you want it be
happy<00:00:28.949> with<00:00:28.980> diffuse<00:00:29.490> apply<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:29.939> with

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
happy with diffuse apply it with

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.690 
happy with diffuse apply it with
whatever<00:00:31.140> you'd<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:31.579> really<00:00:32.579> really

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
whatever you'd like really really

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.430 
whatever you'd like really really
doesn't<00:00:33.059> matter<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.450> baking<00:00:34.020> process<00:00:34.140> is

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
doesn't matter the baking process is

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.590 
doesn't matter the baking process is
unaffected<00:00:34.770> by<00:00:34.980> what<00:00:35.100> you've<00:00:35.370> got<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.760> so

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
unaffected by what you've got on it so

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.630 
unaffected by what you've got on it so
you've<00:00:37.380> got<00:00:37.530> your<00:00:37.590> mesh<00:00:37.739> happy<00:00:38.070> with<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.340> it's

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
you've got your mesh happy with it it's

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.760 
you've got your mesh happy with it it's
been<00:00:38.879> cleaned<00:00:39.149> up<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.420> everything<00:00:39.510> now<00:00:40.320> what

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
been cleaned up and everything now what

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.350 
been cleaned up and everything now what
we<00:00:40.920> first<00:00:41.250> going<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.460> do<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.700> change<00:00:41.879> our<00:00:42.149> menu

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
we first going to do is change our menu

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.510 
we first going to do is change our menu
set<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.840> rendering<00:00:43.469> lighting<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.370> shading

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
set to rendering lighting and shading

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.670 
set to rendering lighting and shading
and<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.480> where<00:00:45.629> most<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.289> your<00:00:46.469> baking

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
and this is where most of your baking

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.610 
and this is where most of your baking
system<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:48.180> what<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.840> can<00:00:48.989> either<00:00:49.140> do<00:00:49.410> is

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
system is so what you can either do is

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.470 
system is so what you can either do is
check<00:00:49.829> your<00:00:49.860> baked<00:00:50.070> or<00:00:50.190> vertex<00:00:50.520> baked<00:00:50.760> but

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
check your baked or vertex baked but

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.750 
check your baked or vertex baked but
because<00:00:51.809> we<00:00:52.320> know<00:00:52.649> what<00:00:53.039> we<00:00:53.160> want<00:00:53.340> we're<00:00:53.579> only

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
because we know what we want we're only

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.549 
because we know what we want we're only
gonna<00:00:53.940> do<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.120> one<00:00:54.360> object<00:00:54.510> we<00:00:54.870> can<00:00:55.050> just<00:00:55.230> go

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
gonna do this one object we can just go

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.529 
gonna do this one object we can just go

do it this way a faster way of doing it

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.939 
do it this way a faster way of doing it
is<00:01:03.629> doing<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:04.019> through<00:01:04.260> just<00:01:04.470> your<00:01:04.650> polygon

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
is doing it through just your polygon

menu in car now we're going to pull off
this<00:01:07.229> panel<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.710> we're<00:01:07.950> gonna<00:01:08.040> use<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.780> now

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
this panel so we're gonna use it now

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.539 
this panel so we're gonna use it now
we'll<00:01:11.369> get<00:01:11.460> rid<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.670> these<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:13.100> in<00:01:14.100> our<00:01:14.250> column

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
we'll get rid of these and in our column

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.820 
we'll get rid of these and in our column
menu<00:01:14.670> we<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:15.659> batch<00:01:16.170> bag<00:01:16.409> mental<00:01:16.740> ray

to the vertices camera keep his
perspective<00:01:30.810> use<00:01:31.020> bakes<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.439> oh<00:01:31.470> right

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
perspective use bakes that oh right

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.740 
perspective use bakes that oh right
that's<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.040> going<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.310> turn<00:01:32.520> off<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:33.509> down

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
that's just going to turn off this down

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.210 
that's just going to turn off this down
here<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.990> might<00:01:34.170> research<00:01:34.530> setting<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:34.979> can

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
here I might research setting so you can

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.499 
here I might research setting so you can
see<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.820> what<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.060> would<00:01:36.119> be<00:01:36.210> like<00:01:36.240> for

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
see this is what it would be like for

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.429 
see this is what it would be like for
you<00:01:36.650> we<00:01:37.650> need<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.979> do<00:01:38.070> vertices<00:01:38.520> there<00:01:38.820> yeah<00:01:39.439> we

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
you we need to do vertices there yeah we

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.800 
you we need to do vertices there yeah we
don't<00:01:40.590> want<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.890> make<00:01:41.009> shadows<00:01:41.630> we're<00:01:42.630> going

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
don't want to make shadows we're going

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.719 
don't want to make shadows we're going
to<00:01:42.930> go<00:01:43.079> basic<00:01:43.560> override<00:01:43.979> we're<00:01:44.310> gonna<00:01:44.460> change

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
to go basic override we're gonna change

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.749 
to go basic override we're gonna change
our<00:01:44.939> color<00:01:45.149> mode<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.570> occlusion<00:01:46.759> occlusion

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
our color mode to occlusion occlusion

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.139 
our color mode to occlusion occlusion
Ray's<00:01:47.939> if<00:01:48.869> your<00:01:49.490> baked<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.670> coming<00:01:50.970> out<00:01:51.060> and

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
Ray's if your baked is coming out and

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.969 
Ray's if your baked is coming out and
it's<00:01:51.270> very<00:01:51.299> grainy<00:01:51.750> turn<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.380> up<00:01:52.560> only<00:01:52.770> go

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
it's very grainy turn this up only go

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.319 
it's very grainy turn this up only go
with<00:01:53.070> 128<00:01:53.610> because<00:01:53.880> I've<00:01:54.030> done<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.210> before

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
with 128 because I've done this before

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.130 
with 128 because I've done this before
and<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.840> know<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.200> nice<00:01:56.030> into<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.810> then

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
and I know it's nice into that and then

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.389 
and I know it's nice into that and then
we're<00:01:58.229> gonna<00:01:58.320> come<00:01:58.560> down<00:01:58.590> here<00:01:59.009> we're<00:01:59.280> gonna

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
we're gonna come down here we're gonna

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.760 
we're gonna come down here we're gonna
keep<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.700> on<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.850> color<00:02:00.140> you<00:02:01.140> want<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.380> make

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
keep it on the color you want to make

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.069 
keep it on the color you want to make
sure<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:03.030> on<00:02:03.090> overwrite<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:03.990> then

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
sure that it is on overwrite and then

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.499 
sure that it is on overwrite and then
we're<00:02:04.200> going<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.409> go<00:02:04.619> convert<00:02:05.579> there<00:02:06.299> we<00:02:06.390> go

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
we're going to go convert there we go

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.440 
we're going to go convert there we go
perfect<00:02:06.890> now<00:02:07.890> with<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:08.789> little<00:02:08.940> guy<00:02:09.179> here

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
perfect now with this little guy here

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.750 
perfect now with this little guy here
you<00:02:09.569> can<00:02:09.720> clearly<00:02:10.140> see<00:02:10.259> their<00:02:10.649> arrows<00:02:11.520> baked

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
you can clearly see their arrows baked

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.580 
you can clearly see their arrows baked
in<00:02:11.940> looks<00:02:12.450> good

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
in looks good

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.850 
in looks good
now<00:02:13.830> if<00:02:14.640> you're<00:02:15.060> freaking<00:02:15.420> out<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.720> you're<00:02:16.500> in

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
now if you're freaking out and you're in

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.080 
now if you're freaking out and you're in
your<00:02:16.890> hypershade<00:02:17.459> you've<00:02:17.700> got<00:02:17.849> it<00:02:17.940> selected

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
your hypershade you've got it selected

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.680 
your hypershade you've got it selected
and<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:19.200> assign<00:02:19.950> material<00:02:20.520> it<00:02:20.940> doesn't<00:02:21.480> work

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
and you assign material it doesn't work

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.440 
and you assign material it doesn't work
that<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:22.489> think<00:02:23.489> you<00:02:23.670> sit<00:02:23.940> don't<00:02:24.060> freak<00:02:24.330> out

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
that I think you sit don't freak out

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.930 
that I think you sit don't freak out
that's<00:02:25.230> just<00:02:25.349> a<00:02:25.620> system<00:02:25.950> in<00:02:26.220> here<00:02:26.489> you<00:02:26.819> know

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
that's just a system in here you know

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.370 
that's just a system in here you know
call<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.180> menu<00:02:27.510> we'll<00:02:27.690> come<00:02:27.870> back<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.170> same

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
call it menu we'll come back the same

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.440 
call it menu we'll come back the same
thing<00:02:28.560> up<00:02:28.680> here<00:02:28.709> we're<00:02:29.580> going<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.760> come<00:02:30.239> down

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
thing up here we're going to come down

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.940 
thing up here we're going to come down
we're<00:02:30.810> going<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.019> go<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.230> color<00:02:31.590> material

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
we're going to go to color material

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.920 
we're going to go to color material
channel<00:02:32.400> it's<00:02:32.550> on<00:02:32.700> none<00:02:33.150> currently<00:02:33.780> it's

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
channel it's on none currently it's

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.259 
channel it's on none currently it's
showing<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.230> vertex<00:02:34.680> color<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.819> if<00:02:35.970> we<00:02:36.120> just

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
showing the vertex color so if we just

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.300 
showing the vertex color so if we just
click<00:02:36.420> diffuse<00:02:37.319> there<00:02:37.739> yeah<00:02:37.920> that's<00:02:38.099> exactly

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
click diffuse there yeah that's exactly

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.559 
click diffuse there yeah that's exactly
what<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.730> want<00:02:38.910> now<00:02:39.900> if<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:41.390> finish<00:02:42.390> with

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
what you want now if you finish with

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.020 
what you want now if you finish with
that<00:02:42.720> that's<00:02:43.050> all<00:02:43.140> done<00:02:43.410> now<00:02:43.650> all<00:02:44.519> of<00:02:44.910> these

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
that that's all done now all of these

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.380 
that that's all done now all of these
vertices<00:02:45.420> have<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:46.459> color<00:02:47.459> baked<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.910> them<00:02:48.090> now

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
vertices have a color baked to them now

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.420 
vertices have a color baked to them now
it's<00:02:48.600> it's<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.380> gradient<00:02:49.620> black<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.130> white<00:02:50.250> but

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
it's it's a gradient black and white but

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.759 
it's it's a gradient black and white but
we're<00:02:50.610> all<00:02:50.730> good<00:02:50.910> so<00:02:51.540> you're<00:02:52.140> gonna<00:02:52.230> export<00:02:52.620> it

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
we're all good so you're gonna export it

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.830 
we're all good so you're gonna export it
FBX<00:02:53.190> pull<00:02:53.580> it<00:02:53.700> into<00:02:53.850> unity<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.569> then<00:02:54.720> your

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
FBX pull it into unity and then your

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.610 
FBX pull it into unity and then your
scene<00:02:55.170> will<00:02:55.440> look<00:02:55.860> something<00:02:56.370> like<00:02:56.580> this<00:02:57.090> now

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
scene will look something like this now

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.440 
scene will look something like this now
you've<00:02:58.620> got<00:02:58.739> your<00:02:58.830> table<00:02:59.190> let's<00:02:59.910> just<00:03:00.090> drag<00:03:00.269> it

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
you've got your table let's just drag it

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.990 
you've got your table let's just drag it
in<00:03:00.540> if<00:03:00.989> you<00:03:01.049> drag<00:03:01.380> it<00:03:01.500> into<00:03:01.620> up<00:03:02.190> here<00:03:02.519> it'll<00:03:02.880> go

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
in if you drag it into up here it'll go

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.970 
in if you drag it into up here it'll go
at<00:03:03.150> zero<00:03:03.420> zero<00:03:03.630> zero<00:03:03.690> dragged<00:03:04.440> into<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.739> scene

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
at zero zero zero dragged into the scene

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.300 
at zero zero zero dragged into the scene
you're<00:03:05.700> gonna<00:03:05.819> have<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.120> go<00:03:06.739> options<00:03:07.739> reset

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
you're gonna have to go options reset

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.789 
you're gonna have to go options reset
now<00:03:09.030> you've<00:03:09.360> got<00:03:09.540> your<00:03:09.630> table<00:03:09.959> pink<00:03:10.530> because

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
now you've got your table pink because

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.199 
now you've got your table pink because
I've<00:03:10.950> deleted<00:03:11.190> my<00:03:11.430> material<00:03:11.849> that<00:03:11.940> came<00:03:12.030> in

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
I've deleted my material that came in

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.410 
I've deleted my material that came in
with<00:03:12.360> so<00:03:13.200> we're<00:03:13.349> going<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.590> create<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:14.370> material

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
with so we're going to create a material

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.530 
with so we're going to create a material
now<00:03:15.690> we're<00:03:15.840> gonna<00:03:15.930> name<00:03:16.140> it<00:03:16.170> table<00:03:18.350> round

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
now we're gonna name it table round

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.259 
now we're gonna name it table round
material<00:03:21.680> so<00:03:22.680> with<00:03:23.549> this<00:03:23.670> material<00:03:23.820> you<00:03:24.180> know

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
material so with this material you know

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.380 
material so with this material you know
apply<00:03:24.570> it<00:03:24.630> straight<00:03:24.810> away<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:26.180> there<00:03:27.180> we<00:03:27.269> go

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
apply it straight away and there we go

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.720 
apply it straight away and there we go
that's<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.690> that's<00:03:27.810> just<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.680> light<00:03:29.310> I've<00:03:29.489> put

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
that's it that's just the light I've put

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.990 
that's it that's just the light I've put
in<00:03:29.850> coming<00:03:30.209> through<00:03:30.530> so<00:03:31.530> this<00:03:32.220> diffuse<00:03:32.790> invert

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
in coming through so this diffuse invert

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.640 
in coming through so this diffuse invert
color<00:03:33.209> is<00:03:33.390> exactly<00:03:33.750> what<00:03:33.989> I<00:03:34.019> want<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.440> built

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
color is exactly what I want I built

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.630 
color is exactly what I want I built
this<00:03:34.739> earlier<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.220> now<00:03:35.280> I'm<00:03:35.340> going<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.519> show

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
this earlier and now I'm going to show

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.160 
this earlier and now I'm going to show
you<00:03:35.670> how<00:03:35.850> it<00:03:35.940> works<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:36.390> let's<00:03:36.690> just<00:03:36.810> throw

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
you how it works so let's just throw

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.750 
you how it works so let's just throw
this<00:03:37.410> in<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:38.660> now<00:03:39.660> you<00:03:39.720> can<00:03:40.079> see<00:03:40.319> my<00:03:40.920> AO<00:03:41.340> coming

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
this in and now you can see my AO coming

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.699 
this in and now you can see my AO coming
through<00:03:41.910> but<00:03:42.120> that's<00:03:42.569> just<00:03:42.810> one<00:03:43.049> step<00:03:43.500> too<00:03:43.680> far

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
through but that's just one step too far

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:44.960 
through but that's just one step too far
ahead<00:03:43.920> we're<00:03:44.130> going<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.310> click<00:03:44.459> on<00:03:44.549> this<00:03:44.700> we're

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
ahead we're going to click on this we're

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.309 
ahead we're going to click on this we're
gonna<00:03:45.030> get<00:03:45.269> opening<00:03:45.600> shader<00:03:45.810> Forge<00:03:46.019> if<00:03:46.230> you

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
gonna get opening shader Forge if you

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.990 
gonna get opening shader Forge if you
haven't<00:03:46.560> done<00:03:46.620> this<00:03:46.739> earlier<00:03:46.950> you're<00:03:47.880> gonna

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
haven't done this earlier you're gonna

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.840 
haven't done this earlier you're gonna
need<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.299> go<00:03:48.420> window<00:03:49.170> shade<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.590> forge<00:03:49.799> so<00:03:50.730> we're

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
need to go window shade a forge so we're

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.970 
need to go window shade a forge so we're
gonna<00:03:50.940> go<00:03:51.120> open<00:03:51.389> in<00:03:51.510> shade<00:03:51.630> of<00:03:51.750> forge<00:03:51.900> and<00:03:52.829> is

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
gonna go open in shade of forge and is

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.410 
gonna go open in shade of forge and is
exactly<00:03:53.100> what<00:03:53.430> looks<00:03:53.549> like<00:03:53.700> it's<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.180> very

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
exactly what looks like it's a very

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.990 
exactly what looks like it's a very
simple<00:03:54.840> simple<00:03:55.170> simple<00:03:55.319> system<00:03:56.160> because

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
simple simple simple system because

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.780 
simple simple simple system because
shader<00:03:57.450> Forge<00:03:57.660> is<00:03:57.840> so<00:03:58.049> fantastic<00:03:58.680> so<00:03:59.459> the

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
shader Forge is so fantastic so the

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.449 
shader Forge is so fantastic so the
first<00:03:59.970> thing<00:04:00.120> you<00:04:00.269> need<00:04:00.510> is<00:04:00.690> a<00:04:00.720> vertex<00:04:01.350> Oh

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
first thing you need is a vertex Oh

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.090 
first thing you need is a vertex Oh

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
mr. Belton we're going to need a vertex

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.410 
mr. Belton we're going to need a vertex
color<00:04:05.430> node<00:04:05.700> alright<00:04:07.190> yeah<00:04:08.190> that's<00:04:08.489> for

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
color node alright yeah that's for

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.300 
color node alright yeah that's for
whatever<00:04:09.720> this<00:04:10.049> is<00:04:10.230> applied<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.769> it'll<00:04:11.100> pull

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.449 
whatever this is applied to it'll pull
the<00:04:11.340> vertex<00:04:11.910> color<00:04:12.150> out<00:04:12.359> of<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.690> mesh<00:04:13.049> it's<00:04:13.260> on

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
the vertex color out of the mesh it's on

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.379 
the vertex color out of the mesh it's on
now<00:04:14.459> the<00:04:14.639> other<00:04:14.790> thing<00:04:14.940> we're<00:04:15.060> gonna<00:04:15.150> need<00:04:15.239> is

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
now the other thing we're gonna need is

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.870 
now the other thing we're gonna need is
in<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.720> colored<00:04:16.079> section<00:04:16.579> texture<00:04:17.579> today

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
in the colored section texture today

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.279 
in the colored section texture today
there<00:04:18.239> we<00:04:18.329> go<00:04:18.450> that's<00:04:18.630> where<00:04:18.840> you'll<00:04:18.959> apply

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
there we go that's where you'll apply

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.240 
there we go that's where you'll apply
your<00:04:19.440> texture<00:04:19.739> now<00:04:20.280> on<00:04:20.700> this<00:04:21.599> mesh<00:04:22.250> even

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
your texture now on this mesh even

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.040 
your texture now on this mesh even
though<00:04:23.370> it<00:04:23.490> has<00:04:23.610> this<00:04:23.760> applied<00:04:24.090> this<00:04:24.510> texture

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
though it has this applied this texture

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.830 
though it has this applied this texture
does<00:04:25.380> not

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
does not

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.570 
does not
matter<00:04:26.020> you'll<00:04:26.500> have<00:04:26.680> to<00:04:26.800> reapply<00:04:27.190> it<00:04:27.310> for

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
matter you'll have to reapply it for

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.659 
matter you'll have to reapply it for
later<00:04:28.500> when<00:04:29.500> you're<00:04:29.889> actually<00:04:30.190> in<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.400> scene

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
later when you're actually in the scene

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.720 
later when you're actually in the scene
not<00:04:30.850> enjoyed<00:04:31.300> a<00:04:31.330> forge<00:04:31.570> so<00:04:32.310> we've<00:04:33.310> done<00:04:33.490> it<00:04:33.520> all

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
not enjoyed a forge so we've done it all

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.210 
not enjoyed a forge so we've done it all
just<00:04:34.180> hold<00:04:34.690> down<00:04:34.750> m<00:04:35.050> and<00:04:35.229> click<00:04:35.470> and<00:04:35.680> you<00:04:35.740> got<00:04:36.190> a

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
just hold down m and click and you got a

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.280 
just hold down m and click and you got a
multiply<00:04:36.610> node<00:04:36.639> and<00:04:37.110> then<00:04:38.110> you're<00:04:38.199> gonna

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
multiply node and then you're gonna

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.960 
multiply node and then you're gonna
connect<00:04:38.590> them<00:04:38.889> all<00:04:39.010> up<00:04:39.190> just<00:04:39.520> to<00:04:39.699> look<00:04:39.790> like

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
connect them all up just to look like

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.900 
connect them all up just to look like
this<00:04:40.290> now<00:04:41.290> when<00:04:42.160> they<00:04:42.310> do<00:04:42.370> look<00:04:42.550> like<00:04:42.669> this

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
this now when they do look like this

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.510 
this now when they do look like this
I'll<00:04:43.810> show<00:04:44.080> you<00:04:44.139> how<00:04:44.500> you<00:04:44.560> can<00:04:44.740> tell<00:04:44.949> that<00:04:45.340> it's

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
I'll show you how you can tell that it's

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.980 
I'll show you how you can tell that it's
working<00:04:45.699> and<00:04:46.090> it's<00:04:46.240> not<00:04:46.300> we're<00:04:46.720> going<00:04:46.870> to

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
working and it's not we're going to

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.379 
working and it's not we're going to
compile<00:04:47.320> this<00:04:47.500> shader<00:04:47.940> just<00:04:48.940> to<00:04:49.060> make<00:04:49.210> sure

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
compile this shader just to make sure

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.120 
compile this shader just to make sure

tell this is working if it's a yes or a

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.150

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:23.129 
our jeff's down diffuse RGB to our main
diffuse<00:05:19.960> it<00:05:20.530> can<00:05:20.680> pile<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:20.979> shader<00:05:21.539> and<00:05:22.539> there

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
diffuse it can pile the shader and there

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:25.140 
diffuse it can pile the shader and there
you<00:05:23.200> go<00:05:23.350> alright<00:05:23.860> so<00:05:24.220> that's<00:05:24.400> just<00:05:24.639> a<00:05:24.820> diffuse

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
you go alright so that's just a diffuse

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.029 
you go alright so that's just a diffuse
now<00:05:25.389> if<00:05:25.539> you<00:05:25.660> multiply<00:05:26.139> it<00:05:26.169> with<00:05:26.320> your<00:05:26.680> vertex

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 
now if you multiply it with your vertex

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:28.710 
now if you multiply it with your vertex
color<00:05:27.250> you're<00:05:27.460> going<00:05:27.520> to<00:05:27.639> get<00:05:27.820> the<00:05:28.030> AO<00:05:28.300> come

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
color you're going to get the AO come

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.770 
color you're going to get the AO come
through<00:05:28.960> so<00:05:29.650> we're<00:05:29.770> gonna<00:05:30.180> swap<00:05:31.180> these<00:05:31.360> it's

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
through so we're gonna swap these it's

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.129 
through so we're gonna swap these it's
gonna<00:05:31.870> recompile<00:05:32.470> and<00:05:33.660> there<00:05:34.660> you<00:05:34.750> go<00:05:34.900> now<00:05:35.080> you

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
gonna recompile and there you go now you

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:36.360 
gonna recompile and there you go now you
can<00:05:35.320> see<00:05:35.440> a<00:05:35.650> always<00:05:35.860> working<00:05:36.160> so<00:05:36.280> that's

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
can see a always working so that's

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.950 
can see a always working so that's
really<00:05:36.610> easy<00:05:36.729> method<00:05:37.270> of<00:05:37.389> checking<00:05:37.539> that<00:05:37.810> it's

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
really easy method of checking that it's

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.310 
really easy method of checking that it's
working<00:05:38.320> and<00:05:38.470> that<00:05:39.250> your<00:05:40.020> object<00:05:41.020> did<00:05:41.139> come

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
working and that your object did come

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.140 
working and that your object did come
out<00:05:41.349> with<00:05:41.560> baked<00:05:41.740> a<00:05:42.090> to<00:05:43.090> you<00:05:43.210> vertices<00:05:43.599> so<00:05:45.150> the

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
out with baked a to you vertices so the

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.330 
out with baked a to you vertices so the
multiply<00:05:46.599> just<00:05:47.200> quick<00:05:47.470> note<00:05:47.650> it<00:05:47.950> doesn't

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
multiply just quick note it doesn't

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.100 
multiply just quick note it doesn't
matter<00:05:48.639> if<00:05:48.940> this<00:05:49.180> is<00:05:49.389> on<00:05:49.510> top<00:05:49.660> or<00:05:49.870> on<00:05:49.900> bottom

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
matter if this is on top or on bottom

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.990 
matter if this is on top or on bottom
I've<00:05:50.680> tried<00:05:50.950> to<00:05:51.099> flip<00:05:51.280> them<00:05:51.460> you<00:05:51.639> can<00:05:51.789> do<00:05:51.880> the

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
I've tried to flip them you can do the

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.909 
I've tried to flip them you can do the
same<00:05:52.150> it<00:05:52.810> really<00:05:53.139> really<00:05:53.320> doesn't<00:05:53.470> matter

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
same it really really doesn't matter

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.670 
same it really really doesn't matter
it's<00:05:54.099> whatever<00:05:54.760> it<00:05:54.940> wants<00:05:55.380> it's<00:05:56.380> not<00:05:56.560> like

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
it's whatever it wants it's not like

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.990 
it's whatever it wants it's not like
Photoshop<00:05:57.099> you<00:05:57.220> don't<00:05:57.400> have<00:05:57.490> to<00:05:57.580> have<00:05:57.700> one<00:05:57.729> on

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
Photoshop you don't have to have one on

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.540 
Photoshop you don't have to have one on
