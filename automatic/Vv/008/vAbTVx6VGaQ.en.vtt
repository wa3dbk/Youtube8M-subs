00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.740
 Y 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.420
 how about how you are going here in 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.610
 our site in our workshop to 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.139
 talk about motorcycling to talk about 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.730
 security and to talk about many things 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.580
 that have to do with the wheels with 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.859
 motor today good some things that you have 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.020
 have to check that they are important for the 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:21.699
 security and that are on your motorcycle that 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.070
 takes you to the one that brings you every day 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.660
 the one that weekend gives you cute 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.279
 good times you have to attend to it 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:32.529
 little bit also fundamentally first 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.510
 front and rear tire that the 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.130
 tire is in the conditions that 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.340
 it has to be requested by the manufacturer or 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.320
 be in the use that the drawing is in the 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.629
 measured within the range of use of 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.629
 tire that is the right tire 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:50.110
 and if possible, of course, pneumatic 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:53.320
 of approved brand and also not 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.090
 have a time without use where the 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.949
 tire has aged because they come down 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.980
 the benefits do not last forever 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.309
 because I have drawing tire care 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.960
 It also gets old and you have to change it 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.000
 check the condition of the brakes 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.770
 the game of the front floor in these 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.140
 drum brakes are regulated from this 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.640
 turquita that is here you can feel it 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:18.700
 from the handle how much it has twisting 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.770
 it takes off game and opening unwinding 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.330
 it gives you more juice the juice that you have left 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.000
 comfortable for you to see that the both 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.610
 brake is what you are looking for and also that you 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.680
 Be sure the brake gives you confidence 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.140
 back the same but has another 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.670
 sensitivity the front brake is used 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.450
 by 70 percent on the bike and the 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.610
 back in a 30 and also has the 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.789
 regulation by a nut and is when 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.979
 it's a drum- to-rod brake like him and 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.170
 last and now I'm going to put it in 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.420
 contact so you can see it when 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.060
 press the rear brake you have to 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.390
 turn on the brake light all have 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.580
 regulation and this is warning who 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.700
 comes behind us who are you 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:05.439
 stop and avoid taking you ahead 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.439
 and well
