to be looking at my newest custom which

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.339 
to be looking at my newest custom which
is<00:00:15.950> another<00:00:16.369> one<00:00:16.580> for<00:00:16.820> my<00:00:16.939> customer<00:00:17.810> who<00:00:17.990> wants

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:18.349 
is another one for my customer who wants

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:22.540 
is another one for my customer who wants
the<00:00:18.529> original<00:00:19.460> shield<00:00:19.820> and<00:00:20.180> Hydra<00:00:20.529> agents<00:00:21.550> and

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
the original shield and Hydra agents and

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.910 
the original shield and Hydra agents and
this<00:00:23.450> is<00:00:23.599> obviously<00:00:23.990> the<00:00:24.110> first<00:00:24.320> Hydra<00:00:24.770> one

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
this is obviously the first Hydra one

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.410 
this is obviously the first Hydra one
he's<00:00:25.130> not<00:00:25.160> blue<00:00:25.520> and<00:00:25.670> gray<00:00:25.820> like<00:00:26.029> the<00:00:26.060> shield

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
he's not blue and gray like the shield

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.420 
he's not blue and gray like the shield
so<00:00:26.600> it's<00:00:26.990> probably<00:00:27.710> pretty<00:00:27.890> easy<00:00:28.100> to<00:00:28.250> tell

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430

wants those to be but I thought they

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.500 
wants those to be but I thought they
look<00:02:41.370> cool<00:02:41.580> so<00:02:41.849> those<00:02:42.000> are<00:02:42.120> going<00:02:42.239> all<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.480> way

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
that a little bit I sculpt it over the

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.909 
that a little bit I sculpt it over the
center<00:04:24.510> thing<00:04:24.810> for<00:04:24.990> protector<00:04:25.440> to<00:04:25.590> give<00:04:25.740> him

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
his Hydra logo and the head is actually

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.909 
his Hydra logo and the head is actually
protector<00:04:30.870> which<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.140> didn't<00:04:31.409> want<00:04:31.650> to<00:04:31.740> use

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
protector which I didn't want to use

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.649 
protector which I didn't want to use
originally<00:04:32.460> because<00:04:33.000> I<00:04:33.150> didn't<00:04:33.390> want<00:04:33.510> it<00:04:33.570> to

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:33.659 
originally because I didn't want it to

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.480 
originally because I didn't want it to
just<00:04:33.840> look<00:04:33.930> like<00:04:34.080> a<00:04:34.260> repainted<00:04:34.770> protector<00:04:35.250> so

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
just look like a repainted protector so

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.210 
just look like a repainted protector so
but<00:04:36.000> I'd

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
but I'd

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.460 
but I'd
was<00:04:36.430> instead<00:04:36.880> as<00:04:37.060> I<00:04:37.180> sculpted<00:04:37.570> H<00:04:37.780> in<00:04:38.020> part<00:04:38.260> to

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
was instead as I sculpted H in part to

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.560 
was instead as I sculpted H in part to
the<00:04:38.770> helmet<00:04:39.400> or<00:04:39.520> mask<00:04:39.820> which<00:04:40.090> I<00:04:40.210> think<00:04:40.420> really

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
the helmet or mask which I think really

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.690 
the helmet or mask which I think really
changes<00:04:41.050> the<00:04:41.140> look<00:04:41.290> and<00:04:41.860> I<00:04:41.950> sculpted<00:04:42.370> a<00:04:42.520> new

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
changes the look and I sculpted a new

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.040 
changes the look and I sculpted a new
type<00:04:42.910> of<00:04:42.940> visor<00:04:43.300> with<00:04:45.360> little<00:04:46.360> reflected

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
type of visor with little reflected

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.870 
type of visor with little reflected
reflections<00:04:47.680> in<00:04:47.860> it<00:04:47.980> so<00:04:48.370> I<00:04:48.400> think<00:04:48.490> that<00:04:48.640> looks

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
reflections in it so I think that looks

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.880 
reflections in it so I think that looks
pretty<00:04:49.060> cool<00:04:49.330> and<00:04:49.630> then<00:04:49.810> I<00:04:49.870> used<00:04:50.050> the<00:04:50.140> like<00:04:50.710> the

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
pretty cool and then I used the like the

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.070 
pretty cool and then I used the like the
I<00:04:51.070> said<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.490> Deadpool<00:04:51.670> harness<00:04:52.240> up<00:04:52.390> here<00:04:52.630> that

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
I said the Deadpool harness up here that

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.080 
I said the Deadpool harness up here that
goes<00:04:53.260> around<00:04:53.560> to<00:04:53.740> the<00:04:53.770> back<00:04:53.890> and<00:04:54.400> I<00:04:54.850> made<00:04:55.060> it

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
goes around to the back and I made it

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.320 
goes around to the back and I made it
just<00:04:55.240> able<00:04:55.840> to<00:04:55.990> receive<00:04:56.470> the<00:04:56.650> backpack<00:04:57.180> if<00:04:58.180> I

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
just able to receive the backpack if I

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.150 
just able to receive the backpack if I
can<00:04:58.480> do<00:04:58.570> it<00:04:58.660> in<00:04:58.750> camera<00:04:59.110> there<00:04:59.410> you<00:04:59.440> go<00:04:59.650> so<00:05:00.130> I

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
can do it in camera there you go so I

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.280 
can do it in camera there you go so I
mean<00:05:00.550> it's<00:05:00.880> not<00:05:01.000> a<00:05:01.030> whole<00:05:01.300> lot<00:05:01.540> going<00:05:01.570> on<00:05:01.990> but<00:05:02.230> I

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
mean it's not a whole lot going on but I

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.440 
mean it's not a whole lot going on but I
think<00:05:02.530> it<00:05:02.620> turned<00:05:02.800> out<00:05:02.890> pretty<00:05:02.950> cool<00:05:03.460> this<00:05:04.180> is

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
think it turned out pretty cool this is

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.180 
think it turned out pretty cool this is
from<00:05:04.690> some<00:05:04.900> belt<00:05:05.110> I<00:05:05.260> found<00:05:05.530> I<00:05:05.710> don't<00:05:05.890> know<00:05:05.980> and

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
from some belt I found I don't know and

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.310 
from some belt I found I don't know and
I<00:05:06.220> just<00:05:06.250> repainted<00:05:06.850> it<00:05:07.000> then<00:05:07.420> he<00:05:07.510> also<00:05:07.660> has<00:05:07.990> the

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
I just repainted it then he also has the

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.800 
I just repainted it then he also has the
headset<00:05:09.130> thing<00:05:09.400> which<00:05:09.730> is<00:05:09.940> it<00:05:10.240> doesn't<00:05:10.450> get<00:05:10.690> in

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
headset thing which is it doesn't get in

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.420 
headset thing which is it doesn't get in
the<00:05:10.840> way<00:05:10.960> of<00:05:11.170> the<00:05:11.290> articulation<00:05:11.980> it's<00:05:12.190> soft

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
the way of the articulation it's soft

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.430 
the way of the articulation it's soft
enough<00:05:12.700> plastic<00:05:13.180> to<00:05:13.510> where<00:05:13.660> you<00:05:14.200> can<00:05:14.350> do

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
enough plastic to where you can do
