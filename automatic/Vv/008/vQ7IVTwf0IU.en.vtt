00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:07.259
 Tell us guys, we're from 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.300
 new here at the lg booth is born 2015 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.660
 to show another novelty for 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.950
 you what is the lg music folk system like 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.080
 We can see here we are in a 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.109
 environment where many 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.570
 speakers and all of these 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.279
 they are integrated into an ep and I go 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.119
 show and in sequence to you how it is 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.650
 that works 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.590
 first we will check your 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.900
 boxes here lg brought this year to 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.480
 faithful if a line quite enough 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.160
 large and fairly large number of 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.980
 sound so we have several sizes 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.980
 of various formats with several 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.290
 powers that the idea of ​​lg 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.930
 music show is that you can spread 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.870
 these speakers dance in your house 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.050
 with several rooms and all of them can 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.579
 be integrated into the same wifi network at 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.989
 from the application 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.730
 the application that we will show in the 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.039
 Follow this application for you 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.199
 allows you to manage all of these 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.690
 speakers the speakers of your 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.570
 home theater anyway they can all 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.240
 operate simultaneously or 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.570
 independent way that the system nuno 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.740
 you have total control of the environment is 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.189
 we have here a home theater 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.290
 main with some speakers 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:21.720
 auxiliary devices that can be connected or 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.840
 cable or via Bluetooth also with the 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.520
 main smartphone and let's get here 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.520
 in the part where you have an application 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.149
 here is a main application of lg 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.869
 music hall that allows you to 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.069
 control all these speakers 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.079
 directly on ep 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:43.270
 so it does not matter if the audio source 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:46.119
 is leaving your computer is 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.909
 coming out of a physical media is coming out 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:52.119
 of a screamin program does not matter 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:55.869
 from any of them and you 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.729
 can have total control of the 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.250
 environmentally sound condition right 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.479
 and you can set up 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.700
 independent sound 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.579
 according to what he told us here this 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.229
 system supports up to 100 speakers 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.599
 so you can have it within the same 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.090
 up to 100 audio tracks that are not 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.950
 necessarily have to be lg can 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.709
 from any other manufacturer since the 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.690
 that they are on the same network and the 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.640
 From this you configure I want you to 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.230
 two audio boxes for example plays 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.019
 one song I want three other 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.510
 audio boxes to play another song or 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:31.629
 eventually even all the cut bunches 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.359
 in the same song and finally we have 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:37.090
 another very interesting situation 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:38.440
 also that it is the fact that the song follows 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.639
 you in the environment 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.100
 so for example let's suppose you 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:44.620
 be in the room listening to a song you 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.780
 you can move to the room near the 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.970
 your cell phone from an audio box it 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.910
 recognizes that your cell phone base 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.010
 the material transmitter has moved up to a 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.239
 another room and he transfers the music 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.069
 that was being heard 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.549
 in that room that you were with a 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:03.130
 new room doing what the flow that the 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.950
 The flame is the flow of music that she 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.819
 can follow you through the entire 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.500
 your home 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.230
 so this is it people was one more 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.090
 The novelty of LG is born here is 2015 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.690
 stay connected in our coverage and until the 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.690
