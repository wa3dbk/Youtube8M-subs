percentage<00:01:07.600> and<00:01:07.780> I<00:01:08.680> can<00:01:09.610> understand<00:01:09.910> say<00:01:10.060> I'm

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
percentage and I can understand say I'm

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.440 
percentage and I can understand say I'm
not<00:01:10.270> sure<00:01:10.330> if<00:01:10.900> it's<00:01:11.530> 100%<00:01:12.100> accurate<00:01:12.820> but<00:01:13.300> it

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
not sure if it's 100% accurate but it

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.090 
not sure if it's 100% accurate but it
gives<00:01:13.660> you<00:01:13.840> a<00:01:13.870> reference<00:01:14.290> point<00:01:14.380> if<00:01:14.800> you

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
gives you a reference point if you

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.670 
gives you a reference point if you
always<00:01:15.640> do<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.030> same<00:01:16.210> way<00:01:16.480> in<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:17.500> same

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
always do the same way in the same

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.740 
always do the same way in the same
position<00:01:18.250> around<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:18.880> same<00:01:19.090> time<00:01:19.360> period<00:01:19.540> of

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
position around the same time period of

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.930 
position around the same time period of
the<00:01:19.840> day<00:01:19.990> you<00:01:20.500> have<00:01:20.650> a<00:01:20.680> good<00:01:20.950> estimate<00:01:21.430> if<00:01:21.640> your

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940

so<00:02:06.370> I<00:02:06.700> will<00:02:06.909> say<00:02:07.030> that<00:02:07.180> this<00:02:07.360> body<00:02:07.870> fat<00:02:08.200> caliper

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
so I will say that this body fat caliper

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.700 
so I will say that this body fat caliper
it's<00:02:09.159> very<00:02:09.489> essential<00:02:09.879> to<00:02:10.330> help<00:02:11.110> you

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
little thing right here is like they

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.690 
little thing right here is like they
move<00:02:32.740> you<00:02:32.950> want<00:02:33.100> to<00:02:33.160> make<00:02:33.250> sure<00:02:33.400> it's<00:02:33.520> all<00:02:33.610> the

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
move you want to make sure it's all the

telling me I'm at about eight according
to<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:04.120> body<00:03:04.330> fat<00:03:04.540> caliper<00:03:04.990> so<00:03:05.500> we're<00:03:05.650> at<00:03:05.860> it

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
to the body fat caliper so we're at it

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.710 
to the body fat caliper so we're at it
for<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.220> lower<00:03:06.430> abs<00:03:06.610> and<00:03:07.210> you<00:03:07.450> do<00:03:07.570> it<00:03:07.690> again

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
for the lower abs and you do it again

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.960 
for the lower abs and you do it again
just<00:03:08.410> to<00:03:08.530> get<00:03:08.860> an<00:03:08.980> accurate<00:03:09.370> measurement<00:03:09.400> to

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
just to get an accurate measurement to

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.370 
just to get an accurate measurement to
try<00:03:10.120> to<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.390> know<00:03:10.450> to<00:03:10.720> make<00:03:10.900> sure<00:03:11.110> that<00:03:11.260> you

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:56.629 
put my age my weight and my numbers in
and<00:05:51.750> then<00:05:52.550> you<00:05:53.550> press<00:05:53.729> calculate<00:05:54.710> and<00:05:55.710> then

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
and then you press calculate and then

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:57.830 
and then you press calculate and then
it's<00:05:56.909> telling<00:05:57.150> it's<00:05:57.270> telling<00:05:57.509> me<00:05:57.569> I'm<00:05:57.689> at

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
it's telling it's telling me I'm at

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.679 
it's telling it's telling me I'm at
about<00:05:58.139> four<00:05:58.770> point<00:05:59.039> six<00:05:59.250> one<00:05:59.550> but<00:06:00.360> once<00:06:00.569> again

00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:00.689 
about four point six one but once again

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:01.939 
about four point six one but once again
like<00:06:00.810> I<00:06:01.050> said<00:06:01.110> I'm<00:06:01.349> not<00:06:01.500> sure<00:06:01.560> if<00:06:01.800> that's

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
like I said I'm not sure if that's

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:03.499 
like I said I'm not sure if that's
actually<00:06:02.159> accurate<00:06:02.849> but<00:06:03.030> it<00:06:03.120> gives<00:06:03.300> me<00:06:03.479> a

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
actually accurate but it gives me a

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:05.300 
actually accurate but it gives me a
reference<00:06:03.900> point<00:06:04.080> when<00:06:04.259> I<00:06:04.349> first<00:06:04.590> to<00:06:05.009> give<00:06:05.159> you

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
reference point when I first to give you

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.010 
reference point when I first to give you
a<00:06:05.340> little<00:06:05.520> idea<00:06:05.580> when<00:06:06.389> I<00:06:06.419> first<00:06:06.659> started<00:06:06.960> off

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
a little idea when I first started off

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.629 
a little idea when I first started off
if<00:06:07.229> you<00:06:07.319> go<00:06:07.409> check<00:06:07.650> out<00:06:07.800> my<00:06:07.979> transformation

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 
if you go check out my transformation

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.490 
if you go check out my transformation
video<00:06:08.909> when<00:06:09.389> I<00:06:09.419> first<00:06:09.719> did<00:06:09.900> this<00:06:10.080> I<00:06:10.259> was<00:06:10.379> at

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
video when I first did this I was at

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.240 
video when I first did this I was at
sixteen<00:06:11.039> so<00:06:11.580> you<00:06:12.000> know<00:06:12.090> namine<00:06:12.360> I've<00:06:12.509> actually

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
sixteen so you know namine I've actually

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.399 
sixteen so you know namine I've actually
went<00:06:14.250> down<00:06:14.490> by<00:06:14.759> around<00:06:15.060> 12<00:06:15.960> percent<00:06:16.050> of<00:06:16.259> body

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:16.409 
went down by around 12 percent of body

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:19.279 
went down by around 12 percent of body
fat<00:06:16.650> for<00:06:16.860> sure<00:06:17.069> but<00:06:17.479> to<00:06:18.479> say<00:06:18.629> if<00:06:18.750> I<00:06:18.840> was<00:06:18.930> sixteen

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:19.289 
fat for sure but to say if I was sixteen

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:21.260 
fat for sure but to say if I was sixteen
percent<00:06:19.560> at<00:06:19.710> that<00:06:19.740> point<00:06:20.159> when<00:06:20.639> I<00:06:20.669> started<00:06:20.789> and

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
percent at that point when I started and

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.719 
percent at that point when I started and
if<00:06:21.569> I'm<00:06:21.719> at<00:06:21.900> four<00:06:22.349> point<00:06:22.560> six<00:06:22.740> now<00:06:22.979> who<00:06:23.520> knows

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
if I'm at four point six now who knows

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:24.860 
if I'm at four point six now who knows
but<00:06:23.969> I<00:06:24.029> know<00:06:24.150> that<00:06:24.419> I<00:06:24.509> went<00:06:24.750> down

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
but I know that I went down

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.709 
but I know that I went down
approximately<00:06:25.800> 12%<00:06:26.699> body<00:06:27.029> fat<00:06:27.180> and<00:06:27.509> that's

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:27.719 
approximately 12% body fat and that's

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:30.619 
approximately 12% body fat and that's
the<00:06:27.840> issue<00:06:27.960> and<00:06:28.409> that's<00:06:29.240> that<00:06:30.240> I'm<00:06:30.360> trying<00:06:30.569> to
