the<00:02:33.739> only<00:02:34.040> issue<00:02:34.280> I<00:02:34.400> really<00:02:34.640> have<00:02:34.760> this<00:02:34.910> case

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
the only issue I really have this case

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.120 
the only issue I really have this case
in<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.360> way<00:02:35.480> of<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.570> reasons<00:02:35.870> I<00:02:35.959> I<00:02:36.620> don't

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
in the way of the reasons I I don't

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.250 
in the way of the reasons I I don't
really<00:02:37.250> recommend<00:02:38.180> or<00:02:38.420> like<00:02:38.660> it<00:02:38.810> that<00:02:38.930> much<00:02:38.959> is

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
really recommend or like it that much is

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.990 
really recommend or like it that much is
because<00:02:39.410> of<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.739> belt<00:02:39.920> clip<00:02:40.100> and<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.700> flap

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
because of the belt clip and the flap

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.420 
because of the belt clip and the flap
now<00:02:41.660> I'm<00:02:42.290> just<00:02:42.410> going<00:02:42.739> to<00:02:42.769> say<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.070> belt<00:02:43.250> clip

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
now I'm just going to say the belt clip

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.130 
now I'm just going to say the belt clip
is<00:02:43.580> really<00:02:43.880> cheaply<00:02:44.299> made<00:02:44.540> cheap<00:02:44.900> plastic

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
is really cheaply made cheap plastic

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.140 
is really cheaply made cheap plastic
it's<00:02:46.100> probably<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.489> cheapest<00:02:46.850> book<00:02:47.000> I've

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
it's probably the cheapest book I've

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.240 
it's probably the cheapest book I've
ever<00:02:47.299> seen<00:02:47.660> it<00:02:48.230> would<00:02:48.440> definitely<00:02:48.860> break<00:02:49.040> on

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
ever seen it would definitely break on

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.850 
ever seen it would definitely break on
it<00:02:49.280> really<00:02:49.610> easily<00:02:49.760> i<00:02:49.970> think<00:02:50.230> but<00:02:51.230> luckily<00:02:51.500> i

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
it really easily i think but luckily i

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.590 
it really easily i think but luckily i
just<00:02:52.220> found<00:02:52.310> out<00:02:52.489> i<00:02:52.519> love<00:02:52.880> with<00:02:53.090> on<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.330> ribs

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
just found out i love with on the ribs

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.240 
just found out i love with on the ribs
website<00:02:53.989> and<00:02:54.230> they<00:02:54.290> are<00:02:54.440> replacing<00:02:54.709> this<00:02:55.070> bow

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
website and they are replacing this bow

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.280 
website and they are replacing this bow
clip<00:02:55.489> with<00:02:55.670> another<00:02:55.940> belt<00:02:56.150> clip<00:02:56.330> so<00:02:56.540> this<00:02:57.140> has

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
clip with another belt clip so this has

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.020 
clip with another belt clip so this has
become<00:02:57.410> obsolete<00:02:57.769> this<00:02:58.100> is<00:02:58.250> initially<00:02:58.880> where

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
become obsolete this is initially where

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.850 
become obsolete this is initially where
as<00:02:59.090> far<00:02:59.269> as<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.510> quality<00:02:59.870> of<00:02:59.900> this<00:03:00.019> i<00:03:00.260> haven't

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
as far as the quality of this i haven't

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.770 
as far as the quality of this i haven't
checked<00:03:01.130> or<00:03:01.310> tested<00:03:01.760> out<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.060> new<00:03:02.330> belt<00:03:02.570> clip

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
checked or tested out the new belt clip

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.449 
checked or tested out the new belt clip
but<00:03:03.140> i'm<00:03:03.230> assuming<00:03:03.799> it's<00:03:04.010> better<00:03:04.250> than<00:03:04.340> this

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
but i'm assuming it's better than this

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.539 
but i'm assuming it's better than this
one<00:03:04.959> hopefully<00:03:05.959> so<00:03:06.709> okay<00:03:06.950> so<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.220> bow<00:03:07.310> clip

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
one hopefully so okay so the bow clip

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.820 
one hopefully so okay so the bow clip
isn't<00:03:07.790> really<00:03:08.030> a<00:03:08.330> big<00:03:09.110> issue<00:03:09.140> if<00:03:09.530> you<00:03:09.560> were<00:03:09.709> to

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
isn't really a big issue if you were to

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:10.960 
isn't really a big issue if you were to
buy<00:03:09.950> now<00:03:10.160> because<00:03:10.400> you<00:03:10.489> won't<00:03:10.610> get<00:03:10.730> this<00:03:10.820> one

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
buy now because you won't get this one

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.449 
buy now because you won't get this one
but<00:03:11.420> then<00:03:11.570> i<00:03:11.600> think<00:03:11.780> this<00:03:12.019> issue<00:03:12.220> with<00:03:13.220> this

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
but then i think this issue with this

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.190 
but then i think this issue with this
would<00:03:13.940> still<00:03:14.180> be<00:03:14.269> a<00:03:14.299> problem<00:03:14.600> is<00:03:14.780> that<00:03:14.989> this

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
would still be a problem is that this

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.990 
would still be a problem is that this
flapper<00:03:15.500> here<00:03:15.830> you're<00:03:16.549> attending<00:03:16.760> put<00:03:16.940> the

miss swivels it flips it right off and
it<00:03:32.810> pops<00:03:33.019> open<00:03:33.140> I<00:03:33.670> think<00:03:34.670> it's<00:03:34.790> a<00:03:34.850> really<00:03:34.880> big

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
it pops open I think it's a really big

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.520 
it pops open I think it's a really big
design<00:03:35.480> floor<00:03:35.780> I<00:03:35.810> don't<00:03:36.049> think<00:03:36.230> they<00:03:36.320> should

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
design floor I don't think they should

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.720 
design floor I don't think they should
have<00:03:36.560> designed<00:03:36.890> it<00:03:36.980> with<00:03:37.040> this<00:03:37.190> flap<00:03:37.400> here<00:03:37.640> at

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
have designed it with this flap here at

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.180 
have designed it with this flap here at
all<00:03:37.850> um<00:03:38.150> I<00:03:38.510> honestly<00:03:39.230> don't<00:03:39.350> think<00:03:39.470> it<00:03:39.709> might

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
all um I honestly don't think it might

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.450 
all um I honestly don't think it might
not<00:03:40.280> even<00:03:40.370> need<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.819> flat<00:03:41.000> back

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
not even need the flat back

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.510 
not even need the flat back
probably<00:03:41.850> husband<00:03:42.740> it's<00:03:43.740> if<00:03:44.040> seems<00:03:44.370> pretty

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
probably husband it's if seems pretty

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.770 
probably husband it's if seems pretty
stomach<00:03:44.910> for<00:03:45.120> it<00:03:45.180> wouldn't<00:03:45.390> even<00:03:45.540> need<00:03:45.630> to

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
stomach for it wouldn't even need to

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.360 
stomach for it wouldn't even need to
have<00:03:45.960> that<00:03:45.990> we<00:03:46.410> will<00:03:46.560> just<00:03:46.680> sit<00:03:46.860> in<00:03:47.010> there<00:03:47.160> all

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
have that we will just sit in there all

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.430 
have that we will just sit in there all
right<00:03:47.750> but<00:03:48.750> I<00:03:48.780> guess<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:48.960> would<00:03:49.200> want<00:03:49.380> that

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
right but I guess you would want that

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.110 
right but I guess you would want that
splat<00:03:49.860> for<00:03:50.040> protection<00:03:50.580> but<00:03:50.670> at<00:03:50.850> the<00:03:50.970> same

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
splat for protection but at the same

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.820 
splat for protection but at the same
time<00:03:51.270> the<00:03:51.840> magnet<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.350> it's<00:03:52.470> using<00:03:52.740> is

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
time the magnet that it's using is

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.860 
time the magnet that it's using is
really<00:03:53.160> not<00:03:53.610> that<00:03:53.820> strong<00:03:54.150> of<00:03:54.300> a<00:03:54.390> magnet<00:03:54.660> on<00:03:54.720> me

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
really not that strong of a magnet on me

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.660 
really not that strong of a magnet on me
i<00:03:54.900> could<00:03:55.080> easily<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.710> know<00:03:55.830> it<00:03:56.550> doesn't

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
i could easily you know it doesn't

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.220 
i could easily you know it doesn't
really<00:03:56.880> stand<00:03:57.120> there<00:03:57.300> very<00:03:57.450> long<00:03:57.510> silent<00:03:58.110> i

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
really stand there very long silent i

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.810 
really stand there very long silent i
think<00:03:58.440> even<00:03:58.650> if<00:03:58.830> it<00:03:58.950> was<00:03:59.070> loose<00:03:59.280> that<00:03:59.490> I<00:03:59.520> doubt

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
think even if it was loose that I doubt

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.430 
think even if it was loose that I doubt
this<00:04:00.000> flat<00:04:00.270> but<00:04:00.450> stop<00:04:00.660> it<00:04:00.810> from<00:04:00.930> sliding<00:04:01.170> out

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
this flat but stop it from sliding out

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.410 
this flat but stop it from sliding out
from<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:02.370> bottom<00:04:02.520> of<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.760> iPhone<00:04:02.880> if<00:04:03.240> you<00:04:03.330> had

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
from the bottom of the iPhone if you had

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.150 
from the bottom of the iPhone if you had
your<00:04:03.480> flip<00:04:03.660> flip<00:04:03.810> side<00:04:03.990> up<00:04:04.170> so<00:04:04.350> I<00:04:04.860> definitely

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
your flip flip side up so I definitely

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.560 
your flip flip side up so I definitely
don't<00:04:05.340> think<00:04:05.460> this<00:04:05.730> is<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:05.970> good<00:04:06.180> idea<00:04:06.270> the<00:04:06.480> way

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
don't think this is a good idea the way

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.730 
don't think this is a good idea the way
this<00:04:06.690> is<00:04:06.870> designed<00:04:06.960> here<00:04:07.320> and<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:07.530> way<00:04:07.620> the

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
this is designed here and the way the

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.330 
this is designed here and the way the
book<00:04:07.890> club<00:04:08.070> hits<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.490> to<00:04:08.640> that<00:04:09.530> so<00:04:10.530> that<00:04:11.250> was

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
book club hits it to that so that was

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.560 
book club hits it to that so that was
the<00:04:11.430> biggest<00:04:11.610> design<00:04:11.970> flaw<00:04:12.180> I<00:04:12.210> found<00:04:12.480> with

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
the biggest design flaw I found with

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.210 
the biggest design flaw I found with
this<00:04:12.750> everything<00:04:13.470> else<00:04:13.620> is<00:04:13.740> pretty<00:04:13.890> nice<00:04:14.070> so

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
this everything else is pretty nice so

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.530 
this everything else is pretty nice so
the<00:04:14.310> quality<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.730> craftsmanship<00:04:15.090> is<00:04:15.330> really

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
the quality the craftsmanship is really

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.000 
the quality the craftsmanship is really
good<00:04:15.690> know<00:04:16.260> if<00:04:16.410> there's<00:04:16.560> a<00:04:16.620> pretty<00:04:16.770> good<00:04:16.890> jump

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
good know if there's a pretty good jump

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.940 
good know if there's a pretty good jump
in<00:04:17.100> their<00:04:17.220> cases<00:04:18.350> like<00:04:19.350> I<00:04:19.410> said<00:04:19.560> a<00:04:19.590> boat<00:04:19.739> clip

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
in their cases like I said a boat clip

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.560 
in their cases like I said a boat clip
is<00:04:20.100> being<00:04:20.280> replaced<00:04:20.460> so<00:04:20.760> that's<00:04:20.940> not<00:04:21.060> even<00:04:21.510> an

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
is being replaced so that's not even an

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.660 
is being replaced so that's not even an
issue<00:04:21.690> right<00:04:21.989> now<00:04:22.050> so<00:04:22.830> not<00:04:23.010> too<00:04:23.160> bad<00:04:23.310> this<00:04:23.460> case

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
issue right now so not too bad this case

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.200 
issue right now so not too bad this case
we<00:04:23.820> tells<00:04:24.260> 4599<00:04:25.260> I<00:04:25.380> believe<00:04:25.680> $45<00:04:26.340> on<00:04:26.550> the

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
myself want to use my regular basis

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.960 
myself want to use my regular basis
besides<00:04:46.920> the<00:04:47.160> fact<00:04:47.280> that<00:04:47.400> there<00:04:47.550> is<00:04:47.580> no<00:04:47.730> screen

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
besides the fact that there is no screen

besides the fact that there is no screen
protection<00:04:48.270> but<00:04:48.540> that's<00:04:48.690> just<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:49.020> style<00:04:49.320> of

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
protection but that's just the style of

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.530 
protection but that's just the style of
the<00:04:49.560> case<00:04:49.710> so<00:04:49.950> but<00:04:50.670> i<00:04:50.970> have<00:04:51.120> a<00:04:51.150> really<00:04:51.420> big
