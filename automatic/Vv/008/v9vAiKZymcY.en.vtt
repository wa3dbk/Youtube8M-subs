00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.090

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:13.150
 wake up here so be here on 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.849
 top and ride with a breeze on here 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.860
 or sports wolves for example yes from 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.259
 here the original model is probably only 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.270
 body and chassis remained the rest 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.759
 elements were refined to achieve 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.279
 maximum acceleration and dynamics that 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:32.320
 The interior is even more interesting. 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:35.450
 here is the combat load of the nest 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:40.100
 I work with what standard 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.380
 engines 131 forces in this about 220 hectares 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.960
 that is, the mountain is straight without any problems 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.980
 no photo at all velvet under the city 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.290
 here is mean if you quit 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:55.760
 as opposed to the standard version 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:59.150
 if everything is done for more 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.309
 engine power stuffing pleased and 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.010
 it was all created by skillful hands 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.870
 the rider himself collected it himself on her and 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.040
 went to the most important thing in tuning 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.990
 domestic cars 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.840
 it's love for everything you do 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.720
 no other way we offer 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.670
 there is auto war they inside open it 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.979
 charms well I'm only for 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.410
 to get into the car you need to attach 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.660
 A lot of effort is still racing 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.450
 car and convenience here to anything he 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.399
 how many devices are there just like due 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.930
 the spaceship is actually here 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:34.759
 a minimum of appliances and hearts needed 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.930
 mechanical oil pressure sensor she 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.220
 tachometer 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.369
 coolant temperature 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.220
 light bulb 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.000
 motor control and here are the numbers that 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.710
 it means 1 place is 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.560
 electric part to the rest so 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.510
 car relyushki fuses all 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.580
 signed to 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.370
 and 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.990
 waiting for races quickly eliminate some 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.480
 the only question that is full of me 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.240
 worries nil here on the frames have to 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.270
 her two chairs sat on the chair here 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.840
 one sports car data 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.090
 provided for the pilot ie seat 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.780
 for the cord here is not provided as 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.280
 we are participating in auto coffee they lied 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.620
 accordingly, comfort is not only 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.570
 I have this sports Volga recently 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.100
 participated in the Siberian auto cruise 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.570
 federal district in which 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.300
 competed with professional racers 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.060
 from all over Russia and it just so happened that 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.950
 the winner was Alexander Well 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.900
 in a few minutes I'll start 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.350
 Try yourself in the role of navigator Well 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.060
 we start that Alexander tell how you 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.350
 how did you manage to win and in which 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.490
 races you participated stage 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.530
 All-Russian to 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:51.780
 competition is Siberian federal 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:55.360
 district means first stage 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.870
 the wolf was very interesting in principle 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.870
 interesting and the fact that it could begin 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.940
 say on dry ground and smoothly 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.520
 flowed 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.620
 slippery surface and tracks and where bu 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.990
 I will begin again personally intro to party shovel 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.880
 lancer well, we are not racing now 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.550
 track but check how it will behave 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.140
 Volga on a dirt road can for me 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.690
 Of course a separate place in the cabin 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.550
 will not be allocated therefore we will go to 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.550
 extremely sitting position 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.459
 feeling inexpressible powerful motor 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.080
 do our own thing and we hide behind 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.209
 horizon in seconds 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.180
 the only minus is eating this swallow 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:08.110
 how tractor liters fuel burn 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.110
 every second 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.489
 It was 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.110
 how many bullets to 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.110
 I 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.469
 neon 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.539
 mono 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.770

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.940
