00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240
 Hello everyone, Michael, today we are 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:11.700
 we will make a bat leagues length 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.299
 we will need a square sheet of paper and 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.500
 scissors for a start we need to do 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.460
 base double triangle shape do 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.460
 diagonal lines 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:48.290
 turn over and make folds 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.290
 in the middle 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.490
 then we get here so need 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:25.759
 to push 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.630
 from the bottom to the center so she bend the punch well 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.920
 next cruise 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:39.709
 we put it in a triangle like this 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:44.469
 It became so go further course scissors we take 

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:44.469
 and cut ears 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.980
 it is important that our arc 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.120
 which we just cut went like 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:13.870
 can be closer to the top point since 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:17.760
 when we bend our heads 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:23.140
 places the mouse should be like 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:27.250
 such is something like a neck and that's it 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:32.489
 for this you should make an incision like 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:38.440
 can be higher in the center to the upper corner 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:40.959
 Further similar wished further we take this 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.110
 line more precisely fold and attach to 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.110
 to myself 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.750
 same thing on the other hand 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:15.080
 Next, unfold the whole figure to 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:18.099
 it turned out so those should bend 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.099
 head to its place 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:36.970
 and you can still make it more prominent 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:44.349
 just like that click here block now 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:44.349
 bend legs like this 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.090
 analysis form a little body 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:10.040
 bend this corner kayu middle like this 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:24.920
 we finally form the wings first 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:34.000
 It is important not to be mistaken to bend this angle to 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:34.000
 this corner so it looked like this 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:56.350
 also with another circle from here to here 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:11.939
 further arch wings in the opposite direction 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:33.500
 just to get it on 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:33.500
 came in contact with this now again 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.850
 by the same principle 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:54.449
 now unfold the wings not 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:54.449
 unwrap these sides of the present and 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:06.460
 bend the last this side of this 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:08.880
 which will be barely noticeable but here's to 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.880
 this country 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:26.450
 now spread the wings a little bit 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.450
 we bend inward 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.890
 leg ready 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.780
 that's all thanks to everyone for watching 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.310
 good luck to all 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.270
