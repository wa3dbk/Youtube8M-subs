got another imperfection here I don't
know<00:02:35.010> if<00:02:35.100> that's<00:02:35.280> supposed<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.880> be<00:02:35.970> in<00:02:36.270> just

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
know if that's supposed to be in just

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.930 
know if that's supposed to be in just
like<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.540> circle<00:02:37.020> there<00:02:37.220> it's<00:02:38.220> literally<00:02:38.820> a

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
like a circle there it's literally a

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.760 
like a circle there it's literally a
circle<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.660> it's<00:02:39.780> just<00:02:40.200> coming<00:02:40.380> right<00:02:40.740> off

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
circle and it's just coming right off

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.070 
circle and it's just coming right off
and<00:02:41.190> then<00:02:41.310> I'm<00:02:41.490> not<00:02:41.520> even<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.210> finger<00:02:42.510> no<00:02:42.630> at<00:02:42.720> all

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
and then I'm not even a finger no at all

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.740 
and then I'm not even a finger no at all
I'm<00:02:43.440> just<00:02:43.650> using<00:02:43.860> my<00:02:44.070> finger<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:45.360> it's<00:02:45.510> just

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
I'm just using my finger and it's just

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.440 
I'm just using my finger and it's just
coming<00:02:45.900> off<00:02:46.200> so<00:02:47.060> that's<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.150> little<00:02:48.270> bit

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
coming off so that's a little bit

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.040 
coming off so that's a little bit
disappointing

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
disappointing

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.210 
disappointing
again<00:02:49.740> you<00:02:49.890> could<00:02:50.010> touch<00:02:50.190> that<00:02:50.220> up<00:02:50.840> but<00:02:52.220> the

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
again you could touch that up but the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.490 
again you could touch that up but the
paint<00:02:53.520> quality<00:02:54.090> as<00:02:54.240> far<00:02:54.270> as<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.810> finish<00:02:55.110> is

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
paint quality as far as the finish is

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.670 
paint quality as far as the finish is
very<00:02:55.800> very<00:02:56.310> nice<00:02:56.460> where's<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.540> other<00:02:57.750> some<00:02:58.650> of

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
very very nice where's the other some of

very very nice where's the other some of
those<00:02:58.800> other<00:02:59.010> ones<00:02:59.100> who<00:02:59.370> saw<00:02:59.610> was<00:02:59.880> not<00:03:00.200> doing

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
those other ones who saw was not doing

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.600 
those other ones who saw was not doing
the<00:03:01.290> mud<00:03:01.470> flaps<00:03:01.740> that<00:03:01.980> painting<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.340> black

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
the mud flaps that painting the black

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.420 
the mud flaps that painting the black
here<00:03:02.940> looks<00:03:03.900> pretty<00:03:03.930> cool<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.500> don't<00:03:05.040> know<00:03:05.130> what

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
here looks pretty cool I don't know what

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.490 
here looks pretty cool I don't know what
that<00:03:05.670> that's<00:03:06.180> just<00:03:06.390> an<00:03:06.540> imperfection<00:03:06.960> I<00:03:07.320> don't

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
that that's just an imperfection I don't

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.840 
that that's just an imperfection I don't
suppose<00:03:07.830> they're<00:03:08.040> supposed<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.310> be<00:03:08.460> some<00:03:08.640> kind

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
suppose they're supposed to be some kind

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.340 
suppose they're supposed to be some kind
of<00:03:08.880> Halfmoon<00:03:09.390> or<00:03:09.510> anything<00:03:09.720> on<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:09.930> back<00:03:10.170> of

a<00:03:18.090> pretty<00:03:18.239> heavy<00:03:18.450> way<00:03:18.690> it's<00:03:18.989> we'll<00:03:19.890> get<00:03:20.040> you

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
a pretty heavy way it's we'll get you

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.530 
a pretty heavy way it's we'll get you
all<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.280> ladders<00:03:20.730> here<00:03:20.970> you've<00:03:21.300> got<00:03:21.510> your

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
all the ladders here you've got your

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.570 
all the ladders here you've got your
your<00:03:22.140> exhaust<00:03:22.560> I'll<00:03:22.890> paint<00:03:23.130> it<00:03:23.340> up<00:03:23.600> fuel<00:03:24.600> cells

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
your exhaust I'll paint it up fuel cells

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.740 
your exhaust I'll paint it up fuel cells
pretty<00:03:26.580> neat<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:27.000> puts<00:03:27.270> it<00:03:27.360> up<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.630> goes

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
pretty neat and puts it up and goes

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.420 
pretty neat and puts it up and goes
pretty<00:03:27.900> fast<00:03:28.200> on<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.530> track<00:03:28.770> too

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.899 

so<00:03:33.349> what<00:03:34.349> we<00:03:34.500> learned<00:03:34.709> tonight<00:03:34.890> so<00:03:35.189> far<00:03:36.680> well

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
so what we learned tonight so far well

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.179 
so what we learned tonight so far well
that<00:03:39.049> you're<00:03:40.049> paying<00:03:40.290> more<00:03:40.590> a<00:03:40.620> lot<00:03:40.829> a<00:03:40.980> lot<00:03:41.129> more

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:41.189 
that you're paying more a lot a lot more

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:42.530 
that you're paying more a lot a lot more
for<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.519> reps<00:03:41.730> or<00:03:41.879> entertainments<00:03:42.420> but

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
for the reps or entertainments but

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.009 
for the reps or entertainments but
you're<00:03:42.750> not<00:03:42.840> really<00:03:43.019> getting<00:03:43.170> better<00:03:43.439> quality

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
you're not really getting better quality

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.600 
you're not really getting better quality
at<00:03:46.019> least<00:03:46.290> not<00:03:46.439> in<00:03:46.470> this<00:03:46.620> patch<00:03:46.890> probably<00:03:47.459> the

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
at least not in this patch probably the

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.190 
at least not in this patch probably the
cooler<00:03:47.879> branches<00:03:48.390> they've<00:03:48.510> had<00:03:48.720> even<00:03:49.109> though

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
cooler branches they've had even though

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.050 
cooler branches they've had even though
I<00:03:49.230> don't<00:03:49.530> know<00:03:49.769> anything<00:03:50.340> about<00:03:50.459> BJ<00:03:50.909> in<00:03:50.970> the

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
I don't know anything about BJ in the

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.809 
I don't know anything about BJ in the
bear<00:03:51.239> I've<00:03:51.780> never<00:03:51.959> watched<00:03:52.170> Batman<00:03:52.819> it's

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
bear I've never watched Batman it's

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.089 
bear I've never watched Batman it's
probably<00:03:54.359> one<00:03:54.540> of<00:03:54.569> the<00:03:54.750> coolest<00:03:55.170> you<00:03:56.010> know

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
probably one of the coolest you know

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.190 
probably one of the coolest you know
overall<00:03:56.609> there's<00:03:56.909> not<00:03:57.090> really<00:03:57.329> any<00:03:57.569> duds<00:03:57.989> at

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
overall there's not really any duds at

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.970 
overall there's not really any duds at
it<00:03:58.290> per<00:03:58.470> se<00:03:59.000> but<00:04:00.109> as<00:04:01.109> you<00:04:01.230> can<00:04:01.379> see<00:04:01.560> it's<00:04:01.769> also

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
it per se but as you can see it's also

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.679 
it per se but as you can see it's also
the<00:04:02.220> worst<00:04:02.370> quality<00:04:02.849> that<00:04:03.000> I've<00:04:03.150> seen<00:04:03.420> so<00:04:03.659> far
