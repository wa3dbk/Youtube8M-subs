00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
back which is my belt tensioner and it's

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.580 
back which is my belt tensioner and it's
attached<00:03:03.940> to<00:03:04.239> this<00:03:04.540> spring<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.260> when<00:03:05.409> that

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
attached to this spring so when that

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.020 
attached to this spring so when that
that<00:03:06.129> bottom<00:03:06.909> brake<00:03:07.900> cable<00:03:08.799> tightens<00:03:09.400> the

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
that bottom brake cable tightens the

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.210 
that bottom brake cable tightens the
spring<00:03:10.420> will<00:03:10.569> give<00:03:10.720> some<00:03:10.959> leeway<00:03:11.170> right<00:03:12.040> now

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
spring will give some leeway right now

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.780 
spring will give some leeway right now
it's<00:03:12.489> in<00:03:13.230> locked<00:03:14.230> mode<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:15.190> this<00:03:15.310> will<00:03:15.579> not

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
it's in locked mode and this will not

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.509 
it's in locked mode and this will not
turn<00:03:16.060> it's<00:03:16.989> protected<00:03:17.620> so<00:03:18.010> we<00:03:18.160> don't<00:03:18.340> have<00:03:18.489> a

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
turn it's protected so we don't have a

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.390 
turn it's protected so we don't have a
problem<00:03:18.970> with<00:03:19.090> it<00:03:19.739> catching<00:03:20.739> our<00:03:20.859> fingers<00:03:21.220> in

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
problem with it catching our fingers in

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.240 
problem with it catching our fingers in
it<00:03:21.430> or<00:03:21.669> anything<00:03:21.910> so<00:03:22.870> it<00:03:23.049> locks<00:03:23.349> and<00:03:23.709> it

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
it or anything so it locks and it

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.190 
it or anything so it locks and it
disengages<00:03:24.579> the<00:03:24.970> belt<00:03:25.239> off<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.540> main<00:03:25.870> drive

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
disengages the belt off the main drive

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.750 
disengages the belt off the main drive
now<00:03:27.099> if<00:03:27.400> I<00:03:27.549> release<00:03:28.389> this<00:03:28.690> and<00:03:29.019> pull<00:03:29.319> it<00:03:29.440> back

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
now if I release this and pull it back

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.610 
now if I release this and pull it back
as<00:03:30.760> you<00:03:30.970> can<00:03:31.120> see<00:03:31.269> the<00:03:31.480> belt<00:03:31.660> tightens<00:03:32.139> up<00:03:32.319> on

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
as you can see the belt tightens up on

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.520 
as you can see the belt tightens up on
the<00:03:32.709> tensioner<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:34.209> brake<00:03:34.450> lets<00:03:34.750> loose<00:03:35.079> and

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
the tensioner the brake lets loose and

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.960 
the tensioner the brake lets loose and
she's<00:03:36.250> ready<00:03:36.519> to<00:03:36.669> go

actually sifts the dirt I've already put
it<00:05:42.930> to<00:05:43.050> the<00:05:43.169> test<00:05:43.200> when<00:05:43.710> the<00:05:43.800> ground<00:05:43.950> was<00:05:44.160> dry

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
it to the test when the ground was dry

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.720 
it to the test when the ground was dry
and<00:05:44.880> it<00:05:45.480> worked<00:05:45.660> very<00:05:45.780> well<00:05:46.080> so<00:05:46.800> I<00:05:47.100> don't<00:05:47.520> think

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
and it worked very well so I don't think

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.250 
and it worked very well so I don't think
I'll<00:05:47.910> have<00:05:47.940> much<00:05:48.240> problem<00:05:48.630> with<00:05:48.660> it<00:05:48.840> working

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
I'll have much problem with it working

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.590 
I'll have much problem with it working
but<00:05:49.500> like<00:05:50.160> I<00:05:50.250> say<00:05:50.460> everyone<00:05:51.090> wanted<00:05:51.450> to<00:05:51.510> see

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
but like I say everyone wanted to see

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.890 
but like I say everyone wanted to see
this<00:05:52.020> how<00:05:52.680> it's<00:05:52.919> going<00:05:53.100> to<00:05:53.160> function<00:05:53.510> so<00:05:54.510> this

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
this how it's going to function so this

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.170 
this how it's going to function so this
