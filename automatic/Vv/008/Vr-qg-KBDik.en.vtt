so<00:00:00.510> here<00:00:00.750> is<00:00:00.900> my<00:00:00.930> fancy<00:00:01.680> dancy<00:00:02.010> fuel<00:00:02.340> system

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:03.259 
so here is my fancy dancy fuel system

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:07.130 
so here is my fancy dancy fuel system
was<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:04.440> Montecarlo<00:00:05.480> we're<00:00:06.480> gonna<00:00:06.629> have<00:00:06.870> some

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
was the Montecarlo we're gonna have some

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.930 
was the Montecarlo we're gonna have some
kind<00:00:07.290> of<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.410> cap<00:00:07.620> on<00:00:07.830> here<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.040> keep<00:00:08.189> fuel<00:00:08.760> from

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
kind of a cap on here to keep fuel from

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.150 
kind of a cap on here to keep fuel from
splashing<00:00:09.420> out<00:00:09.570> but<00:00:09.780> we<00:00:09.870> can<00:00:10.019> put<00:00:10.200> about<00:00:10.380> half

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
splashing out but we can put about half

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.789 
splashing out but we can put about half
a<00:00:11.309> gallon<00:00:11.429> of<00:00:11.639> fuel<00:00:11.670> in<00:00:11.969> there<00:00:12.410> we've<00:00:13.410> secured

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
a gallon of fuel in there we've secured

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.499 
a gallon of fuel in there we've secured
the<00:00:13.830> fuel<00:00:14.190> filter<00:00:14.549> over<00:00:14.759> here<00:00:14.969> so<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.269> doesn't

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
the fuel filter over here so it doesn't

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.160 
the fuel filter over here so it doesn't
get<00:00:15.570> tangled<00:00:15.929> up<00:00:15.960> in<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.170> fan<00:00:17.869> and<00:00:18.869> then<00:00:19.050> we

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
get tangled up in the fan and then we

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.480 
get tangled up in the fan and then we
should<00:00:19.410> be<00:00:19.529> good<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.800> go<00:00:19.830> for<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.250> ride<00:00:22.490> first

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
I drove it little change in plans we had

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.300 
I drove it little change in plans we had
over<00:04:20.989> a<00:04:21.019> third<00:04:21.290> of<00:04:21.380> a<00:04:21.470> gallon<00:04:21.799> almost<00:04:22.070> a<00:04:22.160> half

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
drink a lot of gas because it started

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.210 
drink a lot of gas because it started
running<00:04:30.110> strange<00:04:30.560> so<00:04:30.800> we<00:04:30.890> turned<00:04:31.100> around

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
running strange so we turned around

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.950 
running strange so we turned around
gonna<00:04:32.060> adjust<00:04:32.330> the<00:04:32.480> time<00:04:32.660> without<00:04:32.900> the

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
distributor was loose

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.040 
distributor was loose
so<00:04:34.700> when<00:04:35.030> tighten<00:04:35.330> up<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.480> distributor<00:04:35.930> and<00:04:36.020> I

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
so when tighten up the distributor and I

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.360 
so when tighten up the distributor and I
thought<00:04:36.230> better<00:04:36.410> check<00:04:36.680> the<00:04:36.800> fuel<00:04:37.040> and<00:04:37.220> make

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
thought better check the fuel and make

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.710 
thought better check the fuel and make
sure<00:04:37.550> that's<00:04:37.730> not<00:04:37.940> leaking<00:04:38.300> or<00:04:38.390> anything

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
sure that's not leaking or anything

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.020 
sure that's not leaking or anything
there<00:04:39.320> was<00:04:39.440> none<00:04:39.680> left<00:04:39.710> in<00:04:40.040> the<00:04:40.100> tank<00:04:40.670> it<00:04:40.910> was

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
there was none left in the tank it was

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.690 
there was none left in the tank it was
actually<00:04:41.450> out<00:04:41.600> of<00:04:41.630> fuel<00:04:41.960> so<00:04:42.800> we're<00:04:43.370> gonna<00:04:43.460> just

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
actually out of fuel so we're gonna just

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.610 
actually out of fuel so we're gonna just
hold<00:04:43.820> off<00:04:44.000> on<00:04:44.060> doing<00:04:44.660> any<00:04:44.990> additional<00:04:45.380> test

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
hold off on doing any additional test

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.110 
hold off on doing any additional test
driving<00:04:45.890> until<00:04:46.190> we<00:04:46.250> replace<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:46.640> fuel<00:04:46.880> tank

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
driving until we replace the fuel tank

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.970 
driving until we replace the fuel tank
with<00:04:47.840> a<00:04:47.870> new<00:04:48.050> one<00:04:48.230> so<00:04:48.470> it<00:04:48.590> doesn't<00:04:48.800> have<00:04:48.920> a

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
with a new one so it doesn't have a

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.280 
with a new one so it doesn't have a
little<00:04:49.100> fuel<00:04:49.870> meanwhile<00:04:50.870> we're<00:04:51.020> gonna<00:04:51.110> load

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
little fuel meanwhile we're gonna load

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.530 
little fuel meanwhile we're gonna load
it<00:04:51.380> up<00:04:51.470> in<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:51.620> car<00:04:51.830> trailer<00:04:52.150> because<00:04:53.150> it'll

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
it up in the car trailer because it'll

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.850 
it up in the car trailer because it'll
be<00:04:53.600> easier<00:04:53.870> to<00:04:53.990> get<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.170> tank<00:04:54.440> with<00:04:54.740> it

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
be easier to get the tank with it

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.520 
be easier to get the tank with it

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:22.040 
thing balanced from the trailer to where

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.700 
thing balanced from the trailer to where
there's<00:06:22.510> basically<00:06:23.510> very<00:06:24.170> little<00:06:24.230> tongue

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.060 
there's basically very little tongue
weight<00:06:24.890> because<00:06:25.280> this<00:06:25.610> piece<00:06:25.880> of<00:06:26.030> crap<00:06:26.270> some

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070 
weight because this piece of crap some

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.920

minimal<00:06:35.300> tongue<00:06:35.510> weight<00:06:36.250> basically<00:06:37.250> as<00:06:38.060> you

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 
minimal tongue weight basically as you

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.120 
minimal tongue weight basically as you
can<00:06:38.240> see<00:06:38.390> how<00:06:38.450> we<00:06:38.510> have<00:06:38.750> it<00:06:38.870> here<00:06:39.020> the<00:06:39.830> fuel

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130
