00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.510 

without<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.329> toolbox<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.980> proper<00:00:47.280> tools

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.169 

so<00:02:06.630> next<00:02:07.020> number<00:02:07.470> five<00:02:07.710> six<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.700> seven<00:02:08.759> you're

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
so next number five six and seven you're

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.430 
so next number five six and seven you're
going<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.420> need<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:10.259> proper<00:02:10.619> axles<00:02:12.350> for<00:02:13.350> the

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
most part the data 30 axle is going to

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.270 
most part the data 30 axle is going to

bumper that has a winch mounting plate

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.170 
bumper that has a winch mounting plate
so<00:03:22.890> that<00:03:23.070> you<00:03:23.160> can<00:03:23.310> put<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.489> winch<00:03:23.730> on<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.060> if

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
so that you can put a winch on it if

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.840 
so that you can put a winch on it if
you're<00:03:24.329> going<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.540> do<00:03:24.690> that<00:03:24.840> later<00:03:25.110> on<00:03:25.850> so

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
you're going to do that later on so

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.150 
you're going to do that later on so
after<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.269> get<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.570> front<00:03:27.780> bumper<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.410> your

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
after you get the front bumper and your

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.770 
after you get the front bumper and your
winch<00:03:29.400> then<00:03:29.820> it's<00:03:29.970> time<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.269> start<00:03:30.450> thinking

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
winch then it's time to start thinking

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.190 
winch then it's time to start thinking
