if you're taking a picture of a

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.389 
if you're taking a picture of a
landscape<00:00:04.690> setting<00:00:05.380> up<00:00:05.650> your<00:00:05.770> camera<00:00:06.220> is

landscape setting up your camera is

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:09.240 
landscape setting up your camera is
really<00:00:07.150> quite<00:00:07.420> simple<00:00:07.870> the<00:00:08.799> only<00:00:08.830> thing<00:00:09.160> you

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.250 
really quite simple the only thing you

really quite simple the only thing you
want<00:00:09.430> to<00:00:09.490> keep<00:00:09.639> in<00:00:09.820> mind<00:00:09.850> when<00:00:10.299> taking

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:10.600 
want to keep in mind when taking

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.590 
want to keep in mind when taking
pictures<00:00:10.900> of<00:00:11.020> landscapes<00:00:11.230> is<00:00:11.860> having<00:00:12.850> a<00:00:13.059> long

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:13.600 
pictures of landscapes is having a long

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.140 
pictures of landscapes is having a long
depth<00:00:14.080> of<00:00:14.260> field<00:00:14.500> to<00:00:14.740> have<00:00:15.400> everything<00:00:15.850> in

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
depth of field to have everything in

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.600 
depth of field to have everything in
focus<00:00:16.420> so<00:00:16.900> there<00:00:17.890> are<00:00:17.980> a<00:00:18.039> couple<00:00:18.190> ways<00:00:18.460> of

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:18.610 
focus so there are a couple ways of

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.520 
focus so there are a couple ways of
doing<00:00:18.760> this

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:19.530 
doing this

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.280 
doing this
turn<00:00:20.530> your<00:00:20.680> mode<00:00:20.950> dial<00:00:21.220> to<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:22.390> landscape

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.290 
turn your mode dial to the landscape

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.520 
turn your mode dial to the landscape
scene<00:00:23.650> mode<00:00:23.920> right<00:00:24.160> here<00:00:24.490> and<00:00:25.050> what<00:00:26.050> that<00:00:26.230> does

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:26.530 
scene mode right here and what that does

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.610 
scene mode right here and what that does
is<00:00:27.030> allow<00:00:28.030> you<00:00:28.060> to<00:00:28.210> choose<00:00:28.510> between<00:00:28.900> a<00:00:29.350> few

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:29.620 
is allow you to choose between a few

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.740 
is allow you to choose between a few
different<00:00:30.010> landscape<00:00:30.430> options<00:00:30.970> the

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
different landscape options the

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.720 
different landscape options the
difference<00:00:32.110> for<00:00:32.289> example<00:00:32.320> between<00:00:33.219> normal

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
difference for example between normal

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.919 
difference for example between normal
and<00:00:34.499> nature<00:00:35.499> is<00:00:35.710> the<00:00:36.670> color<00:00:37.059> algorithms<00:00:37.749> that

00:00:37.919 --> 00:00:37.929 
and nature is the color algorithms that

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:40.079 
and nature is the color algorithms that
the<00:00:38.050> camera<00:00:38.409> is<00:00:38.469> using<00:00:38.890> to<00:00:39.429> generate<00:00:39.730> the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:40.089 
the camera is using to generate the

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:42.840 
the camera is using to generate the
color<00:00:40.329> in<00:00:40.539> the<00:00:40.690> scene<00:00:40.929> with<00:00:41.769> nature<00:00:42.339> there<00:00:42.699> is

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
color in the scene with nature there is

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.689 
color in the scene with nature there is
more<00:00:43.089> emphasis<00:00:43.569> put<00:00:44.260> on<00:00:44.319> greens<00:00:44.920> and<00:00:45.159> blues<00:00:45.399> in

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
more emphasis put on greens and blues in

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.579

properly exposed the only problem with
the<00:01:36.820> automated<00:01:37.420> scenes<00:01:37.780> is<00:01:38.140> that<00:01:38.610> ISO<00:01:39.610> and

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
the automated scenes is that ISO and

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.840 
the automated scenes is that ISO and
white<00:01:40.270> balance<00:01:40.690> are<00:01:40.900> automated<00:01:41.650> for<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.610> most

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
white balance are automated for the most

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.250 
white balance are automated for the most
part<00:01:43.210> it's<00:01:43.480> okay

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
part it's okay

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.950 
part it's okay
white<00:01:44.980> balance<00:01:45.190> set<00:01:45.610> to<00:01:45.700> automatic<00:01:46.300> outdoors

white balance set to automatic outdoors

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.740 
white balance set to automatic outdoors
is<00:01:47.260> really<00:01:47.980> just<00:01:48.400> fine<00:01:48.700> you<00:01:49.330> will<00:01:49.510> get<00:01:49.720> a

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
is really just fine you will get a

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.870 
is really just fine you will get a
little<00:01:50.020> bit<00:01:50.140> better<00:01:50.290> color<00:01:50.620> however<00:01:51.250> if<00:01:51.700> you

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
little bit better color however if you

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.450 
little bit better color however if you
set<00:01:52.150> that<00:01:52.330> to<00:01:52.720> daylight<00:01:53.170> so<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.070> other<00:01:54.220> thing

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
set that to daylight so the other thing

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.140 
set that to daylight so the other thing
you<00:01:54.550> can<00:01:54.730> do<00:01:54.970> instead<00:01:55.630> is<00:01:55.900> choose<00:01:56.620> a<00:01:57.010> from<00:01:57.940> your

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
you can do instead is choose a from your

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.540 
you can do instead is choose a from your
mode<00:01:58.330> dial<00:01:58.360> just<00:01:58.870> turn<00:01:59.260> your<00:01:59.440> mode<00:01:59.620> dial<00:01:59.830> to<00:01:59.980> a

mode dial just turn your mode dial to a
this<00:02:01.420> stands<00:02:01.750> for<00:02:01.870> aperture<00:02:02.710> and<00:02:02.920> what<00:02:03.730> this

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
this stands for aperture and what this

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.630 
this stands for aperture and what this
allows<00:02:04.210> you<00:02:04.420> to<00:02:04.510> do

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
allows you to do

is okay but not great so I will change
the<00:02:46.080> aperture<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.590> little<00:02:47.010> bit<00:02:47.160> more<00:02:47.810> I'll<00:02:48.810> go

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
the aperture a little bit more I'll go

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.030 
the aperture a little bit more I'll go
to<00:02:49.400> f11<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.820> now<00:02:51.180> my<00:02:51.660> shutter<00:02:51.930> speed<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.440> one

to f11 and now my shutter speed is one

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.430 
to f11 and now my shutter speed is one
sixtieth<00:02:53.550> of<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.760> second<00:02:54.150> which<00:02:54.750> can<00:02:54.959> easily<00:02:55.170> be

sixtieth of a second which can easily be

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.070 
sixtieth of a second which can easily be
handheld<00:02:56.390> especially<00:02:57.390> considering<00:02:57.930> I'm
