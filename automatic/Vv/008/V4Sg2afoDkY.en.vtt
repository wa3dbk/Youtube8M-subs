00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
that have been announced so far in Halo

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.730 
that have been announced so far in Halo
4<00:00:23.760> at<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.240> point<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.570> think<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:25.050> all<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.350> the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740

4 at this point I think it is all of the
weapons<00:00:26.189> but<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.789> guess<00:00:27.060> here<00:00:27.240> we'll<00:00:27.420> just<00:00:27.570> have

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689

for anyone who doesn't know so we now
have<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> new<00:00:56.760> weapon<00:00:56.969> known<00:00:57.300> as<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.570> saw<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.469> is

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
have a new weapon known as the saw it is

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.709 
have a new weapon known as the saw it is
kind<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.280> like<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> light<00:00:59.699> machine<00:00:59.910> gun<00:01:00.420> but<00:01:00.629> it

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
kind of like a light machine gun but it

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.799 
kind of like a light machine gun but it
shoots<00:01:01.020> really<00:01:01.440> fast<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.570> basically<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.690> have

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
shoots really fast so basically you have

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.890 
shoots really fast so basically you have
a<00:01:03.840> lot<00:01:04.049> more<00:01:04.110> ammo<00:01:04.619> but<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.640> much<00:01:05.900> much

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
a lot more ammo but it's a much much

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.420 
a lot more ammo but it's a much much
faster<00:01:07.140> rate<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.530> fire<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.070> you'll<00:01:08.220> go<00:01:08.400> through

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
faster rate of fire so you'll go through

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.399 
faster rate of fire so you'll go through
that<00:01:08.700> ammo<00:01:08.909> really<00:01:09.510> fast<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:09.990> it's<00:01:10.140> not<00:01:10.229> gonna

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
that ammo really fast so it's not gonna

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.530 
that ammo really fast so it's not gonna
be<00:01:10.530> something<00:01:10.710> that's<00:01:10.979> overly<00:01:11.760> powerful<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
be something that's overly powerful the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.630 
be something that's overly powerful the
bullet<00:01:13.020> wise<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.010> could<00:01:14.369> have<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
bullet wise but you could have the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.830 
bullet wise but you could have the
ability<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.180> able<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.360> kill<00:01:15.600> more<00:01:15.810> enemies

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
ability to be able to kill more enemies

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.530 
ability to be able to kill more enemies
there<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.009> sticky<00:01:17.460> detonator<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.270> Halo

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
there is the sticky detonator it is Halo

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.620 
there is the sticky detonator it is Halo
4<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> answer<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:20.180> looks<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.299> wooden<00:01:21.479> thing

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
4 the answer to the looks a wooden thing

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.810 
4 the answer to the looks a wooden thing
of<00:01:21.750> knabe<00:01:22.140> launcher<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.860> there<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.340> also<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
of knabe launcher and there is also the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.969 
of knabe launcher and there is also the
railgun<00:01:24.150> which<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.049> guess<00:01:25.830> kind<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.520> like<00:01:26.670> a

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
railgun which is I guess kind of like a

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.580 
railgun which is I guess kind of like a
weaker<00:01:28.979> more<00:01:29.600> every<00:01:30.600> scenario<00:01:30.990> friendly

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
weaker more every scenario friendly

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.319 
weaker more every scenario friendly
version<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.189> Spartan<00:01:32.670> laser<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.240> is

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
version of the Spartan laser so it is

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.749 
version of the Spartan laser so it is
another<00:01:33.600> charge<00:01:33.960> up<00:01:34.229> gun<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.829> but<00:01:35.490> it's<00:01:35.640> not

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
another charge up gun and but it's not

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.340 
another charge up gun and but it's not
as<00:01:35.939> powerful<00:01:36.270> as<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.600> Spartan<00:01:36.990> laser<00:01:37.049> it's

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
as powerful as the Spartan laser it's

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.870 
as powerful as the Spartan laser it's
mainly<00:01:37.560> used<00:01:37.740> for<00:01:38.280> something<00:01:38.549> where<00:01:38.790> you're

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
mainly used for something where you're

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.490 
mainly used for something where you're
gonna<00:01:38.970> like<00:01:39.420> if<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.600> want<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.840> blow<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.020> vehicle

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
gonna like if you want to blow a vehicle

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.289 
gonna like if you want to blow a vehicle
out<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.799> way<00:01:40.950> beer<00:01:41.729> that's<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.119> railgun

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
out of the way beer that's the railgun

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.450 
out of the way beer that's the railgun
so<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.720> was<00:01:42.840> real<00:01:43.049> quite<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.439> while<00:01:43.710> back<00:01:43.950> now

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
so that was real quite a while back now

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.560 
description because a lot of the
information<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.460> have<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.759> find<00:02:00.060> out<00:02:00.270> from

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
information I have I find out from

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.569 
information I have I find out from
ducain<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.200> but<00:02:01.950> he<00:02:02.040> was<00:02:02.219> saying<00:02:02.369> it's

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
ducain and but he was saying it's

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.100 
ducain and but he was saying it's
similar<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:03.030> plasma<00:02:03.540> pistol<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:04.049> it

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
similar to a plasma pistol and it

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.499 
similar to a plasma pistol and it
charges<00:02:04.619> up<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.490> can<00:02:05.909> shoot<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.390> it

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
charges up so you can shoot and it

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.270 
charges up so you can shoot and it
charges<00:02:06.960> as<00:02:07.110> well<00:02:07.140> same<00:02:07.710> as<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.860> plasma<00:02:08.250> pistol

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
charges as well same as a plasma pistol

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.309 
charges as well same as a plasma pistol
would<00:02:08.640> but<00:02:09.420> apparently<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.869> don't<00:02:10.200> actually

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
would but apparently you don't actually

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.140 
would but apparently you don't actually
have<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.739> control<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.129> when<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.640> charge<00:02:11.910> shot

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
have the control of when the charge shot

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.610 
have the control of when the charge shot
is<00:02:12.270> launched<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:12.870> can<00:02:13.020> be<00:02:13.110> using<00:02:13.470> it

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
is launched so you can be using it

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.350 
is launched so you can be using it
shooting<00:02:14.040> but<00:02:14.250> if<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:14.549> charged<00:02:14.940> up<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.269> it's

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
shooting but if it's charged up and it's

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.509 
shooting but if it's charged up and it's
ready<00:02:15.569> to<00:02:15.659> shoot<00:02:16.220> realistically<00:02:17.220> you've<00:02:17.340> just

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
ready to shoot realistically you've just

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:18.710 
ready to shoot realistically you've just
got<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.640> hope<00:02:17.849> you're<00:02:18.000> aiming<00:02:18.360> at<00:02:18.420> an<00:02:18.569> enemy

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
got to hope you're aiming at an enemy

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.080 
got to hope you're aiming at an enemy
because<00:02:19.110> it's<00:02:19.739> just<00:02:19.890> going<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.129> be<00:02:20.220> shot<00:02:20.909> and

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
because it's just going to be shot and

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.460 
because it's just going to be shot and
you're<00:02:21.269> gonna<00:02:21.390> waste<00:02:21.659> it

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
you're gonna waste it

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.800 
you're gonna waste it
next<00:02:23.010> what<00:02:23.129> the<00:02:23.159> binary<00:02:23.940> rifle<00:02:24.180> now<00:02:24.480> this<00:02:24.629> is

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
next what the binary rifle now this is

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.479 
next what the binary rifle now this is
the<00:02:24.989> sniper<00:02:25.379> rifles<00:02:25.799> there<00:02:25.980> will<00:02:26.099> be<00:02:26.129> three

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
the sniper rifles there will be three

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.240 
the sniper rifles there will be three
sniper<00:02:26.790> rifles<00:02:27.209> in<00:02:27.420> Halo<00:02:27.870> 4<00:02:27.900> it's<00:02:28.799> only<00:02:29.010> two

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
sniper rifles in Halo 4 it's only two

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.710 
sniper rifles in Halo 4 it's only two
shot<00:02:29.459> weapons<00:02:29.730> there's<00:02:29.940> only<00:02:30.030> two<00:02:30.269> shots<00:02:30.510> per

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
shot weapons there's only two shots per

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.720 
shot weapons there's only two shots per
clip<00:02:31.049> but<00:02:31.530> it's<00:02:31.650> more<00:02:31.890> powerful<00:02:31.950> than<00:02:32.579> a

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
clip but it's more powerful than a

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.729 
clip but it's more powerful than a
standard<00:02:33.150> sniper<00:02:33.480> rifle<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.079> you<00:02:34.590> know<00:02:34.680> you

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
standard sniper rifle so you know you

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.410 
standard sniper rifle so you know you
could<00:02:34.890> do<00:02:35.069> a<00:02:35.099> lot<00:02:35.400> more<00:02:35.459> work<00:02:35.940> if<00:02:36.239> you<00:02:36.390> know

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
could do a lot more work if you know

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.630 
could do a lot more work if you know
where<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:36.930> aim<00:02:37.049> the<00:02:37.379> shot<00:02:37.620> now<00:02:38.340> they've<00:02:38.489> got

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
where to aim the shot now they've got

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.699 
where to aim the shot now they've got
the<00:02:38.760> incineration<00:02:39.569> cannon<00:02:39.959> it<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.409> another

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
the incineration cannon it is another

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.250 
the incineration cannon it is another
power<00:02:41.010> weapon<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.640> is<00:02:41.930> really<00:02:42.930> similar<00:02:43.140> to

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
power weapon it is really similar to

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.809 
power weapon it is really similar to
things<00:02:43.530> like<00:02:43.650> em<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.129> the<00:02:44.220> rocket<00:02:44.519> launch<00:02:44.670> of

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
things like em and the rocket launch of

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.729 
things like em and the rocket launch of
the<00:02:44.879> few<00:02:45.090> rod<00:02:45.329> kind<00:02:45.959> of<00:02:46.019> like<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.349> flamethrower

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
the few rod kind of like a flamethrower

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.860 
the few rod kind of like a flamethrower
as<00:02:47.250> well<00:02:47.459> from<00:02:47.910> what<00:02:48.150> I've<00:02:48.269> heard<00:02:48.299> about<00:02:48.599> how

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
as well from what I've heard about how

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.869 
as well from what I've heard about how
the<00:02:48.930> actual<00:02:49.170> shots<00:02:49.620> are<00:02:49.859> but<00:02:50.700> with<00:02:50.790> the

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
the actual shots are but with the

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.220 
the actual shots are but with the
incineration<00:02:51.450> cannon<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:51.780> only<00:02:51.900> have<00:02:52.049> one

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
incineration cannon you only have one

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.289 
incineration cannon you only have one
shot<00:02:52.260> so<00:02:53.250> it's<00:02:53.400> not<00:02:53.519> like<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.700> rocket<00:02:54.030> launcher

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
shot so it's not like a rocket launcher

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.569 
shot so it's not like a rocket launcher
where<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.569> shoot<00:02:54.840> go<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.680> next<00:02:55.859> next

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
where you shoot go to the next next

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.580 
where you shoot go to the next next
brand<00:02:57.269> and<00:02:57.359> then<00:02:57.450> shoot<00:02:57.690> again<00:02:57.959> you've<00:02:58.349> got<00:02:58.379> a

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
brand and then shoot again you've got a

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.259 
brand and then shoot again you've got a
shoot<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.040> reload<00:02:59.459> before<00:02:59.609> you<00:02:59.849> can<00:02:59.970> get<00:03:00.090> any

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
shoot and reload before you can get any

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.149 
shoot and reload before you can get any
other<00:03:00.480> shots<00:03:00.810> out<00:03:01.079> we've<00:03:01.769> got<00:03:01.799> the<00:03:02.010> right

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
other shots out we've got the right

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.490 
other shots out we've got the right
light<00:03:02.819> rifle<00:03:03.000> as<00:03:03.209> you<00:03:03.359> all<00:03:03.510> know<00:03:03.690> revealed<00:03:04.079> in

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
light rifle as you all know revealed in

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.009 
light rifle as you all know revealed in
the<00:03:04.680> Halo<00:03:04.980> 4<00:03:05.250> demo<00:03:05.459> at<00:03:05.700> e3<00:03:05.849> now<00:03:06.510> this<00:03:06.659> is<00:03:06.840> kind

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
the Halo 4 demo at e3 now this is kind

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.619 
the Halo 4 demo at e3 now this is kind
of<00:03:07.079> a<00:03:07.170> mix<00:03:07.440> between<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.829> DMR<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:09.239> battle

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
of a mix between the DMR and a battle

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.690 
of a mix between the DMR and a battle
rifle<00:03:09.840> so<00:03:10.650> if<00:03:10.709> you're<00:03:10.859> shooting<00:03:11.040> from<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.549> hip

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
rifle so if you're shooting from the hip

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.640 
rifle so if you're shooting from the hip
like<00:03:11.970> you<00:03:12.120> would<00:03:12.239> normally<00:03:12.599> shoot<00:03:12.900> with<00:03:13.530> all

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
like you would normally shoot with all

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.979 
like you would normally shoot with all
weapons<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:14.489> is<00:03:14.790> just<00:03:15.269> a<00:03:15.359> standard<00:03:15.750> three

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
weapons it is just a standard three

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.509 
weapons it is just a standard three
burst<00:03:16.290> shot<00:03:16.530> too<00:03:16.709> similar<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.129> the<00:03:17.220> battle

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
burst shot too similar to the battle

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.920 
burst shot too similar to the battle
rifle<00:03:17.880> you<00:03:18.030> know<00:03:18.120> I'm<00:03:18.299> sure<00:03:18.359> you<00:03:18.630> could<00:03:18.810> do<00:03:18.900> a

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
rifle you know I'm sure you could do a

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.780 
rifle you know I'm sure you could do a
lot<00:03:19.139> of<00:03:19.200> work<00:03:19.470> if<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.739> get<00:03:19.859> shot<00:03:20.400> on<00:03:20.579> target

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
lot of work if you get shot on target

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.099 
lot of work if you get shot on target
but<00:03:21.180> it's<00:03:21.299> not<00:03:21.450> gonna<00:03:21.599> be<00:03:21.780> something<00:03:21.989> that's

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
but it's not gonna be something that's

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.039 
but it's not gonna be something that's
ridiculously<00:03:22.919> overpowered<00:03:23.569> however<00:03:24.569> if<00:03:24.840> you

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
ridiculously overpowered however if you

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.229 
ridiculously overpowered however if you
scope<00:03:25.470> in<00:03:25.709> so<00:03:26.010> if<00:03:26.099> you<00:03:26.130> look<00:03:26.400> down<00:03:26.609> the<00:03:26.849> side<00:03:27.060> so

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
scope in so if you look down the side so

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.940 
scope in so if you look down the side so
similar<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.630> like<00:03:27.720> how<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:27.930> shoot<00:03:28.260> with<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.470> DMR

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
similar to like how you shoot with a DMR

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.879 
similar to like how you shoot with a DMR
it's<00:03:29.669> actually<00:03:30.000> a<00:03:30.090> much<00:03:30.480> more<00:03:30.840> powerful<00:03:31.169> one

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
it's actually a much more powerful one

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.250 
it's actually a much more powerful one
shot<00:03:32.220> so<00:03:32.459> I<00:03:33.090> think<00:03:33.599> they're<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:33.930> little<00:03:34.049> bit

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
shot so I think they're a little bit

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.869 
shot so I think they're a little bit
more<00:03:34.410> powerful<00:03:34.709> than<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.010> dino<00:03:35.250> my<00:03:35.430> short<00:03:35.760> as

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
more powerful than a dino my short as

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.520 
more powerful than a dino my short as
well<00:03:36.030> so<00:03:36.450> if<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:36.660> zoom<00:03:36.690> in<00:03:37.049> although<00:03:37.349> you're

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
well so if you zoom in although you're

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.930 
well so if you zoom in although you're
only<00:03:37.620> gonna<00:03:37.799> be<00:03:37.889> shootin<00:03:38.310> one<00:03:38.459> board<00:03:38.700> at<00:03:38.819> a

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
only gonna be shootin one board at a

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.699 
only gonna be shootin one board at a
time<00:03:39.209> you<00:03:39.660> couldn't<00:03:39.930> get<00:03:40.019> a<00:03:40.049> lot<00:03:40.230> more<00:03:40.260> power

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
time you couldn't get a lot more power

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.589 
time you couldn't get a lot more power
behind<00:03:40.889> those<00:03:41.280> bullets<00:03:41.669> now<00:03:42.299> this<00:03:42.449> is<00:03:42.510> a

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
behind those bullets now this is a

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.119 
behind those bullets now this is a
scanner<00:03:42.870> shot<00:03:43.079> as<00:03:43.230> everyone<00:03:43.530> knows<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:44.069> loves

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
scanner shot as everyone knows and loves

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.300 
scanner shot as everyone knows and loves
so<00:03:44.579> far<00:03:44.970> it<00:03:45.359> is<00:03:45.419> the<00:03:45.780> Promethean<00:03:46.650> shotgun<00:03:47.160> and

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
so far it is the Promethean shotgun and

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.800 
so far it is the Promethean shotgun and
it<00:03:47.400> does<00:03:47.519> have<00:03:47.699> a<00:03:47.730> ricocheted<00:03:48.209> ability<00:03:48.690> as

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
it does have a ricocheted ability as

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.420 
it does have a ricocheted ability as
well<00:03:49.019> so<00:03:49.470> all<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.739> bullets<00:03:49.980> can<00:03:50.099> be<00:03:50.190> cached

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
well so all the bullets can be cached

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.500 
well so all the bullets can be cached
off<00:03:50.579> walls<00:03:50.790> if<00:03:50.970> you<00:03:51.060> want<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.239> shoot<00:03:51.389> around

how<00:04:08.879> much<00:04:09.120> power<00:04:09.389> it<00:04:09.540> does<00:04:09.720> but<00:04:09.989> generally<00:04:10.319> it

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
how much power it does but generally it

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.960 
how much power it does but generally it
slows<00:04:10.769> down<00:04:10.799> vehicles<00:04:11.430> so<00:04:11.549> it's<00:04:11.669> gonna<00:04:11.790> be

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
slows down vehicles so it's gonna be

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.520 
slows down vehicles so it's gonna be
something<00:04:12.269> that<00:04:12.299> will<00:04:12.510> have<00:04:12.989> some<00:04:13.230> sort<00:04:13.470> of

details have been revealed at this point

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:46.750 
details have been revealed at this point
so<00:05:45.919> I<00:05:45.949> don't<00:05:46.220> know<00:05:46.310> if<00:05:46.400> they're<00:05:46.520> gonna<00:05:46.639> be

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
so I don't know if they're gonna be

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.839 
so I don't know if they're gonna be
campaign<00:05:47.360> oh<00:05:47.510> sorry<00:05:48.320> campaign<00:05:48.740> only<00:05:48.979> or<00:05:49.340> if

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:49.849 
campaign oh sorry campaign only or if

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.430 
campaign oh sorry campaign only or if
they'll<00:05:50.030> even<00:05:50.060> be<00:05:50.300> player<00:05:50.690> controller<00:05:51.199> bull

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
they'll even be player controller bull

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.899 
they'll even be player controller bull
we<00:05:51.560> may<00:05:51.710> not<00:05:51.860> be<00:05:52.010> able<00:05:52.130> to<00:05:52.220> use<00:05:52.460> them<00:05:52.610> at<00:05:52.729> all

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:52.909 
we may not be able to use them at all

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:54.670 
we may not be able to use them at all
but<00:05:53.389> I'm<00:05:53.479> thinking<00:05:53.780> the<00:05:53.870> mammoths<00:05:54.259> may<00:05:54.470> work

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
but I'm thinking the mammoths may work

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.939 
but I'm thinking the mammoths may work
similar<00:05:55.159> to<00:05:55.190> like<00:05:55.820> how<00:05:56.000> the<00:05:56.060> elephant<00:05:56.690> did<00:05:56.949> in

00:05:57.939 --> 00:05:57.949 
similar to like how the elephant did in

00:05:57.949 --> 00:05:59.890 
similar to like how the elephant did in
sandbox<00:05:58.310> that<00:05:58.699> would<00:05:58.789> be<00:05:58.880> really<00:05:59.120> cool<00:05:59.330> as<00:05:59.509> for

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
sandbox that would be really cool as for

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.600 
sandbox that would be really cool as for
the<00:05:59.990> Cyclops<00:06:00.409> I<00:06:00.830> don't<00:06:01.039> think<00:06:01.220> we're<00:06:01.340> gonna<00:06:01.400> be

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
the Cyclops I don't think we're gonna be

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.879 
the Cyclops I don't think we're gonna be
using<00:06:01.789> that<00:06:02.120> and<00:06:02.870> I<00:06:02.960> haven't<00:06:03.199> heard<00:06:03.530> anything

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:03.889
