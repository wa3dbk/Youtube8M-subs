00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hello everyone Bender and today we are 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.970
 we will deal with one enough 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.460
 funny thing namely we will 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.340
 find handed no small animals 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.130
 cut off whole pieces of them fry it 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.690
 meat and this early fun I'll tell you 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.690
 so let's start 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.870
 Well, something like this now let's you 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.510
 tell you how to do all these things we 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.110
 let's roast the cow now and let me 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.450
 teach 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.700
 you need to do the first thing you 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.360
 you need the main tool of blue 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.970
 Mystic 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.880
 namely the cleaver is a real cleaver and 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.620
 Kraft he follows whoever 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.930
 might think minecraft can be crafted 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.730
 cleaver something is required 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.130
 four iron ingots one stick 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.980
 lay out such a composition get 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.350
 the real meat cleaver further us 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.600
 need one more leg this is a knife 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.729
 sirloin but actually more like 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.250
 for sharpening but nonetheless crafting 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.320
 ration of two iron bars and one 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.780
 shelves next to us 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.119
 need a hook on which we will hang 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.960
 the very animal this hook I have here 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.260
 non-working 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.310
 and now I'll show you how to be beautiful 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.690
 real hook and for that to me 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.330
 will need to take this hook 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.310
 from creative mode and I already took this circle 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.930
 here I have it and let's 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.290
 look kraftitsya this hook 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.539
 of four iron ingots we get 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.090
 hook and the next items we need 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.369
 to skull skewer on which we will 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.100
 frying a skewer is spent very simply and 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.500
 the next thing is even 2 will have them 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.509
 slide this skewer legs and they 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.210
 crafting in the same way just from the sticks 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.220
 Well, now it's time to kill something 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.430
 the animal that you want to fry and 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.320
 let it be that cow come here come 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.720
 here the box we will kill you 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.240
 Butcher's knife is very, very long 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.550
 and it hurts so you better not even 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.050
 resist just die and and after all 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.660
 it will probably be easier 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.750
 voila now we killed the cows and for some reason 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.730
 we had unusual meat pieces of meat 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.620
 and the dead cow 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.720
 that is, we basically carry it now 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.150
 dead cow on its hump well or 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.370
 somehow so further we need to hang it 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.870
 on the hook if you want and hang on the circle 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.510
 for example i want 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.290
 and we just put the hook here somewhere 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.170
 here for example 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.760
 near iron but on any block principle 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.890
 can only be put on ice 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.590
 put on we just take this 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.810
 the cow and hang it uk upside down 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.790
 looks like this and 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.010
 it's funny enough i'll tell you 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.569
 further we will need to skin this 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.680
 the cow and for that just need 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.349
 that same 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.480
 sirloin we stalk we just come to 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.750
 and it and right-click on it 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.819
 thereby removing all her skin and eat 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.190
 You can then make different armor well or 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.349
 what does he need next now in there are two 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.629
 option to either remove it and start frying 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.260
 either cut it into pieces using here 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.030
 this knife 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.190
 if you cut it you just 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.280
 the meat will fall out which can be later 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.079
 fry in the oven but if you decide it 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.299
 take off and let me show you how it is 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.190
 working for this will not need yet 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.250
 one dead cow let's take 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.620
 from creative regime and hang in the same way 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.750
 and so this cow is hanging now 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.609
 we remove all skin from it and now we 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.629
 just hit it until 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.639
 she won't fall out 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.889
 she fell to us and now we can her 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.720
 quietly fry for that 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:55.019
 for this we need time 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.609
 those two coasters for our skewers 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.069
 lay them out like this and 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.410
 now we put this skewer but unfortunately 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.480
 it does not always work the first time 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.010
 need to choose exactly which stand 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.260
 sometimes you have to poke 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.870
 many many times but voila with us 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.150
 put this skewer over the fire 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.940
 next we need to put ours on it 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.459
 the cow we did it and now we need 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.620
 rotate rotate corolla because she 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.560
 can overcook and after some 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.630
 time the cow will fire on let's i 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.789
 Immediately rewind to this point not 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.580
 five seconds have passed and the cow is already 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:32.849
 ready and you can and calmly cut 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.490
 with a knife and we immediately get ready meat 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:37.500
 here is such a mod friends here 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.810
 Today I personally have this mod very much 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.060
 liked because you can cut 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.960
 kill shred and do a lot of things 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.000
 interesting 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.490
 I hope you get a divorce in the same way 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.820
 Like the conclusion I will say that for sure 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.400
 can also deal with pigs 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.200
 example or zombie yes friends can be here 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.220
 hang a zombie on a circle let's you 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.800
 show you how it looks 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.280
 yes it looks like the following 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.210
 way 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:04.280
 so do me zombie corpse zombie and voila he 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.620
 does not hang out because he needs more 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.050
 places so we have to hang our 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.240
 Hook a little higher take it where I have 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.240
 this cube so friends let me again 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.610
 take it from the creative mode from the side 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.730
 menus for this change here decide and 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:22.040
 where is this hook here is such a meat 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:25.190
 hook and let's hang it a little higher 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.890
 here and try to hang this for orbit 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.120
 well voila zombies are hung on a hook here 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.610
 such a funny moment 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.440
 unfortunately it is impossible to cut it but 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.790
 no less here such moments in this 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.740
 fashion is exactly the same can be done with 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:42.140
 family as I said before and even with 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.840
 chicken well, in principle, the process is not 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:47.900
 different absolutely nothing but on this one 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.850
 In principle, everything except that meat can 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.370
 spoil this moment to me very 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.620
 Liked by fashion if you keep long 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.440
 and meat in the chest then with time she 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.080
 may deteriorate and so that it does not 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.970
 spoiled you need to do 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.180
 special refrigerator yes yes exactly 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:07.040
 the refrigerator and this refrigerator is crafted 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.570
 as follows i will need ice 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.490
 honestly can not even imagine how I 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.620
 you need to drink straight 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.050
 iron is required i am an ordinary chest 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:18.050
 put it somewhere here and inside 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.450
 you can put all your meat which 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:23.330
 fire on not fire on in general this place 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:25.910
 to store meat and there she never 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.110
 spoil it everything will be ok well 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.150
 and so she can rot 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.100
 up to really can rot and rotten 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.920
 meat I'll tell you this is not very tasty 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:36.050
