00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:11.969
 and that's it and that's it, everything's beauty 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.849
 coming back here with another game play 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:19.820
 I'm here today with need for speed 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:26.160
 monster between taking it on the engine g 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:29.189
 again a gameplay in the g game engine 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.929
 very good very good device and wheel 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.280
 Calm down, no problem with you. 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.879
 can see the graphics there are beautiful 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.700
 honestly, it does not make any difference 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.700
 charts monex the four who go to 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.559
 g1 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.300
 in this game in real racing in times of 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.510
 so much difference 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.789
 modern combat here now I do not 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.860
 I noticed so much difference so in the meantime 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.960
 It has almost no practically 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.300
 same thing graph terms 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.510
 This is a game he is not much. 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.129
 heavy 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.010
 Although the graphics are beautiful, it does not 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.820
 It's a very heavy game. 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:13.280
 there you did a good job in this game ac 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.590
 beautiful milan 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:21.450
 you can see how the graphics 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:25.890
 car and the scenery is very 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.670
 beautiful and the game is not super 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.670
 heavy 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.880
 I already have a video of him on the channel. 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:47.159
 running on the nexus and if you want 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.030
 see if you have a graphic difference is just 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.030
 take a look at the ila 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.130
 I myself did not particularly notice 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.830
 A very good game. 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.060
 I particularly I really like the 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.229
 seriously for expedited 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.009
 I think few people should not like 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.009
 need for speed right? 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.820
 ran determined'll see if gives 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:28.000
 play more here than the video the video 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.770
 It does not get too short, I'm back here. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.020
 with one more run 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:38.050
 now the time rush to arrive at no 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:48.580
 end of the race with more time 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:51.730
 left to say these things that still 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.340
 take care of tutorial 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:03:15.300
 I did not play on my next until I believed 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:15.300
 a little advanced but look police 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.310
 the legendary police demonstrated yesterday 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:31.640
 but I do not play need for speed showed 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:35.360
 before pondering degree of in old ps2 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.360
 Do not know what's good, do not 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.960
 the commands are simpler at all 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.010
 complicated 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.330
 different from other animals you can 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.780
 control touching side of the screen in this 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:24.360
 here you only have the accelerometer and a 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.890
 steering wheel that stays on the side I do not 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.570
 I really liked the steering wheel. 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.190
 always use in the room will include 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.390
 fairly easy to control 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.490
 very good gameplay so there it is 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:38.100
 we left here left in the video 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.260
 favorite subscribes to the channel if you 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.420
 it 's not written 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.420
 It's good and until the next
