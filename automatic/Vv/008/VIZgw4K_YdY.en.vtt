00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
hard to really make a decision about

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.240 
hard to really make a decision about
what<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.599> need<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.960> do<00:00:31.109> because<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.949> know<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
what you need to do because you know the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.729 
what you need to do because you know the
fun<00:00:32.640> part<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.420> thinking<00:00:34.380> about<00:00:34.500> it

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
fun part of it is thinking about it

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.819 
fun part of it is thinking about it
imagining<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.399> but<00:00:35.579> then<00:00:35.730> actually<00:00:36.390> having<00:00:36.690> to

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
imagining it but then actually having to

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.799 
imagining it but then actually having to
finalize<00:00:37.829> something<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:39.149> always<00:00:39.270> one<00:00:39.780> of

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
finalize something it's always one of

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.810 
finalize something it's always one of
the<00:00:39.899> biggest<00:00:40.140> challenges<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.280> setting

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
the biggest challenges so of it setting

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.950 
the biggest challenges so of it setting
a<00:00:41.850> deadline<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.300> knowing<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.690> there's<00:00:42.870> an

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
a deadline in knowing that there's an

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.540 
a deadline in knowing that there's an
audience<00:00:43.079> it's<00:00:43.500> waiting<00:00:43.829> for<00:00:43.860> something<00:00:44.190> and

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
audience it's waiting for something and

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.010 
audience it's waiting for something and
that<00:00:44.789> puts<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.270> kind<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.570> pressure<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:45.899> you

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
that puts the kind of pressure on you

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.680 
that puts the kind of pressure on you
that<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.550> positive<00:00:47.550> that's<00:00:47.850> part<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
that is positive that's part of the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.600 
that is positive that's part of the
process<00:00:48.840> which<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.289> think<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.739> maybe<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.489> lot

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
process which I think that maybe a lot

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.950 
process which I think that maybe a lot
of<00:00:50.730> people<00:00:50.910> don't<00:00:51.000> want<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.239> talk<00:00:51.390> about<00:00:51.539> but

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
of people don't want to talk about but

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.700 
of people don't want to talk about but
it's<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.649> big<00:00:52.800> factor<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.120> think<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:54.710> a

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
it's a big factor and so I think it's a

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.959 
it's a big factor and so I think it's a
fantastic<00:00:56.460> opportunity<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:58.820> unleash<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> lot

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
fantastic opportunity to unleash a lot

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.390 
fantastic opportunity to unleash a lot
of<00:01:01.730> original<00:01:02.730> concepts<00:01:03.420> which<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:04.049> is
