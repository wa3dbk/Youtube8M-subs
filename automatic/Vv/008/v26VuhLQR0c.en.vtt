be able to assess this we had to make

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.679 
be able to assess this we had to make
the<00:01:34.110> sophisticated<00:01:34.829> vibration<00:01:35.549> test<00:01:35.820> first

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
the sophisticated vibration test first

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.109 
the sophisticated vibration test first
time<00:01:36.990> we<00:01:37.200> did<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.350> with<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> basic<00:01:38.700> structure<00:01:39.090> of

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
time we did it with a basic structure of

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.300 
time we did it with a basic structure of
the<00:01:39.270> airplane<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.780> now<00:01:40.110> with<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.740> entire

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
the airplane and now with the entire

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.819 
the airplane and now with the entire
airplane<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.240> we<00:01:42.479> needed<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.560> very

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
airplane and we needed a very

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.910 
airplane and we needed a very
experienced<00:01:44.369> team<00:01:44.670> for<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.720> DLR<00:01:46.590> for<00:01:46.860> us

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
experienced team for that and DLR for us

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.550 
experienced team for that and DLR for us
was<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.460> best<00:01:48.030> solution<00:01:48.479> will<00:01:49.170> do<00:01:49.350> now

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
was the best solution will do now

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.160 
was the best solution will do now
parameters<00:01:50.689> identifications<00:01:51.689> which<00:01:51.990> are

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
parameters identifications which are

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.429 
parameters identifications which are
useful<00:01:52.320> which<00:01:52.950> will<00:01:53.189> be<00:01:53.340> very<00:01:53.369> useful<00:01:53.610> to

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
useful which will be very useful to

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.870 
useful which will be very useful to
improve<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.680> quality<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:56.159> our<00:01:56.430> flight

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
improve the quality of our flight

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.929 
improve the quality of our flight
simulator<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.600> potentially<00:01:58.140> also<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:59.189> help

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
simulator and potentially also to help

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.050 
simulator and potentially also to help
us<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.360> develop<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:01.430> autopilot<00:02:02.430> for<00:02:02.939> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
us to develop the autopilot for the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.639 
us to develop the autopilot for the
second<00:02:03.420> airplane<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.110> there<00:02:04.259> are<00:02:04.320> different

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
second airplane so there are different

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.639

yours<00:05:15.020> we<00:05:16.020> are<00:05:16.080> not<00:05:16.229> only<00:05:16.650> developing<00:05:17.400> an

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
yours we are not only developing an

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:20.330 
yours we are not only developing an
airplane<00:05:18.210> but<00:05:18.660> above<00:05:19.199> all<00:05:19.349> we<00:05:19.680> are<00:05:19.860> and<00:05:20.160> we

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
airplane but above all we are and we

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.820 
airplane but above all we are and we
hope<00:05:20.550> to<00:05:20.580> develop<00:05:20.910> a<00:05:21.240> symbol<00:05:21.660> of<00:05:21.810> what<00:05:22.199> really

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
hope to develop a symbol of what really

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.230 
hope to develop a symbol of what really
can<00:05:23.010> be<00:05:23.160> done<00:05:23.370> with<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:23.729> existing

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
can be done with the existing

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.330 
can be done with the existing
technologies<00:05:24.900> will<00:05:25.500> actually<00:05:25.800> demonstrates

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
technologies will actually demonstrates

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.850 
technologies will actually demonstrates
that<00:05:26.460> we<00:05:26.760> can<00:05:26.910> save<00:05:27.180> energy<00:05:27.449> and<00:05:27.810> we<00:05:28.560> believe

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
that we can save energy and we believe

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.460 
that we can save energy and we believe
this<00:05:29.039> is<00:05:29.099> a<00:05:29.280> very<00:05:29.729> good<00:05:29.849> examples<00:05:30.539> as<00:05:30.750> we<00:05:31.260> will

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
this is a very good examples as we will

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.920 
this is a very good examples as we will
fly<00:05:31.800> nappin<00:05:32.520> of<00:05:32.669> the<00:05:32.760> size<00:05:33.000> of<00:05:33.180> an<00:05:33.330> Airbus<00:05:33.630> but

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
fly nappin of the size of an Airbus but

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.339 
fly nappin of the size of an Airbus but
using<00:05:34.500> only<00:05:34.740> the<00:05:35.130> power<00:05:35.160> of<00:05:35.550> small

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:36.349 
using only the power of small

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:38.960 
using only the power of small
motorcycles<00:05:37.349> and<00:05:37.590> if<00:05:37.919> we<00:05:38.039> can<00:05:38.220> save<00:05:38.490> energy<00:05:38.729> in

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
motorcycles and if we can save energy in

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.760 
motorcycles and if we can save energy in
the<00:05:39.060> air<00:05:39.090> we<00:05:39.330> can<00:05:39.479> certainly<00:05:39.660> save<00:05:40.139> in<00:05:40.289> energy

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
the air we can certainly save in energy

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.040 
the air we can certainly save in energy
in<00:05:40.889> many<00:05:41.099> applications<00:05:41.280> on<00:05:42.090> the<00:05:42.510> ground<00:05:42.780> in
