that it's in the movie and I really like

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.040

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
weapon green tea cup this it does have

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.389 
weapon green tea cup this it does have
is<00:00:52.800> for<00:00:53.870> machine<00:00:54.870> guns<00:00:56.149> very<00:00:57.149> nice<00:00:58.010> it's<00:00:59.010> blue

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
is for machine guns very nice it's blue

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.740

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
and I really like these figures

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.950 
and I really like these figures
weaponized<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:05.339> really<00:01:06.150> don't<00:01:06.360> see<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.780> point

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
weaponized I really don't see the point

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.140 
weaponized I really don't see the point
of<00:01:07.439> having<00:01:08.210> only<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:10.350> an<00:01:10.710> armored<00:01:11.150> vehicles

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
of having only the an armored vehicles

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.260 
of having only the an armored vehicles
like<00:01:12.390> unrolled<00:01:13.320> Buster<00:01:13.770> or<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.970> Human

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
like unrolled Buster or the Human

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.670 
like unrolled Buster or the Human
Alliance<00:01:15.830> Leadfoot<00:01:17.840> it<00:01:18.840> seems<00:01:19.350> pointless

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
Alliance Leadfoot it seems pointless

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.510 
Alliance Leadfoot it seems pointless
because<00:01:20.210> in<00:01:21.210> no<00:01:21.900> point<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.350> movie<00:01:22.470> we<00:01:23.310> see

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
because in no point in the movie we see

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.679 
because in no point in the movie we see
them<00:01:23.790> without<00:01:24.180> their<00:01:24.840> weapons<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:26.119> I<00:01:27.119> really

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
them without their weapons so I really

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.289 
them without their weapons so I really
don't<00:01:27.810> know<00:01:27.930> why<00:01:28.380> they<00:01:29.250> choose<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.850> release

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
don't know why they choose to release

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.390 
don't know why they choose to release
those<00:01:30.689> kind<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.049> versions<00:01:31.409> but<00:01:31.619> here<00:01:32.280> we<00:01:32.369> have

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
those kind of versions but here we have

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.539 
those kind of versions but here we have
weaponized<00:01:33.170> topspin<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.409> we<00:01:35.100> are<00:01:35.159> going<00:01:35.369> to

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
weaponized topspin and we are going to

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.260 
weaponized topspin and we are going to
get<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.970> weaponized<00:01:36.450> late<00:01:36.840> food<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.579> I<00:01:38.579> do<00:01:38.880> hope

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
get a weaponized late food and I do hope

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.590 
get a weaponized late food and I do hope
that<00:01:39.570> they<00:01:40.380> make<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.770> deluxe<00:01:41.040> class<00:01:41.600> weaponized

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
that they make a deluxe class weaponized

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.289 
that they make a deluxe class weaponized
Roadbuster<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:44.280> we<00:01:44.369> can<00:01:44.520> have<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.850> whole

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
Roadbuster so we can have the whole

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.450 
Roadbuster so we can have the whole
preset<00:01:45.840> complete<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:47.360> maybe<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.570> will<00:01:48.689> be<00:01:49.460> I'm

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460

don't<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:36.980> done<00:02:37.189> that<00:02:37.400> you<00:02:38.090> need<00:02:38.239> to<00:02:38.799> split

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
don't you done that you need to split

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:45.610 
don't you done that you need to split
this<00:02:40.069> part<00:02:40.689> in<00:02:41.689> half<00:02:43.480> bring<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.750> Spurs<00:02:45.260> food

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
up and fold this in so this will allow

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.129 
up and fold this in so this will allow
you<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:50.120> rotate<00:02:50.329> here<00:02:50.780> from<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.349> waist<00:02:53.139> you

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:54.139 
you to rotate here from the waist you

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:55.899 
you to rotate here from the waist you
can<00:02:54.290> see<00:02:54.440> this<00:02:54.620> this<00:02:55.099> product<00:02:55.489> legs<00:02:55.730> are

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:55.909 
can see this this product legs are

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.819 
can see this this product legs are
separate<00:02:56.510> now<00:02:56.959> you<00:02:57.019> need<00:02:57.349> to<00:02:57.379> plug<00:02:57.920> them<00:02:58.099> in

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
separate now you need to plug them in

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.160 
separate now you need to plug them in
the<00:03:00.829> legs<00:03:01.099> we<00:03:01.879> need<00:03:02.150> to<00:03:02.269> flip<00:03:02.540> this<00:03:02.750> panel

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
the legs we need to flip this panel

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.210 
the legs we need to flip this panel
inside<00:03:03.500> bring<00:03:04.099> the<00:03:04.250> feet<00:03:04.430> down<00:03:05.980> will<00:03:06.980> do<00:03:07.099> the

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
inside bring the feet down will do the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.780 
inside bring the feet down will do the
same<00:03:07.250> here<00:03:07.879> and<00:03:08.530> there<00:03:09.530> we<00:03:09.620> have<00:03:09.680> both<00:03:10.159> legs

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
same here and there we have both legs

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.699 
same here and there we have both legs
already<00:03:11.349> transformed<00:03:13.870> bring<00:03:14.870> this<00:03:15.079> panel

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
already transformed bring this panel

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:23.259

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.420 
here to the back down down span extend
here<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.660> arms<00:03:23.989> put<00:03:24.650> them<00:03:24.769> right<00:03:25.220> into

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
here the arms put them right into

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.050 
here the arms put them right into
position<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:28.569> put<00:03:29.569> the<00:03:29.659> head<00:03:29.840> right<00:03:30.409> in<00:03:30.590> front

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.869 
position and put the head right in front
and<00:03:32.169> there's<00:03:33.169> a<00:03:33.260> way<00:03:33.409> to<00:03:33.440> position<00:03:34.190> this<00:03:34.370> we

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 
and there's a way to position this we

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:45.030 
and there's a way to position this we
need<00:03:35.000> to<00:03:35.859> rotate<00:03:36.859> all<00:03:37.639> the<00:03:37.699> machine<00:03:38.209> guns<00:03:42.519> so

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
need to rotate all the machine guns so

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.009 
need to rotate all the machine guns so
and<00:03:46.040> there<00:03:46.940> we<00:03:47.060> have<00:03:47.949> autobot<00:03:48.949> topspin<00:03:50.019> in

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
and there we have autobot topspin in

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.199 
and there we have autobot topspin in
robot<00:03:51.440> mode<00:03:51.470> one<00:03:52.280> of<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.549> records<00:03:54.459> we<00:03:55.459> put<00:03:55.699> his

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
robot mode one of the records we put his

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.229 
robot mode one of the records we put his
weapon<00:03:56.599> and<00:03:56.959> it's<00:03:57.680> a<00:03:57.739> very<00:03:57.919> nice<00:03:58.069> figure<00:03:58.370> you

weapon and it's a very nice figure you

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.140 
weapon and it's a very nice figure you
cannot<00:03:59.599> see<00:03:59.900> the<00:04:00.290> vehicle<00:04:00.829> in<00:04:01.729> this<00:04:01.940> mode

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
cannot see the vehicle in this mode

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.770 
cannot see the vehicle in this mode
