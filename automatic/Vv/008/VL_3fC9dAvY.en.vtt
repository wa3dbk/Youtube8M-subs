00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.970
 what everyone was waiting for is game 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.800
 0 new announcement of these because until 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.230
 so I had just released photos of the 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.549
 internet few photos yet this 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.640
 showed the law how it would be 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.930
 the houses that are most 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.150
 rounded and half different you can 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.310
 create many things but the beauty houses 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.470
 but what they showed here in this 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.900
 trailer of e3 was the following one of the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.820
 stuff is character building 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.520
 so if you 're going to build characters 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.950
 very well detailed in a nice thing 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.020
 that I was trying to be realistic 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.030
 because it 's a life simulation game 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.239
 but talking just to simulate life, let's go 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.860
 leave it with perfect graphics with 11 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.590
 if they were real people, not them 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.910
 realized that the carton portion is 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.460
 much more fun than people 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.100
 expect of gray then they left to change the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.809
 chart leave the graph more than 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.170
 even showing that it is a 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.960
 Little game not the cool movie, another thing 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.359
 are the feelings they ins 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.390
 interact much better with each other and 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.070
 now if you are defending your actions 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.920
 taking care of the things that I do 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.780
 be sad or not have the issue too 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.439
 this compatibility for example you 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.030
 puts it does some things think of 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.430
 play for example with sad music 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.470
 everyone who is and will be back will have this 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.740
 feeling and will influence is one of the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.890
 people from moving even the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.500
 from gameplay is simpler 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.170
 like you've been playing non- tablet 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.670
 then it is not the part of the controls and 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.100
 more streamlined for the 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.750
 people there was able to interact 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.840
 better and even put this game who knows 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.149
 on this front on mobile devices 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.799
 another nice thing this here o the party 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.750
 you can create your own 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.119
 character put on the internet their 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.579

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.719

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.489
 you think will make a difference there in 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.560
 your habitat looks only the guy died will 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.900

 evil and come death but it is a death 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.540

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.790
