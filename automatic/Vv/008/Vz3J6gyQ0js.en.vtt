hip<00:02:04.500> thrust<00:02:04.830> or<00:02:05.039> hip<00:02:05.160> lift<00:02:05.429> with<00:02:05.580> that<00:02:05.729> barbell

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
hip thrust or hip lift with that barbell

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.859 
hip thrust or hip lift with that barbell
which<00:02:06.720> is<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.929> great<00:02:07.110> movement<00:02:07.560> for<00:02:07.709> the<00:02:07.739> glutes

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
which is a great movement for the glutes

burning it out there with that one yeah

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.800 
burning it out there with that one yeah
at<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.540> end<00:02:37.690> it's<00:02:38.470> really<00:02:38.650> good<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:40.510> then

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
at the end it's really good and then

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.660 
at the end it's really good and then
just<00:02:41.020> when<00:02:41.170> you<00:02:41.290> think<00:02:41.440> you're<00:02:41.620> dead<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:42.430> move

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
just when you think you're dead you move

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.150 
just when you think you're dead you move
in<00:02:42.850> to<00:02:43.240> jump<00:02:43.540> rope<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.020> you<00:02:44.530> don't<00:02:44.710> just<00:02:44.980> do

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
in to jump rope and you don't just do

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.160 
in to jump rope and you don't just do
like<00:02:45.460> sets<00:02:45.820> of<00:02:46.060> ten<00:02:46.510> like<00:02:46.780> you<00:02:46.930> would<00:02:47.080> if

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
like sets of ten like you would if

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.240 
like sets of ten like you would if
you're<00:02:47.290> lifting<00:02:47.500> I<00:02:47.770> mean<00:02:47.950> you're<00:02:48.070> going

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
you're lifting I mean you're going

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.040 
you're lifting I mean you're going
serious<00:02:48.940> here<00:02:49.120> you<00:02:49.210> start<00:02:49.450> with<00:02:49.600> both<00:02:49.840> legs

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
serious here you start with both legs

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.000 
serious here you start with both legs
and<00:02:50.290> how<00:02:50.380> long<00:02:50.560> do<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:50.740> do<00:02:50.830> that<00:02:50.950> for

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
and how long do you do that for

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.720 
and how long do you do that for
typically<00:02:52.080> so<00:02:53.080> sometimes<00:02:53.710> we<00:02:53.830> do<00:02:53.950> 30<00:02:54.190> second

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
typically so sometimes we do 30 second

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.520 
typically so sometimes we do 30 second
double<00:02:55.060> of<00:02:55.090> 8<00:02:55.270> 30<00:02:55.510> second<00:02:55.900> single<00:02:56.260> make<00:02:56.380> all

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
double of 8 30 second single make all

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.500 
double of 8 30 second single make all
trading<00:02:56.890> links<00:02:57.070> or<00:02:57.910> sometimes<00:02:58.240> we<00:02:58.270> do<00:02:58.480> a

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
trading links or sometimes we do a

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.600 
trading links or sometimes we do a
minute<00:02:58.930> of<00:02:59.050> each<00:02:59.440> depending<00:03:00.220> on<00:03:00.340> what<00:03:00.490> we're

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
minute of each depending on what we're

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.460 
minute of each depending on what we're
calling<00:03:00.760> for<00:03:01.210> that<00:03:01.300> day<00:03:01.510> so<00:03:01.780> plyometrics<00:03:02.380> is

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
calling for that day so plyometrics is

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.320 
calling for that day so plyometrics is
really<00:03:02.680> important<00:03:03.310> if<00:03:03.520> you<00:03:03.910> want<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.150> those

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
really important if you want it those

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.630 
really important if you want it those
legs<00:03:04.690> trim<00:03:05.080> down<00:03:05.350> which<00:03:05.860> I<00:03:06.010> have<00:03:06.160> a<00:03:06.190> hard<00:03:06.430> time

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
legs trim down which I have a hard time

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.970 
legs trim down which I have a hard time
bringing<00:03:06.850> my<00:03:07.120> legs<00:03:07.330> in<00:03:07.540> yeah<00:03:08.170> usually<00:03:08.560> coming

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
bringing my legs in yeah usually coming

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.060 
bringing my legs in yeah usually coming
at<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.190> end<00:03:09.220> of<00:03:09.640> my<00:03:09.910> training<00:03:10.230> on<00:03:11.230> my<00:03:11.350> prep<00:03:11.590> got

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
at the end of my training on my prep got

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.410 
at the end of my training on my prep got
it<00:03:12.250> so<00:03:12.400> that's<00:03:12.550> when<00:03:12.730> you<00:03:12.820> really<00:03:13.120> start<00:03:13.360> to

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
it so that's when you really start to

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.330 
it so that's when you really start to
notice<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:13.900> final<00:03:14.290> tightening<00:03:14.860> of<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.070> legs

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
notice the final tightening of the legs

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.620 
notice the final tightening of the legs
looks<00:03:15.580> like<00:03:15.700> your<00:03:15.850> abs<00:03:16.000> come<00:03:16.210> up<00:03:16.360> pretty

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
looks like your abs come up pretty

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.350 
looks like your abs come up pretty
easily<00:03:16.870> well<00:03:17.440> I<00:03:17.650> say<00:03:17.950> easily<00:03:18.370> but<00:03:18.580> yeah<00:03:18.820> you

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
easily well I say easily but yeah you

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.930 
easily well I say easily but yeah you
know<00:03:19.510> I<00:03:19.540> see<00:03:19.960> on<00:03:20.140> my<00:03:20.680> abs<00:03:20.890> are<00:03:21.250> probably<00:03:21.820> my

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
know I see on my abs are probably my

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.380 
know I see on my abs are probably my
strong<00:03:22.330> point<00:03:22.720> on<00:03:22.960> I<00:03:23.710> think<00:03:23.950> people<00:03:24.280> would

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
strong point on I think people would

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.020 
strong point on I think people would
appreciate<00:03:25.390> it<00:03:25.990> but<00:03:26.620> it<00:03:26.860> might<00:03:27.160> be<00:03:27.190> too<00:03:27.430> hard

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
appreciate it but it might be too hard

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.700 
appreciate it but it might be too hard
at<00:03:28.300> times<00:03:28.570> you<00:03:28.990> know<00:03:29.050> so<00:03:29.260> we<00:03:29.380> have<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.620> learn

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
at times you know so we have to learn

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.050 
at times you know so we have to learn
how<00:03:29.770> to<00:03:29.860> soften<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.340> up<00:03:30.400> as<00:03:30.580> one<00:03:30.820> I<00:03:30.940> think

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
how to soften that up as one I think

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.820 
how to soften that up as one I think
that<00:03:31.210> comes<00:03:31.390> in<00:03:31.510> with<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:31.720> diet<00:03:31.930> as<00:03:32.200> well<00:03:32.230> yeah

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
that comes in with the diet as well yeah

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.530 
that comes in with the diet as well yeah
that's<00:03:33.010> tricky<00:03:33.370> when<00:03:33.790> you<00:03:33.910> have<00:03:34.060> body<00:03:34.240> parts

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
that's tricky when you have body parts

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.270 
that's tricky when you have body parts
that<00:03:34.840> do<00:03:34.990> naturally<00:03:35.650> get<00:03:35.800> super<00:03:36.130> lean

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
that do naturally get super lean

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.340 
that do naturally get super lean
especially<00:03:36.790> in<00:03:36.880> bikini<00:03:37.180> because<00:03:37.570> it's<00:03:38.110> about

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
especially in bikini because it's about
