00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
the basics probably the most basic would

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.590 
the basics probably the most basic would
be<00:01:52.049> what<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.619> port<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.070> starboard<00:01:53.460> fore<00:01:54.450> and

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
be what is port and starboard fore and

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.499 
be what is port and starboard fore and
aft<00:01:54.829> deck<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.130> overhead<00:01:56.640> well<00:01:57.030> for<00:01:57.390> is

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
aft deck and overhead well for is

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.109 
aft deck and overhead well for is
forward<00:01:57.899> aft<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.439> behind<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.920> deck<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.729> below

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
forward aft is behind you deck is below

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.300 
forward aft is behind you deck is below
you<00:02:00.180> over<00:02:00.540> head<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.810> above<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.320> port<00:02:02.159> and

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
you over head is above you port and

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.190 
you over head is above you port and
starboard<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:03.000> left<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.450> right<00:02:03.600> respectfully

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
starboard is left and right respectfully

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.520 
starboard is left and right respectfully
so<00:02:05.810> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
so the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.469 
so the
most<00:02:07.799> difficult<00:02:08.190> ones<00:02:08.369> there<00:02:08.640> would<00:02:08.940> be<00:02:08.970> port

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
most difficult ones there would be port

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.990 
most difficult ones there would be port
and<00:02:09.869> starboard<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:11.250> easiest<00:02:11.580> way<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.970> I

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
and starboard the easiest way that I

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.670 
and starboard the easiest way that I
found<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.540> remember<00:02:12.870> them<00:02:13.020> which<00:02:13.380> one<00:02:13.560> is

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
found to remember them which one is

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.260 
found to remember them which one is
which<00:02:13.830> is<00:02:14.069> when<00:02:14.520> standing<00:02:14.880> at<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.090> back<00:02:15.209> of

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
which is when standing at the back of

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.840 
which is when standing at the back of
the<00:02:15.480> ship<00:02:15.540> looking<00:02:15.990> forward<00:02:16.490> port<00:02:17.490> is<00:02:17.640> on<00:02:17.760> the

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
the ship looking forward port is on the

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.199 
the ship looking forward port is on the
left<00:02:18.530> starboard<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.620> on<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.800> right<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.220> the

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
left starboard is on the right and the

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.990 
left starboard is on the right and the
easiest<00:02:21.540> way<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.750> remember<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.140> is<00:02:22.319> left<00:02:23.220> has

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
easiest way to remember that is left has

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.390 
easiest way to remember that is left has
less<00:02:24.330> letters<00:02:24.690> than<00:02:24.870> right<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.350> port<00:02:26.069> has

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
less letters than right and port has

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.030 
less letters than right and port has
less<00:02:26.700> letters<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.180> stubborn<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:28.290> hopefully

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
less letters and stubborn so hopefully

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.830 
less letters and stubborn so hopefully
that<00:02:29.760> helps<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:30.030> out<00:02:30.090> there<00:02:30.300> because<00:02:30.540> your

that helps you out there because your

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.740 
that helps you out there because your
flight<00:02:31.020> computer<00:02:31.410> will<00:02:31.590> be<00:02:32.030> saying<00:02:33.030> proximity

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
flight computer will be saying proximity

except<00:03:44.130> here<00:03:44.670> I<00:03:44.700> don't<00:03:45.030> want<00:03:45.239> to<00:03:45.359> be<00:03:45.450> pointing

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
except here I don't want to be pointing

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.420 
except here I don't want to be pointing
myself<00:03:46.170> with<00:03:46.260> those<00:03:46.380> rocks<00:03:46.650> so<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:46.980> leave<00:03:47.250> the

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
myself with those rocks so I leave the

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.490 
myself with those rocks so I leave the
ship<00:03:47.640> pointed<00:03:48.120> away<00:03:48.540> from<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.959> rocks<00:03:49.170> and

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
ship pointed away from the rocks and

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.670 
ship pointed away from the rocks and
then<00:03:49.859> I<00:03:49.950> aim<00:03:50.280> far<00:03:51.269> off<00:03:51.540> to<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.840> side<00:03:52.079> so<00:03:52.530> that<00:03:52.650> I

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
then I aim far off to the side so that I

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.120 
then I aim far off to the side so that I
don't<00:03:52.920> endanger<00:03:53.220> my<00:03:53.549> ship<00:03:54.799> all<00:03:55.799> right<00:03:56.010> now

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
don't endanger my ship all right now

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.349 
don't endanger my ship all right now
these<00:03:56.280> next<00:03:56.519> few<00:03:56.640> kills<00:03:56.880> here<00:03:57.090> they're<00:03:57.269> not

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
these next few kills here they're not

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.420 
these next few kills here they're not
exactly<00:03:57.510> how<00:03:57.959> Jam<00:03:58.260> kills<00:03:58.530> that<00:03:58.769> highlight<00:03:59.310> the

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
exactly how Jam kills that highlight the

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.400 
exactly how Jam kills that highlight the
uses<00:03:59.700> of<00:03:59.730> it<00:03:59.970> but<00:04:00.450> I've<00:04:00.540> left<00:04:00.720> it<00:04:00.870> in<00:04:00.989> so<00:04:01.230> that<00:04:01.260> I

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
uses of it but I've left it in so that I

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.470 
uses of it but I've left it in so that I
could<00:04:01.530> talk<00:04:01.739> about<00:04:02.040> a<00:04:02.280> couple<00:04:02.730> of<00:04:02.790> easy<00:04:02.970> points

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
could talk about a couple of easy points

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.509 
could talk about a couple of easy points
and<00:04:03.859> they're<00:04:04.859> pretty<00:04:04.980> much<00:04:05.100> common<00:04:05.489> sense

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
and they're pretty much common sense

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:06.770 
and they're pretty much common sense
when<00:04:05.820> you<00:04:05.910> think<00:04:05.940> about<00:04:06.120> it<00:04:06.269> but<00:04:06.480> for<00:04:06.630> some

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
when you think about it but for some

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.300 
when you think about it but for some
pilots<00:04:07.140> maybe<00:04:07.620> they<00:04:07.799> didn't<00:04:07.980> think<00:04:08.040> about<00:04:08.160> it

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
pilots maybe they didn't think about it

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.729 
pilots maybe they didn't think about it
so<00:04:08.579> it's<00:04:08.700> not<00:04:08.850> that<00:04:09.060> easy<00:04:09.180> to<00:04:09.390> talk<00:04:09.540> about

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
so it's not that easy to talk about

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.610 
so it's not that easy to talk about
their<00:04:10.739> you<00:04:11.400> saw<00:04:11.579> it<00:04:11.640> right<00:04:11.700> there<00:04:11.820> the<00:04:12.570> aim<00:04:13.170> dot

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
their you saw it right there the aim dot

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.279 
their you saw it right there the aim dot
was<00:04:14.190> almost<00:04:14.519> or<00:04:14.820> was<00:04:15.359> right<00:04:15.629> on<00:04:15.750> top<00:04:15.959> of<00:04:15.989> the

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
was almost or was right on top of the

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.610 
was almost or was right on top of the
enemy<00:04:16.530> ship<00:04:16.729> the<00:04:17.729> lead<00:04:18.239> indicator<00:04:18.599> in<00:04:19.140> length

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
enemy ship the lead indicator in length

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.229 
enemy ship the lead indicator in length
will<00:04:20.039> indicate<00:04:20.340> to<00:04:20.669> you

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
will indicate to you

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.570 
will indicate to you
how<00:04:21.389> quick<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:22.259> enemy<00:04:22.500> ship<00:04:22.710> is<00:04:22.860> moving<00:04:23.009> in<00:04:23.370> an

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
how quick the enemy ship is moving in an

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.240 
how quick the enemy ship is moving in an
angular<00:04:24.000> velocity<00:04:24.539> away<00:04:24.870> from<00:04:25.050> you<00:04:25.169> so<00:04:26.039> when

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
angular velocity away from you so when

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.760 
angular velocity away from you so when
it's<00:04:26.370> close<00:04:26.610> together<00:04:26.849> like<00:04:27.210> that<00:04:27.319> it's<00:04:28.319> much

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
it's close together like that it's much

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.309 
it's close together like that it's much
easier<00:04:29.069> to<00:04:29.340> land<00:04:29.639> a<00:04:29.849> shot<00:04:30.060> then<00:04:30.780> when<00:04:31.080> it's

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:31.319 
easier to land a shot then when it's

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.409 
easier to land a shot then when it's
very<00:04:31.590> far<00:04:31.919> off<00:04:32.069> even<00:04:32.520> if<00:04:32.610> you<00:04:32.699> can<00:04:32.849> hold<00:04:33.030> it<00:04:33.270> on

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
very far off even if you can hold it on

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:34.879 
very far off even if you can hold it on
the<00:04:33.599> topic<00:04:33.960> when<00:04:34.080> it's<00:04:34.199> far<00:04:34.319> off<00:04:34.440> it's<00:04:34.680> going

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
the topic when it's far off it's going

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.309 
the topic when it's far off it's going
to<00:04:34.949> be<00:04:35.069> hard<00:04:35.699> to<00:04:35.819> see<00:04:36.060> hard<00:04:36.360> to<00:04:36.509> hit<00:04:36.660> on<00:04:37.139> how<00:04:37.259> to

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:37.319 
to be hard to see hard to hit on how to

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.620 
to be hard to see hard to hit on how to
land<00:04:37.590> hits<00:04:37.860> here<00:04:38.759> you'll<00:04:38.910> see<00:04:38.970> this<00:04:39.210> vandal

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
land hits here you'll see this vandal

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.719 
land hits here you'll see this vandal
hunter<00:04:39.900> is<00:04:40.050> coming<00:04:40.080> right<00:04:40.500> at<00:04:40.650> me<00:04:40.680> I<00:04:40.979> can<00:04:41.580> land

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.010 
hunter is coming right at me I can land
a<00:04:41.819> bunch<00:04:42.000> of<00:04:42.120> hits<00:04:42.270> on<00:04:42.419> them<00:04:42.539> unfortunately

a bunch of hits on them unfortunately

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.550 
a bunch of hits on them unfortunately
not<00:04:43.680> enough<00:04:43.710> to<00:04:44.190> put<00:04:44.310> them<00:04:44.430> under<00:04:44.639> here<00:04:44.729> and

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
not enough to put them under here and

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.870 
not enough to put them under here and
how<00:04:46.560> that<00:04:46.680> might<00:04:46.860> be<00:04:47.099> because<00:04:47.220> of<00:04:47.550> my<00:04:47.669> like<00:04:47.849> a

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
how that might be because of my like a

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.999 
how that might be because of my like a
skill<00:04:48.210> I<00:04:50.030> should<00:04:51.030> get<00:04:51.120> them<00:04:51.270> here<00:04:51.479> now<00:04:52.289> you'll

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
skill I should get them here now you'll

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:55.370 
skill I should get them here now you'll
see<00:04:53.250> here<00:04:53.550> I'm<00:04:53.699> not<00:04:53.960> pointing<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.199> ship

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
see here I'm not pointing the ship

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.589 
see here I'm not pointing the ship
directly<00:04:55.650> at<00:04:55.860> him<00:04:56.039> i<00:04:56.159> am<00:04:56.190> using<00:04:56.490> the<00:04:56.789> turret

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 
directly at him i am using the turret

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.360 
directly at him i am using the turret
guns<00:04:57.810> to<00:04:58.020> hit<00:04:58.050> them<00:04:58.259> and<00:04:58.440> then<00:04:58.949> at<00:04:59.099> the<00:04:59.130> last

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
guns to hit them and then at the last

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.830 
guns to hit them and then at the last
second<00:04:59.789> i<00:04:59.819> move<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.120> ship<00:05:00.300> so<00:05:00.479> that<00:05:00.509> I<00:05:00.630> make

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
second i move the ship so that I make

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.409 
second i move the ship so that I make
sure<00:05:00.870> my<00:05:00.990> shot<00:05:01.380> lands<00:05:04.099> again<00:05:05.120> don't<00:05:06.120> quite<00:05:06.300> get

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
sure my shot lands again don't quite get

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.930 
sure my shot lands again don't quite get
that<00:05:06.479> hunter<00:05:06.840> down<00:05:07.050> here<00:05:07.770> I<00:05:07.800> see<00:05:08.130> it<00:05:08.220> a<00:05:08.340> target

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
that hunter down here I see it a target

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.770 
that hunter down here I see it a target
of<00:05:09.030> opportunity<00:05:11.360> missing<00:05:12.360> him<00:05:12.509> then<00:05:12.750> I

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
of opportunity missing him then I

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.450 
of opportunity missing him then I
switched<00:05:13.349> back<00:05:13.530> to<00:05:13.560> the<00:05:13.740> first<00:05:13.889> guys<00:05:14.099> his

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
switched back to the first guys his

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.580 
switched back to the first guys his
approach<00:05:14.789> vector<00:05:15.120> should<00:05:15.270> be<00:05:15.360> very<00:05:15.539> steep<00:05:15.810> and

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
approach vector should be very steep and

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.520 
approach vector should be very steep and
I'm<00:05:16.740> able<00:05:16.860> to<00:05:17.069> wipe<00:05:17.250> the<00:05:17.370> word<00:05:17.550> with<00:05:17.669> him

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
I'm able to wipe the word with him

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.930 
I'm able to wipe the word with him
switching<00:05:19.530> back<00:05:19.680> to<00:05:19.710> the<00:05:19.919> next<00:05:20.099> target<00:05:20.430> it's

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
switching back to the next target it's

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.939 
switching back to the next target it's
the<00:05:21.030> exact<00:05:21.270> same<00:05:21.300> thing<00:05:21.630> again<00:05:21.840> wait<00:05:22.620> for<00:05:22.830> that

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
the exact same thing again wait for that

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:24.559 
the exact same thing again wait for that
lead<00:05:23.400> indicator<00:05:23.669> to<00:05:24.000> be<00:05:24.120> as<00:05:24.210> close<00:05:24.360> to<00:05:24.419> the

engaging them as the Rock has really
poorly<00:05:49.380> lit<00:05:49.590> and<00:05:49.770> I<00:05:49.800> can't<00:05:50.009> see<00:05:50.190> the<00:05:50.310> contours

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
poorly lit and I can't see the contours

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:52.850 
poorly lit and I can't see the contours
of them<00:05:50.969> however<00:05:51.630> he<00:05:51.990> is<00:05:52.020> focused<00:05:52.440> on<00:05:52.530> my

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
of them however he is focused on my

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.649 
of them however he is focused on my
wingman<00:05:53.250> so<00:05:53.909> I'm<00:05:54.000> going<00:05:54.060> to<00:05:54.240> be<00:05:54.300> able<00:05:54.389> to<00:05:54.539> come

up<00:05:54.690> behind<00:05:54.900> him<00:05:55.169> here<00:05:55.319> and<00:05:55.610> light<00:05:56.610> them<00:05:56.729> up

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:56.819 
up behind him here and light them up

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:03.499 
up behind him here and light them up
he's<00:05:57.090> in<00:05:57.210> the<00:05:57.270> middle<00:05:57.449> of<00:05:57.539> a<00:05:57.630> turn<00:06:02.360> you<00:06:03.360> see

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
he's in the middle of a turn you see

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:05.330 
he's in the middle of a turn you see
it's<00:06:03.630> very<00:06:03.810> hard<00:06:04.020> to<00:06:04.050> hit<00:06:04.139> when<00:06:04.469> they're<00:06:04.680> neat

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
it's very hard to hit when they're neat

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.070 
it's very hard to hit when they're neat
indicators<00:06:05.819> that<00:06:05.849> far<00:06:06.180> out<00:06:06.300> that<00:06:06.780> starts

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
indicators that far out that starts

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.110 
indicators that far out that starts
getting<00:06:07.319> closer<00:06:07.500> together<00:06:07.740> closer<00:06:08.729> to<00:06:08.940> him

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
getting closer together closer to him

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.580 
getting closer together closer to him
and<00:06:09.770> then<00:06:10.770> I<00:06:12.080> don't<00:06:13.080> know<00:06:13.139> why<00:06:13.259> didn't<00:06:13.469> shoot

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
and then I don't know why didn't shoot

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.909 
and then I don't know why didn't shoot
them<00:06:13.770> here<00:06:14.159> we<00:06:14.280> go<00:06:14.509> there<00:06:15.509> is<00:06:15.719> see<00:06:16.530> how<00:06:16.590> easy<00:06:16.800> it

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
them here we go there is see how easy it

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.080 
them here we go there is see how easy it
was<00:06:17.009> to<00:06:17.069> take<00:06:17.250> them<00:06:17.400> out<00:06:17.520> when<00:06:17.669> the<00:06:17.789> leading

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
was to take them out when the leading

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.850 
was to take them out when the leading
Decatur<00:06:18.360> was<00:06:18.509> very<00:06:18.690> close<00:06:18.900> to<00:06:18.930> him<00:06:19.110> it's<00:06:19.740> all

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
Decatur was very close to him it's all

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.140 
Decatur was very close to him it's all
about<00:06:20.039> finding<00:06:20.219> the<00:06:20.400> right<00:06:20.460> angle<00:06:20.969> so<00:06:21.120> that

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
about finding the right angle so that

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.850 
about finding the right angle so that
it's<00:06:21.360> extremely<00:06:21.840> easy<00:06:22.080> to<00:06:22.289> take<00:06:22.560> these<00:06:22.680> guys

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
it's extremely easy to take these guys

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.899 
it's extremely easy to take these guys
out<00:06:23.569> so<00:06:24.569> here<00:06:24.810> I'm<00:06:25.289> focused<00:06:26.039> on<00:06:26.130> this<00:06:26.310> guy<00:06:26.490> but

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:26.909 
out so here I'm focused on this guy but

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:28.550 
out so here I'm focused on this guy but
then<00:06:27.030> I<00:06:27.060> noticed<00:06:27.300> that<00:06:27.509> I've<00:06:27.719> got<00:06:27.870> a<00:06:27.900> target

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
then I noticed that I've got a target

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.079 
then I noticed that I've got a target
coming<00:06:28.919> directly<00:06:29.219> at<00:06:29.430> me<00:06:29.550> here<00:06:29.729> so<00:06:29.880> I<00:06:29.909> switched

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:30.089 
coming directly at me here so I switched

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:31.140 
coming directly at me here so I switched
to<00:06:30.270> him

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
to him

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.350 
to him
and<00:06:31.870> not<00:06:32.560> quick<00:06:32.800> enough<00:06:32.940> we<00:06:33.940> should<00:06:34.150> be<00:06:34.240> able

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
and not quick enough we should be able

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.160 
and not quick enough we should be able
to<00:06:34.600> take<00:06:34.870> them<00:06:34.990> out<00:06:35.140> really<00:06:35.830> quickly<00:06:36.040> here

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.170 
to take them out really quickly here

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:39.210 
to take them out really quickly here
again<00:06:38.170> using<00:06:38.500> the<00:06:38.590> mouse<00:06:38.680> and<00:06:38.740> ristic

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.220 
again using the mouse and ristic

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.000 
again using the mouse and ristic
separately<00:06:40.320> get<00:06:41.320> myself<00:06:41.500> in<00:06:41.740> the<00:06:41.800> perfect

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
separately get myself in the perfect

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.610 
separately get myself in the perfect
position<00:06:42.250> and<00:06:42.700> then<00:06:42.790> make<00:06:42.940> the<00:06:43.090> fine<00:06:43.300> two

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
position and then make the fine two

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.370 
position and then make the fine two
movements<00:06:44.620> that<00:06:44.920> I<00:06:44.980> need<00:06:45.160> with<00:06:45.340> the<00:06:45.370> most<00:06:46.380> all

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
movements that I need with the most all

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.810 
movements that I need with the most all
right<00:06:47.590> I<00:06:47.680> sped<00:06:47.890> that<00:06:48.040> part<00:06:48.250> up<00:06:48.370> there<00:06:48.550> so<00:06:48.790> that

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:48.820 
right I sped that part up there so that

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.140 
right I sped that part up there so that
we<00:06:49.060> could<00:06:49.180> skip<00:06:49.420> ahead<00:06:49.570> to<00:06:50.550> well<00:06:51.550> kill<00:06:51.940> here

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.150 
we could skip ahead to well kill here

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.210 
we could skip ahead to well kill here
and<00:06:52.330> then<00:06:52.840> probably<00:06:53.440> the<00:06:53.620> most<00:06:53.740> important

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.220 
and then probably the most important

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.920 
and then probably the most important
kill<00:06:54.370> in<00:06:54.490> this<00:06:54.610> video<00:06:54.910> using<00:06:55.540> the<00:06:55.780> joystick

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:55.930 
kill in this video using the joystick

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.310 
kill in this video using the joystick
completely<00:06:56.800> separately<00:06:57.220> from<00:06:57.430> the<00:06:57.520> mouse<00:06:57.760> and

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:58.320 
completely separately from the mouse and

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.870 
completely separately from the mouse and
all<00:06:59.320> starts<00:06:59.650> with<00:06:59.740> me<00:06:59.890> actually<00:07:00.430> missing<00:07:00.790> my

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 
all starts with me actually missing my

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.820 
all starts with me actually missing my
target<00:07:01.270> I<00:07:01.420> think<00:07:01.870> about<00:07:02.050> what<00:07:02.140> i<00:07:02.200> need<00:07:02.350> to<00:07:02.380> do<00:07:02.620> I

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
target I think about what i need to do I

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.370 
target I think about what i need to do I
use<00:07:03.340> the<00:07:03.580> joystick<00:07:03.790> to<00:07:04.030> to<00:07:04.960> move<00:07:05.080> the<00:07:05.200> ship

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:05.380 
use the joystick to to move the ship

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.810 
use the joystick to to move the ship
around<00:07:05.500> and<00:07:05.740> then<00:07:05.920> I<00:07:05.950> use<00:07:06.160> the<00:07:06.310> mouse<00:07:06.460> to<00:07:06.520> make

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:06.820 
around and then I use the mouse to make

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.160 
around and then I use the mouse to make
my<00:07:06.970> fine<00:07:07.180> little<00:07:07.390> movements<00:07:07.810> and<00:07:07.990> it's

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.170 
my fine little movements and it's

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.870 
my fine little movements and it's
extremely<00:07:08.740> easy<00:07:08.950> to<00:07:09.100> take<00:07:09.340> the<00:07:09.460> target<00:07:09.670> out

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:09.880 
extremely easy to take the target out

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.740 
extremely easy to take the target out
