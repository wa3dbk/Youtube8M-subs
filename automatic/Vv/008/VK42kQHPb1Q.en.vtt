00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 he his polycrystalline silicon up 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.370
 1420 degrees Celsius special 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:14.040
 hermetic oven that is cleared of 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:16.170
 air argon then turned out 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.359
 molten silicon unwinds in 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.600
 crucible a silicon seed crystal 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.769
 size and shape resembling a pencil 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.420
 plunges into it spinning in 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.420
 opposite direction 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.710
 until molten polycrystalline 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.840
 silicon cools off the seed crystal 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.250
 maiden and extract approximately by 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.250
 one and a half millimeter per minute 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.660
 the result is a solid 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.970
 silicon crystal weighing about 200 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.540
 kilograms and a diameter of about 200 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.540
 millimeters 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.020
 the crystal is so durable that its weight 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:05.140
 can withstand 1 thread with a diameter of just 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:08.940
 three millimeters but he's fragile now 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.440
 it needs to be cut exactly to fit 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.850
 after chemical and fluoroscopy 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.500
 chesky study to check 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.240
 degree of its purity and molecular 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.670
 orientation it is loaded into the installation 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.740
 for cutting silicon this wire saw 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.990
 weighing 10 but he's using fast 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.640
 moving tape from ultra thin 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:33.179
 wire cuts silicon wafer 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:39.789
 only 2 3 millimeters thick and 99 99 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:42.039
 99 and 99 percent free press but 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.560
 after cutting on the surface of the plates 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.750
 microscopic defects remain 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:52.300
 it means it's time to go polishing with 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:54.159
 using grinding but even after processing 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.560
 in this powerful grinding machine they 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.090
 is not sufficiently smooth so then 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.440
 polish them one more time with 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.670
 using chemical reagents 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.580
 the result is silicon wafers with 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.569
 surface roughness less than 0.1 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.190
 billion billion per meter now 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.560
 when they are polished to a shine on 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.560
 you can finally engrave the microcircuit 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.450
 place millions of transistors on these 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.069
 tiny plates work such 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.600
 chip makers like texas 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.810
 instruments 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.490
 in 1958 to the inventor of the integral 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.230
 chip jack kirby succeeded 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.800
 place on your scheme one 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.990
 transistor nowadays last 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.240
 generation uses almost a billion and in 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.960
 according to law moore every two 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.640
 years capacity doubles 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.040
 Well, of course the more trying to increase 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.540
 the capacity should be less each 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.670
 the transistor in this model is over a quarter 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.970
 a billion transistors someone will have to 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.070
 reduce them for her work with such 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.610
 microscopic details puts in front 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.410
 chip makers have a serious problem 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.210
 since the thickness of the transistor is only one 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.150
 ten thousandth of a millimeter even 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.720
 tiny dust particles can lead to 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.720
 catastrophe 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.980
 so before experts like 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.140
 dnb or go to work in a factory 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:26.180
 they put on a protective suit here on 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.160
 away for test by making the chip yet 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.620
 we start with silicon wafers 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.830
 substrates perform many different 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.660
 manufacturing operations 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.160
 our usual microchip from start to 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.340
 The end usually consists of approximately 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.340
 one and a half thousand separate technological 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.340
 operations 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.200
 shop area which is slightly 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.550
 less than 18 thousand square meters 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.319
 is a clean room of class 1 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:01.050
 thanks to 12 tones of equipment for 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:06.180
 air conditioning 10,000 times cleaner 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:08.190
 than in the surgical operating room in one 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.530
 cubic foot of air is approximately 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.349
 one 30 parts a cubic meter is contained 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.630
 less than 100 microparticles just one 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.370
 particle hit the most important 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.579
 plot plate is able to pull out 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.989
 building a whole chip to give you 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.850
 idea of â€‹â€‹how this 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.919
 the room is clean I will say that only when 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.440
 walking every minute forms 5 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.090
 million microparticles 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.400
 so to avoid inadvertent 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.930
 pollution by staff stack blasting 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.880
 go through a difficult process 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.010
 component assembly in 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.009
 standardized frontal containers 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.080
 discoveries 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.059
 the main problem is how to reduce 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.749
 complex schemes and make at least a claim on 

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:46.749
 plates 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:54.049
 this is done using the process under 

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:56.029
 photolithography name 

00:04:54.049 --> 00:04:57.689
 the plates are covered first 

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:59.459
 photosensitive chemical 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:01.549
 reagents that harden under 

00:04:59.459 --> 00:05:03.599
 UV exposure 

00:05:01.549 --> 00:05:05.789
 sealed dark rooms 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:08.519
 ultraviolet passes through images 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:10.609
 then through diminishing lenses and hits 

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:13.259
 on a reagent-coated plate 

00:05:10.609 --> 00:05:14.669
 when chemicals wash off the image 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:20.519
 stays just like when developing 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:22.529
 photos but to post on 

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:25.379
 plate all the components add them 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:27.919
 layer by layer like floors in tiny 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:27.919
 skyscraper 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.640
 to complete the plates work them 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.100
 containers run up to forty cycles and 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:39.210
 photolithography operations are repeated over 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.210
 each new layer 

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:47.210
 some layers heat up on some 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:49.569
 affect ionized plasma and 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.189
 some are covered with metals 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:54.529
 each type of treatment changes properties 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:58.990
 this layer and slowly create part 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:58.990
 puzzles forming a chip model 

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:05.119
 on finished silicon wafer sheets 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:07.339
 accommodates up to thousands of individual 

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:10.449
 microchips and over 4 billion 

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:10.449
 schematic components 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:15.699
 it remains only to cut and pack them 

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:20.300
 and turning the sand circuit board 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:22.430
 completed that once there was nothing 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.979
 standing heaps of sand now can be 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.709
 sold for more than 17 thousand dollars 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:30.139
 per gram and is capable of vein and eye 

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:32.539
 calculate the pi number with an accuracy of 1000 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:34.490
 characters poet metaphysician William Blake 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:37.459
 claimed that he could see the world in 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:39.619
 a grain of sand but if he now looked 

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:41.809
 on her once again stabby seemed surprised 

00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:45.519
 would have discovered even more billion 

00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:45.519
 tiny transistors
