00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
we're going to say it that way and say

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.520 
we're going to say it that way and say
these<00:02:12.270> two<00:02:12.569> are<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.840> middle<00:02:13.200> this<00:02:13.379> is

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
these two are the middle this is

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.230 
these two are the middle this is
the<00:02:13.590> last<00:02:13.890> month<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:14.400> can<00:02:14.520> be<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.730> middle<00:02:14.970> if

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
the last month it can be the middle if

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.910 
the last month it can be the middle if
it<00:02:15.360> goes<00:02:15.540> in<00:02:15.750> October<00:02:16.319> that's<00:02:16.560> going<00:02:16.740> to<00:02:16.800> be

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
it goes in October that's going to be

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.010 
it goes in October that's going to be
closer<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.060> last<00:02:18.300> quarter<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.959> year

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
closer to the last quarter of the year

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.350 
closer to the last quarter of the year
so<00:02:20.010> September<00:02:20.940> is<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.980> release<00:02:23.400> date<00:02:23.760> they

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360

so September is the release date they
haven't<00:02:24.569> said<00:02:24.750> September<00:02:25.500> but<00:02:26.040> going<00:02:26.550> through

the scale I am definitely saying it's

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.400 
the scale I am definitely saying it's
going<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.420> be<00:02:30.480> September<00:02:30.900> if<00:02:31.020> it's<00:02:31.170> not

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
saying September I'm guessing around

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.690 
saying September I'm guessing around
September<00:02:43.260> ain't<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:43.890> is<00:02:44.040> just<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.310> guess<00:02:44.520> I

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
September ain't that is just a guess I

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.699 
September ain't that is just a guess I
have<00:02:44.880> nothing<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.390> back<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.750> up<00:02:45.810> except<00:02:46.440> that

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
have nothing to back that up except that

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.699 
have nothing to back that up except that
it's<00:02:47.310> about<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:47.640> month<00:02:48.090> after<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.570> August<00:02:49.110> so

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
it's about a month after the August so

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.590 
it's about a month after the August so
that's<00:02:50.519> why<00:02:50.760> I'm<00:02:50.850> saying<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.330> it's<00:02:51.510> an

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
that's why I'm saying that it's an

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.210 
that's why I'm saying that it's an
educated<00:02:52.050> guess<00:02:52.320> because<00:02:52.680> it's<00:02:52.739> around<00:02:53.100> a

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
educated guess because it's around a

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.680 
educated guess because it's around a
month<00:02:53.459> since<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:54.150> early<00:02:55.050> August<00:02:55.700> date<00:02:56.700> so

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
month since the early August date so

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.930
