00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 there were very good all welcome to the 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.190
 channel of home experiments today we're going 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.580
 to learn how to pass a photo to a 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.580
 wood plank 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.869
 and for this we need a large table 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:17.509
 wooden medium transfer sheet 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:18.919
 a brush and a black and white photo 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:19.939
 are not worth the laser printers has to 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:21.529
 be ink printers 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.320
 surely find a table 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.550
 wood is very difficult or buy a 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.800
 Craft shop is excessively 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.390
 expensive what you can do is use a 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.390
 kitchen lid and cut the handle 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.370
 once we have our table ready 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.570
 we just have to extend with the 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.570
 brush the gel medium 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.120
 once we have extended women by 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.400
 the whole table we will simply have to 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.400
 go placing the photograph little by little 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.970
 yes 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.380
 if you want with a card you can go 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.070
 readying the surface so that no 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.070
 no bubble left 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.659
 once placed the fire on top of 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:29.469
 our wood we go through another 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.469
 medium gel coat 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.890
 and let it dry overnight 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.680
 and once last night we remove the 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.680
 folio 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.880
 and this would be the result 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.030
 person 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.619
 As you can see we have left something very 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.660
 vintage that you can leave on the wall of 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.980
 your room to decorate it in case 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.420
 you ask in medium gel you can 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.040
 get in craft stores 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.630
 good and we hope you liked it and 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.040

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.540
