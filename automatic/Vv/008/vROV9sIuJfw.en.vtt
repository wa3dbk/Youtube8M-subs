my joke for the year so I'm gonna take
some<00:04:01.950> butter<00:04:02.400> lettuce<00:04:02.670> and<00:04:03.030> add<00:04:03.180> in<00:04:03.389> some

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
some butter lettuce and add in some

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.970 
some butter lettuce and add in some
chicken<00:04:03.780> or<00:04:04.079> whatever<00:04:04.230> protein<00:04:04.769> that<00:04:04.859> you

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
chicken or whatever protein that you

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.030 
chicken or whatever protein that you
prefer<00:04:05.370> with<00:04:06.120> some<00:04:06.450> shredded<00:04:07.109> up<00:04:07.200> carrots<00:04:07.799> and

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
prefer with some shredded up carrots and

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.460 
prefer with some shredded up carrots and
then<00:04:08.489> some<00:04:08.880> of<00:04:09.030> these<00:04:09.180> they're<00:04:09.720> not<00:04:09.750> snap<00:04:10.170> peas

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
then some of these they're not snap peas

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.289
