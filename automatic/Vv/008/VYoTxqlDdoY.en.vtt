looking for Quirrell this is a little

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.250 
looking for Quirrell this is a little
bit<00:02:35.160> lighter<00:02:35.580> than<00:02:35.760> what<00:02:36.360> I<00:02:36.570> wanted<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.110> what

bit lighter than what I wanted and what

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.530 
bit lighter than what I wanted and what
is<00:02:37.440> sort<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.830> bright<00:02:38.070> coral<00:02:38.340> but<00:02:38.580> I<00:02:38.640> saw<00:02:39.360> this
