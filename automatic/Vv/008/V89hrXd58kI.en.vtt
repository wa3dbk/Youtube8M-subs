00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 our ancestors have always 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.410
 had to identify restaurant 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.260
 past his hands were stamped on 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.519
 paintings they made in the caves 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.799
 but today technological advances 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.719
 allow us to recognize a person not 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.029
 only by his footprints but also by his 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.270
 iris in the eyes modes or certain features 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.490
 of his behavior the so-called identification 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.380
 biometrics is already used very 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.939
 widely by the police for the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.680
 security intelligence agencies 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.689
 by governments in general but 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.149
 It is also a very useful tool in 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.670
 other areas such as public health or 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.610
 social policies in general about 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.110
 all in the least developed countries 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.350
 look at the details in this interesting 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.350
 reportage 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.920
 approximately 40% of children in the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.770
 developing world do not have a 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.500
 birth certificate in the south of 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:57.949
 asia this percentage reaches 63 percent 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.030
 percent in sub-Saharan Africa 55% 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.190
 if you want to open a bank account 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.019
 you need a driver's license or 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.030
 another ID card as a 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.770
 passport if you do not have a card 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.090
 identification will face serious 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.110
 problems to exercise their rights 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.120
 social and financial politicians 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.440
 but the solution to this problem could 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.440
 do not be too far 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.550
 Biometrics is not new new is that 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.250
 measurements fingerprints 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.470
 of the iris of the eye of the voice the features 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.840
 of the face can now be much more 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.670
 precise thanks to technology and 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.180
 now you can also record in a 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.180
 digital format 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.990
 technological advances in the 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.790
 biometric identification can help 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.590
 to create or strengthen systems of 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.180
 national identification but also 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.310
 can be used for others 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.619
 purposes such as providing access to 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.790
 banking and health insurance or combating 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.790
 corruption and waste 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.229
 the first application in which 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.409
 used biometrics to provide a 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.170
 service was in south africa in 1994 it 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.369
 used to distribute pensions they were 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.770
 took the fingerprints to the 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.479
 beneficiaries and then a cashier was devised 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.280
 automatic that can read fingerprints 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.170
 digital once a month 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.360
 beneficiaries went to the ATM 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.580
 and put their hands on the reader if the 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.320
 reader recognized them as beneficiaries 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.320
 the cashier gave them their pension 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.480
 India is at the forefront in this new 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.180
 biometric identification wave its 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.950
 universal identification program is 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.930
 the most ambitious project of registration 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.880
 biometric that has never been undertaken 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.519
 they have already benefited more than 1000 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.510
 millions of people 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.800
 Pakistan has also created a system 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.239
 National biometric identification 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.239
 called nothing 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.739
 Pakistan was the victim of a series of 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.540
 devastating floods in 2010 and the 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.549
 government wanted to distribute payments of 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.170
 help his citizens could do 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.420
 this in a few weeks because they had 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.610
 access to anyone's database and 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.130
 they could see who exactly lived in 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.290
 the affected areas then the help is 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.480
 He gave only affected the 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.040
 government could issue giza cards and 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.080
 citizens used these cards 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.150
 to verify their identity through 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.150
 nothing and in this way receive help 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.080
 Another advantage is that biometrics helps 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.739
 clean employee payrolls 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.930
 public 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.670
 many times plagued by workers 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.220
 ghosts that charge without exercising 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.520
 functions or that illegally collect two or 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.140
 three 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.240
 larios 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.650
 not all programs that take advantage 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.230
 Advances in biometric identification 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.330
 have been successful and biometrics has 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.030
 generated concerns related to 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.890
 privacy for example advances in 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.959
 facial recognition technologies 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.420
 could be exploited by governments 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.340
 to monitor its citizens without 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.740
 But until now the advantages have 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.330
 been much greater than its disadvantages and 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.680
 everything indicates that the industry of 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.680
 biometrics will continue to grow
