00:00:00.813 --> 00:00:03.460
 We are told to look at the rational numbers below and 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.596
 to arrange them from the least to the greatest. 

00:00:05.596 --> 00:00:07.094
 In fact, there was no need to tell us the first sentence, 

00:00:07.094 --> 00:00:09.311
 because I will know that I have to look at the rational numbers, 

00:00:09.311 --> 00:00:11.110
 to sort them from the least to the greatest. 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.722
 However, we are given 1/2, minus 5, 

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:17.460
 3.3, 0, 21 on 12, 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.247
 minus 5.5 and 2 whole and 1/8. 

00:00:20.247 --> 00:00:22.708
 The easiest way to visualize them is 

00:00:22.708 --> 00:00:25.865
 to draw a numerical axis that is long enough 

00:00:25.865 --> 00:00:28.384
 and can accommodate all these numbers. 

00:00:28.384 --> 00:00:30.625
 Then we can think about how to compare them. 

00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:34.224
 Let me draw a huge number of axes here. 

00:00:34.224 --> 00:00:38.043
 I'll take almost the entire screen. 

00:00:38.043 --> 00:00:40.446
 I'll stop here, I have a few negative numbers here, 

00:00:40.446 --> 00:00:42.524
 we go down to minus 5.5, 

00:00:42.524 --> 00:00:44.498
 and we have several positive integers, 

00:00:44.498 --> 00:00:47.087
 it looks like we're up to 3.3. 

00:00:47.087 --> 00:00:48.979
 This thing is still a little less than 2, 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:50.685
 so we get to 3.3. 

00:00:50.685 --> 00:00:53.506
 I can safely put it 

00:00:53.506 --> 00:00:55.561
 0 right here in the middle, 

00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:57.024
 I can move a bit to the right, because 

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:59.183
 our negative numbers are more negative. 

00:00:59.183 --> 00:01:01.702
 So 0 and let me do that 

00:01:01.702 --> 00:01:06.601
 minus 1, minus 2, minus 3, minus 4, 

00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:10.386
 minus 5, and that should be enough. 

00:01:10.386 --> 00:01:12.882
 Minus 5, and then in the positive direction we have 

00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:17.455
 1, 2, 3. 

00:01:17.455 --> 00:01:19.418
 Let's see if we can apply these points. 

00:01:19.418 --> 00:01:24.015
 To get started, let's look at 1/2. 

00:01:24.015 --> 00:01:26.360
 Where is 1/2, it is located ... 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.562
 Let me actually draw the divisions a bit better. 

00:01:30.562 --> 00:01:35.490
 This is 1, 2 and 3, and 4. 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.294
 Let's start with 1/2. 

00:01:38.294 --> 00:01:41.997
 1/2 is exactly between 0 and 1, 

00:01:41.997 --> 00:01:43.402
 it is half the whole. 

00:01:43.402 --> 00:01:46.049
 This will be one whole here. 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.103
 Let me mark it. 

00:01:48.103 --> 00:01:50.123
 One. 

00:01:50.123 --> 00:01:52.944
 So 1/2 is half between 0 and 1. 

00:01:52.944 --> 00:01:56.021
 1/2 will be right here. 

00:01:56.021 --> 00:01:59.562
 That's it, let's write it a little bigger, 

00:01:59.562 --> 00:02:01.047
 it's probably hard for you to read it. 

00:02:01.047 --> 00:02:03.079
 Okay, 1/2, 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.366
 which is also 

00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:07.398
 0.5. 

00:02:07.398 --> 00:02:09.185
 This is where it is. 

00:02:09.185 --> 00:02:11.893
 Then we have minus 5. 

00:02:11.893 --> 00:02:14.839
 Minus 5 - this is minus 1, minus 2, 

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:17.625
 minus 3, minus 4, minus 5. 

00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:21.096
 Minus 5 is here. 

00:02:21.096 --> 00:02:24.440
 And then we have 3.3. 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.597
 Plus 3.3, I'll write it in blue. 

00:02:27.597 --> 00:02:29.106
 Plus 3.3. 

00:02:29.106 --> 00:02:31.579
 1, 2, 3 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.738
 and then we want to move another 0.3. 

00:02:33.738 --> 00:02:36.385
 0.3 is about 1/3 of the distance, 

00:02:36.385 --> 00:02:37.836
 less than a third of it, 

00:02:37.836 --> 00:02:40.181
 it will be 3,333 to infinity, 

00:02:40.181 --> 00:02:41.563
 or 1/3 of the distance. 

00:02:41.563 --> 00:02:43.084
 1/3 of the distance 

00:02:43.084 --> 00:02:45.185
 looks somewhere here. 

00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:48.261
 That's 3, this is where it will be 

00:02:48.261 --> 00:02:51.721
 3.3. Let me mark it. 

00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:53.717
 I will now mark the numbers 

00:02:53.717 --> 00:02:57.734
 on the numerical axis here on top, so that 1, 2, 3, 

00:02:57.734 --> 00:03:01.855
 4, this is 0, minus 1, minus 2, 

00:03:01.855 --> 00:03:05.721
 minus 3, minus 4, minus 5 

00:03:05.721 --> 00:03:07.393
 etc. 

00:03:07.393 --> 00:03:09.633
 Then we reach 0, which is one of the numbers, 

00:03:09.633 --> 00:03:11.177
 which we have already recorded. 

00:03:11.177 --> 00:03:14.382
 0 is here on the numerical axis, 

00:03:14.382 --> 00:03:16.436
 so I will just write this 0 with orange to make it clear, 

00:03:16.436 --> 00:03:17.737
 this is this 0. 

00:03:17.737 --> 00:03:20.997
 Then we have 21 on 12, which is an irregular liver 

00:03:20.997 --> 00:03:23.019
 and to think 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.818
 where to put it 

00:03:24.818 --> 00:03:27.256
 on the numerical axis ... 

00:03:27.256 --> 00:03:29.137
 Let me put it in blue. 

00:03:29.137 --> 00:03:30.692
 To think, where to put this on the numerical axis, 

00:03:30.692 --> 00:03:32.759
 let's make it a mixed number, make it a bit 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.895
 easier to visualize, at least for me. 

00:03:34.895 --> 00:03:39.399
 12 is contained in 21 once. 

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:41.512
 1 in 12 is 12. 

00:03:41.512 --> 00:03:43.857
 If you pull out, you get a ... 

00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:46.794
 Here we can regroup or borrow ... 

00:03:46.794 --> 00:03:48.454
 If you do not want to do this in mind, 

00:03:48.454 --> 00:03:50.835
 to know you will get 9. But let's do it. 

00:03:50.835 --> 00:03:54.409
 If we take 1 of the pair, the pair becomes 1, 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.114
 this is 11 or we actually regroup 10. 

00:03:57.114 --> 00:04:00.713
 In any case, 11 minus 2 is 9, 1 minus 1 is 0. 

00:04:00.713 --> 00:04:02.234
 We have a residue of 9. 

00:04:02.234 --> 00:04:05.438
 This thing, written as a mixed number, 21 on 12 

00:04:05.438 --> 00:04:09.536
 written as a mixed number is 1 and 9/12. 

00:04:09.536 --> 00:04:11.115
 You get a 12/12 there 

00:04:11.115 --> 00:04:13.193
 and then you have left 9/12. 

00:04:13.193 --> 00:04:15.712
 1 whole and 9/12 we can also write as ... 

00:04:15.712 --> 00:04:18.289
 In fact, we had to make it simple at the beginning, 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:22.631
 because 21 and 12 are divided into 3, 

00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:26.372
 but now we can just divide 9, we can simplify 

00:04:26.372 --> 00:04:29.040
 9/12, we divide the numerator, 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.693
 and the denominator of 3. 

00:04:31.693 --> 00:04:36.016
 Then we get 1 and 3 on 4, 1 and 3/4. 

00:04:36.016 --> 00:04:37.514
 I will explain - I could simplify 

00:04:37.514 --> 00:04:40.734
 this at the beginning, 21 divided by 3 

00:04:40.734 --> 00:04:44.328
 is equal to 7 and 12 divided by 3 

00:04:44.328 --> 00:04:46.093
 is equal to 4. 

00:04:46.093 --> 00:04:48.345
 So this is the same thing as 7/4 

00:04:48.345 --> 00:04:51.491
 and if I had to divide 4 to 7, 

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:53.429
 4 is contained in 7 once, 

00:04:53.429 --> 00:04:55.566
 we remove, 1 in 4 is 4, 

00:04:55.566 --> 00:04:59.025
 and we get a remainder of 3. 1 whole and 3/4. 

00:04:59.025 --> 00:05:01.533
 Where will we put this number? 

00:05:01.533 --> 00:05:05.073
 It is 1 and then we have 3/4, 

00:05:05.073 --> 00:05:06.443
 we will travel 3/4 of the distance. 

00:05:06.443 --> 00:05:09.891
 That's half, it's 1/4, 2/4, 

00:05:09.891 --> 00:05:12.526
 3/4 - will be right there. 

00:05:12.526 --> 00:05:17.526
 This is 21 on 12, which is the same as 7/4, 

00:05:18.246 --> 00:05:21.465
 which is the same as 1 and 3/4. 

00:05:21.465 --> 00:05:24.228
 Then we have a minus 5.5. 

00:05:24.228 --> 00:05:27.833
 Minus 5.5 - I will write it again with purple, 

00:05:27.833 --> 00:05:29.081
 they finish my colors. 

00:05:29.081 --> 00:05:31.089
 Minus 5.5. This is minus 5, 

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:32.784
 meaning minus 5.5 will be between 

00:05:32.784 --> 00:05:35.106
 minus 5 and minus 6. 

00:05:35.106 --> 00:05:37.381
 Let me add a minus 6 to the numerical axis, 

00:05:37.381 --> 00:05:39.448
 to make it clear. 

00:05:39.448 --> 00:05:41.781
 Let me go a little further, 

00:05:41.781 --> 00:05:44.080
 let's say it's minus 6. 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.401
 Minus 6, the number axis going on 

00:05:46.401 --> 00:05:48.201
 to smaller values. 

00:05:48.201 --> 00:05:50.279
 Let me move a little left. 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:52.682
 Minus 6, so if we go to minus 5.5 

00:05:52.682 --> 00:05:56.722
 it will be between minus 5 and minus 6. 

00:05:56.722 --> 00:06:00.123
 This is minus 5, 5. 

00:06:00.123 --> 00:06:02.317
 Right there. 

00:06:02.317 --> 00:06:05.390
 And finally we have 2 and 1/8. 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.505
 I will write it again with orange, 

00:06:08.505 --> 00:06:09.782
 or not - I will write it in blue. 

00:06:09.782 --> 00:06:13.984
 2 whole and 1/8 is 2 and then 1/8. 

00:06:13.984 --> 00:06:15.958
 If we want to find the right place, 

00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.664
 we have to divide into eighths. 

00:06:17.664 --> 00:06:21.019
 It will be 4/8, it will be 2/8, 

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:23.260
 and this will be 6/8, 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.744
 then 1/8 will be right here. 

00:06:25.744 --> 00:06:29.239
 That's 2 whole and 1/8. 

00:06:29.239 --> 00:06:31.502
 In fact, we did 

00:06:31.502 --> 00:06:32.559
 in their exact places. 

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:33.940
 You do not need to pinpoint the exact locations, 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.415
 if you just try to sort them, 

00:06:35.415 --> 00:06:39.002
 but do not interfere with seeing 

00:06:39.002 --> 00:06:40.464
 exactly where they are. 

00:06:40.464 --> 00:06:41.939
 Now we've sorted them because 

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:43.831
 we put them on this numerical axis. 

00:06:43.831 --> 00:06:46.466
 The order is ... Minus 5.5 is the smallest, 

00:06:46.466 --> 00:06:49.345
 then minus 5, then 0, 

00:06:49.345 --> 00:06:54.345
 then plus 1/2, then 21 on 12 then 2 and 1/8, 

00:06:54.813 --> 00:06:57.228
 and finally 3.3. 

00:06:57.228 --> 00:06:58.679
 And we're ready.
