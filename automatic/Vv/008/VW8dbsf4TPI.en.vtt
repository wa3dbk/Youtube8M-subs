00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
power to have p1 pedals you should show

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.889 
power to have p1 pedals you should show
how<00:00:05.430> simple<00:00:05.759> it<00:00:05.819> is<00:00:05.910> what<00:00:06.569> you've<00:00:06.660> got<00:00:06.810> is

how simple it is what you've got is

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.299 
how simple it is what you've got is
effectively<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.410> standard<00:00:07.770> pedal<00:00:08.040> for<00:00:08.220> my

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
effectively a standard pedal for my

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.830 
effectively a standard pedal for my
installation<00:00:08.550> standpoint<00:00:09.150> I'm<00:00:09.660> gonna<00:00:09.780> go

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
installation standpoint I'm gonna go

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.749 
installation standpoint I'm gonna go
ahead<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.080> take<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.650> left-hand<00:00:11.010> side<00:00:11.219> here

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:13.759 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:25.099 

simply<00:00:14.759> twist<00:00:14.910> on<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:23.150> and<00:00:24.150> then<00:00:24.510> from<00:00:25.019> a

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
simply twist on in and then from a

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.210 
simply twist on in and then from a
torque<00:00:25.350> perspective<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:25.890> don't<00:00:25.920> have<00:00:26.130> to

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
torque perspective you don't have to

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.580 
torque perspective you don't have to
have<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.720> any<00:00:27.720> torque<00:00:28.170> wrench<00:00:28.349> for<00:00:28.439> anything

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
have a any torque wrench for anything

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.509 
have a any torque wrench for anything
like<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.769> you're<00:00:29.010> just<00:00:29.130> gonna<00:00:29.220> go<00:00:29.369> ahead<00:00:29.429> and

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
like that you're just gonna go ahead and

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.330 
like that you're just gonna go ahead and
get<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.760> fairly<00:00:29.880> tight<00:00:30.140> nothing<00:00:31.140> that's<00:00:31.340> too

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
get it fairly tight nothing that's too

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.940 
get it fairly tight nothing that's too
crazy<00:00:32.520> but<00:00:32.880> just<00:00:33.059> enough<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.770> feels<00:00:34.770> snug

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
crazy but just enough that feels snug

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.709 
crazy but just enough that feels snug
and<00:00:35.520> it'll<00:00:35.850> go<00:00:35.940> ahead<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.239> automatically

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
and it'll go ahead and automatically

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:37.549 
and it'll go ahead and automatically
tighten<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:37.020> bit<00:00:37.170> more<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.530> then

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
tighten a bit more and then

00:00:37.559 --> 00:01:02.080 
tighten a bit more and then
automatically<00:00:38.190> calibrate<00:00:38.460> as<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.910> go<00:00:39.000> along

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.470 

there<00:01:03.090> we<00:01:03.180> go

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
there we go

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.210 
there we go
that's<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.989> installation<00:01:04.739> portion<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.129> that

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
that's the installation portion of that

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.620 
that's the installation portion of that
and<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.820> last<00:01:06.060> thing<00:01:06.240> we'll<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.479> we'll

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
and the last thing we'll do is we'll

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.899 
and the last thing we'll do is we'll
come<00:01:06.689> from<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.020> head<00:01:07.140> unit<00:01:07.430> and<00:01:08.430> we'll<00:01:08.580> go<00:01:08.670> ahead

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
come from a head unit and we'll go ahead

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.100 
come from a head unit and we'll go ahead
and<00:01:09.000> do<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> manual<00:01:09.330> zero<00:01:09.659> on<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.869> head<00:01:09.990> unit

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
and do a manual zero on the head unit

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.649 
and do a manual zero on the head unit
itself<00:01:10.880> okay<00:01:11.880> now<00:01:12.000> we've<00:01:12.150> got<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> pedals

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
itself okay now we've got the pedals

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.179 
itself okay now we've got the pedals
physically<00:01:13.049> installed<00:01:13.409> we're<00:01:13.950> going<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.130> need

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
physically installed we're going to need

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.499 
physically installed we're going to need
to<00:01:14.369> go<00:01:14.549> ahead<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.820> pair<00:01:15.000> them<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.299> our<00:01:15.390> head

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
to go ahead and pair them to our head

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.510 
to go ahead and pair them to our head
unit<00:01:15.720> two<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:15.990> calibrate<00:01:16.470> them<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.430> this

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
unit two and calibrate them so in this

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.130 
unit two and calibrate them so in this
case<00:01:17.700> I've<00:01:17.880> got<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.119> dual<00:01:18.299> GPS<00:01:18.689> I'm<00:01:18.900> gonna<00:01:19.080> go

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
case I've got the dual GPS I'm gonna go

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.020 
case I've got the dual GPS I'm gonna go
up<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.350> sensors<00:01:19.710> I'm<00:01:20.280> going<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.580> enter<00:01:20.909> into

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
up to sensors I'm going to enter into

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.510 
up to sensors I'm going to enter into
that<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:22.110> I'm<00:01:22.229> going<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.860> select<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.369> bike

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
that and I'm going to select the bike

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.690 
that and I'm going to select the bike
that<00:01:23.700> already<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:24.409> edit<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.580> and<00:01:26.580> I'm

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
that already have edit that and I'm

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.179 
that already have edit that and I'm
gonna<00:01:26.820> go<00:01:26.880> ahead<00:01:27.060> down<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.509> power<00:01:28.290> sensors<00:01:28.829> and

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
gonna go ahead down to power sensors and

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.850 
gonna go ahead down to power sensors and
get<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> new<00:01:29.729> power<00:01:29.909> sensor<00:01:30.360> paired<00:01:30.630> up<00:01:30.750> here<00:01:30.930> so

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
get a new power sensor paired up here so

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.149 
get a new power sensor paired up here so
in<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:32.549> case<00:01:32.820> I'm<00:01:33.509> gonna<00:01:33.659> go<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.040> I'm<00:01:35.040> going

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
in this case I'm gonna go and I'm going

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.620 
in this case I'm gonna go and I'm going
to<00:01:35.220> manually<00:01:35.520> enter<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.820> anti<00:01:36.210> D<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.479> there

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
to manually enter the anti D in there

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.399 
to manually enter the anti D in there
because<00:01:36.900> I've<00:01:36.990> got<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.140> couple<00:01:37.290> different

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
because I've got a couple different

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.050 
because I've got a couple different
sensor<00:01:38.189> IDs<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.670> are<00:01:38.759> floating<00:01:38.970> around

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
sensor IDs that are floating around

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.999 
sensor IDs that are floating around
right<00:01:39.299> now<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:40.049> anti<00:01:40.259> D<00:01:40.320> for<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.619> one<00:01:40.860> is

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
right now so the anti D for this one is

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.660 
right now so the anti D for this one is
fifty<00:01:41.400> two<00:01:41.610> zero<00:01:42.030> seven<00:01:42.270> one<00:01:46.579> normally<00:01:47.579> you

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
fifty two zero seven one normally you

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.920 
fifty two zero seven one normally you
can<00:01:47.820> just<00:01:48.000> search<00:01:48.180> on<00:01:48.329> your<00:01:48.450> bike<00:01:48.570> if<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.810> got

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
can just search on your bike if you got

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.810 
can just search on your bike if you got
nothing<00:01:49.200> around<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:49.530> there<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.369> lot<00:01:50.700> of

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
nothing around but there is a lot of

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.120 
nothing around but there is a lot of
power<00:01:50.970> meters<00:01:51.299> around<00:01:51.750> me<00:01:51.840> right<00:01:51.990> now<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.409> I

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
power meters around me right now so I

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.340 
power meters around me right now so I
would<00:01:53.460> end<00:01:53.549> up<00:01:53.759> finding<00:01:54.030> all<00:01:54.540> sorts<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:55.140> stuff

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
would end up finding all sorts of stuff

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:03.910 
would end up finding all sorts of stuff
that<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.560> don't<00:01:55.619> really<00:01:55.829> want<00:01:56.270> 5207<00:01:57.270> one

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.350 

there<00:02:04.920> we<00:02:05.040> go<00:02:05.160> and<00:02:05.550> it<00:02:05.700> should<00:02:05.850> find<00:02:06.120> this<00:02:06.210> here

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
there we go and it should find this here

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.470 
there we go and it should find this here
in<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.510> second<00:02:08.030> okay<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.060> went<00:02:09.150> ahead<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.390> just

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:09.480 
in a second okay I went ahead and just

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.570 
in a second okay I went ahead and just
spun<00:02:09.930> the<00:02:10.020> crank<00:02:10.260> there<00:02:10.410> why<00:02:10.560> cut<00:02:11.220> away<00:02:11.370> just

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.670 
spun the crank there why cut away just
to<00:02:11.670> get<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.880> woken<00:02:12.240> up<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.510> then<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:13.530> know

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
to get it woken up and then you know

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.800 
to get it woken up and then you know
you'll<00:02:13.830> see<00:02:13.890> it's<00:02:14.100> paired<00:02:14.580> there<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.450> I'll<00:02:15.690> go

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
you'll see it's paired there and I'll go

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.740 
you'll see it's paired there and I'll go
it<00:02:15.960> up<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.700> activate<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.730> sensor<00:02:20.600> and<00:02:21.600> then

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
it up to activate that sensor and then

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.570 
it up to activate that sensor and then
we'll<00:02:21.930> go<00:02:22.050> back<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.470> just<00:02:22.560> do<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.860> calibration

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
we'll go back and just do a calibration

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.370 
we'll go back and just do a calibration
so<00:02:24.420> we'll<00:02:24.540> go<00:02:24.600> into<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.810> calibration<00:02:25.260> menu

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
so we'll go into the calibration menu

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.510 
so we'll go into the calibration menu
and<00:02:26.190> it'll<00:02:27.000> start<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.420> search<00:02:27.540> for<00:02:27.780> them<00:02:27.900> and

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
and it'll start and search for them and

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.130 
and it'll start and search for them and
there's<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.760> manual<00:02:30.300> zero<00:02:30.570> right<00:02:30.720> there<00:02:30.900> so

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
there's the manual zero right there so

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.870 
there's the manual zero right there so
simple<00:02:31.470> as<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.710> at<00:02:32.340> this<00:02:32.430> point<00:02:32.610> we're<00:02:32.850> ready

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
simple as that at this point we're ready

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.180 
simple as that at this point we're ready
to<00:02:33.060> go
