00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.070
 hello here kiki gorillas today 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.419
 we will see how to make a 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.029
 big bomb firstly you go 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:20.279
 buy shares and so that's the best 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.480
 it's taking them medical when 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.830
 red yellows have a little bit of everything 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.840
 that's the problem to make a rosette 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:35.370
 it's finding it triangular pavers 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.400
 what does not exist or does it exist 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.040
 but are not the very pretty 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:44.339
 so the best is to do them yourself 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.839
 even so you take a lapidary with 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:51.269
 of course a special stone cuts 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:55.199
 for the record and I actually took 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:57.930
 the cobblestones and as you want to see I have 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.140
 cut into a triangle so in fact I 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.939
 just cut off half the pavement and with a 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.939
 chisel or screwdriver you type his 

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:10.969
 crate all alone so here you do 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:15.780
 the first row in triangle then 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:19.039
 you alternate a normal square pad with 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.039
 a triangle 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:29.939
 then you take three pavers to the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:37.009
 continuation and a triangle as you can 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:37.009
 see him a triangle a triangle ap 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:50.840
 and then once you did so 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.710
 the triangles in the middle the first the 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.009
 first round around 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:59.390
 the second round you continue that with 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:02.679
 space enough bets so I have 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:06.409
 put all this on a bed of sand 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:08.720
 knowing that you still have to take a 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.009
 hammer and a wooden cane for good 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.170
 the kids it's in for not after 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.730
 that it moves normally if you 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.190
 do that it moves more and after you 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.110
 you put the tree top with a 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.209
 broom attached to you and as I come from 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:28.269
 to do and it's impeccable 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:31.220
 other small precision when the 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:34.220
 first round with customers so you 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.099
 do it with the level of course and 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.930
 then everything else is of course 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.450
 with a ruler and you ask the team to 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.299
 on it to see if everything is good 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.069
 if you have any questions please 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.730
 not a good day 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.730
 thank you
