also seems like come on attack him thank
you<00:03:35.310> it<00:03:35.790> also<00:03:35.940> seems<00:03:36.299> like<00:03:36.680> his<00:03:37.680> attacks<00:03:38.069> are

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
you it also seems like his attacks are

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.059 
you it also seems like his attacks are
wider<00:03:38.670> as<00:03:39.000> well<00:03:39.389> so<00:03:39.720> you<00:03:39.780> have<00:03:40.019> to<00:03:40.139> roll

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
wider as well so you have to roll

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.849 
wider as well so you have to roll
further<00:03:41.430> in<00:03:41.670> order<00:03:41.819> to<00:03:41.910> avoid<00:03:42.239> his<00:03:42.359> attacks

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
further in order to avoid his attacks

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.780 
further in order to avoid his attacks
now<00:03:43.859> hopefully<00:03:44.220> we'll<00:03:44.340> be<00:03:44.430> able<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.579> see

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
now hopefully we'll be able to see

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.309 
now hopefully we'll be able to see
something<00:03:45.540> in<00:03:45.750> a<00:03:45.840> moment

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
something in a moment

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.699 
something in a moment
all<00:03:47.860> right<00:03:47.980> so<00:03:48.360> whatever<00:03:49.360> his<00:03:49.870> ears<00:03:50.200> cover<00:03:50.530> his

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
all right so whatever his ears cover his

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.740 
all right so whatever his ears cover his
face<00:03:50.860> like<00:03:51.099> this<00:03:51.280> that<00:03:51.969> means<00:03:52.269> that<00:03:52.629> he's

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
face like this that means that he's

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.699 
face like this that means that he's
enraged<00:03:53.079> and<00:03:55.109> basically<00:03:56.109> when<00:03:56.349> he's<00:03:56.439> in<00:03:56.560> race

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
enraged and basically when he's in race

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.199 
enraged and basically when he's in race

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
right now that's the move I was just

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.290 
right now that's the move I was just
talking<00:04:39.520> about<00:04:39.550> right<00:04:39.789> there<00:04:41.789> he<00:04:42.789> really<00:04:43.000> is

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
talking about right there he really is

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.360 
talking about right there he really is
just<00:04:43.330> not<00:04:43.930> doing<00:04:44.470> very<00:04:44.740> much<00:04:44.770> it's<00:04:45.220> really

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
just not doing very much it's really

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.400 
just not doing very much it's really
easy<00:04:45.699> to<00:04:45.880> avoid<00:04:46.150> the<00:04:46.360> tax<00:04:46.599> for<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:46.960> most<00:04:47.139> part

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
easy to avoid the tax for the most part

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.750 
easy to avoid the tax for the most part
but<00:04:47.979> he<00:04:48.130> can<00:04:48.310> be<00:04:48.430> tricky<00:04:48.940> if<00:04:49.259> you're<00:04:50.760> somebody

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
but he can be tricky if you're somebody

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.339 
but he can be tricky if you're somebody
that's<00:04:51.880> knew<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:52.330> series<00:04:52.630> you<00:04:52.750> I<00:04:53.050> don't<00:04:53.260> know

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:53.349 
that's knew the series you I don't know

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:55.429 
that's knew the series you I don't know
what<00:04:53.470> to<00:04:53.560> really<00:04:53.680> expect

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:55.439 
what to really expect

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:58.279 
what to really expect
well<00:04:56.369> usually<00:04:56.580> if<00:04:56.969> he<00:04:57.119> turns<00:04:57.839> his<00:04:58.019> head<00:04:58.050> and

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
well usually if he turns his head and

00:04:58.289 --> 00:04:59.989 
well usually if he turns his head and
looks<00:04:58.469> at<00:04:58.589> you<00:04:58.739> that<00:04:59.459> means<00:04:59.699> he's<00:04:59.819> gonna

00:04:59.989 --> 00:04:59.999 
looks at you that means he's gonna

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:02.929 
looks at you that means he's gonna
attack<00:05:00.330> you<00:05:00.689> so<00:05:01.249> you<00:05:02.249> definitely<00:05:02.550> want<00:05:02.909> to

00:05:02.929 --> 00:05:02.939 
attack you so you definitely want to

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:05.179 
attack you so you definitely want to
throw<00:05:03.599> out<00:05:03.629> of<00:05:03.809> the<00:05:03.929> way<00:05:04.110> if<00:05:04.709> he<00:05:04.800> does<00:05:04.949> that

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:05.189 
throw out of the way if he does that

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:06.979 
throw out of the way if he does that
otherwise<00:05:05.879> I<00:05:06.059> just<00:05:06.239> kind<00:05:06.389> of<00:05:06.449> sit<00:05:06.719> real<00:05:06.959> close

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:06.989 
otherwise I just kind of sit real close

00:05:06.989 --> 00:05:09.919 
otherwise I just kind of sit real close
to<00:05:07.349> him<00:05:07.439> and<00:05:07.529> I<00:05:07.589> just<00:05:07.769> keep<00:05:07.919> attacking<00:05:08.339> him<00:05:08.929> of

weapon<00:05:12.899> I<00:05:15.080> did<00:05:16.080> not<00:05:16.169> want<00:05:16.319> to<00:05:16.349> get<00:05:16.499> that<00:05:16.679> I

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:16.739 
weapon I did not want to get that I

00:05:16.739 --> 00:05:18.619 
weapon I did not want to get that I
wanted<00:05:16.979> to<00:05:17.069> climb<00:05:17.309> where<00:05:18.179> is<00:05:18.239> he<00:05:18.300> going

oh he's actually leaving okay so he

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:23.449 
oh he's actually leaving okay so he

water<00:05:32.249> over<00:05:32.579> when<00:05:32.849> I<00:05:32.879> first<00:05:33.119> saw<00:05:33.269> him<00:05:33.419> I

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:33.509 
water over when I first saw him I

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:35.239 
water over when I first saw him I
thought<00:05:33.539> he<00:05:33.779> might<00:05:33.899> be<00:05:33.959> fire<00:05:34.289> and<00:05:34.589> he's

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:35.249 
thought he might be fire and he's

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:41.179 
thought he might be fire and he's
running<00:05:35.459> away<00:05:35.610> is<00:05:36.269> he<00:05:36.360> limping<00:05:39.589> so<00:05:40.589> anyway<00:05:41.009> he

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:41.189 
running away is he limping so anyway he

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:43.790 
running away is he limping so anyway he
is<00:05:41.279> actually<00:05:41.699> water<00:05:41.999> element<00:05:42.649> you<00:05:43.649> could

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
is actually water element you could

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.469 
is actually water element you could
actually<00:05:43.919> get<00:05:44.129> water<00:05:44.339> blended<00:05:44.669> from<00:05:44.789> him<00:05:44.999> he

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
actually get water blended from him he

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.629 
actually get water blended from him he
shoots<00:05:45.779> water<00:05:45.959> out<00:05:46.259> of<00:05:46.379> his<00:05:46.499> nose<00:05:46.769> out<00:05:47.369> of<00:05:47.489> his

shoots water out of his nose out of his

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.619 
shoots water out of his nose out of his
trunk<00:05:47.999> I<00:05:48.149> guess<00:05:49.669> for<00:05:50.669> that<00:05:50.789> reason<00:05:51.059> I<00:05:51.119> suggest

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:51.629 
trunk I guess for that reason I suggest
