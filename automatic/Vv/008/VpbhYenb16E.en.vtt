00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:10.180 
this is the time cloud tell me how

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.609 
this is the time cloud tell me how
important<00:00:10.510> the<00:00:10.570> warm-up<00:00:10.869> piece<00:00:11.049> for<00:00:11.260> a<00:00:11.289> time

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:11.619 
important the warm-up piece for a time

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:13.039 
important the warm-up piece for a time
trial<00:00:11.920> it's<00:00:12.129> essentially<00:00:12.580> if<00:00:12.639> you<00:00:12.699> want<00:00:12.879> to

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
trial it's essentially if you want to

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.430 
trial it's essentially if you want to
survive<00:00:14.049> a<00:00:14.110> time<00:00:14.379> trial<00:00:14.680> and<00:00:15.750> so<00:00:16.750> it's<00:00:16.960> a<00:00:17.170> it's

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:17.440 
survive a time trial and so it's a it's

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.980 
survive a time trial and so it's a it's
primarily<00:00:17.980> just<00:00:18.070> you<00:00:18.520> know<00:00:18.609> get<00:00:18.789> the<00:00:18.990> the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
primarily just you know get the the

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.779 
primarily just you know get the the
engine<00:00:20.289> up<00:00:20.410> and<00:00:20.500> running<00:00:20.589> again<00:00:20.890> you<00:00:21.609> still

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:21.789 
engine up and running again you still

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.359 
engine up and running again you still
still<00:00:22.179> need<00:00:22.359> to<00:00:22.449> warm<00:00:22.660> up<00:00:22.830> weather<00:00:23.830> means

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
still need to warm up weather means

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.819 
still need to warm up weather means
there<00:00:24.669> you<00:00:25.630> want<00:00:25.839> to<00:00:25.990> survive<00:00:26.230> the<00:00:26.410> time<00:00:26.529> trial

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:26.829 
there you want to survive the time trial

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:28.829 
there you want to survive the time trial
or<00:00:27.009> you're<00:00:27.189> going<00:00:27.339> for<00:00:27.579> the<00:00:27.640> win<00:00:27.759> you<00:00:28.599> want<00:00:28.779> to

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:28.839 
or you're going for the win you want to

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:30.210 
or you're going for the win you want to
finish<00:00:28.990> it<00:00:29.169> as<00:00:29.259> close<00:00:29.499> to<00:00:29.650> your<00:00:29.769> actual

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
finish it as close to your actual

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.850 
finish it as close to your actual
starting<00:00:30.609> time<00:00:30.789> as<00:00:30.909> possible<00:00:31.060> I<00:00:31.529> don't<00:00:32.529> think

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
starting time as possible I don't think

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.260 
starting time as possible I don't think
you<00:00:32.980> can<00:00:33.130> they<00:00:33.310> get<00:00:33.579> through<00:00:33.790> a<00:00:33.820> time<00:00:34.030> trial

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
you can they get through a time trial

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.660 
you can they get through a time trial
easily<00:00:34.660> it's<00:00:35.620> going<00:00:35.830> to<00:00:35.890> be<00:00:35.980> spitting<00:00:36.460> snot

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
easily it's going to be spitting snot

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.850 
easily it's going to be spitting snot
everywhere<00:00:36.700> no<00:00:37.420> matter<00:00:37.600> how<00:00:37.750> you<00:00:37.810> a<00:00:37.960> high

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
everywhere no matter how you a high

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.900 
everywhere no matter how you a high
rider<00:00:39.390> but<00:00:40.770> luckily<00:00:41.770> I<00:00:41.890> have<00:00:41.980> my<00:00:42.130> half<00:00:42.790> the

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
rider but luckily I have my half the

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.590 
rider but luckily I have my half the
watt<00:00:43.090> so<00:00:43.360> I<00:00:43.680> there<00:00:44.680> I<00:00:45.670> think<00:00:45.910> I'm<00:00:46.000> gonna<00:00:46.120> keep

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
watt so I there I think I'm gonna keep

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.280 
watt so I there I think I'm gonna keep
it<00:00:46.720> around<00:00:46.900> the<00:00:47.550> 360<00:00:48.550> but<00:00:48.700> I<00:00:48.760> mean<00:00:49.170> that's<00:00:50.170> a

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
it around the 360 but I mean that's a

00:00:50.290 --> 00:01:00.120 
it around the 360 but I mean that's a
lot<00:00:50.380> easier<00:00:50.710> said<00:00:50.860> than<00:00:51.010> done<00:00:51.070> right<00:00:51.220> now<00:00:59.130> I'm

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
lot easier said than done right now I'm

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.800 
lot easier said than done right now I'm

gorgeous ship TT bike and some of the
tech<00:01:05.979> involved<00:01:06.430> let's<00:01:06.700> start<00:01:06.939> with<00:01:07.090> the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
tech involved let's start with the

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.359 
tech involved let's start with the
wheels<00:01:07.749> they're<00:01:08.020> both<00:01:08.200> zip<00:01:08.530> there<00:01:08.799> is<00:01:09.009> a<00:01:09.039> disk

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
wheels they're both zip there is a disk

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.520 
wheels they're both zip there is a disk
in<00:01:10.240> the<00:01:10.359> front<00:01:10.600> so<00:01:10.719> 808<00:01:11.109> they're<00:01:11.289> running

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
in the front so 808 they're running

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.289 
in the front so 808 they're running
today<00:01:11.679> and<00:01:12.159> on<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:12.490> dista<00:01:12.850> in<00:01:13.179> the

tubular we would die gripped in compound

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.380 
tubular we would die gripped in compound
so<00:01:17.799> in<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.490> special<00:01:18.729> e<00:01:18.880> with<00:01:18.999> these<00:01:19.149> dodgy

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
so in the special e with these dodgy

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.120 
so in the special e with these dodgy
conditions<00:01:20.020> they're<00:01:20.170> going<00:01:20.350> to<00:01:20.409> be<00:01:20.530> given<00:01:20.979> a

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.209

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
really good edge on grip today so it's

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:26.309 
really good edge on grip today so it's
