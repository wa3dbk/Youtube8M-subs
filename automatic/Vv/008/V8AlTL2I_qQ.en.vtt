00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.770
 that's why everyone is welcome one more day in 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.060
 my channel is the schleimer and today 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:17.640
 We will analyze the jet stream vehicle and the 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.770
 skylanders harry caine 'get back' that 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.990
 they have released a gameplay and photos with a 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.270
 rifle not several and to start knowing that 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.099
 jet stream is a super aerial vehicle 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.380
 char who is and runs like that and 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.779
 corresponds with harry caine get back 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.189
 that's why the attachments have served 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.260
 several photos since we have them in 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.239
 screen right now but that already makes 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.910
 time but the important thing is the new 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.190
 gameplay of this vehicle and the jet pack 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.019
 3 because you do not analyze others 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.289
 very easy vehicles simply that 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.760
 they are very seen and it's worth so good 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.440
 if you want me to make them leave me a 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.570
 comment saying that if you want the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.239
 analysis of such a vehicle such that it 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.949
 anime and come from hot street and speed 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.350
 fashion now what I remember and what 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.510
 they were not going to go like that 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.309
 example the vehicle is known magic 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.440
 and unknown skylanders magic well no 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.200
 I have no idea, but some people 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.409
 see, I'm going to see what attacks 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.840
 has I do not know what I do not know how much and it paints 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.659
 all right 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.090
 and well here we already have that implies that 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.670
 we see it little blue and white roll 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.280
 very cool technology air found 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.920
 jetpack is mounted and something you do not understand 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.909
 because it has three different forms 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.759
 let's see the first one that of the 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.770
 introduction without golden wings then it comes out 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.299
 with bad gilt and at the moment of 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.819
 It mounted 'get back' sets and 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:38.030
 completely blue and some mini wings 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:40.069
 gilt forward is not something weird since 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.319
 is a l thought in the second form 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:44.149
 before mounting the 610 back is like a 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.819
 mix between the two nor totally 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:50.060
 transformed is not totally blue 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:51.709
 in jet back mode but it's modified 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.479
 Normal is not like normal then 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:56.000
 I have no idea all the photos that have 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.530
 come out photo or not of gameplay but the 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.329
 photo is that the practitioner has left 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.579
 first day appears in the transformation 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.610
 already final is totally blue with the mini 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.739
 golden candles can not be that 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.019
 setting a trap so they do not know 

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:11.510
 I will make a mini video to explain how 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.819
 goes when there is more detail but to 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.530
 who does not know in the trap is not going to 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.510
 have villains simply if they are 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.140
 mounted on a vehicle is that it will adopt 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.150
 the element 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.540
 the trap is worth you for example you have to 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.550
 hot street you put a water trap and 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.319
 will have water attacks and the fight of 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.270
 appearance will change a bit although it will be 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.000
 a little mess because if you put on hot street 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.310
 then you put spitfire modified then 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.080
 put one of water I do not know maybe 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.480
 it only changes the attack and the physical 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.709
 I do not think it's a bit warm up a car 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.520
 of fire firing some water but 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.520
 good 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.280
 and then well we have how it would continue 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.410
 playing vale we also have a 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.120
 little part where it comes out I think speed 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.520
 fail I think it's also come out a bit 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.290
 more piloting the ones without that way of 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.930
 jetpack is obviously much more lucid 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.090
 the way to 'get back' but look there what 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.190
 we have another one where they come out 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.560
 modifying it with wings made of 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.990
 fabric let's go from the back valer we have 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.590
 Photos 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.180
 and we have gameplays so good for 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.490
 to start receives the name of harry caine 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.170
 get back we have different attacks one 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.110
 of them is quite similar to the one 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.180
 had before is the second one that is when 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.250
 They absorb, I do not know if you remember because it attracts 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.440
 enemies and destroys ranges from 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.360
 your weapon but this time it does not absorb them 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.460
 completely but when it will absorb 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.950
 if it does not catch the enemies in the air 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.200
 all medium-light size can not be a 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.310
 golem of your huge and then you can 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.290
 throw another attack that is the first one that 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.500
 launches like a kind of golden disk 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.540
 not as roger fans but is accompanied 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.310
 like a gust of air, that is, when 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.650
 principle seems like the 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.530
 first with a flurry of air but without 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.980
 happen in some pictures is one is a 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:59.110
 disk and without pressing and quickly 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.519
 and the last that creates a tornado 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.599
 if the new porsche is called harry caine 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:07.209
 tornado and trapped enemies 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.680
 physically cool there, the new one is cool 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.080
 appearance that they have given to me 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.819
 sincerely 'get back' is one of those 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.069
 I like really like her 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.570
 appearance and with the suit and now I 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.959
 even more sincerely the have 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.840
 improved enough, and sincerely, not 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.389
 I have more nothing more to say, okay, not what 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.110
 I wanted to do very long and good I hope 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.580
