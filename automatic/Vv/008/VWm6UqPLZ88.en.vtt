00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
making sure to make a video for guys I

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.609 
making sure to make a video for guys I
want<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.450> guys<00:01:36.630> listen<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.170> car<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
want you guys listen to the car and the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:54.300 
want you guys listen to the car and the
horn<00:01:37.829> for<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.100> quick<00:01:38.250> second<00:01:38.610> though

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.490 

so<00:01:55.310> it<00:01:55.430> has<00:01:55.579> a<00:01:55.610> pretty<00:01:55.939> cool<00:01:56.049> horn<00:01:57.049> I<00:01:57.289> think

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
so it has a pretty cool horn I think

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.050 
so it has a pretty cool horn I think
there's<00:01:57.799> three<00:01:58.039> different<00:01:58.219> types<00:01:58.579> of<00:01:58.759> horns

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
there's three different types of horns

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.459 
there's three different types of horns
and<00:01:59.270> every<00:01:59.509> time<00:01:59.689> you<00:01:59.869> start<00:02:00.079> you<00:02:00.289> get<00:02:00.439> a

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
and every time you start you get a

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:02.709 
and every time you start you get a
different<00:02:00.950> one<00:02:01.100> so<00:02:01.729> all<00:02:02.149> those<00:02:02.329> sounds<00:02:02.479> were

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
different one so all those sounds were

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.469 
different one so all those sounds were
me<00:02:02.869> doing<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.259> horns<00:02:03.530> on<00:02:03.679> and<00:02:03.860> off<00:02:03.969> it's<00:02:04.969> able

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
me doing the horns on and off it's able

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.209 
me doing the horns on and off it's able
to<00:02:05.630> use<00:02:05.869> Franklin's<00:02:06.320> driving<00:02:06.679> ability<00:02:07.070> like

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
to use Franklin's driving ability like

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.850 
to use Franklin's driving ability like
all<00:02:07.429> vehicles<00:02:07.939> it<00:02:08.810> looks<00:02:08.989> pretty<00:02:09.200> cool<00:02:09.379> once
