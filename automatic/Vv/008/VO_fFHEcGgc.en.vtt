gentle<00:04:39.920> I'm<00:04:40.920> just<00:04:41.100> gonna<00:04:41.220> sweep<00:04:41.490> this<00:04:41.640> over

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
gentle I'm just gonna sweep this over

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.760 
gentle I'm just gonna sweep this over
the<00:04:41.910> top<00:04:42.090> and<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:43.110> reason<00:04:43.410> why<00:04:43.500> I'm<00:04:43.620> wetting

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
the top and the reason why I'm wetting

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.440 
the top and the reason why I'm wetting
the<00:04:43.890> brush<00:04:44.070> is<00:04:44.250> because<00:04:44.280> it<00:04:44.670> gives<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:45.090> powder

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
the brush is because it gives the powder

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.070 
the brush is because it gives the powder
more<00:04:45.660> intensity<00:04:47.570> like<00:04:48.570> I<00:04:48.690> needed<00:04:48.870> more

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
more intensity like I needed more

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.709 
more intensity like I needed more
intensity<00:04:49.500> with<00:04:49.830> this<00:04:49.950> makeup

00:04:54.709 --> 00:04:54.719 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:56.869 

and<00:04:54.959> then<00:04:55.830> we<00:04:55.919> have<00:04:56.099> a<00:04:56.129> really<00:04:56.429> nice<00:04:56.580> natural

00:04:56.869 --> 00:04:56.879 
and then we have a really nice natural

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.360 
and then we have a really nice natural
dialogue
