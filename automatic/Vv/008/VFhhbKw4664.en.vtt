little<00:03:11.349> rubber<00:03:11.500> feet<00:03:11.680> in<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.099> front<00:03:12.340> of<00:03:12.430> the

little rubber feet in the front of the

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.050 
little rubber feet in the front of the
pedal<00:03:13.769> which<00:03:14.769> make<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.160> impossible<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.760> do

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
pedal which make it impossible to do

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.059

little<00:03:18.340> rubber<00:03:18.459> feet<00:03:18.610> out<00:03:19.000> so<00:03:19.930> if<00:03:20.379> you<00:03:20.530> have<00:03:20.680> a

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
little rubber feet out so if you have a

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.229 
little rubber feet out so if you have a
wah-wah<00:03:20.980> and<00:03:21.310> you<00:03:21.370> want<00:03:21.579> to<00:03:21.700> do<00:03:21.790> this<00:03:21.940> that's

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
wah-wah and you want to do this that's

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.190 
wah-wah and you want to do this that's
the<00:03:22.360> first<00:03:22.390> thing<00:03:22.690> you're<00:03:22.810> going<00:03:22.900> to<00:03:22.959> have<00:03:23.079> to

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
the first thing you're going to have to

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.170 
the first thing you're going to have to
do<00:03:23.349> is<00:03:23.590> take<00:03:23.769> those<00:03:23.920> rubber<00:03:24.190> feet<00:03:24.430> out<00:03:24.790> of<00:03:25.090> the

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
do is take those rubber feet out of the

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.970 
do is take those rubber feet out of the
front<00:03:25.420> of<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.569> pedal<00:03:25.870> and<00:03:25.959> that<00:03:26.049> way<00:03:26.470> it's

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
front of the pedal and that way it's

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.490 
front of the pedal and that way it's
much<00:03:27.190> easier<00:03:27.579> to<00:03:27.610> turn<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.150> off<00:03:28.299> so<00:03:29.140> if<00:03:29.290> you<00:03:29.379> use

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
much easier to turn it off so if you use

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.530 
much easier to turn it off so if you use
the<00:03:29.650> wah-wah<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.190> get<00:03:30.310> that<00:03:30.489> sound<00:03:30.760> it<00:03:31.420> would

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
the wah-wah to get that sound it would

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.260 
the wah-wah to get that sound it would
be<00:03:31.629> done<00:03:31.780> like<00:03:31.989> this
