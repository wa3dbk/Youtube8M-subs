so<00:01:04.309> that<00:01:04.699> contradiction<00:01:05.600> that<00:01:05.780> exists

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
so that contradiction that exists

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.130 
so that contradiction that exists
between<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:07.130> ways<00:01:08.060> in<00:01:08.270> which<00:01:08.299> we<00:01:08.450> represent

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
between the ways in which we represent

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.749 
between the ways in which we represent
them<00:01:09.439> for<00:01:10.369> the<00:01:11.299> use<00:01:11.540> of<00:01:12.369> something<00:01:13.369> that<00:01:13.400> is

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
them for the use of something that is

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:15.910 
them for the use of something that is
supposed<00:01:14.210> to<00:01:14.329> represent<00:01:14.689> innocence<00:01:15.470> and<00:01:15.710> then

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
supposed to represent innocence and then

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.230 
supposed to represent innocence and then
the<00:01:16.040> way<00:01:16.159> that<00:01:16.189> we<00:01:16.430> treat<00:01:16.460> them<00:01:16.820> which<00:01:17.090> is

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
the way that we treat them which is

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.809 
the way that we treat them which is
which<00:01:17.780> is<00:01:17.810> in<00:01:18.500> stark<00:01:18.740> contradiction<00:01:19.100> what's

00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:19.819 
which is in stark contradiction what's

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:22.539 
which is in stark contradiction what's
interesting<00:01:19.969> about<00:01:20.359> these<00:01:20.929> works<00:01:21.380> is<00:01:21.799> the

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
interesting about these works is the

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.849 
interesting about these works is the
scale<00:01:23.270> in<00:01:23.630> which<00:01:23.810> they're<00:01:24.049> printed<00:01:24.409> is<00:01:24.590> very

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:24.859 
scale in which they're printed is very

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:27.609 
scale in which they're printed is very
large<00:01:25.159> and<00:01:25.609> so<00:01:26.090> as<00:01:26.359> we<00:01:26.810> engage<00:01:26.929> with<00:01:27.380> them

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
large and so as we engage with them

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.389 
large and so as we engage with them
these<00:01:28.130> images<00:01:28.429> are<00:01:28.869> very<00:01:29.979> they're<00:01:30.979> very<00:01:31.130> kind

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
these images are very they're very kind

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.219 
these images are very they're very kind
of<00:01:31.460> up<00:01:31.639> front<00:01:31.999> and<00:01:32.179> center<00:01:32.240> with<00:01:32.749> our<00:01:32.899> vantage

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
of up front and center with our vantage

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.379 
of up front and center with our vantage
point<00:01:33.560> there<00:01:34.039> there<00:01:34.609> we<00:01:34.789> have<00:01:34.939> to<00:01:35.060> confront

00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:35.389 
point there there we have to confront

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:39.429 
point there there we have to confront
them<00:01:35.689> via<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.920> scale<00:01:37.219> and<00:01:37.840> via<00:01:38.840> their<00:01:39.139> gaze

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
them via the scale and via their gaze

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.319 
them via the scale and via their gaze
you<00:01:39.950> know<00:01:40.069> many<00:01:40.310> of<00:01:40.460> these<00:01:40.579> are<00:01:40.639> looking<00:01:41.210> us

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
you know many of these are looking us

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.260 
you know many of these are looking us
right<00:01:41.600> in<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:41.810> eye<00:01:41.929> and<00:01:42.530> it<00:01:43.369> brings<00:01:43.639> about<00:01:43.880> all

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
right in the eye and it brings about all

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.910 
right in the eye and it brings about all
these<00:01:44.450> contradictory<00:01:45.020> feelings<00:01:45.439> that<00:01:45.829> we

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
these contradictory feelings that we

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.890 
these contradictory feelings that we
have

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
have

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.560 
have
mikes<00:01:47.290> we<00:01:47.800> sympathize<00:01:48.730> and<00:01:48.790> empathize<00:01:49.150> with

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
mikes we sympathize and empathize with

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.020 
mikes we sympathize and empathize with
these<00:01:50.140> when<00:01:50.890> we<00:01:51.010> realize<00:01:51.400> what<00:01:51.700> they've<00:01:51.850> gone

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
these when we realize what they've gone

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.330 
these when we realize what they've gone
through<00:01:52.090> yet<00:01:52.480> at<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.690> same<00:01:52.720> time<00:01:53.010> mice<00:01:54.010> are<00:01:54.160> so

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
through yet at the same time mice are so

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.630 
through yet at the same time mice are so
commonly<00:01:54.760> used<00:01:55.180> for<00:01:56.010> for<00:01:57.010> research<00:01:57.400> of

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
commonly used for for research of

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.820 
commonly used for for research of
various<00:01:58.000> kinds<00:01:58.240> and<00:01:58.630> in<00:01:58.840> that<00:01:59.320> research<00:01:59.770> is

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
various kinds and in that research is

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.890 
various kinds and in that research is
something<00:02:00.370> that<00:02:00.550> actually<00:02:00.700> benefits<00:02:01.660> mankind

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
something that actually benefits mankind

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.550 
something that actually benefits mankind
so<00:02:02.770> our<00:02:03.760> sympathies<00:02:04.450> towards<00:02:04.720> these<00:02:05.050> animals

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
so our sympathies towards these animals

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.820 
so our sympathies towards these animals
versus<00:02:06.520> what<00:02:07.210> we<00:02:07.240> gain<00:02:07.600> from<00:02:07.630> them<00:02:08.110> are<00:02:08.320> really

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
versus what we gain from them are really

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:17.370 
versus what we gain from them are really
in<00:02:09.040> contradiction

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.440
