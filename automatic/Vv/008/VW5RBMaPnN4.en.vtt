taystee you're not familiar with it's
always<00:02:29.220> good<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.430> check<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.209> see<00:02:30.360> where<00:02:30.569> the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
always good to check and see where the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.330 
always good to check and see where the
odd<00:02:30.810> characters<00:02:31.319> like<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.620> ampersands<00:02:32.310> and

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
the dollar signs and things are so you

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:44.479 
the dollar signs and things are so you
can<00:02:34.380> find<00:02:34.650> them<00:02:34.799> when<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.010> need<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:44.040> if

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
can find them when you need it and if

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.880 
can find them when you need it and if
you<00:02:44.580> had<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.760> font<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.209> had<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.810> lot<00:02:46.260> of<00:02:46.290> extra

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
you had a font that had a lot of extra

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.580 
you had a font that had a lot of extra
characters<00:02:47.430> like<00:02:48.019> accented<00:02:49.019> letters<00:02:49.049> and<00:02:49.440> so

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
characters like accented letters and so

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.470 
characters like accented letters and so
forth<00:02:49.860> they<00:02:50.190> might<00:02:50.370> have<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.790> rearrange<00:02:51.090> the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
forth they might have to rearrange the

00:02:51.480 --> 00:03:21.620 
forth they might have to rearrange the
case<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.720> little<00:02:52.080> bit<00:02:52.170> for<00:02:52.380> that<00:03:20.209> no<00:03:21.209> we<00:03:21.359> let<00:03:21.510> the

and these sticks are quite nice these

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.890 
and these sticks are quite nice these
are<00:04:54.870> rustics<00:04:55.560> that<00:04:55.740> have<00:04:55.949> a<00:04:56.900> locking

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
are rustics that have a locking

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.620 
are rustics that have a locking
mechanism<00:04:57.930> that<00:04:58.680> they're<00:04:59.099> preset

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
mechanism that they're preset

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.820 
mechanism that they're preset
yeah<00:05:01.020> they're<00:05:01.229> all<00:05:01.349> these<00:05:01.500> are<00:05:01.620> all<00:05:01.710> two

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
yeah they're all these are all two

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.399 
yeah they're all these are all two
preset<00:05:02.190> sizes<00:05:02.720> and<00:05:03.720> this<00:05:03.900> one<00:05:04.110> doesn't<00:05:04.289> have

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:04.409 
preset sizes and this one doesn't have

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:06.439 
preset sizes and this one doesn't have
it<00:05:04.560> some<00:05:04.889> of<00:05:04.919> them<00:05:05.039> have<00:05:05.220> a<00:05:05.250> little<00:05:05.460> half<00:05:05.789> pike

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
it some of them have a little half pike

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.050 
it some of them have a little half pike
adjustment<00:05:07.320> that<00:05:08.280> you<00:05:08.370> can<00:05:08.550> make<00:05:08.699> do<00:05:08.909> these

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
adjustment that you can make do these

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.580 
adjustment that you can make do these
ones<00:05:09.330> set<00:05:09.630> to<00:05:09.870> actual<00:05:10.620> full<00:05:10.830> Pike<00:05:11.039> measures

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
ones set to actual full Pike measures

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.540 
ones set to actual full Pike measures
unlike<00:05:13.590> the<00:05:13.740> old<00:05:13.889> ones<00:05:14.099> where<00:05:14.280> you<00:05:14.340> would<00:05:14.460> have

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
unlike the old ones where you would have

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.430 
unlike the old ones where you would have
had<00:05:14.699> to<00:05:14.820> have<00:05:15.000> a<00:05:15.300> measuring<00:05:15.930> stick<00:05:16.080> that<00:05:16.320> you

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
had to have a measuring stick that you

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.960 
had to have a measuring stick that you
would<00:05:16.560> put<00:05:16.740> in<00:05:16.889> and<00:05:17.190> then<00:05:17.370> you<00:05:17.490> block<00:05:17.699> you're

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
would put in and then you block you're

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:31.490 
would put in and then you block you're
here<00:05:18.270> composing<00:05:18.780> stick<00:05:18.870> to<00:05:19.110> that<00:05:19.199> size<00:05:30.229> as<00:05:31.229> you

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
here composing stick to that size as you

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.469 
here composing stick to that size as you
say<00:05:31.650> you<00:05:31.710> don't<00:05:31.860> want<00:05:32.070> to<00:05:32.130> have<00:05:32.280> to<00:05:32.430> read<00:05:33.300> it

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
say you don't want to have to read it

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:34.850 
say you don't want to have to read it
ideal<00:05:33.870> that<00:05:34.050> you<00:05:34.110> want<00:05:34.289> to<00:05:34.349> proof<00:05:34.500> the<00:05:34.680> thing

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
ideal that you want to proof the thing

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.529 
ideal that you want to proof the thing
and<00:05:34.979> then<00:05:35.099> proofread<00:05:35.550> it<00:05:35.699> you<00:05:35.849> know<00:05:35.969> when

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
and then proofread it you know when

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.300 
and then proofread it you know when
you're<00:05:36.659> doing<00:05:36.870> I<00:05:36.930> hear<00:05:37.139> you<00:05:37.259> really<00:05:37.560> you<00:05:38.130> have
