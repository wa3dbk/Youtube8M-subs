for<00:00:24.829> a<00:00:24.860> while<00:00:25.009> now<00:00:25.220> we've<00:00:25.400> been<00:00:25.489> driving<00:00:25.939> this

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
for a while now we've been driving this

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.119 
for a while now we've been driving this
car<00:00:26.599> and<00:00:27.700> we<00:00:28.700> would<00:00:28.849> notice<00:00:29.210> a<00:00:29.570> clunk<00:00:30.259> over

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:31.129 
car and we would notice a clunk over

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:33.639 
car and we would notice a clunk over
bumps<00:00:31.520> and<00:00:31.790> I<00:00:32.570> checked<00:00:33.200> everything<00:00:33.469> in<00:00:33.559> the

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
bumps and I checked everything in the

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:35.260 
bumps and I checked everything in the
front<00:00:33.860> suspension<00:00:34.010> it<00:00:34.460> seemed<00:00:34.730> fine

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
front suspension it seemed fine

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.920 
front suspension it seemed fine
and<00:00:35.840> eventually<00:00:36.350> I<00:00:36.379> traced<00:00:36.770> it<00:00:37.420> to<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:38.629> rear

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
and eventually I traced it to the rear

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.660 
and eventually I traced it to the rear
suspension<00:00:40.570> specifically<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:42.260> rear<00:00:42.670> Delta

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
suspension specifically the rear Delta

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.630 
suspension specifically the rear Delta
link<00:00:43.880> or<00:00:44.150> rear<00:00:44.480> suspension<00:00:45.110> end<00:00:45.320> link<00:00:45.650> I<00:00:45.890> have

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
link or rear suspension end link I have

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.590 
link or rear suspension end link I have
the<00:00:46.820> wheel<00:00:46.970> off<00:00:47.180> here

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
the wheel off here

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.750 
the wheel off here
get<00:00:48.380> the<00:00:48.470> car<00:00:48.620> supported<00:00:48.980> by<00:00:49.040> jack<00:00:49.250> stands<00:00:49.520> and

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
get the car supported by jack stands and

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.610 
get the car supported by jack stands and
we're<00:00:50.450> looking<00:00:50.660> at<00:00:50.750> this<00:00:50.960> piece<00:00:51.260> right<00:00:51.560> here

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
we're looking at this piece right here

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.040 
we're looking at this piece right here
now<00:00:52.310> if<00:00:52.460> you<00:00:52.610> once<00:00:53.570> again<00:00:53.720> this<00:00:53.899> is<00:00:54.020> a

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
now if you once again this is a

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.030 
now if you once again this is a
front-wheel<00:00:54.500> drive<00:00:55.690> model<00:00:56.690> so<00:00:57.079> I<00:00:57.350> don't<00:00:57.890> I

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
front-wheel drive model so I don't I

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.530 
front-wheel drive model so I don't I
don't<00:00:58.160> know<00:00:58.489> how<00:00:58.610> the<00:00:58.670> all-wheel<00:00:59.239> drive

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
don't know how the all-wheel drive

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.930 
don't know how the all-wheel drive
models<00:01:00.050> will<00:01:00.230> differ<00:01:00.500> but<00:01:00.829> I<00:01:01.070> get<00:01:01.700> the<00:01:01.790> wheel

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
models will differ but I get the wheel

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.899 
models will differ but I get the wheel
off<00:01:02.090> here<00:01:02.329> for<00:01:02.510> better<00:01:02.899> access<00:01:03.380> and<00:01:03.909> here's

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
off here for better access and here's

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.590 
off here for better access and here's
for<00:01:06.579> lack<00:01:07.579> of<00:01:07.610> knowing<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:08.060> right<00:01:08.119> term<00:01:08.420> the

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
for lack of knowing the right term the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.080 
for lack of knowing the right term the
rear<00:01:08.750> suspension<00:01:08.899> arm<00:01:09.439> and<00:01:09.680> this<00:01:10.460> end<00:01:10.700> piece

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
rear suspension arm and this end piece

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.060 
rear suspension arm and this end piece
here<00:01:11.509> is<00:01:11.659> replaceable<00:01:12.200> now<00:01:12.530> you<00:01:12.619> can<00:01:12.740> see<00:01:12.920> the

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
here is replaceable now you can see the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.940 
here is replaceable now you can see the
ball<00:01:13.250> joint<00:01:13.579> in<00:01:13.790> there<00:01:14.530> this<00:01:15.530> whole<00:01:15.740> thing

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
ball joint in there this whole thing

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.639 
ball joint in there this whole thing
should<00:01:16.159> be<00:01:16.189> encased<00:01:16.700> in<00:01:16.909> rubber<00:01:17.179> and<00:01:17.649> what's

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
should be encased in rubber and what's

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:22.389 
should be encased in rubber and what's
happening<00:01:19.130> is<00:01:19.509> over<00:01:20.509> bumps<00:01:20.899> the<00:01:21.709> this<00:01:22.159> piece

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
happening is over bumps the this piece

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.399 
happening is over bumps the this piece
is<00:01:22.579> just<00:01:22.789> going<00:01:23.179> up<00:01:23.389> and<00:01:23.569> down<00:01:23.689> and<00:01:23.899> clunking

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
is just going up and down and clunking

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.669 
is just going up and down and clunking
and<00:01:25.509> I<00:01:26.509> imagine<00:01:26.899> it's<00:01:27.020> also<00:01:27.170> causing

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:27.679 
and I imagine it's also causing

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:29.739 
and I imagine it's also causing
alignment<00:01:28.399> issues<00:01:28.789> so<00:01:29.149> I'm<00:01:29.450> going<00:01:29.600> to<00:01:29.659> be

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:29.749 
alignment issues so I'm going to be

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:32.800 
alignment issues so I'm going to be
replacing<00:01:30.229> these<00:01:30.319> pieces<00:01:30.619> today<00:01:31.630> now<00:01:32.630> there's

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
replacing these pieces today now there's

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.539 
replacing these pieces today now there's
actually<00:01:32.899> not<00:01:33.259> too<00:01:33.499> much<00:01:33.709> holding<00:01:34.069> this<00:01:34.249> onto

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
actually not too much holding this onto

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.660 
actually not too much holding this onto
the<00:01:34.639> car<00:01:35.829> there's<00:01:36.829> this<00:01:37.069> bolt<00:01:37.399> right<00:01:37.520> here

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
the car there's this bolt right here

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.959 
the car there's this bolt right here
which<00:01:38.090> you<00:01:38.209> access<00:01:39.130> from<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.219> bottom<00:01:40.579> take

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:40.969 
which you access from the bottom take

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:43.059 
which you access from the bottom take
the<00:01:41.119> knot<00:01:41.240> off<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.599> bottom<00:01:41.929> and<00:01:42.020> drive<00:01:42.859> this

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069

bolt<00:01:43.340> out<00:01:43.579> and<00:01:44.229> then<00:01:45.229> there's<00:01:45.380> a<00:01:45.439> bolt<00:01:45.649> going

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
bolt out and then there's a bolt going

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.459 
bolt out and then there's a bolt going
through<00:01:46.819> here<00:01:47.209> once<00:01:47.450> which<00:01:47.899> once<00:01:48.109> again<00:01:48.349> you

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
also access from the bottom and then you

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.769 
also access from the bottom and then you
need<00:01:51.020> to<00:01:51.049> remove<00:01:51.259> this<00:01:51.560> bracket<00:01:51.829> itself<00:01:52.779> at

00:01:53.769 --> 00:01:53.779 
need to remove this bracket itself at

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:55.179 
need to remove this bracket itself at

nut<00:02:19.340> off<00:02:19.370> partway<00:02:20.300> -<00:02:20.930> rip<00:02:21.110> -<00:02:22.330> just<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.420> the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
nut off partway - rip - just to the

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.610 
nut off partway - rip - just to the
point<00:02:23.720> where<00:02:23.810> I'm<00:02:23.870> protecting<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.380> threads

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
point where I'm protecting the threads

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.150 
point where I'm protecting the threads
here

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
here

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.980 
here
and<00:02:25.250> then<00:02:25.880> I'm<00:02:25.970> going<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.150> hammer<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.810> bolt

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
and then I'm going to hammer the bolt

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.850 
and then I'm going to hammer the bolt
out<00:02:27.370> with<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.400> hammer<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:29.560> like<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:30.620> said<00:02:30.680> I'm

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
out with a hammer and like I said I'm

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.860 
out with a hammer and like I said I'm
leaving<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.160> nut<00:02:31.340> on<00:02:31.550> to<00:02:31.820> protect<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.690> bolt

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
leaving the nut on to protect the bolt

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.270 
leaving the nut on to protect the bolt
threads<00:02:33.170> so<00:02:33.680> I'm<00:02:33.740> going<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:33.890> go<00:02:33.980> ahead<00:02:34.040> and<00:02:34.220> do

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
threads so I'm going to go ahead and do

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.450 
threads so I'm going to go ahead and do
that<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:35.320> just<00:02:36.320> for<00:02:36.530> reference<00:02:36.680> this<00:02:37.190> is<00:02:37.340> an

that and just for reference this is an

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.360 
that and just for reference this is an
18<00:02:37.910> millimeter<00:02:38.450> nut<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:39.050> once<00:02:39.950> you<00:02:40.100> have<00:02:40.220> this

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
18 millimeter nut and once you have this

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.060 
18 millimeter nut and once you have this
bolt<00:02:40.670> removed<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:42.020> remove<00:02:42.290> this<00:02:42.470> one<00:02:42.680> here

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
bolt removed you remove this one here

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.420 
bolt removed you remove this one here
also<00:02:43.360> 18<00:02:44.360> millimeters<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.140> once<00:02:46.130> you<00:02:46.280> have

also 18 millimeters and once you have

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.300 
also 18 millimeters and once you have
this<00:02:46.580> bolt<00:02:46.910> out<00:02:47.290> you<00:02:48.290> remove<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.740> three<00:02:49.040> bolts

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
this bolt out you remove the three bolts

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.970 
this bolt out you remove the three bolts
holding<00:02:49.970> on<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.540> main<00:02:51.020> bracket<00:02:51.380> there

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
holding on the main bracket there

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.930 
holding on the main bracket there
these<00:02:52.400> are<00:02:52.730> 17<00:02:53.420> millimeter<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.760> once<00:02:55.760> those

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
these are 17 millimeter and once those

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.120 
these are 17 millimeter and once those
bolts<00:02:56.390> are<00:02:56.510> out<00:02:56.540> this<00:02:57.260> bracket<00:02:57.710> just<00:02:57.890> kind<00:02:58.040> of

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
bolts are out this bracket just kind of

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.320 
bolts are out this bracket just kind of
hangs<00:02:58.340> out<00:02:58.550> of<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.730> way<00:02:58.850> and<00:02:59.000> I<00:02:59.030> think<00:02:59.210> it

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
hangs out of the way and I think it

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.760 
hangs out of the way and I think it
gives<00:02:59.420> you<00:02:59.600> more<00:02:59.750> than<00:02:59.900> enough<00:02:59.960> clearance<00:03:00.500> to

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
gives you more than enough clearance to

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.660 
gives you more than enough clearance to
work<00:03:01.180> if<00:03:02.180> I<00:03:02.360> discover<00:03:02.720> otherwise<00:03:03.260> I<00:03:03.710> will<00:03:04.040> show

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
work if I discover otherwise I will show

work if I discover otherwise I will show

costs<00:03:42.080> over<00:03:42.320> a<00:03:42.350> hundred<00:03:42.740> dollars<00:03:42.890> but<00:03:43.370> you

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
costs over a hundred dollars but you

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.540 
costs over a hundred dollars but you
have<00:03:44.240> to<00:03:44.450> think<00:03:44.660> about<00:03:44.780> it<00:03:45.050> in<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.830> context<00:03:46.460> of

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
have to think about it in the context of

have to think about it in the context of
what's<00:03:46.730> it<00:03:46.880> what's<00:03:47.150> it<00:03:47.240> going<00:03:47.330> to<00:03:47.390> cost<00:03:47.570> you<00:03:47.780> to

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
what's it what's it going to cost you to

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.050

pretty much the reverse of disassembly
and<00:06:33.160> I'm<00:06:34.160> actually<00:06:34.310> going<00:06:34.550> to<00:06:34.640> start<00:06:34.880> by

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
and I'm actually going to start by

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.810 
and I'm actually going to start by
bolting<00:06:36.620> in<00:06:37.960> or<00:06:38.960> bolting<00:06:39.710> the<00:06:39.830> end<00:06:40.010> link<00:06:40.370> to

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 
bolting in or bolting the end link to

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.870 
bolting in or bolting the end link to
the<00:06:40.940> suspension<00:06:41.330> arm<00:06:41.630> here<00:06:42.730> just<00:06:43.730> to<00:06:43.790> make

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:43.880 
the suspension arm here just to make

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.750 
the suspension arm here just to make
sure<00:06:43.910> everything<00:06:44.390> lines<00:06:44.510> up<00:06:44.780> correctly<00:06:45.760> like

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:46.760 
sure everything lines up correctly like

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.580 
sure everything lines up correctly like
I<00:06:46.850> said<00:06:47.000> I'm<00:06:47.090> a<00:06:47.180> bolt<00:06:47.450> I'm<00:06:48.200> going<00:06:48.320> to<00:06:48.380> put<00:06:48.500> this

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.590 
I said I'm a bolt I'm going to put this

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:49.390 
I said I'm a bolt I'm going to put this
bolt<00:06:48.860> in<00:06:49.010> and<00:06:49.190> tight

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.400 
bolt in and tight

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.360 
bolt in and tight
down<00:06:49.669> my<00:06:50.630> sources<00:06:51.199> tell<00:06:51.410> me<00:06:51.650> that<00:06:51.979> the<00:06:52.100> torque

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
down my sources tell me that the torque

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.390 
down my sources tell me that the torque
for<00:06:52.550> that<00:06:52.669> is<00:06:52.910> 65<00:06:53.630> newton<00:06:54.020> meters<00:06:54.290> plus<00:06:54.530> 120

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:55.400 
for that is 65 newton meters plus 120

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.830 
for that is 65 newton meters plus 120
degrees<00:06:55.729> so<00:06:56.180> I'm<00:06:56.270> going<00:06:56.389> to<00:06:56.449> go<00:06:56.509> ahead<00:06:56.570> and<00:06:56.750> do

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:56.840 
degrees so I'm going to go ahead and do

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:02.410 
degrees so I'm going to go ahead and do
that

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:02.420 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.420 

next<00:07:03.290> I'm<00:07:03.380> going<00:07:03.470> to<00:07:03.560> bolt<00:07:03.710> up<00:07:03.860> the<00:07:04.010> bracket

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:04.430 
next I'm going to bolt up the bracket

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.050 
next I'm going to bolt up the bracket
again<00:07:04.520> and<00:07:05.950> my<00:07:06.950> sources<00:07:07.340> tell<00:07:07.670> me<00:07:07.700> that<00:07:07.850> the

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:08.060 
again and my sources tell me that the

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.840 
again and my sources tell me that the
torque<00:07:08.360> on<00:07:08.540> that<00:07:08.630> is<00:07:09.230> 65<00:07:09.980> Newton<00:07:10.370> meters<00:07:10.610> plus

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:10.850 
torque on that is 65 Newton meters plus

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:19.400 
torque on that is 65 Newton meters plus
another<00:07:11.060> 60<00:07:11.510> degrees<00:07:11.810> on<00:07:12.110> those<00:07:12.380> three<00:07:12.740> bolts

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:19.410 

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.800 

finally<00:07:20.410> you<00:07:20.560> install<00:07:21.040> this<00:07:21.820> bolt<00:07:22.240> here<00:07:22.630> the

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:22.810 
finally you install this bolt here the

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.070 
finally you install this bolt here the
main<00:07:23.290> end<00:07:23.590> link<00:07:24.190> to<00:07:24.310> chassis<00:07:24.700> bolt<00:07:24.910> and<00:07:25.120> then

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 
main end link to chassis bolt and then

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.750 
main end link to chassis bolt and then
once<00:07:26.740> again<00:07:26.950> my<00:07:27.040> sources<00:07:27.460> give<00:07:27.640> a<00:07:27.670> torque<00:07:28.030> of

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:29.760 
once again my sources give a torque of

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.840 
once again my sources give a torque of
105<00:07:30.760> Newton<00:07:31.210> meters<00:07:31.570> plus<00:07:32.370> another<00:07:33.370> 90

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:33.850 
105 Newton meters plus another 90

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:40.429 
105 Newton meters plus another 90
degrees

00:07:40.429 --> 00:07:40.439 

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:45.749 

so<00:07:43.710> once<00:07:44.710> that's<00:07:44.860> not<00:07:45.159> all<00:07:45.310> you<00:07:45.400> have<00:07:45.520> to<00:07:45.580> do<00:07:45.669> is

00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:45.759 
so once that's not all you have to do is

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:48.089 
so once that's not all you have to do is
put<00:07:45.909> the<00:07:46.000> wheel<00:07:46.150> back<00:07:46.180> on<00:07:46.539> lower<00:07:47.379> the<00:07:47.560> car<00:07:47.770> and

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:48.099 
put the wheel back on lower the car and

00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:50.640 
put the wheel back on lower the car and
you're<00:07:48.220> good<00:07:48.400> to<00:07:48.430> go<00:07:48.580> so<00:07:49.050> this<00:07:50.050> is<00:07:50.169> Mercedes

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:50.650 
you're good to go so this is Mercedes

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.939 
you're good to go so this is Mercedes
diesel<00:07:50.830> guy<00:07:51.099> thanks<00:07:51.520> for<00:07:51.580> watching
