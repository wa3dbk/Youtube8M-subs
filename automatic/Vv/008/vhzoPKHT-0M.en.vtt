00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.080 
drag it back and see if there is
anything<00:01:11.500> or<00:01:11.950> you<00:01:12.100> can<00:01:12.220> also<00:01:12.369> speed<00:01:12.820> up<00:01:12.850> the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
process so that's not illegal so we can

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.120 
process so that's not illegal so we can
check<00:01:16.210> that<00:01:16.270> on<00:01:16.509> you<00:01:17.319> can<00:01:17.349> also<00:01:17.530> change<00:01:17.920> the
