and I do so I'm the mod adds and an

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.990 
and I do so I'm the mod adds and an
angel<00:00:33.630> halo<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.230> angel<00:00:34.770> wings<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.250> they<00:00:35.850> both

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
angel halo and angel wings and they both

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.400 
angel halo and angel wings and they both
gave<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.270> special<00:00:36.600> powers<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> angel

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
gave you special powers so the angel

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.560 
gave you special powers so the angel
halo<00:00:37.710> will<00:00:37.860> give<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.160> speed<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.090> jump<00:00:39.390> boost

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
halo will give you speed and jump boost

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.110 
halo will give you speed and jump boost
to<00:00:39.930> can<00:00:40.290> run<00:00:40.920> around<00:00:41.040> slightly<00:00:41.579> faster<00:00:42.090> than

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
to can run around slightly faster than

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.180 
to can run around slightly faster than
before<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.350> also<00:00:43.469> jump<00:00:43.860> half<00:00:44.100> a

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
before and you can also jump half a

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.830 
before and you can also jump half a
block<00:00:44.340> higher<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.910> think<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.690> would<00:00:45.809> probably

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
block higher I think it would probably

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.900 
block higher I think it would probably
be<00:00:46.379> more<00:00:46.680> useful<00:00:46.829> if<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.250> could<00:00:47.399> jump<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.700> full

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
be more useful if you could jump a full

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.810 
be more useful if you could jump a full
block<00:00:48.120> higher<00:00:48.390> um<00:00:49.350> but<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.129> know<00:00:50.160> no<00:00:50.579> matter

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
block higher um but you know no matter

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.240 
block higher um but you know no matter
no<00:00:51.090> matter<00:00:51.390> it's<00:00:51.719> fine<00:00:51.930> it's<00:00:52.140> fine<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.770> I'll

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
no matter it's fine it's fine and I'll

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.250 
no matter it's fine it's fine and I'll
show<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.850> flying<00:00:54.360> which<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.870> really<00:00:55.110> cool

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
think it's the perfect time to transcend

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.910 
think it's the perfect time to transcend
over<00:02:13.030> crap<00:02:14.030> it's<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.750> perfect<00:02:15.020> time<00:02:15.319> to<00:02:15.500> segue

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
over crap it's the perfect time to segue

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.760 
over crap it's the perfect time to segue
over<00:02:16.130> to<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:17.330> demon<00:02:17.690> stuff<00:02:17.959> which<00:02:18.440> we<00:02:18.620> will
