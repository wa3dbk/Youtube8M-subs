00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
problems with that and that i can

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.630

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
a typo on their part so I'm sure it can

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.229 
a typo on their part so I'm sure it can
hold<00:03:16.330> more<00:03:16.750> than<00:03:16.959> 200,000<00:03:17.950> average<00:03:18.340> pictures
