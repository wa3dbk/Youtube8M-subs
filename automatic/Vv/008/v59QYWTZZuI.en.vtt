00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.060 

okay<00:00:00.690> this<00:00:00.870> is<00:00:01.020> how<00:00:01.110> to<00:00:01.170> get<00:00:01.380> faster<00:00:01.560> at<00:00:01.920> the

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
okay this is how to get faster at the

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.349 
okay this is how to get faster at the
2x2<00:00:02.429> um<00:00:03.950> the<00:00:04.950> two<00:00:05.190> I<00:00:05.220> do

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
2x2 um the two I do

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.709 
2x2 um the two I do
this<00:00:06.870> is<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.319> very<00:00:08.130> simple<00:00:08.880> puzzle<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:09.809> mean<00:00:11.719> it's

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
this is a very simple puzzle I mean it's

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.720 
this is a very simple puzzle I mean it's
a<00:00:12.870> 2x2<00:00:14.900> but<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.020> problem<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.830> people

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
a 2x2 but the problem is is that people

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.099 
a 2x2 but the problem is is that people
usually<00:00:18.090> get<00:00:18.680> 20<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.800> 30<00:00:20.100> seconds<00:00:20.880> on<00:00:21.210> solving

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
usually get 20 to 30 seconds on solving

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.179 
usually get 20 to 30 seconds on solving
the<00:00:22.470> cube<00:00:23.359> well<00:00:26.840> some<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.230> worl<00:00:28.529> rekr<00:00:28.830> is

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
the cube well some the worl rekr is

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.220 
the cube well some the worl rekr is
probably<00:00:29.699> about<00:00:30.410> two<00:00:31.410> seconds<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.989> mean<00:00:33.989> it

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
probably about two seconds and I mean it

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.080 
probably about two seconds and I mean it
may<00:00:34.410> have<00:00:34.559> been<00:00:34.910> they<00:00:36.140> have<00:00:37.140> been<00:00:38.000> lucky<00:00:39.000> at

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
may have been they have been lucky at

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.220 
may have been they have been lucky at
the<00:00:39.239> same<00:00:39.450> time<00:00:39.660> but<00:00:40.550> it's<00:00:41.550> just<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:42.120> skill<00:00:42.480> like

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the same time but it's just a skill like

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.330 
the same time but it's just a skill like
this<00:00:43.410> also<00:00:44.570> so<00:00:45.570> I'm<00:00:46.379> gonna<00:00:46.559> teach<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.980> how<00:00:47.100> to

I've<00:01:25.049> made<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.409> tutorial<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.009> how<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.159> get<00:01:26.430> your

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
I've made it tutorial on how to get your

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.690 
I've made it tutorial on how to get your
rubik's<00:01:26.939> cube<00:01:27.180> faster<00:01:28.009> you<00:01:29.009> didn't<00:01:29.250> lubricate

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
rubik's cube faster you didn't lubricate

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.469 
rubik's cube faster you didn't lubricate
it<00:01:30.590> okay<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:33.920> really<00:01:34.920> excu<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.670> mean<00:01:36.180> you're<00:01:36.299> -<00:01:36.450> I

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
it okay so really excu I mean you're - I

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.649 
it okay so really excu I mean you're - I
do<00:01:36.780> now<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.409> turns<00:01:37.799> ready<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:39.420> should<00:01:39.570> be

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
do now that turns ready you should be

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.190 
do now that turns ready you should be
surprised<00:01:40.049> now<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:44.100> next<00:01:44.399> step<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:45.200> being

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
surprised now the next step is being

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.770 
surprised now the next step is being
able<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.560> do<00:01:46.680> finger<00:01:47.070> tricks<00:01:47.780> basically

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
able to do finger tricks basically

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.679 
able to do finger tricks basically
finger<00:01:49.140> tricks<00:01:49.460> are<00:01:50.460> just<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.790> way<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.000> moving

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
finger tricks are just a way of moving

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.359 
finger tricks are just a way of moving
the<00:01:52.020> cube<00:01:52.350> in<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.740> fast<00:01:53.040> but<00:01:53.820> like<00:01:55.189> using<00:01:56.189> one

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the cube in a fast but like using one

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.179 
the cube in a fast but like using one
finger<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.420> turn<00:01:57.659> side<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.290> maybe<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.860> do

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
finger to turn side and maybe to do

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.550 
finger to turn side and maybe to do
anything<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.030> turn<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.390> side<00:02:00.540> twice<00:02:00.810> look

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
anything to turn the side twice look

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.190 
anything to turn the side twice look
that<00:02:01.829> may<00:02:02.070> be

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.620 

but<00:02:04.890> yeah<00:02:06.020> okay<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:08.270> how<00:02:09.270> will<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.509> learn

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
but yeah okay so how will you learn

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.430 
but yeah okay so how will you learn
finger<00:02:10.020> tricks<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.790> is<00:02:11.790> very<00:02:12.720> difficult<00:02:13.230> I

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
finger tricks is is very difficult I

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.520 
finger tricks is is very difficult I
mean<00:02:13.709> I<00:02:13.830> went<00:02:14.069> through<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.430> process<00:02:15.530> but

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
mean I went through that process but

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.140 
mean I went through that process but
this<00:02:16.920> is<00:02:17.040> how<00:02:17.190> I<00:02:17.220> learn<00:02:17.489> um<00:02:17.819> I<00:02:19.520> did<00:02:20.520> this<00:02:20.819> one

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
this is how I learn um I did this one

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.790 
this is how I learn um I did this one
algorithm<00:02:21.680> algorithm<00:02:22.680> I'm<00:02:23.550> sorry<00:02:24.560> that<00:02:25.560> goes

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
algorithm algorithm I'm sorry that goes

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:33.229 
algorithm algorithm I'm sorry that goes
