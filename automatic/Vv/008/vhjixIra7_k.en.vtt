00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
changes to those scratches so the more I

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.679 
changes to those scratches so the more I
carry<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.409> 3ds<00:01:16.939> the<00:01:17.939> worse<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.299> scratches

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
carry the 3ds the worse the scratches

carry the 3ds the worse the scratches
are<00:01:18.810> becoming<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:20.780> that's<00:01:21.780> something<00:01:22.080> I

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
are becoming and that's something I

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.749 
are becoming and that's something I
don't<00:01:22.320> exactly<00:01:22.740> want<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.430> don't<00:01:23.610> really

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
don't exactly want so I don't really

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.030 
don't exactly want so I don't really
want<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:23.970> carry<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.240> with<00:01:24.270> me<00:01:24.360> anymore<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:25.040> could

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
want to carry it with me anymore I could

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.219 
want to carry it with me anymore I could
get<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.250> screen<00:01:26.520> protector<00:01:26.670> but<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.509> think<00:01:28.170> a

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
get a screen protector but I think a

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.600 
get a screen protector but I think a
screen<00:01:28.470> protector<00:01:28.619> would<00:01:29.070> get<00:01:29.220> damaged

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
screen protector would get damaged

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.450 
screen protector would get damaged
faster<00:01:30.210> than<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.509> screen<00:01:30.780> as<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:32.220> would<00:01:32.340> be

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
faster than the screen as it would be

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.399 
faster than the screen as it would be
raised<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.090> would<00:01:33.509> make<00:01:33.659> more<00:01:33.869> contact<00:01:34.350> with

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
raised and would make more contact with

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.990 
raised and would make more contact with
this<00:01:34.590> bottom<00:01:34.920> section<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.520> need<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.850> be

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
this bottom section and need to be

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.200 
this bottom section and need to be
replaced<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.659> fairly<00:01:36.960> regular<00:01:37.200> basis<00:01:37.860> and

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
replaced on a fairly regular basis and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.149 
replaced on a fairly regular basis and
plus<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.570> shouldn't<00:01:40.079> need<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.439> buy<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> third

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
plus I shouldn't need to buy a third

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.069 
plus I shouldn't need to buy a third
party<00:01:41.490> item<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.030> prevent<00:01:42.329> damage<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.810> my
