boil and infuse the milk now you've done

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.370 
boil and infuse the milk now you've done
this<00:01:34.950> brand<00:01:35.220> new<00:01:35.280> snap<00:01:35.460> mix<00:01:35.700> which<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.780> perfect

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
this brand new snap mix which is perfect

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.039 
this brand new snap mix which is perfect
what<00:01:37.860> we<00:01:37.920> need<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.130> do<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.909> take<00:01:39.299> tablespoons

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
what we need to do is take tablespoons

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.260 
what we need to do is take tablespoons
of<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.200> mixture<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:41.009> just<00:01:41.250> position<00:01:41.939> them<00:01:42.090> on

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
of the mixture and just position them on

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.260 
of the mixture and just position them on
the<00:01:42.930> like<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.100> we<00:01:44.189> probably<00:01:44.280> get<00:01:44.490> about<00:01:44.579> 6<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.240> a

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
the like so we probably get about 6 on a

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.460 
the like so we probably get about 6 on a
tray<00:01:45.479> like<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.780> because<00:01:45.960> they<00:01:46.049> will<00:01:46.170> spread

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
tray like that because they will spread

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.530 
tray like that because they will spread
out<00:01:46.619> locks<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.880> we<00:01:48.000> can<00:01:48.149> add<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.270> few<00:01:48.329> other

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
out locks and we can add a few other

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.940 
out locks and we can add a few other
flavors<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.170> our<00:01:49.229> milk<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:49.560> we've<00:01:49.649> already<00:01:49.770> got

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
flavors to our milk so we've already got

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.620

the<00:01:50.009> vanilla<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.369> there<00:01:50.490> but<00:01:50.850> now<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.090> can<00:01:51.360> add

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
the vanilla in there but now we can add

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.960 
the vanilla in there but now we can add
nutmeg<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.500> cinnamon<00:01:52.860> about<00:01:53.399> half<00:01:53.850> a

where we're making a custard so do have

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.140 
where we're making a custard so do have
to<00:02:55.129> be<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.250> bit<00:02:55.430> careful<00:02:55.610> okay<00:02:55.879> I'm<00:02:56.000> going<00:02:56.090> to

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
to be a bit careful okay I'm going to

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.490 
to be a bit careful okay I'm going to
turn<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.480> heat<00:02:56.660> down<00:02:56.690> a<00:02:56.930> little<00:02:57.079> bit<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:57.379> it's

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
turn the heat down a little bit so it's

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.970 
turn the heat down a little bit so it's
not<00:02:57.530> quite<00:02:57.829> so<00:02:58.480> aggressive<00:02:59.680> so<00:03:00.680> keep<00:03:00.860> it

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
not quite so aggressive so keep it

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.699 
not quite so aggressive so keep it
moving<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:01.700> we<00:03:01.790> go<00:03:02.110> until<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.260> point<00:03:03.470> we<00:03:03.560> can

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
moving and we go until the point we can

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.410 
moving and we go until the point we can

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
lift out and we can draw a line for the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.910 
lift out and we can draw a line for the
spoon<00:03:05.690> so<00:03:05.959> not<00:03:06.140> quite<00:03:06.379> yet

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
not snuff in the meantime draw the line

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.680 
not snuff in the meantime draw the line
that<00:03:24.799> will<00:03:24.889> hold<00:03:25.010> it<00:03:25.160> there<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.459> fact<00:03:26.000> just<00:03:26.480> in

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
that will hold it there a fact just in

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.539 
that will hold it there a fact just in
the<00:03:26.840> corners<00:03:27.139> it<00:03:27.260> start<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.560> scramble<00:03:27.799> so<00:03:28.489> we

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
the corners it start to scramble so we

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.580 
the corners it start to scramble so we
get<00:03:28.670> it<00:03:28.760> out<00:03:28.849> now<00:03:29.209> into<00:03:29.720> Bowl<00:03:30.170> and<00:03:30.410> throw<00:03:30.560> a

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
get it out now into Bowl and throw a

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.289 
get it out now into Bowl and throw a
sieve<00:03:30.859> and<00:03:31.190> that<00:03:31.489> will<00:03:31.579> catch<00:03:31.849> any<00:03:32.120> of<00:03:32.209> the

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
sieve and that will catch any of the

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.690 
sieve and that will catch any of the
scrambling<00:03:32.599> bits<00:03:32.810> we<00:03:33.650> can<00:03:33.769> cool<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:34.040> down<00:03:34.310> with

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
scrambling bits we can cool it down with

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.640 
scrambling bits we can cool it down with
some<00:03:34.730> whipping<00:03:35.090> cream<00:03:35.209> just<00:03:36.169> to<00:03:36.319> stop<00:03:36.530> it

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
some whipping cream just to stop it

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.099 
some whipping cream just to stop it
cooking<00:03:36.829> anymore<00:03:37.220> and<00:03:38.150> brings<00:03:38.480> it<00:03:38.810> it<00:03:38.989> was

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
thicken it'll enrich it and the bit

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.940 
thicken it'll enrich it and the bit
