00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.440 
belts pulleys since this was made I
think<00:02:57.919> I<00:02:58.040> put<00:02:58.280> an<00:02:58.370> idle<00:02:58.700> air<00:02:58.849> control<00:02:58.880> no

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
think I put an idle air control no

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.650 
think I put an idle air control no
that's<00:02:59.630> on<00:02:59.780> there<00:02:59.930> to<00:03:01.329> about<00:03:02.329> eight<00:03:02.510> hundred

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
that's on there to about eight hundred

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.780 
that's on there to about eight hundred
dollars<00:03:03.049> in<00:03:03.139> parts<00:03:03.319> and<00:03:03.680> I<00:03:03.769> I<00:03:04.130> think<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.579> labor

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
dollars in parts and I I think the labor

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.620 
dollars in parts and I I think the labor
ended<00:03:05.150> up<00:03:05.269> being<00:03:06.639> pretty<00:03:07.639> substantial<00:03:08.359> and<00:03:08.480> it

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
ended up being pretty substantial and it

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.789 
ended up being pretty substantial and it
took<00:03:08.840> it<00:03:08.989> up<00:03:09.109> to<00:03:09.139> about<00:03:09.440> eleven<00:03:09.769> hundred

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
took it up to about eleven hundred

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.240 
took it up to about eleven hundred
dollars<00:03:10.340> for<00:03:10.669> all<00:03:10.790> of<00:03:10.940> that<00:03:11.060> to<00:03:11.209> him<00:03:11.329> and<00:03:11.359> put

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
dollars for all of that to him and put

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.640 
dollars for all of that to him and put
most<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.430> it<00:03:14.520> was<00:03:14.670> just<00:03:14.820> preventative<00:03:15.650> there's

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
most of it was just preventative there's

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.480 
most of it was just preventative there's
a<00:03:16.770> shot<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.430> exhaust<00:03:17.880> there<00:03:19.280> most<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.370> it

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
a shot of the exhaust there most of it

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.810 
a shot of the exhaust there most of it
was<00:03:20.610> just<00:03:20.760> preventative<00:03:21.360> to<00:03:22.490> make<00:03:23.490> sure<00:03:23.640> that

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
was just preventative to make sure that

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.070 
was just preventative to make sure that
we<00:03:23.940> weren't<00:03:24.030> actually<00:03:24.540> picking<00:03:24.720> my<00:03:24.900> daughter

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
we weren't actually picking my daughter

half pretty much hit the key twice and

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:47.770 
half pretty much hit the key twice and
you're<00:03:39.840> good<00:03:39.960> to<00:03:39.990> go

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.960 

just<00:03:48.780> like<00:03:48.900> you'd<00:03:49.050> expect<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.530> four<00:03:49.740> three<00:03:50.010> two

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
shot of that

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.140 
shot of that
as<00:03:59.349> you<00:03:59.500> can<00:03:59.680> see<00:03:59.860> there's<00:04:00.099> no<00:04:00.250> strange<00:04:00.610> sounds

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
as you can see there's no strange sounds

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:14.650 
as you can see there's no strange sounds
or<00:04:01.300> noises<00:04:01.330> coming<00:04:01.930> from<00:04:02.050> under<00:04:02.349> the<00:04:02.470> hood

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.930 

there<00:04:15.200> was<00:04:15.350> a<00:04:15.380> vacuum<00:04:15.770> leak<00:04:16.220> on<00:04:16.400> it<00:04:16.670> when<00:04:16.820> we

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
there was a vacuum leak on it when we

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:34.740 
there was a vacuum leak on it when we
got<00:04:17.090> it

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.100 

a<00:04:35.760> C's<00:04:36.760> all<00:04:37.030> there<00:04:37.330> but<00:04:37.540> I<00:04:37.570> think<00:04:37.870> it<00:04:37.990> either

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
a C's all there but I think it either

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.530 
a C's all there but I think it either
needs<00:04:38.380> recharge<00:04:39.040> or<00:04:39.520> something<00:04:40.120> figured<00:04:40.300> out

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
needs recharge or something figured out

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.309 
needs recharge or something figured out
that

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:46.319 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:05:12.330 

the<00:04:46.770> heat<00:04:46.949> blows<00:04:47.189> warm
