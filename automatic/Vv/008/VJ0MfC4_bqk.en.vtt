the driver you can see we've entered the

give<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.770> more<00:01:47.009> dynamic<00:01:47.310> bass<00:01:47.820> performance

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
give a more dynamic bass performance

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.030 
give a more dynamic bass performance
we've<00:01:49.740> also<00:01:50.930> lowered<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.140> resin<00:01:52.470> frequency

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
we've also lowered the resin frequency

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.700 
we've also lowered the resin frequency
of<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.610> driver<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.420> again<00:01:54.689> getting<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.409> much

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.309 
matching to the mid-range and a much
larger<00:02:12.580> magnet<00:02:13.180> this<00:02:13.510> gives<00:02:13.750> us<00:02:13.900> greatly

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
larger magnet this gives us greatly

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.250 
larger magnet this gives us greatly
improved<00:02:14.860> sensitivity<00:02:15.370> of<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.300> tweeter<00:02:16.540> so

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
improved sensitivity of the tweeter so

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.140 
improved sensitivity of the tweeter so
we<00:02:17.350> don't<00:02:17.470> get<00:02:17.620> as<00:02:17.800> much<00:02:17.920> thermal<00:02:18.250> compression

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
we don't get as much thermal compression

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.380 
we don't get as much thermal compression
at<00:02:19.390> high<00:02:19.660> volumes<00:02:20.470> so<00:02:21.400> all<00:02:21.730> of<00:02:21.760> these<00:02:22.030> changes

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
at high volumes so all of these changes

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.630 
at high volumes so all of these changes
mean<00:02:22.750> we<00:02:22.900> get<00:02:23.080> more<00:02:23.380> dynamic<00:02:24.010> performance

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
mean we get more dynamic performance

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.330 
mean we get more dynamic performance
from<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:25.090> speaker<00:02:25.569> system<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.830> we<00:02:26.920> combine

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
from the speaker system and we combine

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.610 
from the speaker system and we combine
that<00:02:27.640> again<00:02:28.360> with<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.569> six<00:02:28.810> element<00:02:29.140> crossover

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
that again with a six element crossover

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.220 
that again with a six element crossover
Network<00:02:29.670> we<00:02:30.670> have<00:02:30.850> a<00:02:31.120> film<00:02:31.480> capacitor<00:02:31.989> for<00:02:32.110> the

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
Network we have a film capacitor for the

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.559 
Network we have a film capacitor for the
tweeter<00:02:32.440> we<00:02:33.130> have<00:02:33.250> an<00:02:33.370> air<00:02:33.489> cording<00:02:33.910> doctor<00:02:34.300> on

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
tweeter we have an air cording doctor on

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.870 
tweeter we have an air cording doctor on
the<00:02:34.630> tweeter<00:02:34.989> and<00:02:35.260> for<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:35.950> base<00:02:36.069> driver<00:02:36.400> we

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
the tweeter and for the base driver we

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.910 
the tweeter and for the base driver we
have<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.269> laminated<00:02:37.870> steel<00:02:38.140> core<00:02:38.620> inductor

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
have a laminated steel core inductor

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.120 
have a laminated steel core inductor
this<00:02:39.730> allows<00:02:40.390> us<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.660> get<00:02:41.230> high<00:02:41.410> sound<00:02:41.800> levels

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
this allows us to get high sound levels

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.910 
this allows us to get high sound levels
without<00:02:42.459> any<00:02:42.910> ill<00:02:43.750> effects<00:02:44.200> from<00:02:44.440> that

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
without any ill effects from that

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.140 
without any ill effects from that
inductor<00:02:46.650> overall<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:48.400> speaker<00:02:48.760> systems

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
inductor overall the speaker systems

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.110 
inductor overall the speaker systems
have<00:02:49.510> more<00:02:50.140> extended<00:02:50.590> dynamic<00:02:51.580> bass<00:02:51.819> a

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
have more extended dynamic bass a

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.030 
have more extended dynamic bass a
smoother<00:02:52.810> mid-range<00:02:53.290> performance<00:02:53.860> and

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
smoother mid-range performance and

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.860 
smoother mid-range performance and
overall<00:02:54.900> increase<00:02:55.900> in<00:02:56.049> both<00:02:56.650> efficiency<00:02:57.459> and

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
overall increase in both efficiency and

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.059 
overall increase in both efficiency and
ease<00:02:58.870> of<00:02:59.170> drive<00:02:59.950> so<00:03:00.670> even<00:03:00.970> with<00:03:01.120> entry-level

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
ease of drive so even with entry-level

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.729 
ease of drive so even with entry-level
receivers<00:03:03.069> we<00:03:03.730> get<00:03:03.910> a<00:03:04.090> very<00:03:05.049> well-matched

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
receivers we get a very well-matched

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.729 
receivers we get a very well-matched
system<00:03:06.459> and<00:03:06.640> a<00:03:07.000> very<00:03:07.269> well<00:03:07.510> performing<00:03:08.170> system

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
system and a very well performing system

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.949 
system and a very well performing system
what<00:03:09.489> I<00:03:09.519> wanted<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.030> create<00:03:10.360> with<00:03:10.780> these

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
what I wanted to create with these

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.990 
what I wanted to create with these
loudspeakers<00:03:11.590> is<00:03:11.709> not<00:03:11.890> only<00:03:12.370> bringing<00:03:12.760> you

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
loudspeakers is not only bringing you

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.240 
loudspeakers is not only bringing you
the<00:03:13.239> original<00:03:13.329> artistic<00:03:14.019> intention<00:03:14.799> of<00:03:15.040> the

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
the original artistic intention of the

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.910 
the original artistic intention of the
performances<00:03:15.940> but<00:03:16.510> also<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:17.049> fun<00:03:17.350> factor<00:03:17.590> in

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
performances but also the fun factor in

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.210 
performances but also the fun factor in
listening<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.430> music<00:03:19.049> we<00:03:20.049> want<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.769> listen<00:03:21.040> to

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
listening to music we want to listen to

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.990 
listening to music we want to listen to
music<00:03:21.340> we<00:03:21.970> want<00:03:22.150> to<00:03:22.329> enjoy<00:03:22.900> our<00:03:23.260> music<00:03:23.470> and<00:03:24.000> we

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
music we want to enjoy our music and we

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.150 
music we want to enjoy our music and we
want<00:03:25.180> to<00:03:25.269> be<00:03:25.390> surprised<00:03:25.930> by<00:03:26.350> what<00:03:26.650> is<00:03:26.859> in<00:03:27.100> that

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
want to be surprised by what is in that

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.340 
want to be surprised by what is in that
music<00:03:27.790> and<00:03:27.970> I<00:03:28.510> believe<00:03:28.570> that<00:03:29.079> these

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
music and I believe that these

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.280 
music and I believe that these
loudspeakers<00:03:30.100> allow<00:03:30.700> you<00:03:30.760> entry<00:03:31.600> into<00:03:32.140> that

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
loudspeakers allow you entry into that

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.280 
loudspeakers allow you entry into that
the<00:03:32.769> fun<00:03:33.100> of<00:03:33.340> what<00:03:33.609> is<00:03:33.730> in<00:03:33.880> that<00:03:33.910> music<00:03:34.540> to

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
the fun of what is in that music to

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.130 
the fun of what is in that music to
listen<00:03:35.859> more<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:36.609> more<00:03:36.910> and<00:03:37.239> fully<00:03:37.780> be
