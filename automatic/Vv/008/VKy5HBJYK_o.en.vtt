00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
go ahead and go to our dumbbells now

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.280 
go ahead and go to our dumbbells now
this<00:00:46.059> is<00:00:46.270> where<00:00:46.450> the<00:00:46.540> question<00:00:46.780> comes<00:00:47.110> is

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
this is where the question comes is

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.500 
this is where the question comes is
where<00:00:48.070> the<00:00:48.220> strength<00:00:48.520> gains<00:00:48.760> that<00:00:49.150> this<00:00:49.330> guy

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
where the strength gains that this guy

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.170 
where the strength gains that this guy
gets<00:00:49.840> on<00:00:50.580> dumbbells<00:00:51.580> will<00:00:51.820> that<00:00:51.940> translate

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
gets on dumbbells will that translate

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.560 
gets on dumbbells will that translate
over<00:00:52.720> to<00:00:53.110> strength<00:00:53.890> transfer<00:00:54.520> will<00:00:55.059> transfer

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
over to strength transfer will transfer

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.930 
over to strength transfer will transfer
over<00:00:55.600> into<00:00:56.170> strength<00:00:56.980> gains<00:00:57.220> on<00:00:57.430> the<00:00:57.460> barbells

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
over into strength gains on the barbells

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.910 
over into strength gains on the barbells
when<00:00:58.180> he<00:00:58.239> goes<00:00:58.420> back<00:00:58.630> to<00:00:58.900> it<00:00:59.050> into<00:00:59.829> the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
when he goes back to it into the

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.060 
when he goes back to it into the
machines<00:01:00.280> if<00:01:00.489> you<00:01:00.610> use<00:01:00.790> you<00:01:01.540> know<00:01:01.600> I'm<00:01:01.690> saying

types of machines right when you go back

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.300 
types of machines right when you go back
to<00:01:31.360> freeways<00:01:32.080> where<00:01:32.440> there's<00:01:32.649> barbell<00:01:33.100> or

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
to freeways where there's barbell or

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.639 
to freeways where there's barbell or
dumbbell<00:01:33.729> dumbbells<00:01:34.390> you're<00:01:35.200> gonna<00:01:35.380> notice

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
dumbbell dumbbells you're gonna notice

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.499 
dumbbell dumbbells you're gonna notice
there<00:01:36.369> are<00:01:36.459> a<00:01:36.520> lot<00:01:36.700> of<00:01:36.729> the<00:01:37.000> stabilizing

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
there are a lot of the stabilizing

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.210 
there are a lot of the stabilizing
strength<00:01:37.929> is<00:01:38.140> it's<00:01:38.530> not<00:01:38.709> gonna<00:01:38.860> be<00:01:39.069> that

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
strength is it's not gonna be that

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.919 
strength is it's not gonna be that
especially<00:01:39.670> people<00:01:39.700> moving<00:01:40.420> machines<00:01:40.720> any

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
especially people moving machines any

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:43.499 
especially people moving machines any
period<00:01:41.590> of<00:01:41.649> time<00:01:41.709> like<00:01:42.009> we<00:01:42.160> did<00:01:42.190> when<00:01:42.580> we<00:01:42.729> start

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
period of time like we did when we start

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:44.910 
period of time like we did when we start
having<00:01:43.780> a<00:01:43.810> soda<00:01:44.020> shoes<00:01:44.380> weren't<00:01:44.679> from<00:01:44.800> the

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
having a soda shoes weren't from the

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.240 
having a soda shoes weren't from the
freeways<00:01:45.250> to<00:01:45.550> to<00:01:46.390> machines<00:01:46.990> because<00:01:47.380> you<00:01:48.100> know

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
freeways to to machines because you know

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.859 
freeways to to machines because you know
when<00:01:48.429> we<00:01:48.520> did<00:01:48.640> machines<00:01:49.060> it<00:01:49.300> I'll<00:01:49.509> show<00:01:49.810> you

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
when we did machines it I'll show you

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.050 
when we did machines it I'll show you
issues<00:01:50.200> to<00:01:50.350> involve<00:01:50.649> us<00:01:50.830> and<00:01:51.039> now<00:01:51.280> if<00:01:51.880> they

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
issues to involve us and now if they

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.240 
issues to involve us and now if they
going<00:01:52.270> away<00:01:52.509> you<00:01:53.200> know<00:01:53.319> recently<00:01:53.800> two<00:01:53.979> months

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
going away you know recently two months

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.949 
going away you know recently two months
ago<00:01:54.310> we<00:01:54.520> started<00:01:54.789> doing<00:01:54.970> back<00:01:55.270> doing<00:01:55.690> the<00:01:55.780> free

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959 
ago we started doing back doing the free

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:57.419 
ago we started doing back doing the free
weights<00:01:56.140> and<00:01:56.319> we<00:01:56.410> have<00:01:56.530> lost<00:01:56.740> a<00:01:57.009> lot<00:01:57.069> of

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
weights and we have lost a lot of

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.820 
weights and we have lost a lot of
