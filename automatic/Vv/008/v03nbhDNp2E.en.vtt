 yes hello people i welcome you all 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.870
 heartily on my youtube channel my 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.610
 name is khan pieces from the company 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.109
 Studienkreis in Norderstedt and we are 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.279
 for 25 years the absolute 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.599
 Specialists is around the topic 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.949
 vehicle safety give my today 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:21.419
 video I want you again in 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.480
 alarm system installation imagine that we 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:27.210
 have done in a vw passat and 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:32.070
 we have blocked further from the 39 01 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.650
 alarm system the 508 straight module what 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.270
 I just reported here the shock 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.600
 Sensor factory in the plant 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.760
 is installed by mp3s 100 tilt sensor 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.340
 an additional interior siren 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.610
 this attracts 200 locating systems and from 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.560
 continue the 620 v look in the map like 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.750
 the alarm system your vehicle optimally 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.310
 against vandalism and burglary 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.330
 I would like to protect you from theft 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.340
 demonstrate 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.410
 why it is so important one today 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.510
 install subsequent alarm system 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.400
 quite simply the thieves these days 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.870
 have specialized in such 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.399
 to steal vehicles 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.920
 They know exactly how to get one 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:09.299
 Electronic vehicles nowadays 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.009
 Breaking up the key 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.380
 after how to make the immobilizer 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.299
 disables the factory 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.310
 alarm system disabled and how to do so 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.679
 have stolen a vehicle in minutes 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.810
 various video recordings from cameras 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:22.950
 seen as such vehicles cloud though 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.100
 is incredible how fast you are 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.090
 can steal a vehicle nowadays 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.829
 why we stole too much 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.069
 there are no more border controls 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.479
 requires high quality vehicle parts in the 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:34.679
 Eastern European space is gigantic 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.329
 and as I said that the 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:37.829
 border controls have disappeared and the 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.869
 also our currency have it for the 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.369
 very very simple digital age 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.649
 to steal such vehicles 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.209
 the factory alarms are 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.039
 Great for the cost but not 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:49.469
 just so ordered no big one 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.270
 installation time can read along everything wonderfully 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:52.439
 Unfortunately , those are at all cars 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.420
 right when he procures this 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.929
 passat can then crack all passats 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.279
 crack 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.049
 and if he specializes in it 

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:59.939
 has with these vehicles with the parts 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.380
 It is simply this to act 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.999
 theme which we install the best 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.600
 Systems of the world of far clifford 

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:05.880
 Empire 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.139
 These systems are all unique 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.629
 Thief does not know what the alarm center 

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:11.310
 installed the sensors have installed 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.120
 with backup system is installed 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.830
 the customer gets the car 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.140
 a notification on his pager 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.299
 if you have learned and never 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.030
 has a customer with us in 25 years 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.409
 have to accept loss neither after 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.659
 stolen have stolen the seats 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.670
 have still stolen the navi and 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.959
 In any case, that's what we are right for 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.760
 have a big say what the 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.510
 alarm systems here saves you 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.459
 a lot of trouble 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.560
 It is better that every insurance like 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.060
 our customers said since 25th 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.319
 sleep well as the whole year in 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.280
 the practice works with you 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.409
 demonstrate now 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.879
 we can sharpen the system and 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:45.280
 defuse the keyless entry 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.900
 System of the vehicle very comfortable 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.910
 made something new the alarm system 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.590
 generated when sharpening once 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.900
 chip when defusing twice 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.099
 Sharpen sharpening is shopping when he gets it 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.209
 would not have we can about 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.220
 the operator via the interface 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.810
 also out programming probably at the time 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.849
 programming is what the system is 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.739
 really sustainable is really great 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.269
 we only play the campus 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.370
 logs in the alarm system actually 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.840
 so-called vehicle dna and if that 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.859
 customer has said passat which was great but 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.420
 I now need no idea in 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.099
 touareg or a vw bus we build that 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.620
 system without residue back out completely 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:16.959
 important for leasing and fleet vehicles 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.790
 nothing breaks on the vehicle and 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.380
 you can do it then the next car 4 the 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.540
 alarm system is sharpened 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.519
 I'm looking at it now is the cool in 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.389
 Navi in â€‹â€‹there mass what the thieves gamble 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.799
 glotz purely 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.690
 I do not need the car 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.599
 to touch and that's what the system does 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.819
 efficiency is very good 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.470
 By the way, that was the alarm system in there 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.299
 that was not the one that was the x6 on 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.940
 he's all working and that's what he does 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.709
 system so need efficiency strong 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.870
 just pure expected peeping 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.790
 just a bit irritating 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.739
 because dÃ¶rner in it just coded a car 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.480
 almost not the car when I watch 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.069
 there is something going on in the 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.889
 alarm now says hau you off 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.359
 You have no business here on the passat 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.919
 also works with the shock 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.199
 I should show that we have the car just like that 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:00.459
 easy mekka the alarm system 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:01.690
 from around that's for mine 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.819
 taste a bit very sensitive 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.449
 but the customer's customer is hired 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.910
 loves being 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:08.980
 he loves his vehicle and that's why 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.790
 have that here relatively sensitive 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.160
 adjusted 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.870
 When I returned to the vehicle I 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.579
 just turn on the alarm system chip twice 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.859
 Everything was wonderful chip the alarm 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:20.859
 four times then was definitely one 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.450
 incident in my absence this 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.010
 Of course, customer gets automatically on 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.100
 his iphone is a notification 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.940
 when the alarm system sounded alarm 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.440
 if i do not have the area code yet 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.419
 have generated would go Scherfig 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.550
 were quite normal was the small view 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.410
 you dare to hone those again 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.210
 alarm system chip now three times that 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.250
 chipping three times now tells me in the 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.990
 Pre-warning here no matter what 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.630
 now here at the car now gives 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.530
 there is no warning 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.880
 Of course we always build the on 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.039
 board diagnostics to diagnose the on board 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.900
 a huge theme is a standard 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:51.340
 which all vehicles have worldwide 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.530
 and that has a huge big disadvantage 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.850
 is great for the workshops for the 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.139
 namely breakdown services can all with the 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.060
 the same plug in and look what's going on 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.070
 We are using them unfortunately today 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.840
 There are also various companies internet 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.550
 Cloud tools offer about the on 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.139
 board diagnosis is an absolute one 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.880
 standard with us every vehicle what 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.460
 us in the yard comes to the hedge 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.349
 is badly rebuilt by us that the on 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.449
 board diagnosis on the paint that is the 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:15.250
 thief can not find any connection in the car 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.090
 He can come with his tool 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.680
 do whatever he wants 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.000
 the true war of no longer stolen 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.530
 yes I hope my contribution was 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.789
 interesting for you if I have something 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.259
 should have forgotten or have a look
