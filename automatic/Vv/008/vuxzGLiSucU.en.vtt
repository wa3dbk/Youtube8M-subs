00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
talk about right now I think in this

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.270 
talk about right now I think in this
mile<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.369> quarter<00:00:32.550> dirt<00:00:33.300> event<00:00:33.800> at<00:00:34.800> belmont

mile and a quarter dirt event at belmont

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.700 
mile and a quarter dirt event at belmont
park<00:00:35.340> for<00:00:35.640> three-year-olds<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.270> up<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:37.290> think

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
park for three-year-olds and up I think

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.229 
park for three-year-olds and up I think
there's<00:00:37.860> three<00:00:38.070> horses<00:00:38.399> Oh<00:00:38.610> obviously

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
there's three horses Oh obviously

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.580 
there's three horses Oh obviously
there's<00:00:39.420> three<00:00:39.600> horses<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.020> are<00:00:40.079> ten<00:00:40.260> points

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
there's three horses that are ten points

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.720 
there's three horses that are ten points
better<00:00:40.710> than<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.950> rest<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.250> field<00:00:41.489> and

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
better than the rest of the field and

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.360 
better than the rest of the field and
that's<00:00:42.390> quality<00:00:42.899> road<00:00:43.200> summer<00:00:43.530> burden<00:00:44.010> macho

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
that's quality road summer burden macho

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.330 
that's quality road summer burden macho
again<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:45.329> think<00:00:45.930> an<00:00:46.079> easy<00:00:46.320> attic<00:00:46.710> boy<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.160> dry

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
again I think an easy attic boy and dry

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.650 
again I think an easy attic boy and dry
martini<00:00:47.820> have<00:00:47.969> kind<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.210> proven<00:00:48.480> themselves

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
martini have kind of proven themselves

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.500 
martini have kind of proven themselves
to<00:00:48.930> be<00:00:49.020> more<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.590> grade<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.789> type<00:00:51.030> animals

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
to be more of a grade to type animals

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.160 
to be more of a grade to type animals
and<00:00:51.980> in<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.280> end<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.760> having<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.600> having<00:00:55.079> to

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
and in the end of having to having to

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.720 
and in the end of having to having to
overcome<00:00:55.289> three<00:00:55.860> horses<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.340> are<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.579> much

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
overcome three horses that are that much

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.090 
overcome three horses that are that much
better<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.510> probably<00:00:58.020> quite<00:00:58.170> unlikely<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.039> if

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
better is probably quite unlikely so if

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.670 
better is probably quite unlikely so if
we<00:00:59.190> look<00:00:59.219> at<00:00:59.399> these<00:00:59.550> top<00:00:59.910> three<00:01:00.149> contenders

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
we look at these top three contenders

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.959 
we look at these top three contenders
let's<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:02.190> break<00:01:02.460> down<00:01:02.640> what<00:01:02.850> they've

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
let's just break down what they've

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.130 
let's just break down what they've
actually<00:01:03.149> accomplished<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.960> racetrack

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
actually accomplished on the racetrack

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.679 
actually accomplished on the racetrack
this<00:01:04.589> year<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.760> by<00:01:06.119> far<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> most

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
this year the by far the most

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.359 
this year the by far the most
accomplished<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.470> would<00:01:07.590> say<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.890> summer<00:01:08.100> bird

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
accomplished I would say is summer bird

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.280 
accomplished I would say is summer bird
horses<00:01:09.299> one<00:01:09.450> at<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.600> mile<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.900> half<00:01:09.930> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
horses one at a mile and a half the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.800 
horses one at a mile and a half the
horses<00:01:10.590> wanted<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.890> mile<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> quarter<00:01:11.810> red

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
horses wanted a mile and a quarter red

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.480 
horses wanted a mile and a quarter red
an<00:01:12.930> exceptionally<00:01:13.740> good<00:01:13.770> race<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
an exceptionally good race in the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.460 
an exceptionally good race in the
Haskell<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.180> race<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.570> really<00:01:16.080> stacked<00:01:16.320> up

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
Haskell in a race that really stacked up

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.859 
Haskell in a race that really stacked up
against<00:01:16.799> them<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.909> think<00:01:18.030> summer<00:01:18.420> bird<00:01:18.689> has

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
against them so I think summer bird has

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.050 
against them so I think summer bird has
accomplished<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.799> most<00:01:20.040> with<00:01:20.310> macho<00:01:20.729> again

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
accomplished the most with macho again

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.749 
accomplished the most with macho again
also<00:01:21.869> really<00:01:22.710> being<00:01:22.950> at<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.220> top<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.430> his<00:01:23.729> game

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
also really being at the top of his game

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.390 
also really being at the top of his game
he's<00:01:24.090> really<00:01:24.540> put<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.810> into<00:01:24.900> into<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> second

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
he's really put it into into a second

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.219 
he's really put it into into a second
gear<00:01:26.670> here<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:27.000> his<00:01:27.119> four-year-old<00:01:27.600> campaign

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
gear here in his four-year-old campaign

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.100 
gear here in his four-year-old campaign
and<00:01:28.610> he<00:01:29.610> seems<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.060> be<00:01:30.090> really<00:01:30.479> at<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> top<00:01:31.079> of

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
and he seems to be really at the top of

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.240 
and he seems to be really at the top of
his<00:01:31.470> game<00:01:31.610> in<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.820> Woodward<00:01:33.210> he<00:01:33.869> finished

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
his game in the Woodward he finished

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.859 
his game in the Woodward he finished
just<00:01:35.250> behind<00:01:35.340> Rachel<00:01:36.119> Alexandra<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.750> what

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
just behind Rachel Alexandra and what

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.230 
just behind Rachel Alexandra and what
was<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> thrilling<00:01:37.439> race<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.880> only<00:01:39.090> thing

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
was a thrilling race the only thing

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.700 
was a thrilling race the only thing
knocked<00:01:39.600> against<00:01:39.930> macho<00:01:40.229> again<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.590> could

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
knocked against macho again that I could

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.350 
knocked against macho again that I could
say<00:01:40.829> about<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.130> races<00:01:41.490> Rachel<00:01:41.820> was<00:01:41.939> tested

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
say about that races Rachel was tested

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.719 
say about that races Rachel was tested
at<00:01:42.540> least<00:01:43.170> three<00:01:43.470> times<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.159> race<00:01:44.430> and

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
at least three times in that race and

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.850 
at least three times in that race and
should<00:01:45.149> have<00:01:45.210> been<00:01:45.270> softened<00:01:45.720> up<00:01:45.899> enough<00:01:46.200> for

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
should have been softened up enough for

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.710 
should have been softened up enough for
the<00:01:46.920> four<00:01:47.130> year<00:01:47.310> old<00:01:47.460> male<00:01:47.759> cult<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.329> get<00:01:48.509> buyer

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
the four year old male cult to get buyer

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.499 
the four year old male cult to get buyer
and<00:01:49.350> he<00:01:49.530> failed<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:50.009> do<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:51.360> would

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
and he failed to do that so that would

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.630 
and he failed to do that so that would
be<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> strike<00:01:51.899> against<00:01:52.170> macho<00:01:52.590> again<00:01:52.799> quality

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
be a strike against macho again quality

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.910 
be a strike against macho again quality
road<00:01:53.820> really<00:01:54.420> has<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.780> prove<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.530> us<00:01:55.560> still

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
road really has to prove it to us still

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.219 
road really has to prove it to us still
on<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.189> racetrack<00:01:56.369> he's<00:01:56.850> never<00:01:57.030> wanted<00:01:57.450> at<00:01:58.140> a

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
on the racetrack he's never wanted at a

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.719 
on the racetrack he's never wanted at a
classic<00:01:58.649> distance<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.189> mile<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> quarter

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
classic distance of a mile and a quarter

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.600 
classic distance of a mile and a quarter
or<00:01:59.969> better<00:02:00.350> certainly<00:02:01.350> has<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.590> talent<00:02:02.040> to

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
or better certainly has the talent to

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.819 
or better certainly has the talent to
step<00:02:03.390> up<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:04.619> surprise<00:02:05.189> but<00:02:05.579> as<00:02:06.710> would<00:02:07.710> be

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
step up and and surprise but as would be

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.469 
step up and and surprise but as would be
demanded<00:02:08.459> we<00:02:08.610> would<00:02:08.759> we<00:02:08.940> would<00:02:08.970> have<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.360> get

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
demanded we would we would have to get

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.330 
demanded we would we would have to get
significantly<00:02:10.110> better<00:02:10.410> odds<00:02:10.649> on<00:02:10.920> quality

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
significantly better odds on quality

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.460 
significantly better odds on quality
road<00:02:11.520> because<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:12.060> know<00:02:12.180> prove<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.870> me

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
road because you know prove it to me

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.270 
road because you know prove it to me
so<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:14.220> think<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.390> those<00:02:15.540> are<00:02:15.570> that's<00:02:16.290> what

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
so I think that those are that's what

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
so I think that those are that's what
they've<00:02:17.430> accomplished<00:02:17.910> on<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.060> racetrack

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
they've accomplished on the racetrack

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.610 
they've accomplished on the racetrack
now<00:02:18.690> let's<00:02:18.840> look<00:02:18.930> at<00:02:19.080> how<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.230> race<00:02:19.440> may

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
now let's look at how the race may

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.280 
now let's look at how the race may
actually<00:02:19.770> play<00:02:20.220> out<00:02:20.250> on<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.730> racetrack<00:02:20.880> today

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
actually play out on the racetrack today

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.970 
actually play out on the racetrack today
Tuesday<00:02:22.290> is<00:02:22.350> probably<00:02:22.590> going<00:02:22.710> to<00:02:22.800> get<00:02:22.860> the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
Tuesday is probably going to get the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.700 
Tuesday is probably going to get the
lead<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:24.150> think<00:02:24.360> that<00:02:24.510> without<00:02:25.140> question

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
lead and I think that without question

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.200 
lead and I think that without question
quality<00:02:26.100> road<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.460> summer<00:02:26.640> bird<00:02:26.850> all<00:02:27.000> have<00:02:27.090> to

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
quality road and summer bird all have to

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.550 
quality road and summer bird all have to
worry<00:02:27.390> too<00:02:27.570> much<00:02:27.600> about<00:02:27.750> this<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.290> can<00:02:28.410> pretty

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
worry too much about this and can pretty

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.530 
worry too much about this and can pretty
much<00:02:28.650> let<00:02:28.980> him<00:02:29.010> run<00:02:29.280> whether<00:02:29.910> he<00:02:30.060> runs<00:02:30.240> fast

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
much let him run whether he runs fast

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.090 
much let him run whether he runs fast
fractions<00:02:31.050> or<00:02:31.170> whether<00:02:31.320> it<00:02:31.500> backs<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:31.890> up<00:02:31.950> a

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
fractions or whether it backs it up a

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.800 
fractions or whether it backs it up a
little<00:02:32.250> bit<00:02:32.460> because<00:02:32.640> they're<00:02:33.540> going<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:33.720> be

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
little bit because they're going to be

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.150 
little bit because they're going to be
close<00:02:34.050> enough<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.410> have<00:02:34.650> enough<00:02:34.860> speed<00:02:35.100> to

close enough to have enough speed to

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.040 
close enough to have enough speed to

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
stay in contact and tis ways probably

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.640

figures to be so that's a that's a

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.280 
figures to be so that's a that's a
strike<00:02:58.770> against<00:02:59.010> macho<00:02:59.400> again<00:03:00.050> when<00:03:01.050> we<00:03:01.140> look

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
strike against macho again when we look

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.400 
strike against macho again when we look
at<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.500> odds<00:03:02.540> summer<00:03:03.540> bird<00:03:03.780> seems<00:03:04.020> to<00:03:04.140> stack

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
at the odds summer bird seems to stack

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.770 
at the odds summer bird seems to stack
up<00:03:04.650> as<00:03:04.860> both<00:03:05.670> accomplishing<00:03:06.510> more<00:03:06.600> on<00:03:06.720> the

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
up as both accomplishing more on the

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.300 
up as both accomplishing more on the
racetrack<00:03:06.959> this<00:03:07.320> year<00:03:07.530> being<00:03:08.100> in<00:03:08.220> an

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
racetrack this year being in an

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.610 
racetrack this year being in an
excellent<00:03:08.640> form<00:03:08.910> as<00:03:09.090> well<00:03:09.150> as<00:03:10.050> having<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.410> pace

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
excellent form as well as having a pace

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.640 
excellent form as well as having a pace
scenario<00:03:11.130> that<00:03:11.450> that<00:03:12.450> is<00:03:12.570> favorable<00:03:13.200> for<00:03:13.230> him

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
scenario that that is favorable for him

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.120 
scenario that that is favorable for him
so<00:03:13.860> if<00:03:14.150> you<00:03:15.150> can<00:03:15.300> get<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.660> 21<00:03:16.020> on<00:03:16.230> summer<00:03:16.860> bird<00:03:17.040> I

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
so if you can get to 21 on summer bird I

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.800 
so if you can get to 21 on summer bird I
think<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.370> would<00:03:17.459> be<00:03:17.550> an<00:03:17.640> excellent<00:03:18.000> odds<00:03:18.330> play

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
think it would be an excellent odds play

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.890 
think it would be an excellent odds play
if<00:03:19.680> you're<00:03:19.920> not<00:03:20.100> if<00:03:20.310> summer<00:03:21.269> bird<00:03:21.510> goes<00:03:21.720> off

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
if you're not if summer bird goes off

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.210 
if you're not if summer bird goes off
significantly<00:03:22.140> less<00:03:22.650> than<00:03:22.709> that<00:03:22.980> you<00:03:23.100> just

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
significantly less than that you just

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.460 
significantly less than that you just
have<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.489> you<00:03:24.180> know<00:03:24.269> make<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.480> choice<00:03:24.780> of<00:03:24.959> how

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
have to you know make the choice of how

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.540 
have to you know make the choice of how
little<00:03:26.130> are<00:03:26.310> you<00:03:26.670> going<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.709> stand<00:03:28.709> to<00:03:28.950> gain<00:03:29.190> to

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
little are you going to stand to gain to

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.759 
little are you going to stand to gain to
say<00:03:30.209> that<00:03:30.420> summer<00:03:30.630> bird<00:03:30.870> is<00:03:31.050> going<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.410> do<00:03:31.590> what

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
say that summer bird is going to do what

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.259 
say that summer bird is going to do what
he<00:03:31.890> actually<00:03:32.160> should<00:03:32.640> do<00:03:32.820> on<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.120> racetrack

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
he actually should do on the racetrack

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.080 
he actually should do on the racetrack
today<00:03:34.220> quality<00:03:35.220> road<00:03:35.459> I<00:03:35.489> think<00:03:35.670> you're<00:03:35.880> going

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
today quality road I think you're going

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.590 
today quality road I think you're going
to<00:03:36.150> need<00:03:36.330> for<00:03:36.630> 21<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.500> justify<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:39.090> additional

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
to need for 21 to justify the additional

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.620 
to need for 21 to justify the additional
uncertainty<00:03:40.320> in<00:03:40.850> what<00:03:41.850> he<00:03:41.970> can<00:03:42.150> do<00:03:42.330> on<00:03:42.360> the

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
uncertainty in what he can do on the

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.030 
uncertainty in what he can do on the
racetrack<00:03:42.840> he's<00:03:43.260> going<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.470> have<00:03:43.590> to<00:03:43.620> prove<00:03:43.920> it

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
racetrack he's going to have to prove it

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.930 
racetrack he's going to have to prove it
at<00:03:44.130> a<00:03:44.160> mile<00:03:44.310> and<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.489> quarter<00:03:44.640> but<00:03:44.850> he's

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
at a mile and a quarter but he's

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.729 
at a mile and a quarter but he's
probably<00:03:45.060> worth<00:03:45.360> it<00:03:45.570> at<00:03:46.049> four<00:03:46.350> to<00:03:46.440> one<00:03:46.620> or

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
probably worth it at four to one or

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:47.810 
probably worth it at four to one or
better<00:03:46.920> I<00:03:47.010> don't<00:03:47.250> know<00:03:47.310> if<00:03:47.400> you're<00:03:47.489> gonna<00:03:47.580> get

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
better I don't know if you're gonna get

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:48.740 
better I don't know if you're gonna get
that<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:48.180> that's<00:03:48.299> when<00:03:48.450> I'm<00:03:48.540> throwing

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
that and that's when I'm throwing

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.289 
that and that's when I'm throwing
quality<00:03:48.989> road<00:03:49.350> out<00:03:49.530> ma<00:03:50.250> chill<00:03:50.430> again<00:03:50.549> I<00:03:50.910> think

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
quality road out ma chill again I think

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.550 
quality road out ma chill again I think
you<00:03:51.390> actually<00:03:51.510> may<00:03:51.750> get<00:03:51.959> three<00:03:52.200> or<00:03:52.230> four<00:03:52.470> to

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
you actually may get three or four to

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.020 
you actually may get three or four to
one<00:03:52.709> on<00:03:52.830> macho<00:03:53.010> again<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.549> he's<00:03:53.640> not<00:03:53.790> a<00:03:53.820> bad

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
one on macho again and he's not a bad

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.350 
one on macho again and he's not a bad
play<00:03:54.269> at<00:03:54.420> that<00:03:54.570> at<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.230> level<00:03:55.620> so<00:03:56.070> i<00:03:56.360> would

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
play at that at that level so i would

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.000 
play at that at that level so i would
say<00:03:57.510> summer<00:03:57.810> bird<00:03:58.080> at<00:03:58.230> eight<00:03:58.350> to<00:03:58.500> five<00:03:58.739> are

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
say summer bird at eight to five are

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.420 
say summer bird at eight to five are
better<00:03:59.220> odds<00:03:59.989> macho<00:04:00.989> again<00:04:01.320> at<00:04:01.739> seven<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.280> two

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
better odds macho again at seven to two

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.780 
better odds macho again at seven to two
or<00:04:02.580> better<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:04.190> basically<00:04:05.190> so<00:04:05.430> it's<00:04:05.610> summer

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
or better and basically so it's summer

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.190 
or better and basically so it's summer
bird<00:04:06.000> over<00:04:06.239> macho<00:04:06.450> again

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
bird over macho again

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.290 
bird over macho again
