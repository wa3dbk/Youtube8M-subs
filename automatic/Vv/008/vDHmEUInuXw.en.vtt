whatever nvidia comes out with our you
know<00:01:07.619> after<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.520> 980<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.180> like<00:01:09.360> 980<00:01:10.049> TI

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
know after the 980 so like 980 TI

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.219 
know after the 980 so like 980 TI
another<00:01:10.920> Titan<00:01:11.310> base<00:01:11.430> card<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> 3<00:01:12.630> 90<00:01:12.960> x<00:01:13.110> is

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
another Titan base card so the 3 90 x is

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.859 
another Titan base card so the 3 90 x is
actually<00:01:13.530> supposed<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.950> compete<00:01:14.130> with

out for challenger to the 780 ti it's

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.380 
out for challenger to the 780 ti it's
they're<00:01:23.460> going<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> be<00:01:23.729> doing<00:01:23.850> something<00:01:24.180> like

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
they're going to be doing something like

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.740 
they're going to be doing something like
that<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.170> terms<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.619> 900<00:01:26.159> series

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
that but in terms of the 900 series

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.890 
that but in terms of the 900 series
series<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:28.020> our<00:01:28.200> nvidia<00:01:28.740> gpus<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:30.150> what<00:01:30.750> does

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
series of our nvidia gpus so what does

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.310 
series of our nvidia gpus so what does
this<00:01:31.079> mean<00:01:32.000> hopefully<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.150> box<00:01:33.509> up<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> GPU

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
this mean hopefully this box up the GPU

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.980 
this mean hopefully this box up the GPU
seen<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.860> mean<00:01:35.400> everyone's<00:01:35.939> waiting<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.420> AMD

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
seen I mean everyone's waiting for AMD

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.289 
seen I mean everyone's waiting for AMD
to<00:01:37.170> come<00:01:37.380> out<00:01:37.560> with<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:38.040> challenger<00:01:38.610> for

to come out with a challenger for

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.969 
to come out with a challenger for
something<00:01:39.600> new<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.049> prices<00:01:40.439> get<00:01:40.740> pushed

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
something new so the prices get pushed

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.819 
something new so the prices get pushed
down<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:42.119> videos<00:01:42.540> forced<00:01:43.229> essentially

stat hbm memory now if you guys don't
know<00:02:25.239> what<00:02:25.390> that<00:02:25.540> is<00:02:25.569> ah<00:02:26.110> it's<00:02:26.920> just<00:02:27.069> stacked

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
know what that is ah it's just stacked

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.120 
know what that is ah it's just stacked
vram<00:02:28.090> I'm<00:02:28.360> not<00:02:28.630> really<00:02:28.840> an<00:02:29.020> expert<00:02:29.319> on<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:29.709> so

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
vram I'm not really an expert on it so

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.860 
vram I'm not really an expert on it so
if<00:02:30.370> anyone<00:02:30.790> is<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.450> you're<00:02:31.569> watching<00:02:31.660> this

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
if anyone is and you're watching this

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.930 
if anyone is and you're watching this
video<00:02:32.170> please<00:02:32.769> you<00:02:32.890> know<00:02:33.040> comment<00:02:33.700> down<00:02:33.790> below

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
video please you know comment down below

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.270 
video please you know comment down below
you<00:02:34.360> know<00:02:34.510> give<00:02:35.260> a<00:02:35.290> more<00:02:35.500> detailed

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
you know give a more detailed

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.550 
you know give a more detailed
explanation<00:02:36.569> but<00:02:37.569> all<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:37.840> pretty<00:02:38.140> much<00:02:38.230> really

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
explanation but all I pretty much really

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.490 
explanation but all I pretty much really
know<00:02:38.800> is<00:02:39.099> that<00:02:39.400> it's<00:02:39.760> just<00:02:40.090> stacked<00:02:40.330> vram<00:02:40.870> so

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
know is that it's just stacked vram so

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.860 
know is that it's just stacked vram so
you<00:02:41.590> can<00:02:41.709> have<00:02:41.920> more<00:02:42.430> RAM<00:02:42.819> on<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:43.510> know<00:02:43.630> in

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
you can have more RAM on you know in

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.759 
you can have more RAM on you know in
locker<00:02:44.440> area<00:02:45.310> I<00:02:45.640> guess<00:02:45.940> so<00:02:46.660> other<00:02:47.290> I<00:02:47.620> don't

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
locker area I guess so other I don't

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.140 
locker area I guess so other I don't
really<00:02:47.860> know<00:02:48.040> how<00:02:48.250> it<00:02:48.370> works<00:02:48.580> well<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:48.850> know<00:02:48.910> is

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
really know how it works well I know is

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.210 
really know how it works well I know is
that<00:02:49.180> it<00:02:49.480> is<00:02:49.630> much<00:02:49.870> more<00:02:50.140> efficient<00:02:50.739> and<00:02:50.860> you

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
that it is much more efficient and you

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.860 
that it is much more efficient and you
get<00:02:51.430> much<00:02:51.730> better<00:02:51.940> performance<00:02:52.480> out<00:02:52.630> of<00:02:52.690> it

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
get much better performance out of it

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.340 
get much better performance out of it
versus<00:02:53.470> gddr5<00:02:54.450> so<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.510> know<00:02:55.840> who<00:02:56.319> knows

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
versus gddr5 so you know who knows

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.470 
versus gddr5 so you know who knows
what's<00:02:56.709> going<00:02:56.860> to<00:02:56.950> happen<00:02:57.190> with<00:02:57.280> that<00:02:57.480> the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
what's going to happen with that the

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.660 
what's going to happen with that the
funny<00:02:58.750> thing<00:02:58.840> is<00:02:59.080> that<00:02:59.430> Nvidia<00:03:00.430> don't

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
funny thing is that Nvidia don't

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.970 
funny thing is that Nvidia don't
actually<00:03:01.060> plan<00:03:01.330> on<00:03:01.360> using<00:03:01.660> 3d<00:03:02.260> stacked<00:03:02.590> memory

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
actually plan on using 3d stacked memory

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.430 
actually plan on using 3d stacked memory
for<00:03:03.519> a<00:03:03.549> few<00:03:03.730> years<00:03:03.790> so<00:03:04.390> I'd<00:03:04.720> really<00:03:05.080> know<00:03:05.230> how

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
for a few years so I'd really know how

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.610 
for a few years so I'd really know how
legitimate<00:03:05.830> that<00:03:06.130> is<00:03:06.340> but<00:03:07.239> anyway<00:03:07.810> that's<00:03:08.349> too

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
legitimate that is but anyway that's too

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.500 
legitimate that is but anyway that's too
much<00:03:08.799> it<00:03:09.099> guys<00:03:09.130> there<00:03:09.700> wasn't<00:03:10.000> much<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.299> talk

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
much it guys there wasn't much to talk

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.360 
much it guys there wasn't much to talk
about<00:03:10.569> but<00:03:10.900> there's<00:03:11.349> a<00:03:11.440> lot<00:03:11.590> of<00:03:11.620> speculation

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
about but there's a lot of speculation

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.360 
about but there's a lot of speculation
going<00:03:12.610> around<00:03:12.910> now<00:03:13.569> it's<00:03:14.019> just<00:03:14.470> so<00:03:14.739> typical<00:03:14.950> we

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
going around now it's just so typical we

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.460 
going around now it's just so typical we
had<00:03:15.519> the<00:03:15.640> same<00:03:15.849> kind<00:03:16.090> of<00:03:16.180> speculation<00:03:16.870> of<00:03:17.049> the

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
had the same kind of speculation of the

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.020 
had the same kind of speculation of the
GTX<00:03:18.329> 970<00:03:19.410> of<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.500> online<00:03:20.859> 300<00:03:21.459> series<00:03:21.609> as<00:03:21.850> well

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030
