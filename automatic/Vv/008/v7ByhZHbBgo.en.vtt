being<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.379> antennas<00:00:16.859> on<00:00:16.949> this

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
being is that the antennas on this

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.620 
being is that the antennas on this
device<00:00:17.340> have<00:00:17.550> actually<00:00:17.820> been<00:00:17.910> modified<00:00:18.359> and

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
device have actually been modified and

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.179 
device have actually been modified and
this<00:00:18.990> little<00:00:19.199> ringer<00:00:19.500> switch<00:00:19.650> has<00:00:19.920> actually

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
this little ringer switch has actually

this little ringer switch has actually
been<00:00:20.310> moved<00:00:20.609> slightly<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:21.750> it's<00:00:21.900> very

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
been moved slightly so it's very

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.140 
been moved slightly so it's very
possible<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.590> your<00:00:22.890> iPhone<00:00:23.250> 4<00:00:23.490> cases<00:00:23.789> will
