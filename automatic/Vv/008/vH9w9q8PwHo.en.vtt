00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
this is full channel and I know how to

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.340 
this is full channel and I know how to
fill<00:00:14.160> out<00:00:14.219> four<00:00:14.460> channels<00:00:14.790> so<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:15.839> can<00:00:16.170> easily

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
fill out four channels so I can easily

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:32.200 
fill out four channels so I can easily
see<00:00:16.740> if<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.609> good<00:00:17.820> performer<00:00:18.270> or<00:00:18.449> not

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.170 

hey<00:01:32.130> it's<00:01:32.490> gliding

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.940 

am<00:01:38.690> I<00:01:38.810> in<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.020> way<00:01:39.700> hmm

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.600 

I<00:01:46.039> should<00:01:46.759> climb<00:01:47.030> higher<00:01:47.329> before<00:01:47.719> I<00:01:47.930> do<00:01:48.049> some

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
I should climb higher before I do some

quick<00:02:10.489> as<00:02:10.700> well<00:02:14.590> hmm<00:02:15.590> let<00:02:16.250> me<00:02:16.280> see<00:02:16.670> if<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.060> can

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
quick as well hmm let me see if I can

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:33.440 
quick as well hmm let me see if I can
lend<00:02:17.420> it<00:02:17.599> properly

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.309 

it's<00:02:34.450> not<00:02:34.750> i'm<00:02:35.080> using<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:36.000> small<00:02:37.000> 2.4<00:02:37.780> g<00:02:37.959> radio

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
it's not i'm using a small 2.4 g radio

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.290 
it's not i'm using a small 2.4 g radio
that<00:02:38.530> i<00:02:38.560> found<00:02:38.920> somewhere<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:39.700> it's<00:02:39.880> not<00:02:40.270> a

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
that i found somewhere and it's not a

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.390 
that i found somewhere and it's not a
standard<00:02:40.930> radio<00:02:41.470> that<00:02:41.650> comes<00:02:41.890> with<00:02:42.100> it<00:02:42.130> i

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
standard radio that comes with it i

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.640 
standard radio that comes with it i
cannot<00:02:42.700> set<00:02:42.940> dual<00:02:43.180> Rachel<00:02:43.690> or<00:02:43.750> anything<00:02:44.110> so

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
cannot set dual Rachel or anything so

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.510 
cannot set dual Rachel or anything so
elevated<00:02:45.400> response<00:02:46.330> is<00:02:46.480> just<00:02:46.750> too<00:02:47.290> fast<00:02:47.680> men

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.280 

but<00:02:51.520> take<00:02:51.730> off<00:02:51.910> was<00:02:52.120> good<00:02:52.360> we<00:02:52.840> need<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:53.110> set

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
but take off was good we need to set

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.260 
but take off was good we need to set
dual<00:02:53.530> rates<00:02:53.800> on<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.069> front<00:02:54.370> turning<00:02:54.819> wheel<00:02:55.000> in

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
dual rates on the front turning wheel in

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.990 
dual rates on the front turning wheel in
fact<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:56.140> then<00:02:56.890> they<00:02:57.070> can<00:02:57.220> have<00:02:57.400> like<00:02:57.670> very

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
fact and then they can have like very

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:23.360 
fact and then they can have like very
good<00:02:58.239> response<00:02:58.510> on<00:02:58.930> moving<00:02:59.800> around

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.010 

yeah<00:03:24.370> if<00:03:24.520> I<00:03:24.640> did<00:03:24.819> it

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.920 

here<00:03:28.650> comes<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:29.010> little<00:03:29.130> Cessna<00:03:29.550> back<00:03:30.450> after<00:03:30.900> a

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
here comes a little Cessna back after a

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.500 
here comes a little Cessna back after a
big<00:03:31.230> flight<00:03:34.280> now<00:03:35.280> that<00:03:35.490> was<00:03:35.670> a<00:03:35.700> great<00:03:35.970> maiden

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
big flight now that was a great maiden

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.620 
big flight now that was a great maiden
flight<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:37.080> think<00:03:37.740> this<00:03:38.010> bird<00:03:38.280> is<00:03:38.460> good<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:39.390> fly

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
flight I think this bird is good to fly

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.620 
flight I think this bird is good to fly
and<00:03:39.900> have<00:03:40.080> fun<00:03:40.310> let's<00:03:41.310> try<00:03:41.550> a<00:03:41.580> three<00:03:42.120> or<00:03:42.360> we

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
and have fun let's try a three or we

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.730 
and have fun let's try a three or we
should<00:03:42.690> try<00:03:43.020> that<00:03:43.050> dolphin<00:03:43.650> type<00:03:43.920> of<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.280> pusher
