presentation

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.370 

one<00:00:09.340> of<00:00:09.460> the<00:00:09.550> common<00:00:09.970> threads<00:00:10.330> that<00:00:10.660> recently

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:11.380 
one of the common threads that recently

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.500 
one of the common threads that recently
happened<00:00:11.590> was<00:00:12.010> about<00:00:12.160> dots<00:00:12.760> prints<00:00:13.360> and

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.510 
happened was about dots prints and

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.500 
happened was about dots prints and
screen<00:00:14.170> resolution<00:00:14.920> and<00:00:15.100> the<00:00:15.940> question<00:00:16.330> was

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.510 
screen resolution and the question was

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.400 
screen resolution and the question was
actually<00:00:16.720> what's<00:00:17.590> the<00:00:18.420> smallest<00:00:19.420> screen<00:00:20.140> you

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
actually what's the smallest screen you

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.880 
actually what's the smallest screen you
can<00:00:20.619> get<00:00:20.860> with<00:00:21.220> one-to-one<00:00:22.710> resolution<00:00:23.710> I

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
can get with one-to-one resolution I

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.700 
can get with one-to-one resolution I
think<00:00:24.100> was<00:00:24.250> the<00:00:24.369> way<00:00:24.460> it<00:00:24.580> was<00:00:24.610> phrased<00:00:25.259> and<00:00:26.259> I

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
think was the way it was phrased and I

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.200 
think was the way it was phrased and I
really<00:00:27.220> wanted<00:00:27.430> to<00:00:27.520> talk<00:00:27.730> about<00:00:27.759> what

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
really wanted to talk about what

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.179 
really wanted to talk about what
one-to-one<00:00:28.900> resolution<00:00:29.590> is<00:00:29.740> one-to-one

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
one-to-one resolution is one-to-one

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.370 
one-to-one resolution is one-to-one
resolution<00:00:30.880> means<00:00:31.060> that<00:00:31.270> one<00:00:31.540> pixel<00:00:32.140> is

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380 
resolution means that one pixel is

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.880 
resolution means that one pixel is
represented<00:00:32.439> by<00:00:33.250> one<00:00:33.520> pixel<00:00:33.940> on<00:00:34.120> the<00:00:34.150> screen

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
represented by one pixel on the screen

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.890 
represented by one pixel on the screen
when<00:00:35.890> you're<00:00:36.040> looking<00:00:36.370> at<00:00:36.670> something<00:00:37.120> like<00:00:37.570> a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
when you're looking at something like a

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.240 
when you're looking at something like a
small<00:00:38.560> screen<00:00:39.280> it<00:00:39.880> may<00:00:40.149> have<00:00:40.690> our<00:00:41.469> really

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
small screen it may have our really

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.979 
small screen it may have our really
projectors<00:00:42.850> probably<00:00:43.239> the<00:00:43.300> projector<00:00:43.780> is<00:00:43.870> the

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
projectors probably the projector is the

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.650 
projectors probably the projector is the
best<00:00:44.170> example<00:00:44.800> you<00:00:45.579> get<00:00:45.730> a<00:00:45.760> projector<00:00:46.300> and<00:00:46.480> it

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
best example you get a projector and it

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.290 
best example you get a projector and it
will<00:00:46.809> say<00:00:47.190> 1080p<00:00:48.190> compatible<00:00:48.820> meaning<00:00:49.210> that

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
will say 1080p compatible meaning that

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.930 
will say 1080p compatible meaning that
you<00:00:49.420> can<00:00:49.570> feed<00:00:49.870> it<00:00:49.899> a<00:00:50.140> 1080p<00:00:50.620> signal<00:00:51.039> but<00:00:51.850> it

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
you can feed it a 1080p signal but it

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.689 
you can feed it a 1080p signal but it
presents<00:00:52.120> at<00:00:52.570> something<00:00:53.260> like<00:00:53.440> a<00:00:53.710> thousand<00:00:54.280> 24

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
presents at something like a thousand 24

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.560 
presents at something like a thousand 24
by<00:00:54.850> 768<00:00:55.800> well<00:00:57.059> you're<00:00:58.059> not<00:00:58.149> really<00:00:58.329> getting

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
by 768 well you're not really getting

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.069 
by 768 well you're not really getting
1080p<00:00:59.370> here<00:01:00.370> getting<00:01:00.699> thousand<00:01:01.179> 24<00:01:01.600> by<00:01:01.719> 768

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
1080p here getting thousand 24 by 768

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.430 
1080p here getting thousand 24 by 768
and<00:01:02.769> if<00:01:03.280> you're<00:01:03.730> not<00:01:03.940> running<00:01:04.269> a<00:01:04.540> thousand<00:01:05.019> 24

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
and if you're not running a thousand 24

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.960 
and if you're not running a thousand 24
by<00:01:05.590> 768<00:01:05.950> you're<00:01:06.940> not<00:01:07.120> getting<00:01:07.420> a<00:01:07.540> one-to-one

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
by 768 you're not getting a one-to-one

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.250 
by 768 you're not getting a one-to-one
presentation<00:01:09.970> when<00:01:10.690> you're<00:01:10.780> not<00:01:10.870> getting<00:01:11.080> a

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
presentation when you're not getting a

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.679 
presentation when you're not getting a
one-to-one<00:01:11.620> presentation<00:01:12.490> you<00:01:12.759> get<00:01:12.970> scaling

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
one-to-one presentation you get scaling

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:16.590 
one-to-one presentation you get scaling
artifacts<00:01:14.170> and<00:01:14.500> I<00:01:14.950> will<00:01:15.340> link<00:01:15.880> to<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.329> video

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
artifacts and I will link to the video

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.020 
artifacts and I will link to the video
where<00:01:16.869> I<00:01:16.900> show<00:01:17.290> how<00:01:17.710> scaling<00:01:18.310> artifacts<00:01:18.700> work

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
where I show how scaling artifacts work

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.539 
where I show how scaling artifacts work
and<00:01:19.360> you<00:01:19.960> know<00:01:20.049> as<00:01:20.320> you<00:01:20.560> resize<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:21.220> screen

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
and you know as you resize the screen

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.270 
and you know as you resize the screen
you<00:01:22.360> can<00:01:22.540> see<00:01:22.840> that<00:01:23.049> you're<00:01:23.170> getting<00:01:23.320> weird

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
you can see that you're getting weird

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.010 
you can see that you're getting weird
artifacts<00:01:25.060> because<00:01:25.479> of<00:01:25.659> the<00:01:25.750> way<00:01:25.840> that

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
artifacts because of the way that

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.380 
artifacts because of the way that
particular<00:01:26.140> video<00:01:26.680> is<00:01:26.740> made<00:01:27.040> but<00:01:28.030> I<00:01:28.090> wanted<00:01:28.299> to

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
particular video is made but I wanted to

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.910 
particular video is made but I wanted to
talk<00:01:28.570> about<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:29.170> size<00:01:29.500> and<00:01:30.009> dpi<00:01:30.460> so<00:01:31.649> I've<00:01:32.649> got

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
talk about the size and dpi so I've got

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.330 
talk about the size and dpi so I've got
my<00:01:33.070> phone<00:01:33.369> here<00:01:33.729> and<00:01:33.909> it's<00:01:34.780> 800<00:01:35.680> pixels<00:01:36.100> wide

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
my phone here and it's 800 pixels wide

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.940 
my phone here and it's 800 pixels wide
by<00:01:37.439> 480

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
by 480

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.149 
by 480
I<00:01:39.509> think<00:01:40.509> it's<00:01:40.630> 800<00:01:41.020> by<00:01:41.079> 480<00:01:41.530> it's<00:01:41.619> either<00:01:41.710> 800

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
I think it's 800 by 480 it's either 800

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.870 
I think it's 800 by 480 it's either 800
by<00:01:42.250> 480<00:01:43.090> hundred<00:01:43.479> by<00:01:43.570> 480<00:01:44.189> screen<00:01:45.189> resolution

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
by 480 hundred by 480 screen resolution

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:53.359 
by 480 hundred by 480 screen resolution
now<00:01:46.659> this<00:01:47.049> large<00:01:47.409> screen<00:01:47.799> is<00:01:49.020> 1920<00:01:50.020> by<00:01:50.399> 1080<00:01:51.420> so

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
now this large screen is 1920 by 1080 so

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.179 
now this large screen is 1920 by 1080 so
realistically<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:55.600> is<00:01:55.659> 800<00:01:56.469> pixels<00:01:56.920> and

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
realistically this is 800 pixels and

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:02.370 
realistically this is 800 pixels and
this<00:01:58.149> is<00:01:59.009> 1,100<00:02:00.009> pixels<00:02:00.490> so<00:02:01.270> if<00:02:01.840> I<00:02:02.049> had<00:02:02.350> a

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
this is 1,100 pixels so if I had a

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.679 
this is 1,100 pixels so if I had a
screen<00:02:02.770> that<00:02:02.799> was<00:02:03.130> four<00:02:03.700> times<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.299> size<00:02:04.450> of

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
screen that was four times the size of

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.130 
screen that was four times the size of
this<00:02:04.869> one<00:02:05.609> 1600<00:02:06.609> pixels<00:02:07.030> would<00:02:07.630> take<00:02:07.810> up<00:02:07.960> this

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
this one 1600 pixels would take up this

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.130 
this one 1600 pixels would take up this
much<00:02:08.380> space<00:02:08.880> but<00:02:09.880> on<00:02:10.030> this<00:02:10.270> particular<00:02:10.479> screen

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
much space but on this particular screen

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.580 
much space but on this particular screen
I'm<00:02:12.040> only<00:02:12.280> about<00:02:12.490> 1/3<00:02:12.730> of<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.210> way<00:02:13.270> there<00:02:13.810> so

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
I'm only about 1/3 of the way there so

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.070 
I'm only about 1/3 of the way there so
there's<00:02:14.860> only<00:02:16.200> 360<00:02:17.200> ish<00:02:17.379> pixels<00:02:18.340> not<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.150> 1600

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
there's only 360 ish pixels not the 1600

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.150 
there's only 360 ish pixels not the 1600
that<00:02:20.650> you'd<00:02:20.830> have

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
that you'd have

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.470 
that you'd have
my<00:02:21.700> phone<00:02:22.000> so<00:02:22.960> screen<00:02:23.770> resolution<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:24.940> screen

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
my phone so screen resolution and screen

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.590 
my phone so screen resolution and screen
size<00:02:25.950> aren't<00:02:26.950> necessarily<00:02:27.430> related<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:28.180> if

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
size aren't necessarily related and if

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.230 
size aren't necessarily related and if
this<00:02:28.720> was<00:02:28.930> one<00:02:29.110> of<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:30.240> high-resolution

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
this was one of the high-resolution

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.500 
this was one of the high-resolution
displays<00:02:32.020> from<00:02:32.320> Apple<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.400> Samsung<00:02:33.970> iMac

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510

that<00:02:34.870> Samsung<00:02:35.590> IMAX<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.460> Apple<00:02:36.880> IMAX<00:02:38.340> this

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
that Samsung IMAX the Apple IMAX this

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.590 
that Samsung IMAX the Apple IMAX this
would<00:02:39.550> be<00:02:39.870> 20<00:02:40.870> something<00:02:41.380> instead<00:02:41.980> of<00:02:42.600> 1920

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
would be 20 something instead of 1920

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.170 
would be 20 something instead of 1920
and<00:02:43.810> you'd<00:02:44.650> have<00:02:44.800> even<00:02:45.370> higher<00:02:45.640> pixel<00:02:45.970> density

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
and you'd have even higher pixel density

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.150 
and you'd have even higher pixel density
on<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:46.810> smaller<00:02:47.530> screen<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:49.710> screen<00:02:50.710> size<00:02:51.130> and

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
on a smaller screen so screen size and

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.520 
on a smaller screen so screen size and
screen<00:02:51.880> resolution<00:02:52.570> aren't<00:02:52.960> tied<00:02:53.260> together

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
screen resolution aren't tied together

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.650 
screen resolution aren't tied together
because<00:02:54.400> of<00:02:54.550> what's<00:02:54.760> called<00:02:54.940> dots<00:02:55.300> per<00:02:55.630> inch

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
because of what's called dots per inch

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.180 
because of what's called dots per inch
this<00:02:56.620> has<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:56.950> very<00:02:57.580> high<00:02:58.060> DPI<00:02:58.990> but<00:02:59.800> doesn't

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
this has a very high DPI but doesn't

have<00:03:00.280> a<00:03:00.340> huge<00:03:00.730> resolution<00:03:01.390> because<00:03:01.630> it's

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
have a huge resolution because it's

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.880 
have a huge resolution because it's
small<00:03:02.850> this<00:03:03.850> has<00:03:04.090> a<00:03:04.120> lower<00:03:04.510> dpi<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:05.440> more

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
small this has a lower dpi and more

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.040 
small this has a lower dpi and more
resolution<00:03:06.310> because<00:03:06.640> it's<00:03:06.790> bigger<00:03:07.090> but<00:03:07.810> a

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
resolution because it's bigger but a

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.780 
resolution because it's bigger but a
long<00:03:08.470> way<00:03:08.800> there<00:03:09.010> could<00:03:09.190> be<00:03:09.220> any<00:03:09.490> combination

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
long way there could be any combination

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.890 
long way there could be any combination
of<00:03:10.330> dots<00:03:10.930> per<00:03:11.110> inch<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.650> resolution<00:03:12.520> and

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
of dots per inch and resolution and

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.170 
of dots per inch and resolution and
different<00:03:13.900> sized<00:03:14.080> screens<00:03:14.460> so<00:03:15.460> you<00:03:15.760> know<00:03:16.030> I

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
different sized screens so you know I

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.650 
different sized screens so you know I
have<00:03:16.390> a<00:03:16.420> 24<00:03:16.900> inch<00:03:17.080> it's<00:03:17.290> 1920<00:03:17.950> by<00:03:18.070> 1080<00:03:18.490> so<00:03:19.240> it's

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
have a 24 inch it's 1920 by 1080 so it's

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.870 
have a 24 inch it's 1920 by 1080 so it's
the<00:03:19.870> same<00:03:20.050> resolution<00:03:20.710> but<00:03:21.130> it's<00:03:21.250> smaller<00:03:21.580> so

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
the same resolution but it's smaller so

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.560 
the same resolution but it's smaller so
it<00:03:22.060> has<00:03:22.180> a<00:03:22.210> higher<00:03:22.510> dpi<00:03:22.960> I<00:03:23.580> have<00:03:24.580> a<00:03:25.090> couple<00:03:25.390> of

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
it has a higher dpi I have a couple of

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.200 
it has a higher dpi I have a couple of
displays<00:03:25.990> that<00:03:26.320> are<00:03:26.440> just<00:03:26.710> old<00:03:27.010> vga<00:03:27.640> displays

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
displays that are just old vga displays

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.950 
displays that are just old vga displays
that<00:03:28.690> are<00:03:28.750> 640<00:03:29.590> by<00:03:29.860> 480<00:03:30.490> that<00:03:31.150> are<00:03:31.360> bigger<00:03:31.840> than

that are 640 by 480 that are bigger than

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.310 
that are 640 by 480 that are bigger than
my<00:03:32.230> phone<00:03:32.470> but<00:03:32.860> lower<00:03:33.040> resolution<00:03:33.790> so<00:03:34.780> any

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
my phone but lower resolution so any

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.920 
my phone but lower resolution so any
combination<00:03:35.650> is<00:03:36.160> possible<00:03:36.730> you<00:03:37.270> have<00:03:37.570> to<00:03:37.600> look

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
combination is possible you have to look

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.240 
combination is possible you have to look
at<00:03:38.020> the<00:03:38.110> resolution<00:03:38.380> to<00:03:38.650> know<00:03:38.890> whether<00:03:39.100> or<00:03:39.190> not

00:04:51.299 --> 00:04:51.309 
can see that there are a lot of pixels

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:55.019 
can see that there are a lot of pixels
on<00:04:51.789> the<00:04:52.569> screen<00:04:52.599> and<00:04:53.289> that<00:04:53.319> those<00:04:54.249> pixels<00:04:54.699> are

00:04:55.019 --> 00:04:55.029 
on the screen and that those pixels are

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:56.999 
on the screen and that those pixels are
not<00:04:55.059> the<00:04:55.479> full<00:04:55.719> size<00:04:55.989> of<00:04:56.229> the<00:04:56.349> pixels<00:04:56.709> that<00:04:56.830> are

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
not the full size of the pixels that are

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.659 
not the full size of the pixels that are
here<00:04:57.369> because<00:04:58.149> of<00:04:58.330> that<00:04:58.449> you<00:04:58.689> can<00:04:58.899> get<00:04:59.169> these

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
here because of that you can get these

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:01.949 
here because of that you can get these
you<00:05:00.669> get<00:05:00.819> better<00:05:01.059> scaling<00:05:01.689> when<00:05:01.809> you're

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:01.959 
you get better scaling when you're

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:04.469 
you get better scaling when you're
looking<00:05:02.199> at<00:05:02.349> 720p<00:05:02.949> images<00:05:03.759> being<00:05:03.999> presented

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
looking at 720p images being presented

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.369 
looking at 720p images being presented
on<00:05:04.919> 1080p<00:05:05.919> or<00:05:06.189> when<00:05:07.029> you're<00:05:07.149> getting<00:05:07.240> 768<00:05:08.169> or

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:08.379 
on 1080p or when you're getting 768 or

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:10.919 
on 1080p or when you're getting 768 or
whatever<00:05:08.800> resolution<00:05:09.419> you're<00:05:10.419> playing<00:05:10.719> your

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:10.929 
whatever resolution you're playing your

00:05:10.929 --> 00:05:12.809 
whatever resolution you're playing your
game<00:05:11.139> at<00:05:11.439> a<00:05:11.740> plasma<00:05:12.339> does<00:05:12.490> a<00:05:12.519> better<00:05:12.729> job

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:12.819 
game at a plasma does a better job

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:14.939 
game at a plasma does a better job
scaling<00:05:13.689> and<00:05:13.899> so<00:05:14.169> the<00:05:14.289> content<00:05:14.769> will<00:05:14.919> look

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 
scaling and so the content will look

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:18.239 
scaling and so the content will look
better<00:05:15.399> than<00:05:15.729> it<00:05:16.449> would<00:05:16.749> if<00:05:17.050> you<00:05:17.259> were<00:05:17.439> to<00:05:17.679> have

00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:18.249 
better than it would if you were to have

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:24.269 
better than it would if you were to have
an<00:05:18.610> LCD<00:05:19.289> or<00:05:20.289> an<00:05:20.529> LED<00:05:21.069> but<00:05:21.819> LEDs<00:05:22.419> or<00:05:22.599> LCDs<00:05:23.050> do<00:05:23.439> but

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:24.279 
an LCD or an LED but LEDs or LCDs do but

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:28.829 
an LCD or an LED but LEDs or LCDs do but
a<00:05:25.019> LCD<00:05:26.019> display<00:05:26.229> is<00:05:27.129> not<00:05:27.939> going<00:05:28.360> to<00:05:28.449> handle

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:28.839 
a LCD display is not going to handle

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:33.179 
a LCD display is not going to handle
playing<00:05:29.110> 720p<00:05:30.099> content<00:05:30.729> at<00:05:31.269> 1080p<00:05:32.099> nearly<00:05:33.099> as

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:33.189 
playing 720p content at 1080p nearly as

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:36.449 
playing 720p content at 1080p nearly as
well<00:05:33.369> as<00:05:33.489> the<00:05:33.639> plasma<00:05:34.119> will<00:05:34.300> so<00:05:35.279> it<00:05:36.279> gets

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:36.459 
well as the plasma will so it gets

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:38.639 
well as the plasma will so it gets
confusing<00:05:36.969> but<00:05:37.389> hopefully<00:05:38.079> I<00:05:38.110> have<00:05:38.319> at<00:05:38.439> least

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:38.649 
confusing but hopefully I have at least

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:40.379 
confusing but hopefully I have at least
addressed<00:05:39.099> the<00:05:39.339> what<00:05:39.550> the<00:05:39.699> one-to-one<00:05:39.999> means

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
addressed the what the one-to-one means

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:43.019 
addressed the what the one-to-one means
and<00:05:40.749> the<00:05:41.019> fact<00:05:41.229> that<00:05:41.499> you<00:05:41.649> can<00:05:41.829> have<00:05:42.069> any

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:43.029 
and the fact that you can have any

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:46.169 
and the fact that you can have any
resolution<00:05:43.959> on<00:05:44.139> any<00:05:44.800> size<00:05:45.159> display<00:05:45.789> and<00:05:46.149> that

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:46.179 
resolution on any size display and that

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:49.829 
resolution on any size display and that
it<00:05:46.990> really<00:05:47.409> is<00:05:47.649> just<00:05:47.679> a<00:05:48.279> function<00:05:48.519> of<00:05:48.909> dots<00:05:49.629> per

00:05:49.829 --> 00:05:49.839 
it really is just a function of dots per

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:53.819 
it really is just a function of dots per
inch<00:05:50.519> clear<00:05:51.519> as<00:05:51.610> mud
