00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.910
 pay attention see well this 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:07.430
 twelve-sided grid look that in 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.259
 are actually six pairs of faces 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:15.619
 I will give five seconds to memorize 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:18.830
 exactly where is each one what 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:21.710
 they have well now where is the 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.140
 couple for is ahead take some 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.870
 seconds point to the tile on which 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.260
 is they signed up to this one are in what 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.260
 Right 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.850
 ah 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.920
 it was a bit difficult to play again 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.090
 take a little more time to 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.090
 memorize these faces 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.990
 they have them now where the couple is 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.200
 from this forward signal on the tile and 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:52.380
 as you will remember is here this is a 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.180
 Facial memory test ladies would not be 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.760
 surprising that this was pretty easy 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.680
 for you gentlemen it is possible that 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.660
 you had some problems 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.820
 Studies show that the brain 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.010
 male is not very good to remember 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.930
 faces as is the female brain 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.610
 we tested this game with people in the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.710
 mall to see if the women 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.970
 they were really better with memory 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.040
 facial that men 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.840
 matt and amanda are the first in the 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.640
 they see 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.700
 the same game that you just 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.830
 play I really want to see who is the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.270
 first that you complete this are ready 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.270
 guys yes now 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.740
 of this 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.040
 it's very good I think you won 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.120
 you finished first 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:49.210
 how it feels to lose your girlfriend not 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:50.950
 I'm used to this luck, not what 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.920
 you can remember very well the names of 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.080
 people nor their faces while 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.490
 women create connections men 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.470
 create excuses and good work 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.880
 what do you think happened? do you think that 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.860
 betrayed the pressure or what it was that 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.720
 Maybe a little reflection happened but 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:15.030
 but not all women won this 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.030
 challenge as it is easy 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.260
 wait 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.940
 75 percent of women won 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.650
 this game and gave them another point and the 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.640
 why they won can you 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.640
 find in your brain
