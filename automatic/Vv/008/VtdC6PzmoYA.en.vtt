days you actually had to make the plate
on<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:02.960> spot<00:01:03.230> so<00:01:03.559> you<00:01:03.590> have<00:01:03.830> to<00:01:03.950> sensitize<00:01:04.520> it

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
the photograph and then you had to

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.900 
the photograph and then you had to
develop<00:01:09.110> at<00:01:09.380> straight<00:01:09.619> away<00:01:09.860> afterwards<00:01:10.400> so

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
develop at straight away afterwards so

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.520 
develop at straight away afterwards so
it<00:01:10.970> was<00:01:11.090> a<00:01:11.119> really<00:01:11.270> big<00:01:11.479> hassle<00:01:11.720> at<00:01:12.050> that<00:01:12.229> time
