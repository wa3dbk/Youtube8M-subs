she's<00:01:17.580> cognitively<00:01:18.450> fairly<00:01:19.409> able<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.310> the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
she's cognitively fairly able so the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.340 
she's cognitively fairly able so the
trays<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:21.119> been<00:01:21.299> very<00:01:21.570> important<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.229> her

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
trays have been very important to her

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
there's there's a real disconnect

offering them the adaptations they need
our<00:01:49.310> concern<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.759> many<00:01:51.060> children<00:01:51.329> may

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
our concern is that many children may

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.719 
our concern is that many children may
have<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.840> single<00:01:52.320> adaptation<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.189> wheelchair

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
have a single adaptation a wheelchair

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.410 
have a single adaptation a wheelchair
maybe<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:55.009> cane<00:01:56.009> but<00:01:56.909> they<00:01:57.030> don't<00:01:57.180> have<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
maybe a cane but they don't have the

adaptations<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.200> they<00:01:58.439> really<00:01:58.890> need<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.520> do

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
adaptations that they really need to do

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.760 
adaptations that they really need to do
what<00:01:59.820> they<00:01:59.969> want<00:02:00.270> for<00:02:01.020> those<00:02:01.200> who<00:02:01.409> look<00:02:01.590> at

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
what they want for those who look at

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.920 
what they want for those who look at
cardboard<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.759> say<00:02:02.939> well<00:02:03.119> well<00:02:03.450> that's<00:02:03.630> just

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
we can do to put them in better

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.369 
we can do to put them in better
positions<00:03:50.430> just<00:03:51.269> helps<00:03:51.569> everything<00:03:51.989> about

positions just helps everything about

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.620 
positions just helps everything about
them
