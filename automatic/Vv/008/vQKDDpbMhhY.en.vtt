 the damage is as a result of an installation 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.900
 considered faulty and she is from 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.170
 exchange and return excluded 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.460
 they also have the right one 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:01.480
 digital camera apparatus tool 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.480
 use screwdriver th000

 soldering iron and for fujifilm cameras 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:13.420
 sometimes the screwdriver tv2 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.000
 Please refer to the repair before the repair 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.970
 necessarily the battery 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.020
 lead them to the repair of our 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.020
 through the video 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.350
 if you are not a camera technician 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.790
 Can problems with display installation 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.090
 occur 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.879
 if the display is only white or dark 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.659
 is the problem probably 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:41.879
 following first, that ribbon cable 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:46.109
 is not quite in the connection 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:48.959
 secondly, the model of 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:54.689
 backlight does not fit 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:55.819
 For example, Kodak 863 has three 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:58.500
 different 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.489
 backlit with a 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.040
 wrong model of 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.750
 Backlight can be the display 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:09.439
 dark black or overexposed 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:12.640
 in that case, please use the old one 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:16.330
 backlight continues 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.220
 Third, the board is broken in 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.550
 In that case, please build that 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.680
 spare part once again if that 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.930
 this does not solve the problem 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.350
 Send us please the camera to 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.350
 exam 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.120
 Camera can be installed after installation 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.430
 do not turn on 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.600
 then we recommend the camera for 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:43.410
 to send the examination to our workshop 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.280
 Examination and a cost estimate are 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.280
 free of charge with us 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.270
 after installing a new objective 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.840
 Sometimes the camera does not make sharp ones 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:04:00.270
 Pictures our workshop can be the camera 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:03.760
 adjust with software 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.290
 You can do that objectively without software 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.080
 install successfully 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.320
 by putting the back of the broken one 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.020
 objective including the chip ccd chip 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.750

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.590
