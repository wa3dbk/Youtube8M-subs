00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.480 
which I always loved but if you're like
I<00:06:23.930> said<00:06:24.229> the<00:06:24.409> kind<00:06:24.620> of<00:06:24.650> person<00:06:25.009> that<00:06:25.039> wants<00:06:25.400> an

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
I said the kind of person that wants an

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.510 
I said the kind of person that wants an
entire<00:06:25.819> face<00:06:26.240> conveniently<00:06:27.020> in<00:06:27.289> one<00:06:28.009> palette

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 
entire face conveniently in one palette

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.770 
entire face conveniently in one palette
this<00:06:29.000> is<00:06:29.180> a<00:06:29.330> great<00:06:29.690> way<00:06:29.870> to<00:06:29.930> do<00:06:30.169> it<00:06:30.289> because

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
this is a great way to do it because

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.330 
this is a great way to do it because
the<00:06:31.050> rest<00:06:31.260> of<00:06:31.380> the<00:06:31.440> products<00:06:31.830> in<00:06:31.920> here<00:06:32.160> are

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
the rest of the products in here are

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.790 
the rest of the products in here are
really<00:06:32.730> well<00:06:33.030> made<00:06:33.240> and<00:06:33.450> they<00:06:33.780> create<00:06:34.050> a<00:06:34.290> great

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
really well made and they create a great

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.590 
really well made and they create a great
looks<00:06:35.130> you<00:06:35.460> don't<00:06:35.639> get<00:06:35.730> a<00:06:35.790> ton<00:06:36.030> of<00:06:36.090> versatility

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 
looks you don't get a ton of versatility

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.740 
looks you don't get a ton of versatility
I<00:06:36.960> mean<00:06:37.410> you<00:06:37.530> can<00:06:37.770> do<00:06:38.070> pretty<00:06:38.610> subtle<00:06:39.210> daytime

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
I mean you can do pretty subtle daytime

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.360 
I mean you can do pretty subtle daytime
looks<00:06:40.050> and<00:06:40.200> you<00:06:40.260> can<00:06:40.470> amp<00:06:40.740> it<00:06:40.860> up<00:06:40.919> a<00:06:41.040> little<00:06:41.160> bit

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
looks and you can amp it up a little bit

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.650 
looks and you can amp it up a little bit
for<00:06:41.490> night<00:06:41.669> time<00:06:41.880> but<00:06:42.060> at<00:06:42.150> the<00:06:42.240> end<00:06:42.270> of<00:06:42.389> the<00:06:42.480> day

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 
for night time but at the end of the day

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.390 
for night time but at the end of the day
it<00:06:42.990> is<00:06:43.200> a<00:06:43.230> neutral<00:06:43.530> palette<00:06:43.980> but<00:06:44.070> I<00:06:44.130> think

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 
it is a neutral palette but I think

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.909 
it is a neutral palette but I think
that's<00:06:44.669> really<00:06:45.090> what's<00:06:45.570> going<00:06:45.990> to<00:06:46.230> make<00:06:46.740> you

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
that's really what's going to make you

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:48.950 
that's really what's going to make you
say<00:06:47.220> it's<00:06:47.669> everything<00:06:48.090> I<00:06:48.150> want<00:06:48.389> to<00:06:48.480> do<00:06:48.660> my

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
say it's everything I want to do my

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.110 
say it's everything I want to do my
whole<00:06:49.200> face<00:06:49.440> or<00:06:49.800> and<00:06:50.580> I<00:06:50.700> think<00:06:50.940> it<00:06:51.000> can

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
whole face or and I think it can

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.760 
whole face or and I think it can
replicate<00:06:51.300> some<00:06:51.720> of<00:06:51.750> these<00:06:51.930> items<00:06:52.139> I<00:06:52.500> don't

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:52.770 
replicate some of these items I don't

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.370 
replicate some of these items I don't
think<00:06:53.040> I<00:06:53.130> need<00:06:53.190> to<00:06:53.610> spend<00:06:54.270> the<00:06:54.419> money<00:06:54.600> to<00:06:54.690> have

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 
think I need to spend the money to have

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.290 
think I need to spend the money to have
them<00:06:55.620> just<00:06:56.070> simply<00:06:56.520> put<00:06:56.669> all<00:06:56.820> together<00:06:56.970> in<00:06:57.270> one

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 
them just simply put all together in one

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.909 
them just simply put all together in one
