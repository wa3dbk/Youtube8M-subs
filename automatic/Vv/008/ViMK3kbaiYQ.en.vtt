00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:07.200
 greetings and fall m it's soul inside 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.800
 here we are again on diablo iii for the page 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.540
 number 16 of the journal of a and fall m and 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.940
 as I told you about it in my 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.830
 previous video 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:20.820
 about the Witch Doctor now I'm going 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.529
 show it to you in action 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:28.760
 so the long-awaited build sound filled with 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.779
 mysteries all this in a fault 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.250
 level 57 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.800
 so it's far from nothing, I'm going 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.930
 show you its effectiveness 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.250
 so no need for the Templar so much 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.559
 that it is oped you will see it's 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.720
 anything in these new styles 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:52.680
 so 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:54.540
 it's good it can happen 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.970
 it's a 57 sheet after all 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.760
 any big bild anyway 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.410
 some difficulties in phase 57 so we 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:09.450
 start again you launch what they are 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:10.710
 dogs yeah is there maybe a little 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.610
 problem at the monster level so we 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.610
 go check that right now 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.120
 it is I'll please the 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.160
 goats no it looks like there is no 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.010
 problem on stuff 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.479
 all in the air in order I have the power of the 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.790
 skull as it should to increase the 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:39.590
 guys of tantrums so now there you 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:43.040
 can see it's a boxwood of witch doctors 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.640
 based on the skill trombe what makes her 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:51.950
 originality and its effectiveness especially I 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:57.680
 do not know what it's pretty thin ah 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:59.720
 know ggc I forgot the team is the 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.710
 legendary potion what just because of 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.910
 I can do the flaws 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.399
 level 57 good sorry to miss my video 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.830
 so not short, we stop the trolls 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.120
 for obviously it will not be my email 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.519
 and it was an April Fool as 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:18.350
 a lot heavy guess then their 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.180
 drummer no but I have nothing against the 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.500
 fetishist inserted in more than that it was 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.120
 not a troll that I liked very much 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.290
 necromancer we come to both and 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.760
 fetishers maybe I will play a 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.200
 day it's just right now 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.810
 no builds interest me on short 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.450
 to really go back to things 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.540
 Serious I will give you some 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.040
 tips to help you progress in 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.010
 beginning of season as many had me 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.900
 asked for things about that then 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:54.230
 the first one already is at the level of 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:55.880
 difficulty already know that if you play 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.600
 Witch Doctor, you have to try to put it 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.090
 Lowest otherwise you must not over 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.769
 method that's true and that is your 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.040
 class because you no longer lose 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.060
 two years profitability than anything else the 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.049
 difficulty to start the most 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.840
 interesting is simply the 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.829
 second so difficult 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.510
 that's where it's most interesting at 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.650
 level of life and the xp that the mountains 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.730
 sutton 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.140
 the ratio is the best in difficult 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.739
 so to start and you can 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.730
 little by little increased according to the staff 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:30.970
 that you find the goal that you have 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.970
 so that's next for the zones to xp 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.150
 for season 2 I simply xp 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.060
 as a bonus actors because they are 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.810
 relatively simple and montceau are 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:45.689
 quiet and for the habit then 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.060
 great advantage of xp as a bonus is that 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:50.069
 when you arrive level 70 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:55.319
 you will have already smeared the five you 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:56.549
 can go directly from 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.890
 in the legendary hunt since there is 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.569
 a bonus in the faults 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.840
 so that's a benefit 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.280
 negligible and in addition to the bonuses 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:12.090
 looks like a lot of experts 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:16.739
 since the first to have to be 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:18.750
 past the beautiful 70s had only 30 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.359
 minutes before on me so I do not know 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.889
 how they had xp but of any 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.210
 way I played solo are already going that can 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.150
 be fair it is he made 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.570
 bonus sheets so bonuses 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:34.050
 actors in any case it works very well 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:36.650
 for testing then a trick 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.650
 more about the gameplay 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.979
 when you play, get in the habit of 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.580
 equip you 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:49.680
 when you find an object all that and 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.080
 at the same time while moving that you 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.660
 will save a lot of time actually doing that 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.380
 seems to be a little by little 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:01.860
 by accumulating the time you will have taken in 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:04.260
 stopping you will win you 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.380
 a lot of time actually the same when 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:10.970
 you will put the skills or moved 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.970
 in the habit everything happened v 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:29.520
 and therefore a significant time saving 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:32.219
 then at the level of mob groups 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.669
 that's when you 're going to have confessions 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:39.800
 all that aim more groups of mob that 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:45.300
 will give you a lot of xp gains and 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:47.039
 ignore the mobs who are solo after that 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.069
 it depends on your empty purpose and for the 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:52.949
 build good I made three goals of 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:54.270
 beginners you can look who 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:57.120
 works very well to start a 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:00.389
 season especially to cross it 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.949
 the wizard the barbarous marriage eat it 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:03.689
 works well but I have not found 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:07.319
 really starts that very effective at 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:11.279
 beginning after all the classes are not 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:15.990
 on the same level one for the 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:17.460
 start even though it's all in all very 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.610
 balanced be sensitive and that counts the 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.610
 more 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:25.220
 then I think it's all 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:30.110
 way I will make a video much more 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:31.100
 complete and detailed afterwards I 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.870
 think that you understood from all 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:36.380
 way for classes it was necessary to avoid 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.670
 the Witch Doctor rather take barba because 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.840
 we are all manly men and 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:43.880
 strong with beard is or not 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.020
 short no class you can take 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.990
 what you obviously want the most 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:51.050
 fun and interesting support because a 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:53.060
 game is above all for fun and that 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:56.030
 especially that if you're having fun that's fine 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.520
 motivation to play so well it's true 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:01.490
 together here is so I will make a video 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:04.460
 much more detailed later for 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:06.340
 start well in season so thank you 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:11.180
 to have watched this video 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:17.740
 I hope you liked it and see you soon 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:17.740
 good game and good season 3 thank you
