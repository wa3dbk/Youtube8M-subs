 very much to see you but they know 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.059
 why because you corroborate what 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.029
 they always said when he saw them 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.490
 act I see them fiction I see them sing 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.160
 dancing is what I say from the time 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.350
 I make humor people wear an artist 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.180
 inside the people everybody has a 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.830
 artist inside more according to the doctor 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.360
 lisandro idea reason the university of 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.170
 harward is out of every 100 people 70% 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.640
 sing in the shower 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.210
 you will ask what the other 30 does 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.070
 they touch 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.230
 there are people singing there are people who turn to 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.000
 I do not care 30% thing they me 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:49.700
 70% of the song matters 70% that 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.590
 yes you are in 30 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.140
 it's fine that's a problem it 's a 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.970
 problem of you I will not be 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.670
 complicating because I have been doing 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.410
 humor for the theme of my couples the theme 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.740
 as a couple, it has gone so bad for me that I had 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.930
 always three ways to channel it 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.430
 one is the humor that what I do another is 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.370
 hit a shot that I do not recommend 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.110
 because it hurts and the third and third 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.660
 is to go to the therapist I do not know who goes to the 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.500
 therapist here but he's going to jump and you saw 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.570
 everyone 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.250
 to the therapist and always have the 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.380
 problem that you have blame on 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.630
 your children is always a problem of your 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.610
 lifetime 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.280
 in my case I am the generation of 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.500
 The 60s never told me they never told me 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.860
 that it was an organ never until after 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.479
 I got married, either 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.640
 but of course I think he named 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.320
 social I swear to you is more when you are later 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.520
 said his lord organ sole does not have 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.009
 personal union 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.869
 I did not know how to handle the same thing you saw me 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.460
 my voices that with my old the other topic 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.060
 I asked him some sex and I 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.610
 He is freezing the Bible finally 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.469
 where as we do not do man 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.210
 descends from adam and eva tells me but what 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.549
 it happens to you because doubt says no because according to 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.850
 dad the man descends on monkeys nor a 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:10.450
 thing your father's family something else 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.580
 and I do not swear that if it's more and for there 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.680
 to go giving him the subject of the mandates 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.510
 and peers closing my old one always 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.640
 said friend always told me claudio me 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.340
 said life is a heavy chain that 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.080
 between two it becomes lighter and has 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.550
 reason now with time I discovered that 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.200
 between three it becomes much lighter 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.660
 still 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.280
 do not think a lover I'm thinking about 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.140
 certain people who make it possible for 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.390
 a couple takes hold for example a 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.920
 plastic surgeon women if i what 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.750
 I see here they go followed are always with the 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.550
 topic of the bust that you did then the 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.800
 visit lola I know it's complicated 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.120
 subject to taste but strengthens and gives 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.060
 I trust a woman, I have a friend 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.380
 my poor flat kid so flat he has a 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.810
 T-shirt that said in case of violation 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.910
 this part goes up 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.709
 He had no cure or had nothing and went to 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.300
 see a doctor in Mar del Plata where 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.860
 we had very revolutionary methods with 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.959
 a few air valves that was placed in 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.110
 the armpits and when we go via the armpits 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.420
 they were inflating according to their taste 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.239
 medium boys the extra lunch the girl 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.590
 this valve is placed and it will dance 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.530
 meets a boy and bowling 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.000
 says hello we know ourselves from somewhere and 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.000
 the icesi of the same clinic 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.300
 look at me audio
