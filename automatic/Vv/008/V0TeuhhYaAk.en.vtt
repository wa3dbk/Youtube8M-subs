obvious pun there I liked Isabelle's I

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.300 
obvious pun there I liked Isabelle's I
think<00:02:28.560> I've<00:02:28.680> mentioned<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.010> before<00:02:29.099> but

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
think I've mentioned it before but

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.610 
think I've mentioned it before but
Isabelle<00:02:29.910> her<00:02:30.510> head<00:02:30.989> she<00:02:31.290> looks<00:02:31.470> like<00:02:31.560> a

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
Isabelle her head she looks like a

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
ponytail up on top so I think that's why
