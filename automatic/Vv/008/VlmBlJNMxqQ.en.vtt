00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
initially here we've got a choice

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.020 
initially here we've got a choice
between<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:26.100> sword<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:27.390> hammer<00:02:28.069> going<00:02:29.069> so

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
between a sword and a hammer going so

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.240

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
mainly because i was using a sword

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.380 
mainly because i was using a sword
earlier<00:02:34.080> so<00:02:34.830> I'm<00:02:35.549> gonna<00:02:35.670> go<00:02:35.819> take<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.120> sword

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
earlier so I'm gonna go take the sword

that's<00:05:21.200> a<00:05:21.290> red<00:05:21.530> flip<00:05:21.800> switch<00:05:22.100> so<00:05:22.370> that's<00:05:22.580> you

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
that's a red flip switch so that's you

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:24.460 
that's a red flip switch so that's you
know<00:05:23.419> the<00:05:23.540> colors<00:05:23.840> correspond<00:05:24.260> to<00:05:24.290> the

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
know the colors correspond to the

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.050 
know the colors correspond to the
buttons<00:05:24.770> on<00:05:24.919> the<00:05:25.010> controller<00:05:25.370> so<00:05:25.700> that<00:05:25.880> you

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
buttons on the controller so that you

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.320 
buttons on the controller so that you
know<00:05:26.150> it<00:05:26.210> was<00:05:26.389> me<00:05:26.570> red<00:05:26.780> which<00:05:27.020> is<00:05:27.050> magic<00:05:27.789> so<00:05:28.789> for

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
know it was me red which is magic so for

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.510 
know it was me red which is magic so for
a<00:05:29.360> fireball<00:05:29.930> at<00:05:30.050> switch

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:39.180 

and<00:05:32.910> guess<00:05:33.509> decades

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.060 

now<00:05:40.120> this<00:05:40.300> so<00:05:40.510> this<00:05:40.780> is<00:05:40.960> I<00:05:41.140> guess<00:05:41.470> this<00:05:41.620> is<00:05:41.770> kind

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
now this so this is I guess this is kind

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.880 
now this so this is I guess this is kind
of<00:05:42.280> a<00:05:42.430> puzzle<00:05:43.090> here<00:05:43.600> you<00:05:44.290> definitely<00:05:44.530> trying

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
of a puzzle here you definitely trying

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.640 
of a puzzle here you definitely trying
to<00:05:44.980> get<00:05:45.130> across<00:05:45.220> the<00:05:45.610> whole<00:05:45.760> room<00:05:45.970> but<00:05:46.300> if<00:05:46.390> you

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
to get across the whole room but if you

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.140 
to get across the whole room but if you
if<00:05:47.650> you<00:05:47.860> trigger<00:05:48.160> these<00:05:48.340> blocks<00:05:48.670> right<00:05:48.970> you

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
if you trigger these blocks right you

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.690 
if you trigger these blocks right you
can<00:05:49.330> collect<00:05:49.540> all<00:05:49.870> of<00:05:49.900> these<00:05:50.200> chests<00:05:50.740> along

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
can collect all of these chests along

00:05:51.700 --> 00:06:02.000 
can collect all of these chests along
the<00:05:51.850> way<00:05:52.000> and<00:05:52.830> oops<00:05:53.830> well<00:05:54.070> I<00:05:54.100> totally<00:05:54.670> forgot

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.340 

there<00:06:03.010> we<00:06:03.100> go<00:06:03.540> so<00:06:04.540> you<00:06:04.630> can<00:06:04.750> see<00:06:04.840> each<00:06:04.990> switch

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.350 
there we go so you can see each switch

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.480 
there we go so you can see each switch
each<00:06:05.890> block<00:06:06.430> rather<00:06:06.640> when<00:06:06.820> it<00:06:06.910> comes<00:06:07.090> up<00:06:07.300> has

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
each block rather when it comes up has

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.100 
each block rather when it comes up has
certain<00:06:09.490> directions<00:06:09.820> the<00:06:10.330> way<00:06:10.510> you<00:06:10.570> can<00:06:10.810> spawn

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
certain directions the way you can spawn

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.820 
certain directions the way you can spawn
another<00:06:11.260> block<00:06:13.050> in<00:06:14.050> the<00:06:14.140> capable<00:06:14.350> those<00:06:14.560> blue

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
another block in the capable those blue

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:22.500 
another block in the capable those blue
arrows<00:06:15.930> if<00:06:16.930> I<00:06:17.140> find<00:06:17.440> some<00:06:17.830> new<00:06:18.010> gloves<00:06:19.320> NC<00:06:21.510> so

yeah that's true yeah I'm not sure yeah
I<00:07:08.569> just<00:07:09.020> kind<00:07:09.349> of<00:07:09.379> assumed<00:07:09.500> there<00:07:10.069> would<00:07:10.159> be

00:07:10.209 --> 00:07:10.219 
I just kind of assumed there would be

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:14.890 
I just kind of assumed there would be
something<00:07:11.060> I<00:07:11.419> guess<00:07:11.629> but<00:07:13.569> it's<00:07:14.569> not<00:07:14.719> such<00:07:14.870> a

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:14.900 
something I guess but it's not such a

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.360 
something I guess but it's not such a
big<00:07:15.020> deal<00:07:15.139> I<00:07:15.469> guess<00:07:15.680> if<00:07:15.830> you<00:07:15.889> had<00:07:15.979> a<00:07:16.009> character

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:16.370 
big deal I guess if you had a character

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.519 
big deal I guess if you had a character
in<00:07:16.430> fable<00:07:16.759> two<00:07:16.909> that<00:07:17.029> you<00:07:17.090> really<00:07:17.529> weren't

00:07:18.519 --> 00:07:18.529 
in fable two that you really weren't

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:22.179 
in fable two that you really weren't
particularly<00:07:18.919> fond<00:07:19.279> of<00:07:20.770> you<00:07:21.770> wouldn't<00:07:22.039> want

00:07:22.179 --> 00:07:22.189 
particularly fond of you wouldn't want

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:26.380 
particularly fond of you wouldn't want
to<00:07:22.250> carry<00:07:22.520> over

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:26.390 

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.090 

the<00:07:26.960> kind<00:07:27.170> of<00:07:27.260> cool<00:07:27.410> that<00:07:27.440> I<00:07:27.590> feel<00:07:27.740> like<00:07:27.890> you

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:28.100 
the kind of cool that I feel like you

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.620 
the kind of cool that I feel like you
know<00:07:28.190> if<00:07:28.250> your<00:07:28.340> fable<00:07:28.610> 2<00:07:28.730> character<00:07:29.240> was<00:07:29.420> very

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:29.630 
know if your fable 2 character was very

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.900 
know if your fable 2 character was very
obese<00:07:29.990> yeah<00:07:30.620> maybe<00:07:30.860> you<00:07:31.310> know<00:07:31.460> at<00:07:31.730> the

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:31.910 
obese yeah maybe you know at the

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.090 
obese yeah maybe you know at the
offspring<00:07:32.450> you<00:07:33.350> inherit<00:07:33.770> some<00:07:33.920> of<00:07:34.010> those

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:34.100 
offspring you inherit some of those
