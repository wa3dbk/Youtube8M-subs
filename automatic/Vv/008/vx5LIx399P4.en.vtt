00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello friends of the club welcome to 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.839
 dvd criticism and since last week 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.400
 a German movie is going on in the 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.320
 german cinemas in the dieter 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.389
 hallervorden in the figure then the role 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.070
 a former Olympic champion im 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.719
 marathon is rising and doing so 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.400
 he has to realize that he is slowly so much 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.070
 that life has come to an end 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.140
 but he still wants it 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:34.380
 once really know and go with it 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:36.390
 it is now sitting for its last 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.040
 maybe special connection the 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.940
 chestnut male are for fallfest 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.899
 probably there is also one 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.579
 spring festival and in the summer are fixed 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.440
 Did you say that by tinkering? 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.980
 the people no end 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.980
 but how is you? 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.340
 what the man is there for me 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.750
 trained marathon berlin insisted on 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.750
 still win end 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.410
 56 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.780
 also hurt pain 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.720
 i would need more carbs i am 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.860
 Almost another I am 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.300
 also right at the anaerobic threshold 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.450
 they no longer run us now here in 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.450
 journey 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.440
 they worry 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.909
 they have massive against the 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.430
 violation of the service provision 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.570
 had fun heimer had fun funny 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.640
 the marathon is already complete 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.640
 Overbooked ever under 240 run 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.930
 the team stays has already lost 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.170
 Done with the world that is coming to an end 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.170
 do 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.970
 The end of it does not scare you 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.220
 his last race is 114 minutes 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.560
 released and running for six years 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.730
 since 10 october 2013 in the 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.010
 german cinemas and dieter hallervorden 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.110
 Special man named Paul but on the 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.939
 One Olympic champion in Marathon was in 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.430
 The 50s knew him then 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:48.470
 every child one collected playing cards or 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.299
 cards of him with autograph he was a 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.250
 folk hero if you like it but in the year 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.470
 In 2013, almost nobody knows him anymore 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.239
 Meanwhile, his wife aged him 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.840
 really loves about everything and says it 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.310
 belong together like wind and sea 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.650
 somehow slow to the end too 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.970
 has regular fainting and it 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.470
 At some point he asks the question 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.389
 Still caring for his wife and the question 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.030
 is in the room if you are not both in the room 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:12.440
 resettled for it is located 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.849
 even the young daughter die 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.129
 a stewardess is played by heike 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.780
 macatsch but that does not paul everything 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.280
 true have arrived in these homes 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.620
 He realized that one actually there 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.629
 only then view and somehow the 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.489
 death into and towards him 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.170
 he says he does not want to wait 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.180
 run again and that the berlin 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.980
 marathon and best, of course 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.689
 win and there you could say what for 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.010
 a boring story and I found 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:35.480
 the trailer is not very bad 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.549
 but not really good, but me 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.349
 must then say in the end of the film 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.639
 a lot more is really good 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.919
 especially because dieter haller 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.599
 forward the great here does not just play 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:46.099
 this enthusiasm of an athlete and 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.480
 the unconditional choose to win 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.040
 to want to know it again 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.840
 a man, however, ultimately 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.389
 his fate somehow rears up 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.150
 to die to be docile one 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:57.949
 man who loves his wife like that 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.959
 It plays incredibly profoundly that in the 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:01.310
 A movie room also tears when 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.690
 and you have to say that clearly 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.579
 film for the slightly older semester 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.500
 thought is that I have the cinema gang 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:08.540
 Somehow I was 26 years old 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.250
 at age 20, the youngest in the 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.959
 You have to say that it is cinema 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.669
 actually what old and young that is 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.919
 nice to see if an old couple 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:17.269
 together still love and enjoy 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.829
 can and all this conflict and 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.359
 Generation conflicts with the daughter 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.190
 those are so 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.419
 human and of course a neat one 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.830
 shown that it is German 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.780
 film is not used to sometimes 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.460
 That's why his last race for me 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.349
 a strip is somehow kicked out 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.510
 out of the crowd and I think that's great 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:34.310
 unfortunately played insanely little pr 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.870
 nothing for the big crowd by that 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.130
 the least of the film of the note 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.990
 I have to say, though 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.280
 for fans of dieter hallervorden and of 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.139
 co, you should definitely look at the movie 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.410
 but even so it is an exciting good 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.610
 made subject matter and a film of spite 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.560
 114 minutes not really 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.880
 boring it becomes clear that not the whole 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.950
 big number you have to see 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.720
 but in the face of my expectation is the 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.639
 movie absolutely worth seeing only alone 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.230
 kathrin says, for example in the cast 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.760
 again such an unsympathetic figure 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.580
 it's at least since her disrespectful 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.660
 markus lanz on aust occurring I know 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.250
 Not really what I am from the woman 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.080
 That's always how it should be 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.250
 on it or plays here only by chance 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.870
 again such a figure I'm not quite 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.000
 sure with the lot so still 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.139
 heike makatsch and frederik loud yet 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.750
 one or the other familiar face 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:18.450
 Gets me his last run as 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.070
 drama or almost tragic comedy too 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.200
 again and again many funny moments 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.850
 the plan gets very decent 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.130
 seven and a half out of 10 possible points 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.960
 with it absolutely worth seeing whereby I say 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.970
 that would be enough if it did 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.860
 Blu-ray to watch the film on DVD 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.270
 although for it the full cinema price 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.530
 I do not have to lie down that's it 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.910
 not such a typical movie you get on 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.320
 the canvas must see the feeling 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.640
 also transports on the 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.290
 smaller matt disc at home 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.400
 actually he gets quite good overall 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.210
 from me seven out of ten possible 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.190
 points 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.080
 and that is actually more than me 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.240
 Ok friends thought that was us 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.770
 to be last run a thumb 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.600
 since we leave these words we will stay 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.740
 does not like to watch the last two movies 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.300
 criticism or at twitter and facebook 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.890
 We pass a little bit about movies 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.669
 want to write subscribe to this or x 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.470
 2 channel 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.360

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.640
 want to miss, let it be if they do 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.260
