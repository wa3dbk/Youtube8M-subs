00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
and then you can do some etching you can

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.810 
and then you can do some etching you can
do<00:04:58.140> designs<00:04:58.590> you<00:04:58.860> can<00:04:58.890> write<00:04:59.130> characters<00:04:59.370> you

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820
