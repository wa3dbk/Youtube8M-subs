 It becomes white chocolate spaghetti colored yellow 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.840
 The coloring I used the taste gel or powder-free coloring just a little bit 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.200
 Dark chocolate has been turned into a red candy Merz has been turned into a 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.010
 Or milk chocolate cake pop goal 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.340

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:03.970
 Please try by all means check so we should put a link of recipe videos 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:05.309
 Plastic fork This time I use orange color, but it is good to use any color 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.020
 spoon 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.159
 Scissors and Ziplock bag 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.369
 Let's get started 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.749
 First fix the cake pop ball in the distance 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:22.370
 It can be month chilled in the refrigerator and turn over the cake pop ball 

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:25.940
 I put a fork on it because it has a flat surface 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.740
 Because this cake pop the ball is in meatballs 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:34.229
 You do n't have to be round 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:39.020
 Since this cake pop balls are cool for 15 minutes in the refrigerator has become hard 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:45.040
 The form also has become a hardness of about not collapse 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:48.850
 Put a little dark chocolate on the tip of the fork and pierce the cake pop ball 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.270
 Or this time cake pop the ball so much harder 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:58.810
 Because the fork becomes difficult to touch if it is too soft 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:02:02.259
 Let the cake pop balls be refrigerated for 15 minutes in the refrigerator and just be firm 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:07.260
 Japanese clothes for a few minutes a month of economic black ball 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:10.310
 Put in the refrigerator and cool until the chocolate hardens 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:14.980
 The chocolate is firm 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:19.540
 And coating the cake pop ball with dark chocolate Device 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:23.049
 Let's try not to put too much chocolate on the fork at this time 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:28.480
 If you can cover the whole cake pop ball 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:30.740
 Drop chocolate on the log and drop while turning and evenly from the whole 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.780
 Drop the chocolate 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.780
 Let's dry this coating 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:44.310
 The whole came 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:46.750
 I am so worried because I can hide with this later decoration even if the surface is not clean 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.600
 It is okay without 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:56.690
 It will put the source of spaghetti in the red candy Belz 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:03:02.060
 Apply the whole cake pop ball using the back of the spoon 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:08.470
 Where the sauce is thick and it is getting thinner and you can see the brown 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.470
 You can work a state that is a source involved in the various make and meatballs 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.970

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:44.380
 He's got enough to touch it with a finger Next I'll make spaghetti noodles 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:50.319
 Put the light yellowed chocolate in a ziplock bag 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:57.010
 Please use something about this chocolate that is a little stiffer here 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:04:00.050
 Some things are melted before shooting, so they were melted about 5 minutes ago and then left 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:03.230
 Because it is not a Toro Toro liquid 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:07.730
 When it is squeezed close to 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.840
 Use a little muddy whether and chocolate so want to be the form of the surface is clearly remain 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:15.230
 Let's go 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:19.239
 When even a chocolate was placed in a street bag closer to the figure below to close the mouth corners just a little bit 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:24.150
 It is completion of squeeze bag if we cut 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:26.530
 When writing a year , hold the cake pop ball upside down 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:32.820
 Unne and write noodles 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.820
 Introduction wrote in the entire write superimposed again on it 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:43.270
 Noodles of spaghetti, please change from the bottom of the meat ball up to 2 much height of 3 minutes 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:48.460
 Of course you can write to any height 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:54.660
 Please change the amount of noodles freely and try variously. 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:59.300
 Since the spicy chocolate was just right there are still noodles of form it is clearly 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.300
 Write this window Eddie again surface in 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:06.630
 If I could do this far, I rolled it around with the remaining chocolate 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:13.340
 I write spaghetti noodles 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:17.660
 Squeeze out chocolate from above at the border of cake pop ball and fork 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:20.080
 As surface that is attached around the noodles and meatballs that are entangled in the fork are connected 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.080
 It was possible 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:29.860
 This is the completion of meatball spaghetti cake pops Styrofoam or 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:34.409
 Stuck in an oasis and let the forks stand 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:36.930
