00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:37.620 

I<00:00:33.540> mean<00:00:34.540> the<00:00:34.660> handling<00:00:35.140> of<00:00:35.260> that<00:00:35.320> ball<00:00:36.630> pull

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
I mean the handling of that ball pull

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.330 
I mean the handling of that ball pull
the<00:00:37.720> players<00:00:38.050> not<00:00:38.230> advancing<00:00:38.739> room<00:00:38.920> out<00:00:39.130> there

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
the players not advancing room out there

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.150 
the players not advancing room out there
if<00:00:39.400> they<00:00:39.430> throw<00:00:39.790> it<00:00:39.850> well<00:00:40.030> and<00:00:40.650> there<00:00:41.650> is<00:00:41.680> area

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
if they throw it well and there is area

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.080 
if they throw it well and there is area
left<00:00:42.370> and<00:00:42.580> right

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
left and right

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.330 
left and right
if<00:00:43.300> the<00:00:44.170> ball<00:00:44.320> is<00:00:44.350> out<00:00:44.590> of<00:00:44.650> your<00:00:44.739> hand<00:00:45.040> properly

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
if the ball is out of your hand properly

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.299 
if the ball is out of your hand properly
what<00:00:45.730> I<00:00:45.760> like<00:00:46.090> about<00:00:46.270> the<00:00:46.900> shorter<00:00:47.320> pattern<00:00:47.860> is

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
what I like about the shorter pattern is

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:49.740 
what I like about the shorter pattern is
the<00:00:48.489> fact<00:00:48.700> that<00:00:48.760> the<00:00:48.910> players<00:00:49.210> use<00:00:49.510> less

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
the fact that the players use less

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.540 
the fact that the players use less
aggressive<00:00:50.230> equipment<00:00:50.650> shinier<00:00:51.129> equipment

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
aggressive equipment shinier equipment

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.130 
aggressive equipment shinier equipment
and<00:00:51.790> I<00:00:51.910> think<00:00:52.210> that<00:00:52.360> the<00:00:52.480> old<00:00:52.629> pattern<00:00:52.989> holds

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
and I think that the old pattern holds

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.170 
and I think that the old pattern holds
up<00:00:53.410> better<00:00:55.140> they<00:00:56.140> drop<00:00:56.379> this<00:00:56.559> oil<00:00:56.770> pattern

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
up better they drop this oil pattern

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.090 
up better they drop this oil pattern
usually<00:00:58.180> on<00:00:58.270> some<00:00:58.510> well-worn<00:00:59.410> lanes<00:00:59.739> or<00:00:59.949> lanes

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
usually on some well-worn lanes or lanes

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.260 
usually on some well-worn lanes or lanes
that<00:01:00.220> have<00:01:00.280> been<00:01:00.489> around<00:01:00.730> a<00:01:00.879> little<00:01:01.059> bit

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
that have been around a little bit

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.680 
that have been around a little bit
longer<00:01:02.140> in<00:01:02.470> needs<00:01:03.460> a<00:01:03.520> little<00:01:03.640> need<00:01:04.479> a<00:01:04.540> little

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
longer in needs a little need a little

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.320 
longer in needs a little need a little
extra<00:01:04.869> TLC<00:01:05.380> if<00:01:05.860> you<00:01:05.979> will<00:01:06.130> that<00:01:06.550> outside<00:01:07.030> area
