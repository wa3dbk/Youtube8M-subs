00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
pretty fast and people sights make a lot

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.109 
pretty fast and people sights make a lot
of<00:02:03.509> noise<00:02:04.189> let's<00:02:05.189> see<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.549> doesn't<00:02:05.759> make<00:02:05.969> that

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
of noise let's see it doesn't make that

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.990 
of noise let's see it doesn't make that
much<00:02:06.180> noise<00:02:06.329> actually

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
much noise actually

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.420 
much noise actually
so<00:02:10.000> it's<00:02:10.209> not<00:02:10.390> a<00:02:10.450> huge<00:02:10.780> amount<00:02:10.990> no<00:02:11.470> it's<00:02:11.650> pretty

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
so it's not a huge amount no it's pretty

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.020 
so it's not a huge amount no it's pretty
quiet<00:02:12.819> actually<00:02:13.390> but<00:02:14.380> then<00:02:15.010> you<00:02:15.640> can<00:02:15.790> see

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
quiet actually but then you can see

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:27.260 
quiet actually but then you can see
those<00:02:16.209> fly<00:02:16.660> wheels<00:02:16.959> spinning<00:02:17.530> down<00:02:17.739> there<00:02:24.989> now

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.309 
I've always wondered how to load it
until<00:03:05.110> I<00:03:05.140> got<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.650> back<00:03:05.830> up<00:03:06.870> should<00:03:07.870> I<00:03:07.959> tell<00:03:08.200> you

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
until I got to back up should I tell you

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.039 
until I got to back up should I tell you
it<00:03:09.160> was<00:03:09.220> like<00:03:09.459> that<00:03:09.670> you<00:03:09.940> just<00:03:10.269> push<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:10.780> darts

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
it was like that you just push the darts

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:18.390 
it was like that you just push the darts
in<00:03:11.200> like<00:03:11.380> that<00:03:11.530> it's<00:03:11.739> really<00:03:12.010> easy<00:03:16.260> you<00:03:17.400> can

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
in like that it's really easy you can

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:29.099 
in like that it's really easy you can
see<00:03:19.470> that<00:03:25.109> okay<00:03:26.109> so<00:03:26.170> I<00:03:27.660> turn<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.840> on<00:03:28.959> switch

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
see that okay so I turn the on switch

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.460 
see that okay so I turn the on switch
now<00:03:29.670> no<00:03:30.670> noise<00:03:30.910> James<00:03:31.660> will<00:03:31.840> has<00:03:31.989> to<00:03:32.140> be<00:03:32.200> closed

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
now no noise James will has to be closed

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:39.270 
now no noise James will has to be closed
so<00:03:32.739> that<00:03:32.769> light<00:03:33.250> spring<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:38.560> has<00:03:38.769> kind<00:03:39.100> of<00:03:39.190> a

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
you can't just fire the gun when you

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.090 
you can't just fire the gun when you
turn<00:04:36.330> it<00:04:36.539> on<00:04:36.660> because<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.320> flywheel<00:04:37.590> needs

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
turn it on because the flywheel needs

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.760 
turn it on because the flywheel needs
about<00:04:38.970> two<00:04:39.449> or<00:04:39.570> three<00:04:39.780> seconds<00:04:40.229> to<00:04:40.410> warm<00:04:40.590> up

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
about two or three seconds to warm up

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:50.779 
about two or three seconds to warm up
okay<00:04:46.580> basically<00:04:47.580> to<00:04:47.940> do<00:04:48.120> that<00:04:48.590> you<00:04:49.590> just<00:04:49.919> hold

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
okay basically to do that you just hold

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.029 
okay basically to do that you just hold
you<00:04:51.510> can't<00:04:51.780> hold<00:04:52.080> down<00:04:52.289> the<00:04:52.470> trigger<00:04:52.650> and<00:04:52.979> make

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
you can't hold down the trigger and make

00:04:53.039 --> 00:05:11.029 
you can't hold down the trigger and make
it<00:04:53.340> keep<00:04:53.520> on<00:04:53.669> fine<00:05:06.680> so<00:05:08.150> that<00:05:09.150> is<00:05:09.389> how<00:05:09.660> to<00:05:10.039> Faro

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
it keep on fine so that is how to Faro

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.629 
it keep on fine so that is how to Faro
ten<00:05:11.490> quickly<00:05:12.030> I<00:05:12.560> find<00:05:13.560> this<00:05:13.740> another<00:05:14.310> really

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
ten quickly I find this another really

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.810 
ten quickly I find this another really
good<00:05:14.820> gun<00:05:15.000> but<00:05:15.330> if<00:05:16.110> you<00:05:16.470> just<00:05:16.740> in<00:05:17.160> battle<00:05:17.639> it's

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
good gun but if you just in battle it's

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.500 
good gun but if you just in battle it's
not<00:05:18.260> great<00:05:19.260> because<00:05:19.910> makes<00:05:20.910> lots<00:05:21.150> of<00:05:21.240> noise<00:05:21.300> so

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
not great because makes lots of noise so

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.960 
not great because makes lots of noise so
it's<00:05:21.900> pretty<00:05:22.020> hard<00:05:22.260> to<00:05:22.440> hide<00:05:22.950> but<00:05:23.550> if<00:05:23.639> you<00:05:23.729> turn

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
it's pretty hard to hide but if you turn

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.450 
it's pretty hard to hide but if you turn
it<00:05:24.090> off<00:05:24.210> and<00:05:24.240> do<00:05:24.599> it<00:05:24.630> it's<00:05:25.200> easier<00:05:25.620> but<00:05:26.070> then<00:05:26.310> if

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
it off and do it it's easier but then if

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.550 
it off and do it it's easier but then if
you<00:05:26.550> want<00:05:27.120> to<00:05:27.210> attack<00:05:27.599> straight<00:05:28.050> away<00:05:28.289> and<00:05:28.500> you

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
you want to attack straight away and you

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.020 
you want to attack straight away and you
turn<00:05:28.800> it<00:05:28.919> on<00:05:29.010> you<00:05:29.220> pull<00:05:29.400> the<00:05:29.490> trigger<00:05:29.639> straight

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
turn it on you pull the trigger straight

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.990 
turn it on you pull the trigger straight
away<00:05:30.240> the<00:05:30.389> first<00:05:30.599> dot<00:05:30.930> basically<00:05:31.889> goes<00:05:32.520> to<00:05:32.820> me

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
away the first dot basically goes to me

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.740 
away the first dot basically goes to me
and<00:05:33.330> just<00:05:33.419> drops<00:05:33.720> to<00:05:33.930> the<00:05:33.990> ground<00:05:35.120> needs<00:05:36.120> and

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
and just drops to the ground needs and

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.980 
and just drops to the ground needs and
up<00:05:36.930> to<00:05:37.260> the<00:05:37.530> second<00:05:38.039> one<00:05:38.849> second<00:05:39.570> and<00:05:39.690> third

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
up to the second one second and third

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.290 
up to the second one second and third
get<00:05:40.320> faster<00:05:40.919> and<00:05:41.039> then<00:05:41.130> the<00:05:41.220> rest<00:05:41.430> of<00:05:41.580> good<00:05:41.760> see

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
get faster and then the rest of good see

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.150 
get faster and then the rest of good see
it's<00:05:42.660> about<00:05:42.930> two<00:05:43.199> or<00:05:43.289> three<00:05:43.320> seconds<00:05:43.860> to<00:05:43.979> warm

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
it's about two or three seconds to warm

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:57.050 
it's about two or three seconds to warm
up<00:05:45.020> that<00:05:46.020> is<00:05:46.320> the<00:05:46.590> barricade<00:05:55.250> so<00:05:56.250> easy<00:05:56.550> like
