00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
it's time for a few little lessons on

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.420 
it's time for a few little lessons on
wine<00:00:02.970> some<00:00:03.659> basic<00:00:04.200> wine<00:00:04.500> knowledge<00:00:04.830> just

wine some basic wine knowledge just

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.789 
wine some basic wine knowledge just
because<00:00:05.730> it<00:00:05.970> really<00:00:06.029> bugs<00:00:06.870> me<00:00:07.049> when<00:00:07.230> I<00:00:07.470> see

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
because it really bugs me when I see

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.100 
because it really bugs me when I see
these<00:00:08.010> things<00:00:08.220> so<00:00:08.519> first<00:00:09.330> when<00:00:09.660> it<00:00:09.690> comes<00:00:09.960> to

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
these things so first when it comes to

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.190 
these things so first when it comes to
the<00:00:10.230> temperature<00:00:10.830> of<00:00:11.070> wine<00:00:11.400> yes<00:00:12.059> red<00:00:12.719> wine<00:00:12.960> is

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
the temperature of wine yes red wine is

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.379 
the temperature of wine yes red wine is
supposed<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.679> be<00:00:13.860> room<00:00:14.190> temperature<00:00:14.790> but<00:00:15.269> that

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
supposed to be room temperature but that

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.470 
supposed to be room temperature but that
doesn't<00:00:15.690> mean<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:16.220> room<00:00:17.220> that's<00:00:17.430> 85<00:00:18.000> degrees

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
doesn't mean a room that's 85 degrees

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.080 
doesn't mean a room that's 85 degrees
that<00:00:18.869> means<00:00:18.930> cellar<00:00:19.710> room<00:00:20.189> temperature<00:00:20.820> so

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
that means cellar room temperature so

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.750 
that means cellar room temperature so
it's<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.330> little<00:00:21.600> bit<00:00:21.869> cooler<00:00:22.350> so<00:00:23.070> it's<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.609> good

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
it's a little bit cooler so it's a good

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.210 
it's a little bit cooler so it's a good
idea<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.210> put<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.449> wine<00:00:24.779> even<00:00:25.230> if<00:00:25.439> it's<00:00:25.590> red<00:00:25.890> in

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
idea to put the wine even if it's red in

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.009 
idea to put the wine even if it's red in
the<00:00:26.340> refrigerator<00:00:26.880> just<00:00:26.970> for<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> few<00:00:27.750> minutes

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
the refrigerator just for a few minutes

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.080 
the refrigerator just for a few minutes
to<00:00:28.170> cool<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.680> down<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.949> little<00:00:29.220> bit<00:00:29.369> when<00:00:30.000> it

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
to cool it down a little bit when it

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.870 
to cool it down a little bit when it
comes<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.480> white<00:00:30.750> wine<00:00:31.070> it's<00:00:32.070> not<00:00:32.309> supposed<00:00:32.790> to

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
comes to white wine it's not supposed to

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.959 
comes to white wine it's not supposed to
be<00:00:33.120> frigid<00:00:33.960> like<00:00:34.320> almost<00:00:35.100> frozen<00:00:35.489> it's<00:00:35.820> not

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
be frigid like almost frozen it's not

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.880 
be frigid like almost frozen it's not
supposed<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.300> be<00:00:36.420> refrigerator<00:00:37.290> temperature

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
supposed to be refrigerator temperature

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.250 
supposed to be refrigerator temperature
so<00:00:38.129> with<00:00:38.309> white<00:00:38.550> wine<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.149> might<00:00:39.540> keep<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.110> in

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
so with white wine you might keep it in

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.470 
so with white wine you might keep it in
the<00:00:40.379> fridge<00:00:40.559> but<00:00:40.890> then<00:00:41.010> pull<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.489> out<00:00:41.640> about<00:00:41.969> 15

the fridge but then pull it out about 15
minutes<00:00:42.750> before<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.950> can<00:00:44.160> warm<00:00:44.730> up

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
minutes before so that it can warm up

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.150 
minutes before so that it can warm up
just<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.629> little<00:00:45.660> bit<00:00:45.960> now<00:00:46.559> when<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.860> comes<00:00:47.010> to

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160

this<00:01:05.129> not<00:01:06.000> like<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:08.060> like<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:10.170> reason

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
this not like this like this the reason

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.600 
this not like this like this the reason
well<00:01:11.159> if<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.549> hold<00:01:11.850> white<00:01:12.210> wine<00:01:12.740> by<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.159> glass

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
well if you hold white wine by the glass

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.050 
well if you hold white wine by the glass
like<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.780> your<00:01:16.500> hands<00:01:16.860> are<00:01:17.130> hot<00:01:17.340> right<00:01:17.670> or

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
like this your hands are hot right or

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.870 
like this your hands are hot right or
warm<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.530> heat<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:20.040> your<00:01:20.070> hands<00:01:20.490> is

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
warm so the heat of your hands is

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.149 
warm so the heat of your hands is
actually<00:01:21.030> going<00:01:21.450> into<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.560> glass<00:01:22.799> and

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
actually going into the glass and

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.320

that's<00:01:49.670> white<00:01:50.300> wine<00:01:50.510> red<00:01:51.170> wine<00:01:51.430> here's<00:01:52.430> a

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
that's white wine red wine here's a

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.550 
that's white wine red wine here's a
proper<00:01:52.910> red<00:01:53.240> wine<00:01:53.450> glass<00:01:53.660> you<00:01:53.870> compare<00:01:54.350> the

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
proper red wine glass you compare the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
proper red wine glass you compare the
size<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:56.060> reason<00:01:56.330> is<00:01:56.450> because<00:01:56.710> then<00:01:57.710> the

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
size and the reason is because then the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.280 
size and the reason is because then the
head<00:01:58.880> of<00:01:59.030> it<00:01:59.150> is<00:01:59.180> much<00:01:59.480> bigger<00:01:59.720> so<00:02:00.020> you<00:02:00.080> get<00:02:00.260> a

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
head of it is much bigger so you get a

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.580 
head of it is much bigger so you get a
different<00:02:00.830> nose<00:02:01.780> because<00:02:02.780> this<00:02:02.960> one<00:02:03.170> sees<00:02:03.410> so

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
different nose because this one sees so

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.030 
different nose because this one sees so
much<00:02:03.770> more<00:02:04.130> goes<00:02:04.460> in<00:02:04.730> that's<00:02:05.000> helps<00:02:05.900> you<00:02:06.050> to<00:02:06.260> it

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
much more goes in that's helps you to it

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.969 
much more goes in that's helps you to it
enhances<00:02:07.730> the<00:02:08.300> flavor<00:02:08.660> of<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:09.080> wine<00:02:09.229> because

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
enhances the flavor of the wine because

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.720 
enhances the flavor of the wine because
scent<00:02:10.729> is<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:11.930> big<00:02:12.410> part<00:02:12.740> flavor<00:02:13.160> in<00:02:13.370> fact<00:02:13.580> it's

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
scent is a big part flavor in fact it's

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.730 
scent is a big part flavor in fact it's
as<00:02:13.850> much<00:02:14.030> as<00:02:14.150> 70%<00:02:14.660> of<00:02:15.290> what<00:02:15.440> you<00:02:15.560> actually
