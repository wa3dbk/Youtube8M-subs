make a video and this video will be the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.450 
make a video and this video will be the
three<00:00:27.240> biggest<00:00:27.510> mistakes<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:28.410> see<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.279> gym

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
three biggest mistakes I see in the gym

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.650 
three biggest mistakes I see in the gym
every<00:00:29.670> single<00:00:30.150> day<00:00:30.320> so<00:00:31.320> mistake<00:00:32.009> number<00:00:32.160> one<00:00:32.660> a

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
every single day so mistake number one a

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.920 
every single day so mistake number one a
lack<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.320> effort<00:00:34.860> lack<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.790> focus<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.899> is

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
lack of effort lack of focus so this is

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.740 
lack of effort lack of focus so this is
effort<00:00:37.410> focus<00:00:37.829> kind<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.760> goes<00:00:38.910> together<00:00:39.120> so

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
effort focus kind of goes together so

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.540 
effort focus kind of goes together so
what<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:39.989> see<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> lot<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.590> people<00:00:41.010> do<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.280> just

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
what I see a lot of people do is just

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.610 
what I see a lot of people do is just
they're<00:00:42.239> not<00:00:42.390> very<00:00:42.719> congruent<00:00:43.020> with<00:00:43.469> what

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
they're not very congruent with what

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.310 
they're not very congruent with what
they're<00:00:43.860> doing<00:00:44.190> like<00:00:44.430> if<00:00:44.610> you're<00:00:44.820> standing

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
they're doing like if you're standing

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.959 
they're doing like if you're standing
let's<00:00:46.320> say<00:00:46.469> you're<00:00:46.620> doing<00:00:46.800> squats<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.399> if

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
let's say you're doing squats and if

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.549 
let's say you're doing squats and if
you're<00:00:48.120> doing<00:00:48.329> squats<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.079> finish<00:00:49.379> your

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
you're doing squats and you finish your

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.590 
you're doing squats and you finish your
squatting<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.370> can't<00:00:50.640> wait<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.059> jump<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.449> your

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
squatting you can't wait to jump on your

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.450 
squatting you can't wait to jump on your
phone<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.020> text<00:00:52.199> your<00:00:52.379> friend<00:00:52.710> or<00:00:52.949> we'll<00:00:53.340> do

phone to text your friend or we'll do

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.790 
phone to text your friend or we'll do
some<00:00:53.670> other<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.300> surf<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.230> facebook<00:00:55.710> or

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
some other like surf on facebook or

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.170 
some other like surf on facebook or
something<00:00:55.920> like<00:00:56.160> let's<00:00:56.640> go<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> lack<00:00:57.149> of

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
something like let's go a lack of

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.689 
something like let's go a lack of
congruence<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.410> your<00:00:58.590> actions<00:00:59.190> are<00:00:59.460> not

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
congruence so your actions are not

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.459 
congruence so your actions are not
aligned<00:01:00.180> with<00:01:00.420> what<00:01:00.570> what<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:00.960> inside<00:01:01.440> of

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
aligned with what what it's inside of

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.080 
aligned with what what it's inside of
your<00:01:01.680> head<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.190> need<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.489> align<00:01:02.789> your

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
your head so you need to align your

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.630 
your head so you need to align your
thoughts<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.600> actions<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:05.189> get<00:01:05.400> that

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
thoughts and actions and to get that

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.990 
thoughts and actions and to get that
float<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.390> get<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.869> focus<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.979> then<00:01:08.760> that

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
float to get that focus and then that

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.160 
float to get that focus and then that
that<00:01:09.270> exercise<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.939> 10<00:01:11.939> times<00:01:12.299> more<00:01:12.720> effective

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
that exercise is 10 times more effective

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.350 
that exercise is 10 times more effective
than<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.680> then<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.460> when<00:01:14.729> you're<00:01:14.850> like<00:01:15.030> lack

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.359 
than it then it is when you're like lack
of<00:01:15.540> focus<00:01:15.750> when<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.049> just<00:01:16.320> can't<00:01:16.740> wait<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.189> go

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
of focus when you just can't wait to go

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.770 
of focus when you just can't wait to go
through<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> motions<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.390> can<00:01:18.509> get<00:01:18.630> back

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
through the motions so you can get back

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.020 
through the motions so you can get back
on<00:01:18.840> your<00:01:19.110> phone<00:01:19.439> talk<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.189> your<00:01:20.280> buddy<00:01:20.460> there<00:01:20.820> I

right<00:04:58.730> there<00:04:58.970> so<00:04:59.570> the<00:05:00.560> way<00:05:00.830> I<00:05:00.860> would<00:05:01.190> fix<00:05:01.460> this

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
right there so the way I would fix this

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.840 
right there so the way I would fix this
problem<00:05:02.030> is<00:05:02.919> just<00:05:03.919> grab<00:05:04.280> everything<00:05:04.550> and

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
problem is just grab everything and

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.880 
problem is just grab everything and
stick<00:05:05.180> to<00:05:05.210> it<00:05:05.360> it<00:05:05.600> might<00:05:05.810> not<00:05:06.020> be<00:05:06.080> perfect<00:05:06.500> but

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
stick to it it might not be perfect but

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.390 
stick to it it might not be perfect but
if<00:05:07.250> you<00:05:07.370> apply<00:05:07.730> the<00:05:07.790> first<00:05:08.330> two<00:05:09.070> mistakes<00:05:10.070> like

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
if you apply the first two mistakes like

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.280 
if you apply the first two mistakes like
the<00:05:10.610> fixes<00:05:11.090> for<00:05:11.120> these<00:05:11.419> mistakes<00:05:11.750> which<00:05:12.020> is

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
the fixes for these mistakes which is

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.510 
the fixes for these mistakes which is
pretty<00:05:13.220> much<00:05:13.340> putting<00:05:13.730> in<00:05:13.850> the<00:05:13.970> effort<00:05:14.090> and

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
programming but it has to be something

programming but it has to be something
you<00:05:56.660> won't<00:05:56.900> even<00:05:57.020> reach<00:05:57.350> the<00:05:57.530> advanced<00:05:57.979> level
