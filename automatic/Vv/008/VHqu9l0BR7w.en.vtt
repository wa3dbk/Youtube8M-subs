some<00:00:11.130> of<00:00:11.250> you<00:00:11.370> how<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.670> built<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.590> these<00:00:13.590> are

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
some of you how I built it these are

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.660 
some of you how I built it these are
just<00:00:13.980> some<00:00:14.219> spare<00:00:14.730> metal<00:00:15.199> pieces<00:00:16.580> similar<00:00:17.580> to

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
just some spare metal pieces similar to

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.120 
just some spare metal pieces similar to
a<00:00:17.699> duster<00:00:18.240> cane<00:00:18.480> like<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.710> kind<00:00:19.920> of<00:00:19.949> see

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
a duster cane like this you kind of see

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.359 
a duster cane like this you kind of see
the<00:00:20.250> way<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.490> top<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.210> shaped<00:00:22.369> they

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
the way the top of that is shaped they

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.170 
the way the top of that is shaped they
look<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.640> little<00:00:23.789> familiar<00:00:24.439> ok<00:00:25.550> so<00:00:26.550> basically<00:00:26.730> I

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
look a little familiar ok so basically I

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.140 
look a little familiar ok so basically I
cut<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.720> bottom<00:00:28.080> part<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.680> fan<00:00:29.490> or<00:00:29.910> got

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
cut the bottom part of the fan or got

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.410 
cut the bottom part of the fan or got
the<00:00:30.300> can<00:00:30.480> excuse<00:00:30.869> me<00:00:31.430> the<00:00:32.430> stickers<00:00:32.910> are<00:00:32.940> just

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
the can excuse me the stickers are just

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.400 
the can excuse me the stickers are just
I<00:00:33.989> went<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:35.040> got<00:00:35.790> some<00:00:36.030> pictures<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.870> an<00:00:37.050> actual

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
I went I got some pictures of an actual

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.510 
I went I got some pictures of an actual
box<00:00:37.920> off<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.640> pole<00:00:39.149> from<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.480> real<00:00:39.629> siren<00:00:40.520> just

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
box off of a pole from a real siren just

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.030 
box off of a pole from a real siren just
basically<00:00:42.059> printed<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:42.989> glued<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
basically printed it and glued the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.000 
basically printed it and glued the
pieces<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.700> paper<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.270> but<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> lot<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.800> is

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
pieces of paper on but a lot of that is

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.860 
pieces of paper on but a lot of that is
kind<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.309> like<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.550> jb<00:00:47.940> weld<00:00:48.120> style<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:49.760> epoxy

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
kind of like the jb weld style of epoxy

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.889 
kind of like the jb weld style of epoxy
that<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> quarter<00:00:53.430> inch<00:00:53.670> three<00:00:54.239> conductor

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
that is a quarter inch three conductor

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.619 
that is a quarter inch three conductor
headphone<00:00:55.710> plug<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.879> kind<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.180> acts<00:00:57.390> as<00:00:57.600> a

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
headphone plug that kind of acts as a

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.920 
headphone plug that kind of acts as a
slip<00:00:58.050> ring<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:59.070> when<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.640> eventually<00:01:00.030> mount<00:01:00.750> a

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
slip ring so when I eventually mount a

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.929 
slip ring so when I eventually mount a
motor<00:01:01.440> at<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.039> top<00:01:02.250> side<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:03.480> will<00:01:03.960> mate<00:01:04.290> with

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
motor at the top side it will mate with

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.450 
motor at the top side it will mate with
this<00:01:05.939> piece<00:01:06.299> right<00:01:06.600> here<00:01:07.040> where<00:01:08.040> my<00:01:08.070> thumb<00:01:08.400> is

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
this piece right here where my thumb is

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.880 
this piece right here where my thumb is
more<00:01:08.880> or<00:01:09.000> less<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.390> will<00:01:09.750> be<00:01:09.900> more<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.350> gear

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
more or less that will be more of a gear

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.320 
more or less that will be more of a gear
and<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.939> will<00:01:12.119> allow<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:14.340> top<00:01:14.580> siren<00:01:15.119> head

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
and that will allow the top siren head

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.230 
and that will allow the top siren head
to<00:01:15.570> rotate<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:18.780> circuitry<00:01:19.320> here<00:01:19.710> is

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
to rotate the circuitry here is

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.160 
to rotate the circuitry here is
basically<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.110> see<00:01:23.060> this<00:01:24.060> section<00:01:24.659> over

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
basically you can see this section over

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.210 
basically you can see this section over
here<00:01:25.909> that<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.380> 20-second<00:01:28.380> voice<00:01:28.560> recording

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
here that is a 20-second voice recording

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.609 
here that is a 20-second voice recording
module<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:31.040> basically<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.520> got<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.270> little<00:01:34.170> chip

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
module and basically I got a little chip

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.740 
module and basically I got a little chip
that<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.950> can<00:01:35.100> see<00:01:35.250> back<00:01:35.520> here<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:38.750> lm386

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
that you can see back here is a lm386

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.940 
that you can see back here is a lm386
and<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> 800<00:01:42.420> mil<00:01:42.570> wadio<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.680> fire

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
and it is a 800 mil wadio a of a fire

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.480 
and it is a 800 mil wadio a of a fire
comes<00:01:44.790> with<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.000> schematic<00:01:45.799> get<00:01:46.799> radio<00:01:47.189> shack

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
comes with a schematic get radio shack

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.359 
comes with a schematic get radio shack
or<00:01:47.520> other<00:01:48.030> places<00:01:48.299> even<00:01:48.689> cheaper<00:01:49.369> but

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
or other places even cheaper but

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.950 
or other places even cheaper but
basically<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.270> fed<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.049> output<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.960> 22nd

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
basically I fed the output of the 22nd

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.230 
basically I fed the output of the 22nd
recording<00:01:55.560> module<00:01:56.009> into<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.759> input<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.119> the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
recording module into the input of the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.760 
recording module into the input of the
amplifier<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.890> speaker

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
amplifier and on to the speaker

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.770 
amplifier and on to the speaker
I<00:02:01.719> had<00:02:02.719> to<00:02:02.869> use<00:02:03.079> a<00:02:03.189> capacitor<00:02:04.299> between<00:02:05.299> the

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
I had to use a capacitor between the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.460 
I had to use a capacitor between the
speaker<00:02:06.200> output<00:02:06.710> of<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:08.030> voice<00:02:08.929> recording

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
speaker output of the voice recording

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.610 
speaker output of the voice recording
module<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.099> the<00:02:11.030> amplifier<00:02:11.660> because<00:02:11.900> that

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
module and the amplifier because that

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.070 
module and the amplifier because that
they<00:02:12.800> were<00:02:12.860> commonly<00:02:13.660> grounded<00:02:14.660> by<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.840> same

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
they were commonly grounded by the same

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.650 
they were commonly grounded by the same
power<00:02:15.319> supply<00:02:15.970> it<00:02:16.970> would<00:02:17.120> have<00:02:17.209> bogged<00:02:17.450> it

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
power supply it would have bogged it

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.479 
power supply it would have bogged it
down<00:02:17.870> it<00:02:18.140> would<00:02:18.200> have<00:02:18.349> been<00:02:18.410> kind<00:02:18.709> of<00:02:18.739> DC<00:02:19.129> short

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
down it would have been kind of DC short

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.789 
down it would have been kind of DC short
so<00:02:19.790> I<00:02:19.819> put<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.150> capacitor<00:02:20.330> and<00:02:20.959> there<00:02:21.200> which

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
so I put a capacitor and there which

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.000 
so I put a capacitor and there which
allowed<00:02:22.129> the<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.970> AC<00:02:23.209> part<00:02:23.989> of<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.379> the<00:02:24.680> sound

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
allowed the the AC part of the the sound

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.039 
allowed the the AC part of the the sound
the<00:02:25.280> sine<00:02:25.489> wave<00:02:25.730> of<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.330> audio<00:02:26.660> to<00:02:26.840> pass

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
the sine wave of the audio to pass

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.550 
the sine wave of the audio to pass
through<00:02:27.470> but<00:02:27.709> it<00:02:28.430> was<00:02:28.519> a<00:02:28.549> DC<00:02:28.970> block<00:02:29.330> so<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:30.080> kept

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
through but it was a DC block so it kept

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.949 
through but it was a DC block so it kept
those<00:02:31.250> circuits<00:02:31.760> from<00:02:31.849> kind<00:02:32.090> of<00:02:32.180> interfering

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
those circuits from kind of interfering

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.509 
those circuits from kind of interfering
with<00:02:32.989> each<00:02:33.170> other<00:02:33.440> as<00:02:33.860> far<00:02:34.130> as<00:02:34.220> their<00:02:34.340> power

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
with each other as far as their power

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.289 
with each other as far as their power
supply<00:02:35.000> so<00:02:35.890> that's<00:02:36.890> basically<00:02:37.160> how<00:02:37.849> it<00:02:37.970> works

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
supply so that's basically how it works

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.350 
supply so that's basically how it works
there<00:02:38.989> was<00:02:39.140> two<00:02:39.410> push<00:02:40.040> buttons<00:02:40.069> that<00:02:41.060> were<00:02:41.209> on

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
there was two push buttons that were on

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.069 
there was two push buttons that were on
there<00:02:41.630> on<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.849> actual<00:02:44.030> voice<00:02:44.360> recording

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
there on the the actual voice recording

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:50.920 
there on the the actual voice recording
section<00:02:45.890> of<00:02:46.040> it<00:02:46.269> I<00:02:47.269> remove<00:02:48.110> those<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:49.930> those

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
section of it I remove those and those

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.770 
section of it I remove those and those
push<00:02:51.829> buttons<00:02:52.340> basically<00:02:53.239> switched<00:02:53.569> between

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
push buttons basically switched between

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.220 
push buttons basically switched between
one<00:02:54.200> common<00:02:54.620> lead<00:02:54.799> and<00:02:55.130> two<00:02:55.720> different<00:02:56.720> inputs

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
one common lead and two different inputs

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.800 
one common lead and two different inputs
on<00:02:57.440> there<00:02:57.709> so<00:02:58.250> I<00:02:58.310> would<00:02:58.489> place<00:02:58.700> those<00:02:58.970> with<00:02:59.450> you

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
on there so I would place those with you

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.539 
on there so I would place those with you
can<00:03:00.019> kind<00:03:00.230> of<00:03:00.290> see<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.709> backside<00:03:01.190> of<00:03:01.250> this

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
can kind of see the backside of this

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.150 
can kind of see the backside of this
toggle<00:03:02.030> switch<00:03:02.510> so<00:03:03.170> instead<00:03:03.440> how<00:03:03.560> to<00:03:03.620> push<00:03:03.920> one

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
toggle switch so instead how to push one

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.360 
toggle switch so instead how to push one
button<00:03:04.190> or<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.819> other<00:03:05.470> it's<00:03:06.470> just<00:03:06.769> one<00:03:07.010> button

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
button or the other it's just one button

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.879 
button or the other it's just one button
but<00:03:07.850> you're<00:03:08.030> selecting<00:03:08.569> either<00:03:08.780> or<00:03:09.079> input<00:03:09.709> on

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:09.889 
but you're selecting either or input on

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:13.259 
but you're selecting either or input on
there<00:03:10.190> so<00:03:10.730> that's<00:03:10.880> basically<00:03:11.090> what<00:03:11.540> I<00:03:11.569> did<00:03:11.720> but

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
there so that's basically what I did but

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.379 
there so that's basically what I did but
otherwise<00:03:14.769> that's<00:03:15.769> pretty<00:03:16.340> much<00:03:16.579> it<00:03:16.639> the<00:03:17.180> rest

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
otherwise that's pretty much it the rest

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.629 
otherwise that's pretty much it the rest
of<00:03:17.510> this<00:03:17.600> was<00:03:17.900> just<00:03:18.109> stuffing<00:03:18.440> I<00:03:18.560> found<00:03:18.950> I'm

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:19.639 
of this was just stuffing I found I'm

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.629 
of this was just stuffing I found I'm
going<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.090> block<00:03:20.889> just<00:03:21.889> happen<00:03:22.250> to<00:03:22.310> have<00:03:22.340> some

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
going to block just happen to have some

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.680 
going to block just happen to have some
stainless<00:03:23.239> tubing<00:03:23.870> and<00:03:24.350> my<00:03:24.799> work<00:03:25.040> 8<00:03:25.370> inch<00:03:25.730> I

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
stainless tubing and my work 8 inch I

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.410 
stainless tubing and my work 8 inch I
ran<00:03:27.350> the<00:03:27.530> little<00:03:27.829> it<00:03:27.980> looks<00:03:28.639> like<00:03:28.819> a<00:03:28.850> single

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
ran the little it looks like a single

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.390 
ran the little it looks like a single
wire<00:03:29.599> but<00:03:29.870> it's<00:03:30.049> actually<00:03:30.230> miniature<00:03:30.889> coax

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
wire but it's actually miniature coax

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.259 
wire but it's actually miniature coax
axis<00:03:32.000> two<00:03:32.209> conductors<00:03:32.870> for<00:03:33.650> my<00:03:34.010> audio<00:03:34.370> path<00:03:34.700> or

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
axis two conductors for my audio path or

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:43.450 
axis two conductors for my audio path or
speaker<00:03:35.959> so<00:03:36.620> that<00:03:37.549> is<00:03:37.849> pretty<00:03:38.389> much<00:03:38.630> it<00:03:40.450> enjoy
