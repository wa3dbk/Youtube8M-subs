00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.360
 the fundamental nutritional requirements for 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.730
 a growing rabbit and in 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:17.630
 fat is the raw fiber protein 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:20.090
 water the raw fiber represented 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.710
 especially from the hay is essential for 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.679
 keep the apparatus running 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.539
 digestive hay also contributes 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.330
 to buffer the excess of humidity 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.730
 made from fresh food 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.010
 avoiding diarrhea and swelling the dose 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.590
 daily recommended raw fiber 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.520
 in the ration he must wander around the 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.520
 14 percent 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.820
 as regards the proteins 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.580
 needs vary according to age and 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.120
 of the physiological state the females in 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:52.940
 gestation require a protein content 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:56.050
 around 12 to 15 percent rising to 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.340
 17 18 percent during lactation 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.100
 for fattening subjects on 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.519
 protein requirement is of 15 17 per 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.900
 hundred and for reproducers of 12 13 per 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.150
 one hundred 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.070
 the daily type ration can be 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.250
 consisting of commercial feed 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.290
 flocked or blushed with a good one 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.440
 hay 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.750
 commercial flocked feed presents 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.480
 many advantages the content of 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.200
 sugars and proteins mineral salts e 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.580
 vitamins are balanced digestibility is 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.890
 high 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.260
 the only disadvantage is represented by 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.660
 very low fiber content that makes 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:38.680
 necessary constant integration with 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:41.710
 dried fodder a type rationing can 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:45.880
 being next to the evening we administer 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:50.140
 to the hay rabbits in the morning 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:54.759
 instead a concentrated food or cereals 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:58.090
 flakes or pellet feed feed 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:01.270
 in the afternoon the rabbits ingest the 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:05.190
 Czech too made from digestion 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.190
 of hay eaten the night before
