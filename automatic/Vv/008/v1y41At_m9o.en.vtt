stop<00:00:59.340> squeezing<00:00:59.609> me<00:00:59.910> I<00:00:59.940> can't<00:01:00.210> slow<00:01:00.390> down<00:01:00.420> much

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
stop squeezing me I can't slow down much

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.029 
stop squeezing me I can't slow down much
more<00:01:00.899> without<00:01:01.050> doing<00:01:01.289> an<00:01:01.350> emergency<00:01:01.500> stop

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
more without doing an emergency stop

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.200 
more without doing an emergency stop
which<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.280> impractical<00:01:02.910> because<00:01:02.969> there's

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
which is impractical because there's

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.100 
which is impractical because there's
other<00:01:03.300> stuff<00:01:03.510> behind<00:01:03.660> me

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
other stuff behind me

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.810 
other stuff behind me
that's<00:01:04.769> question<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.280> pavement<00:01:05.430> and

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
that's question to the pavement and

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.310 
that's question to the pavement and
that's<00:01:06.750> it

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
that's it

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.640 
that's it
so<00:01:07.830> how<00:01:08.430> come<00:01:08.729> people<00:01:09.030> think<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.049> don't<00:01:10.200> slow

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
so how come people think I don't slow

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.850 
so how come people think I don't slow
down

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
down

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.219 
down
well<00:01:11.159> that's<00:01:11.400> down<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.119> wide-angle<00:01:13.080> lens

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
well that's down to the wide-angle lens

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.899 
well that's down to the wide-angle lens
that<00:01:13.350> are<00:01:13.439> used<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:13.890> case<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.640> video

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
that are used in this case in this video

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.320 
that are used in this case in this video
it's<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> 135<00:01:15.900> degrees<00:01:16.850> objects<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> edge

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
it's a 135 degrees objects on the edge

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.330 
it's a 135 degrees objects on the edge
of<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.600> image<00:01:18.840> appear<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> little<00:01:19.950> bit<00:01:20.040> curved

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
of the image appear a little bit curved

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.320 
of the image appear a little bit curved
and<00:01:20.700> distort<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:22.020> really<00:01:22.590> hard<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.950> read

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
and distort so it's really hard to read

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.210 
and distort so it's really hard to read
how<00:01:25.340> quickly<00:01:26.340> someone<00:01:27.470> decelerates<00:01:28.470> or<00:01:28.829> in

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
how quickly someone decelerates or in

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.880 
how quickly someone decelerates or in
some<00:01:29.700> case<00:01:29.850> as<00:01:29.970> well<00:01:30.210> accelerate<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.290> people

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
some case as well accelerate so people

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.429 
some case as well accelerate so people
on<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.460> video<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.390> fact<00:01:33.630> commented<00:01:34.409> that

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
on this video and in fact commented that

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.010 
on this video and in fact commented that
I<00:01:34.770> didn't<00:01:35.009> slow<00:01:35.130> down<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.780> accelerated<00:01:36.780> at<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
I didn't slow down I accelerated at the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.190 
I didn't slow down I accelerated at the
inside<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.290> taxi<00:01:37.740> when<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.490> fact<00:01:38.579> I'm<00:01:38.759> I'm

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
inside of taxi when in fact I'm I'm

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.620 
inside of taxi when in fact I'm I'm
digging<00:01:40.200> accelerating<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.890> whole<00:01:41.159> time

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
digging accelerating the whole time

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.330 
digging accelerating the whole time
doing<00:01:42.630> what<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:42.899> can<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.200> try<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:43.829> avoid<00:01:44.040> an

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
doing what I can to try and avoid an

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.399 
doing what I can to try and avoid an
instant<00:01:44.729> after<00:01:45.360> all<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.570> do<00:01:45.630> not<00:01:46.020> want<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.320> get

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
but some people don't see it that way

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.950 
but some people don't see it that way
so<00:01:53.579> why<00:01:53.700> am<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:53.909> not<00:01:54.030> using<00:01:54.210> cycling<00:01:54.780> and

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960

that<00:02:35.280> isn't<00:02:35.550> one<00:02:35.670> anyway<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:36.510> what's<00:02:37.470> the

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
that isn't one anyway so what's the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.650 
that isn't one anyway so what's the
problem<00:02:37.710> so<00:02:38.640> why<00:02:38.790> am<00:02:38.880> i<00:02:38.970> cycling<00:02:39.420> in<00:02:39.570> the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
problem so why am i cycling in the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.560 
problem so why am i cycling in the
middle<00:02:39.840> of<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:39.960> road<00:02:40.140> two<00:02:40.860> main<00:02:41.100> reasons<00:02:41.570> one

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
middle of the road two main reasons one

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.140 
middle of the road two main reasons one
it<00:02:42.720> forces<00:02:43.200> road<00:02:43.380> users<00:02:43.770> to<00:02:44.090> overtake<00:02:45.090> me

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
it forces road users to overtake me

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.450 
it forces road users to overtake me
safety<00:02:45.480> by<00:02:45.720> moving<00:02:45.990> to<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.290> right<00:02:46.770> sir<00:02:47.010> you

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
safety by moving to the right sir you

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.400 
safety by moving to the right sir you
meant<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.790> move<00:02:48.420> out<00:02:48.600> into<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.020> other<00:02:49.140> lane<00:02:49.290> to

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
meant to move out into the other lane to

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.690 
meant to move out into the other lane to
overtake<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.890> cyclist<00:02:50.310> if<00:02:50.430> there's<00:02:50.580> not<00:02:50.640> enough

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
overtake a cyclist if there's not enough

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.890 
overtake a cyclist if there's not enough
space<00:02:51.060> within<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.510> lane<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:51.810> there

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
space within the lane and there

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.300 
space within the lane and there
certainly<00:02:52.140> isn't<00:02:52.440> within<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.860> bus<00:02:53.010> lane<00:02:53.190> so

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
certainly isn't within the bus lane so

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.520 
certainly isn't within the bus lane so
I'm<00:02:53.400> forcing<00:02:53.820> him<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:54.090> move<00:02:54.540> out<00:02:54.720> correctly<00:02:55.320> to

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
I'm forcing him to move out correctly to

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.220 
I'm forcing him to move out correctly to
overtake<00:02:55.800> me<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.100> Abby<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.240> give<00:02:57.780> myself<00:02:57.900> the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
overtake me and Abby I give myself the

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.800 
overtake me and Abby I give myself the
space<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:58.980> left<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.640> need<00:02:59.970> if<00:03:00.180> such<00:03:00.780> a

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
space to the left that I need if such a

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.020 
space to the left that I need if such a
case<00:03:01.080> as<00:03:01.260> this<00:03:01.410> happens<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.160> have<00:03:02.730> space<00:03:03.000> to

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
case as this happens I have space to

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.830 
case as this happens I have space to
move<00:03:03.270> to<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.540> left

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
move to the left

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.560 
move to the left
to<00:03:03.990> avoid<00:03:04.230> being<00:03:04.620> hit<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.820> luckily<00:03:06.270> I<00:03:06.300> did

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
to avoid being hit and luckily I did

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.520 
to avoid being hit and luckily I did
because<00:03:06.870> if<00:03:06.960> the<00:03:07.050> same<00:03:07.230> thing<00:03:07.410> had<00:03:07.500> happened

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
because if the same thing had happened

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.410 
because if the same thing had happened
when<00:03:08.130> I<00:03:08.220> was<00:03:08.310> this<00:03:08.550> far<00:03:08.610> away<00:03:08.910> from<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.240> curb

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
when I was this far away from the curb

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.410 
when I was this far away from the curb
I'd<00:03:10.320> be<00:03:10.650> absolutely<00:03:10.940> screwed<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.180> I<00:03:12.300> would

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
I'd be absolutely screwed and I would

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.210 
I'd be absolutely screwed and I would
have<00:03:12.510> probably<00:03:12.720> hit<00:03:12.960> a<00:03:12.990> lamppost<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.740> got

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
have probably hit a lamppost and got

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.650 
have probably hit a lamppost and got
hurt<00:03:14.370> really<00:03:14.550> bad<00:03:14.760> so<00:03:14.970> that's<00:03:15.060> not<00:03:15.240> good<00:03:15.450> so

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
hurt really bad so that's not good so

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.900

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
in before completing the overtake which

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.000 
in before completing the overtake which

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
is not very safe you don't do that on
