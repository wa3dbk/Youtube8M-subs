00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.210
 and now groups h 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.520
 gamer and cardo codeme kmart axel pixel 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.680
 jolie I will be a new steady-state video 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.000
 I think it has been shown by enough 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.820
 people on youtube 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.220
 I just for a matter of time this is not 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.980
 you can have it yesterday but already what 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.489
 I knew from yesterday this I am going to give 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.649
 credit to a show that is American 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:39.050
 I did not see it from anyone from mexico to 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.120
 Although they told me that they had already 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.000
 uploaded me because you owe the credit to the guy 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.140
 American that I do not remember the channel 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.370
 but if you find it I put it in the 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.809
 description of the video the only thing 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.789
 they have to do is grab the grenades 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.600
 I recommend putting pure pomegranate and 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.890
 throw the two here in this part 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.920
 right away they are going to drop a box 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.500
 of it almost broken worn out from a 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.820
 a person I think this is going to 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.590
 have history between the game because 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.149
 because that painting was already good 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.820
 we shoot the conflict is that as 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:10.520
 to see and this game is going to be turned on 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.740
 let's say blue that blue fire 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.390
 what is this is used a lot in the 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.659
 films of spiritual invocation and 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.840
 all that roll but well once 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.820
 already here we are going to go down and we are going to 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.069
 direct to the next step the stress 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.380
 all the vessels develop in 

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:29.539
 paintings in paintings of people 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.750
 Colonel sergeants and all outstanding 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.610
 the cg or which will shoot this 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.580
 another piece of paper that appears here below 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.590
 this box and we will see right away 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.950
 how good it already gave us I did not aim it but 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.860
 be in every time you shoot the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.230
 paint suffers a modification in this 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.420
 is in these cases in the majority there is a 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.360
 a bullet for example there they will see 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.450
 a bullet from his skull or there is a part his 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.840
 face not here half gets this one 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.189
 black what is this light but then 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.860
 well what we are going to do now is 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.780
 let's go up that part of the 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.729
 carrerita 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.679
 the new one goes to the next table 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.780
 It is not far away I recommend 4 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.600
 deprived and kill so many times can 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.000
 robot so that it does not interfere in that 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.230
 kill them do not get lost in the time of 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.970
 all ways if they kill them there is no 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.130
 problem can continue with interest 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.959
 without problems let's go in the 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.670
 box and we're going to shoot in many 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.620
 sometimes we put it there we see the 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.390
 evaluation in the skull in many 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.780
 chances are seen on the screen 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.370
 totally black but good thing is thing 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.470
 apart from the hysteria almost did not 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.569
 worry give a little suspense we 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.400
 we are going to direct to the tower this one 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.550
 and we are going here 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.290
 we go here and we shoot him 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.150
 and if you are going to put aside blacks and 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.560
 ready the sand does not matter so much and I 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.750
 I recommend equipping with the 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.040
 grenades because with the battle of with the 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.200
 epp and reaper that is going to have to 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.270
 then it goes a little 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.050
 complicated to me it takes me four or five 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:05.090
 sometimes kill him because I think I'm from 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.440
 the people who do not wait I'm going to 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.750
 attack then I was going to attack a lot to 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.790
 the one of dog and but it killed to me but then 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.990
 well here we see another picture of a colonel 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.900
 and here on the floor has voted a piece of paper 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:20.680
 also on screen experience and there what 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.430
 they are going to shoot ready that's all 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.650
 and once that's done we're going to address 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.530
 the last two paintings that are 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.769
 hidden inside that were the bookstore 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.750
 that they teach in the previous one and derek the 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:37.150
 voice right here from library the 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.219
 first the first of the last two is 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.379
 this character that looks like a mix that 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:44.260
 is an old man and advanced age 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:46.030
 emaciated and we shot him they will see the 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.620
 let's kill this good I'm going to 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.240
 kill this question bothering 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.220
 too 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.250
 well once finished we are missing 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.320
 do the rest of a painting which is going 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.380
 to be behind us very close 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:02.530
 we activated what was the district of 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:04.210
 last video we go in here and let's see 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.340
 this last painting this last painting 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.190
 let's find a paper back to 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.220
 background we shot him once I 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.370
 I made a mistake but once more 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.160
 completed and ready is what the 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.470
 stress now we can move forward 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:25.000
 we open the floodgate and we go 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:27.730
 until the area, well, this is not ok 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.710
 once done will appear on 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.390
 'pirri' for box as you see here for each 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.060
 one of the paintings and illuminates a circle 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:37.050
 blue is ready now it's going to come out 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.050
 the Constitution 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:50.680
 as they come out reading a small book 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:52.300
 it's like if they gave you the door to 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.249
 access then the only thing you have to 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.619
 to do is to shoot anywhere 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:59.020
 of the face and a bullet will appear there 

00:04:56.619 --> 00:05:00.729
 will bring you to transport a room where 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.050
 the 'pirri' pérez is enough as a type 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:07.839
 sanctuary and they're going to kill the stripper like 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.909
 come now he's going to kill you this even though they 

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:12.189
 I ordered the whole roll is very difficult to kill 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:13.839
 one almost does not die and what has the 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:15.490
 'pirri' pérez that of a puppy kills you 

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:17.889
 as in youtube to repeat it several 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.899
 times then avoid going to see all the 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.999
 bullets that I had to give but well and 

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:24.039
 we entered directly my recommendation for 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:26.499
 kill the fastest is to use grenades to 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:29.589
 full but while it has not fallen 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:32.409
 shoot him in what is this the skull and 

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:34.240
 the body the areas this upper half 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:36.339
 of the body to kill a little faster 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.630
 As you can see, we are going to shoot in the skull and 

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:40.940
 he is going to die 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.440
 so that's was all FBI list 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.180
