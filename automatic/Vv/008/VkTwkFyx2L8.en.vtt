 to advise the advise or the consultants because really direct 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.620
 To start a conversation 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.170
 As a botanist I only have favorite places there but technical ones 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.940
 Bertens "Of course, it's wonderful 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.600

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.320

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.940
 the and 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.550

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.550
 something that will be beautiful religious sets 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.880
 they are not always there 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.039
 HM but they have accepted that and percent are very understanding 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:20.769

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:12.419

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.589
