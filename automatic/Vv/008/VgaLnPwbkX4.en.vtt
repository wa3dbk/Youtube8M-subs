00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello to all of you are very many to 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.819
 ask me videos about my routine 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.259
 manicure so in this bonus video 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.210
 I will show you a little bit 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.280
 care and everything i do at mu 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.900
 mother as well as my nails can 40 of 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.849
 jump in and darty have to have a 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.210
 nice manicures and clean nails in 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.210
 healthy 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.820
 the first step is to withdraw his 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.220
 old polish so I buy the 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.840
 solvent in plates on pump of sierne 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.330
 so it's in the bvk stores 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.610
 lidl and then when I do not have any 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.470
 in the pump I put some solvent 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.910
 that I find at Leclerc the mark in 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.170
 health and the landmark mark and I find 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.809
 that he's fine because they 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.280
 remove quickly the varnish that of 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.690
 at lidl is very good too huh it's 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.360
 just that I do not want to buy back to 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.920
 every time a pump so with a 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.710
 post and solvent I clean the 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.120
 above and below the nails very 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.250
 important because you will see why 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.720
 after that I remove all my little ones 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.320
 exits from elsewhere you can see 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.699
 the tutorial in the notation that are displayed 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.769
 then once a week I get 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.629
 a little homemade care so for that I 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.220
 am going to make a scrub so there 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.800
 really nothing simpler I took 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.260
 and the basic recipe of honey oil 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.300
 and sugar so here I did not invent anything 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.250
 I mix everything all there is I'm going 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.380
 then apply it on my hands and 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.970
 massage your hands with it's really 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.070
 relaxing it smells good 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.360
 after you can of course add this 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.920
 you want in lemon juice 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.110
 rose water essential oils 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.590
 after you create your own 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.910
 mixture and want to keep in the fridge 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.680
 then rinse your hands with 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.600
 soap or not it depends if you like 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.570
 after the texture a little thanks of the oil 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.970
 on your hands then the hydration of 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.410
 mores so I'm a fanatic of 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.090
 hand cream so finally I you 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.800
 showed the one I like and that 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.060
 is the cream of the brand l air that 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.560
 I really like it because in fact it 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.120
 is odorless and so suddenly I am 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.620
 serve when I eat for example 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.840
 when I do not want to smell 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.580
 special on the hands there is also the 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.780
 Olive tree brand cream I love 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.820
 a lot because it is very liquid 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.230
 and she quickly enters the 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.730
 hands so this one I use it all 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.900
 time as soon as I wash my hands because 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.430
 that it is true that I have at all times the 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.020
 feeling of dry skin so I hate 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.700
 so this cream I put it to 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.290
 relationships all in less than ten times by 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.640
 day 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.810
 then there is cream alessandro he 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.789
 I must buy myself a big 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.160
 format because the smell is right but 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.840
 divine and then there is this little tube of 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.370
 cream that I was offered that is fair 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.810
 great I put it before bedtime because 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.940
 that she is very thick and very fat 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.470
 it really moisturizes thoroughly so 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.300
 then you have to clean and degrease 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.690
 before the manicure so either you go 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.920
 you have it yourself 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.840
 under the water with a soap like 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.180
 usually or with a spray 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.960
 disinfectant it also degreases 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.790
 it's alcohol-based 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.800
 we must not forget also the bottom of 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.480
 nails so generally I do not 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.820
 never my care that I showed you 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.560
 there scrubs the cream before laying 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.180
 varnish since you do not need fat 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.100
 before the nail polish of any does that 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.900
 I normally do it the day before and the 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.090
 next day I'm doing my nail polish so 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.160
 there I took a post and some alcohol and 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.390
 I fats my nails so that there 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.460
 really has no trace of fat 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.260
 then we will prepare the plate 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.390
 so I took this little regrowth 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.250
 polished glass cuticles that is really 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.330
 great so do not forget that all that 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.770
 I'm talking to you in the video it's a 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.600
 reference in the description 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.790
 so I refuse to have the critics 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.290
 he cuticles with the beveled tip and 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.240
 then I scratch them with the mouthpiece 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.530
 point in white its not bad but 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.940
 good I had already done there a few 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.300
 days so suddenly there are not 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.880
 a lot 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.230
 I brush then I pass a shot of 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.640
 evening folly to whiten them 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.440
 personally I do not make lemon 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.270
 because I saw that the dose and varnishes 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.190
 I put the lemon every week 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.960
 clear for nothing so I was going 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.670
 polished to whiten them with the blocks of 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.600
 the hand tami taylor and then this block 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.910
 black is to make them shine 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.020
 we then go to nail care 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.150
 so I use the mhave at the 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.920
 scientist it's a hardening actually 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.600
 it's a liquid that goes into the nail 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.280
 so I do not use them all year round 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.570
 you do not have to use it as a cure 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.280
 so for a few weeks 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.600
 I use the winter because my 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.100
 others are more fragile or in 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.660
 moment I do not know why they are 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.520
 break I have a lot of false nails 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.380
 so we apply from half 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.250
 long and let it evaporate 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.110
 liquid so then I go to step 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.090
 from the base so this is the basic poaching that 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.739
 I have been using for over five years a 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.940
 base that I really like because she 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.610
 is thick and she stays fine 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.380
 brilliant so I apply my base in 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.370
 a layer to dry them nothing good 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.590
 special 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.880
 but I also apply below 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.590
 the nail allows for good 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.269
 waterproofed for long nails 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.310
 like that when I do the dishes or 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.669
 my shower they do not become all in 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.410
 made 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.299
 in any case it's safe if I did not 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.190
 that but angles this case would really be 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.800
 much more often than usual to 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.750
 become everyone then we move on to 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.940
 the step of applying the varnish so 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.340
 I posed what their navy blue club 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.020
 so I put my nail polish on top I 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.120
 push up I draw I the 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.590
 pushes on the side and I push on 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.310
 the other side so it's in three or 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.500
 four times 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.910
 after each has his technique to ask 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.130
 the varnish ayia napa necessarily 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.560
 particular I leave these schemas 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.630
 first layer and then I apply the 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.100
 second layer 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.720
 do not forget to varnish the 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.680
 slice of nail for polish 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.720
 hold on longer 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.820
 then possibly with a brush 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.370
 because is rigid enough acetone game 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.810
 can clean what overflowed then 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.370
 when the manicure is really over 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.050
 so when you made the decor is 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.610
 put the top coat there I did not do 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.890
 because I close them and orchids in 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.810
 done after I apply dry as so 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.400
 it's a liquid that will allow you to 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.230
 dry the varnish faster but 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.550
 especially since there is nothing sticking 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.770
 over it's going to make a movie 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.630
 protector so no cat hair not 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.090
 trace of sheets no hair that gets 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.680
 glue and the ultimate finish it's him the 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.060
 cuticle so I learn it elevates 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.350
 cosmetics because they have fragrances 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.850
 who are super good then yellow to 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.190
 pour into this little bottle that I have 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.920
 taken on ali express and so I apply 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.970
 the drop of oil at the cuticle so this 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.890
 bottle it is convenient also for 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.540
 now the handbag so here is 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.090
 normally if you have a good top coat 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.010
 like for example the pocher nor manicure 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.610
 must dry in less than ten minutes 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.470
 must be dry 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.120
 here I hope this video re 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.500
