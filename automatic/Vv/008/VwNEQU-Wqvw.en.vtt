00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:27.979 
there's no or in here even though I'm

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:29.649 
there's no or in here even though I'm
not<00:06:28.009> a<00:06:28.159> minor<00:06:28.459> it's<00:06:28.759> pretty<00:06:28.939> easy<00:06:29.089> to<00:06:29.270> find

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:29.659 
not a minor it's pretty easy to find

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:36.519 
not a minor it's pretty easy to find
just<00:06:30.020> kind<00:06:30.229> of<00:06:30.289> laying<00:06:30.469> around<00:06:30.860> and<00:06:33.879> and<00:06:35.529> I

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:36.529 
just kind of laying around and and I

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:38.739 
just kind of laying around and and I
haven't<00:06:36.800> found<00:06:36.919> an<00:06:37.159> herb<00:06:37.339> node<00:06:37.610> to<00:06:38.330> pop<00:06:38.479> up<00:06:38.509> at

00:06:38.739 --> 00:06:38.749 
haven't found an herb node to pop up at

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:40.779 
haven't found an herb node to pop up at
all<00:06:38.899> so<00:06:39.229> I'm<00:06:39.439> guessing<00:06:39.649> right<00:06:40.009> now<00:06:40.069> it's<00:06:40.429> just

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:40.789 
all so I'm guessing right now it's just

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:43.779 
all so I'm guessing right now it's just
those<00:06:40.999> few<00:06:41.629> herbs<00:06:41.899> that<00:06:42.110> over<00:06:42.469> there<00:06:42.669> so<00:06:43.669> it's

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:43.789 
those few herbs that over there so it's

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:51.909 
those few herbs that over there so it's
