00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.860
 and good is all those comments and I 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.070
 I'm going to put the snyder 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.719
 oysters I'm without the class good voucher 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.070
 for the red camouflage in 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.179
 sniper that I think I told them that 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.179
 I liked them 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.150
 I like the peephole is with the sight of 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.860
 thermal vision because for this map the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.689
 part and more than anything because that 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.920
 sniper is pretty bad but 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.119
 clear as you already know that they have lowered the 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.140
 ballista as explained in the video of 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.579
 Yesterday 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:36.309

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.680
 here because if he wants to come, someone is 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.940
 good 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.519

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.210

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:45.210
 be calm 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.710
 they escape me there is one worth 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.949
 ah 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.949
 nobody around here would see this over here 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.360
 As you know, you know that it is realistic 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.119
 they have gone down so I have put this weapon 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.630
 just for putting me down here 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.630
 I have one 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.720

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:22.470
 I'm going to ask me that I ate two guys 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.470
 but with dad you look at nothing 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.850
 entities pleases out there to see what happens 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.290

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.040

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.770
 Here's one 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.880
 Not seen 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.880
 or in your head 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:59.110
 a calm man calm man 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:01.240
 It's worth all this here in the chest 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.190
 this week to see if I get a drop 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.540

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.640
 over here answer 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.700
 nothing in fact would say that it is the only one 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.950
 it's worth it 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:26.460
 you stay with him along with the water and the 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:29.540
 background someone not 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.540
 and now they are going to upload me 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:39.450

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:43.140

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.740

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.580

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.660
 it's worth 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.120
 and it 's here when more partners than me 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.599
 You have seen you are watching work I stay 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.599

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.600
 I only have bullets 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:23.870
 but it has cost me to be where they are 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:27.580

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.050

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.550
 being here recognizing people 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.100
 I see myself with the sniper that there is more 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.230

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.510
