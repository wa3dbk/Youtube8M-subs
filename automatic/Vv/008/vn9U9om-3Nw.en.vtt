00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.259
 the creatures that will be discussed now 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.440
 real strong men they can raise 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.439
 the subject is ten times heavier than them 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.470
 their own weight they build for themselves 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.670
 houses in which can live up to a million 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.830
 family members 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.720
 and they are very small ants in 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.300
 their lives are so surprising that 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.899
 scientists even came up with the whole science of 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.680
 ants 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.090
 she called the world mycology want 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.510
 Mikola become a world scale 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.410
 then let's solve one riddle from 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:50.809
 life of ants 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.809
 Whom ants feed and blow 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.460
 ants live in huge colonies 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.149
 every ant knows what he needs to do 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.879
 and where to be and everyone has their own 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:07.409
 from the profession of ants builders 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:11.380
 builds an anthill of soldiers and protect it 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.200
 nurses look after the grubs scouts 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.320
 explores new territories foragers 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.140
 gathers food and graze ant cows 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.259
 of course with our ancestors and ants not 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.840
 cope who does not graze to find 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.399
 the answer to this question let's watch 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.209
 for brands Lyali 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:34.299
 look inside the anthill home 

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:38.670
 the room of the nest is in the very 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:41.110
 bottom this royal chamber lives here 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.319
 founder of an ant colony 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:48.759
 queen every day she produces on 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:52.060
 light a few hundred denits and this is children's 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:55.149
 room here are eggs larvae and 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.420
 ant pupae are in an anthill 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.729
 barn where stored grain is stored in 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.649
 meat fruits and ants stack 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.340
 caterpillars and other prey 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:09.610
 and this is the bread here the ants are holding their 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.170
 dairy animals but now it's summer and everything 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.590
 herd grazing in pastures 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.160
 but the ant brought a drop of liquid 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.860
 like milk can follow him 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.270
 he will lead us to mysterious animals 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:29.030
 here they meet 3 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:32.480
 insect pests they suck the juice 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.630
 from the leaves of plants from this sap from 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.650
 makes sweet nourishing milk it 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:42.980
 call the pad work on this dairy 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.760
 the farm is fine-tuned to work here 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.470
 ants of different professions this shepherd he 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.280
 caring for boxes 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:55.220
 and in order to milk the key shepherd knock 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.030
 on it with its antennas and for 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.730
 gives a little go and the shepherd passes 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.580
 droplet transporter which has 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.920
 special goiter takes her to 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.250
 anthill from ladybirds 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:14.299
 and other predatory aphid insects guard 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.950
 guards scouts are looking for new colonies 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.500
 aphids 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.410
 when the flock eats all the leaves glue 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.739
 transferred to other pastures and so 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.560
 It continues all summer with the onset 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.709
 autumn cold glue carry in the anthill 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:35.480
 they spend the winter safely there 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:38.510
 give new offspring we only revealed 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.970
 one secret from the life of ants but these 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.489
 amazing insects ask scientists 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.060
 many riddles answers to them yet 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:50.600
 to find ask questions and 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.140
 study the world with the formula program 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.140
 crazy
