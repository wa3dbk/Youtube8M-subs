to to be that creative player in the
midfield<00:02:46.090> but<00:02:46.390> I<00:02:46.510> think<00:02:46.780> that's<00:02:47.019> the<00:02:47.140> only

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.920 
midfield but I think that's the only
thing<00:02:47.590> I<00:02:47.739> need<00:02:47.950> because<00:02:48.849> the<00:02:49.329> front<00:02:49.629> three

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
thing I need because the front three

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.809 
thing I need because the front three

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
will most likely create motionless stuff

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.599 
will most likely create motionless stuff
for<00:02:52.150> me<00:02:52.329> now<00:02:52.840> I<00:02:52.870> do<00:02:53.230> have<00:02:53.620> van<00:02:53.859> Basten<00:02:54.340> as<00:02:54.430> my

apart for your man iPad from gonna long
but<00:02:59.950> I<00:02:59.980> think<00:03:00.069> that'll<00:03:00.489> be<00:03:00.579> alright<00:03:00.909> on<00:03:01.480> the

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
but I think that'll be alright on the

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.080 
but I think that'll be alright on the
left<00:03:02.079> for<00:03:02.260> spy<00:03:02.500> we<00:03:02.620> do<00:03:02.709> have<00:03:02.829> to<00:03:02.950> pie<00:03:03.220> he<00:03:03.489> got<00:03:03.670> 13

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
left for spy we do have to pie he got 13

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.780 
left for spy we do have to pie he got 13
goals<00:03:04.329> and<00:03:04.599> three<00:03:05.230> assists<00:03:05.590> in<00:03:05.739> 19<00:03:06.159> games<00:03:06.489> and

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
goals and three assists in 19 games and

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.030 
goals and three assists in 19 games and
I<00:03:06.849> think<00:03:06.909> that's<00:03:07.239> is<00:03:07.480> and<00:03:08.140> it's<00:03:08.379> alright<00:03:08.769> in<00:03:08.950> my

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
I think that's is and it's alright in my

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.369 
I think that's is and it's alright in my
opinion<00:03:09.640> and<00:03:09.819> then<00:03:10.510> we<00:03:10.659> do<00:03:10.900> have<00:03:11.290> a<00:03:11.849> cuadrado

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
opinion and then we do have a cuadrado

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.050 
opinion and then we do have a cuadrado
for<00:03:14.379> my<00:03:14.470> previous<00:03:14.920> owners<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.640> previous

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
for my previous owners the previous

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.309 
for my previous owners the previous
owners<00:03:16.299> of<00:03:16.390> him<00:03:16.540> they<00:03:16.690> didn't<00:03:16.930> really<00:03:17.049> score

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
owners of him they didn't really score

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:18.870 
owners of him they didn't really score
many<00:03:17.500> goals<00:03:17.560> with<00:03:18.069> him<00:03:18.190> but<00:03:18.430> they<00:03:18.579> probably

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
many goals with him but they probably

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.819 
many goals with him but they probably
also<00:03:19.120> player<00:03:19.480> maybe<00:03:19.720> on<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:19.959> right<00:03:20.200> mid<00:03:20.440> spot<00:03:20.709> or

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
also player maybe on a right mid spot or

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.409 
also player maybe on a right mid spot or
something<00:03:21.130> like<00:03:21.250> that<00:03:21.340> I'm<00:03:21.669> testing<00:03:22.000> him<00:03:22.299> out

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:22.419 
something like that I'm testing him out

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:24.750 
something like that I'm testing him out
as<00:03:22.599> a<00:03:22.660> ride<00:03:23.049> forward<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:23.709> he's<00:03:24.220> linking<00:03:24.609> up

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
as a ride forward and he's linking up

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.490 
as a ride forward and he's linking up
woody<00:03:25.000> Bob<00:03:25.480> oh<00:03:25.780> yeah<00:03:26.680> 91<00:03:27.220> goals<00:03:27.489> in<00:03:27.669> 46<00:03:28.269> games

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
woody Bob oh yeah 91 goals in 46 games

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.869 
woody Bob oh yeah 91 goals in 46 games
for<00:03:29.500> those<00:03:29.650> who<00:03:29.889> played<00:03:30.129> won<00:03:30.310> it<00:03:30.400> before<00:03:30.489> me

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
for those who played won it before me

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.330 
for those who played won it before me
that's<00:03:31.060> a<00:03:31.239> lot<00:03:31.389> of<00:03:31.480> goals<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:32.109> he<00:03:32.919> might<00:03:33.099> be<00:03:33.310> a

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
that's a lot of goals and he might be a

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.830 
that's a lot of goals and he might be a
bit<00:03:33.549> of<00:03:33.639> a<00:03:33.700> sweaty<00:03:33.970> player<00:03:34.209> I<00:03:34.299> never<00:03:34.540> really

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
bit of a sweaty player I never really

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.140 
bit of a sweaty player I never really
used<00:03:35.049> him<00:03:35.260> on<00:03:35.290> FIFA<00:03:35.680> 14<00:03:35.980> but<00:03:36.579> I<00:03:36.609> kinda<00:03:36.910> wanted

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
used him on FIFA 14 but I kinda wanted

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.270 
used him on FIFA 14 but I kinda wanted
to<00:03:37.269> give<00:03:37.419> him<00:03:37.569> a<00:03:37.599> go<00:03:37.810> he<00:03:38.019> on<00:03:38.109> FIFA<00:03:38.440> 15<00:03:38.620> now<00:03:39.069> that

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
to give him a go he on FIFA 15 now that

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.550 
to give him a go he on FIFA 15 now that
he<00:03:39.370> does<00:03:39.639> have<00:03:39.819> five<00:03:40.090> stars<00:03:40.450> four<00:03:41.079> star<00:03:41.319> skills

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
he does have five stars four star skills

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.430 
he does have five stars four star skills
I<00:03:41.769> mean<00:03:41.950> and<00:03:42.220> he<00:03:42.639> links<00:03:42.970> nicely<00:03:43.690> up<00:03:43.930> with

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
I mean and he links nicely up with

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.830 
I mean and he links nicely up with
cuadrado<00:03:45.370> at<00:03:45.639> the<00:03:45.730> same<00:03:45.970> time<00:03:46.180> so<00:03:46.389> a<00:03:46.419> 40<00:03:46.750> would

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
cuadrado at the same time so a 40 would

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.990 
cuadrado at the same time so a 40 would
be<00:03:46.900> an<00:03:47.049> ideal<00:03:47.440> link<00:03:47.829> up<00:03:48.010> in<00:03:48.220> their<00:03:48.430> attack<00:03:48.760> and

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
be an ideal link up in their attack and

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.119 
be an ideal link up in their attack and
the<00:03:49.840> final<00:03:50.079> finger<00:03:50.290> actually<00:03:50.379> did<00:03:50.650> was<00:03:50.799> to<00:03:50.949> God

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.129 
the final finger actually did was to God

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.129 
the final finger actually did was to God
and<00:03:51.280> pick<00:03:51.489> up<00:03:51.699> and<00:03:52.000> manage<00:03:52.389> a<00:03:52.510> league<00:03:52.720> just<00:03:53.049> to

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139 
and pick up and manage a league just to

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:55.229 
and pick up and manage a league just to
get<00:03:53.319> as<00:03:53.470> many<00:03:53.680> players<00:03:54.010> as<00:03:54.160> possible<00:03:54.340> up<00:03:55.030> and

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
get as many players as possible up and

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.449 
get as many players as possible up and
10<00:03:55.510> chemistry<00:03:56.079> to<00:03:56.199> get<00:03:56.349> the<00:03:56.530> maximum<00:03:56.980> boost<00:03:57.190> to

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
10 chemistry to get the maximum boost to

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.759 
10 chemistry to get the maximum boost to
the<00:03:57.609> stats<00:03:57.910> and<00:03:58.169> apart<00:03:59.169> from<00:03:59.230> that<00:03:59.349> I<00:03:59.500> got

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
the stats and apart from that I got

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.740 
the stats and apart from that I got
ready<00:04:00.069> to<00:04:00.250> play<00:04:00.489> with<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:00.970> new<00:04:01.150> team<00:04:01.449> now<00:04:01.720> I

ready to play with the new team now I
wanted<00:04:02.079> to<00:04:02.139> test<00:04:02.440> it<00:04:02.590> out<00:04:02.709> just<00:04:03.010> to<00:04:03.190> feel<00:04:03.669> it

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
wanted to test it out just to feel it

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.430 
wanted to test it out just to feel it
out<00:04:03.910> and<00:04:03.970> see<00:04:04.150> how<00:04:04.419> it<00:04:04.449> played<00:04:04.810> so<00:04:05.049> I<00:04:05.079> decided

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
out and see how it played so I decided

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.720 
out and see how it played so I decided
to<00:04:05.530> go<00:04:05.680> into<00:04:05.799> the<00:04:05.949> champion<00:04:06.489> shield

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
opponent he was playing with a five at

opponent he was playing with a five at
the<00:04:12.549> back<00:04:12.910> and<00:04:13.209> then<00:04:13.299> just<00:04:13.480> relying<00:04:13.870> on<00:04:14.079> moose

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
the back and then just relying on moose

that's not a penalty I have no clue he
just<00:04:22.450> completely<00:04:23.070> blocked<00:04:24.070> off<00:04:24.250> my<00:04:24.310> player

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:24.849 
just completely blocked off my player

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:26.580 
just completely blocked off my player

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
chance to pie

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.690 
chance to pie
now<00:04:27.840> -<00:04:28.020> ah<00:04:28.230> cuadrado<00:04:28.680> his<00:04:28.950> world<00:04:29.220> but<00:04:29.400> he<00:04:29.550> would

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
now - ah cuadrado his world but he would

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.300 
now - ah cuadrado his world but he would
save<00:04:29.970> it<00:04:30.180> and<00:04:30.360> it<00:04:30.450> was<00:04:30.660> half<00:04:31.620> when<00:04:31.950> not<00:04:32.130> much

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
save it and it was half when not much

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.160 
save it and it was half when not much
stuff<00:04:32.610> happened<00:04:33.000> he<00:04:33.180> was<00:04:33.300> really<00:04:33.840> defensive

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
stuff happened he was really defensive

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.260 
stuff happened he was really defensive
and<00:04:34.620> then<00:04:35.370> just<00:04:35.610> relied<00:04:35.970> on<00:04:36.000> the

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
and then just relied on the

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.090 
and then just relied on the
counter-attacks<00:04:36.960> would<00:04:37.170> doom<00:04:37.380> be<00:04:37.530> and<00:04:37.680> Musa

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
counter-attacks would doom be and Musa

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.490 
counter-attacks would doom be and Musa
but<00:04:38.310> into<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.000> second<00:04:39.360> half<00:04:39.540> we'll<00:04:39.750> find<00:04:40.200> a

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
but into the second half we'll find a

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.130 
but into the second half we'll find a
Baba<00:04:41.160> with<00:04:41.430> a<00:04:41.460> drill<00:04:41.910> cross<00:04:42.240> into<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.600> box<00:04:42.720> and

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
relied on the counter-attacks and I felt

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.290 
relied on the counter-attacks and I felt
like<00:05:55.740> what<00:05:56.010> having<00:05:56.280> too<00:05:56.370> young<00:05:56.580> and<00:05:56.820> got<00:05:57.000> along

like what having too young and got along

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.660 
like what having too young and got along
in<00:05:57.540> the<00:05:57.840> in<00:05:58.050> the<00:05:58.170> midfield<00:05:58.350> they<00:05:59.280> were<00:05:59.340> kind<00:05:59.580> of

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.670 
in the in the midfield they were kind of

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.400 
in the in the midfield they were kind of
good<00:05:59.880> at<00:06:00.030> stopping<00:06:00.360> those<00:06:00.600> counter-attacks

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
good at stopping those counter-attacks

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.560

I thought of going into division two
with<00:06:05.460> them<00:06:05.640> but<00:06:05.820> then<00:06:06.090> I<00:06:06.120> thought<00:06:06.390> you<00:06:06.450> know

with them but then I thought you know
