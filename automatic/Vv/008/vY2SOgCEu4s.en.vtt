00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.690
 hello today we will tell about 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:10.320
 camshaft position sensors 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:12.540
 kalenvala these sensors are mounted on 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.160
 all engine with electronic system 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:20.300
 fuel supply sensor function 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.990
 is to determine the position 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.380
 camshaft calender 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.199
 at a certain point in time and transmission 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.080
 this information on the control computer 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.960
 engine control computer 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.399
 This information is required by the engine for 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.040
 calculation 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.800
 point in time in which it is necessary 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.660
 either feed fuel to the injector 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:49.670
 either spark a spark plug 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:53.960
 Consider the device position sensor 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:58.500
 crankshaft least toyota narrow sensor 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.780
 there is a body part of the body is made of 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.930
 metal to increase the mechanical 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.140
 the strength of the sensor part of the body 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.580
 made of plastic 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.270
 there is a rubber sealing ring 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.950
 which take away the places of contact 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.200
 sensor 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.060
 engine sound to prevent 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:23.369
 engine oil leaks out 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:27.869
 also has fastener steal 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.909
 mounting hole for sensor bolt 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.729
 there is an electrical wire at the end 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:40.170
 which has a connector for 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:41.880
 connecting to the wiring of the car is 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:47.280
 sensor manufactured by 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:50.790
 nissan design is different sensor itself 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.149
 slightly smaller full body 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.280
 made of plastic unchanged 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.990
 the element is a sealing gum 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.210
 ear hooks with bolt hole and 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.930
 connector for wiring 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.989
 car when triggered this 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.400
 sensor on the dashboard lights up 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.000
 malfunction indicator light 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.000
 engine 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.310
 this can happen either 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.310
 using low-quality fuel 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:27.700
 either talking about the output of this sensor from 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.860
 building up with this breakdown 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.580
 usually car save 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.860
 ability to move but on some 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.760
 computer models can translate 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.170
 engine boiled mode at which 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.100
 the engine will not develop the necessary 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.430
 power increases fuel consumption 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:51.300
 The cost of new sensors is 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.770
 about 2000 rubles 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.810
 sensor repair in our opinion 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.690
 impossible in artisanal conditions 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.250
 so the only way to solve 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:05.850
 problems is sensor replacement 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.850
 Thanks for attention
