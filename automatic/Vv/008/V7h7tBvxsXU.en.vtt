gerbil then another in and out if I'm

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.720 
gerbil then another in and out if I'm
going<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.389> do<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.599> attack<00:00:16.020> towards<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.130> at<00:00:17.520> an

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
angle actually going kind of towards the

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.349 
angle actually going kind of towards the
corner<00:00:19.830> so<00:00:20.070> it's<00:00:20.160> more<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.430> an<00:00:20.550> escape<00:00:20.939> dribble

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
up as I met about a 45 degree angle

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.950

before<00:00:25.980> i<00:00:26.220> get<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.670> baseline<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.480> go<00:00:27.689> off

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960
