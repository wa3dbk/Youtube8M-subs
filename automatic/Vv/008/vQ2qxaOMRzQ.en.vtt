00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.759
 and hello to all this hitch machine and 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.200
 we are today for a 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.269
 new video that will show you 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.340
 how to remove the slowdown on 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.930
 iphone ipad or ipod touch 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.760
 so in this video I will take 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.560
 for example the iphone so will not be anymore 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.449
 a port everyone but know that 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.189
 all the possibilities that I'm going 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.630
 data are also available on 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.699
 ipad or ipod touch 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.969
 so she'll start right now 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.660
 with an iphone not jailbroken so the 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.399
 first option 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.500
 it's the reboot so to make a 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.690
 reboot you just have to maintain the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.930
 home &amp; power button at the same time 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.079
 until the iphone go off then 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.570
 until the apple ray appears 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.280
 so we have another option then 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.840
 it's going to go into the settings so of 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.710
 ipad ipad or ipod touch 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.440
 to go then in general here I am the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.780
 do at the same time reset so 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.210
 it's all the way down and you have 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.710
 reset all the settings so that 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.020
 will not erase your contacts it's born that 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.130
 will not erase your photos that removes 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.790
 will have wifi networks and all the content 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.470
 superfluous 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.390
 so you can always try that 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.240
 costs you nothing and the last option 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.009
 for a non jailbroken iphone that 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.390
 slows down it's of course the restoration 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.759
 so the restoration that remains the 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.060
 best method so then we go 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.619
 to jailbroken iphones so all 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.180
 hints already that they have been cited for 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.890
 the iphone eat lighter are valid 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.659
 so you can do them for the iphone 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.710
 jailbroken 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.329
 after there are other options so he has 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.409
 for example the uninstallation of 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.659
 cydia applications 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.630
 so you have installed for example too 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.340
 of the cydia app and well you have 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.720
 just to uninstall them so it's okay 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.770
 take a lot of time because you 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.740
 have to go one by one 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.420
 but you will still win a lot 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.920
 availability at the memory level of 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.470
 your iphone 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.040
 we then have their minds neg so their 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.380
 mind with the sbsetting app so 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.790
 an application obviously of cydia 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.560
 which will allow you to risk your 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.170
 iphone so what is their mind 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.030
 their mind is the restart of 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.400
 your screen the water that solves 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.190
 some bugs or slowdowns so the 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.260
 sbsetting video would 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.860
 available in the description for that 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.680
 you can see a little use 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.570
 and as the last solution we have to 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.580
 customization so for example you have 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.080
 customize your iphone you have 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.550
 installed themes all that slows down 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.080
 a lot so what I advise you 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.240
 it's to uninstall them on cydia or 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.490
 uninstall winterboard no thurber 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.740
 10 who reinstalled the themes 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.560
 so you uninstall it and you will 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.630
 no more problems normally so 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.370
 so here in all these solutions there 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.190
 what I advise you is the 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.200
 restoration via itunes so that's 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.480
 net clear and accurate and you will have a 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.840
 iphone that starts from scratch in some 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.970
 kind 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.650
 so here it was at koumassi do not hesitate 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.270
