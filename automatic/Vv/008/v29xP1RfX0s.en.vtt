try informed avid video or the moon

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.649 
try informed avid video or the moon
would<00:01:53.009> have<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.310> via<00:01:53.490> because<00:01:53.790> they<00:01:54.180> are<00:01:54.360> both

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
would have it via because they are both

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.660 
would have it via because they are both
really<00:01:55.140> good<00:01:55.560> at<00:01:55.680> free<00:01:55.890> kicks<00:01:56.159> they're<00:01:56.460> very

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
easy to score them also he feels much

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.219 
easy to score them also he feels much
stronger<00:01:59.280> than<00:01:59.490> 70<00:02:00.030> strength<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.540> my<00:02:00.780> opinion

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
stronger than 70 strength in my opinion

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.709 
stronger than 70 strength in my opinion
when<00:02:01.740> when<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.299> defenders<00:02:03.299> are<00:02:03.360> trying<00:02:03.659> to

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
when when the defenders are trying to

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.240 
when when the defenders are trying to
shove<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.020> off<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.259> ball<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.829> could<00:02:04.979> just

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
shove you off the ball you could just

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.100 
shove you off the ball you could just
dribble<00:02:05.579> past<00:02:05.850> them<00:02:06.090> or<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.630> could<00:02:06.780> try<00:02:06.990> and

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
dribble past them or you could try and

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.080 
dribble past them or you could try and
out<00:02:07.290> power<00:02:07.680> yourself<00:02:08.160> because<00:02:08.670> he<00:02:08.849> is

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
out power yourself because he is

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.630 
out power yourself because he is
certainly<00:02:09.629> stronger<00:02:10.229> than<00:02:10.379> 70<00:02:11.069> strength<00:02:11.400> and

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
certainly stronger than 70 strength and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.340 
certainly stronger than 70 strength and
he<00:02:12.060> also

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
he also

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.780 
he also
my<00:02:13.410> opinion<00:02:13.830> just<00:02:13.860> seems<00:02:14.400> like<00:02:14.520> he's<00:02:14.760> a

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
my opinion just seems like he's a

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.390 
my opinion just seems like he's a
completely<00:02:15.150> wink<00:02:16.080> forward<00:02:16.710> if<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:17.040> wanted<00:02:17.220> to

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
completely wink forward if you wanted to

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.830 
completely wink forward if you wanted to
if<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.700> want<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:17.940> use<00:02:18.060> them<00:02:18.180> as<00:02:18.270> a<00:02:18.300> striker<00:02:18.810> I

if you want to use them as a striker I

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.360 
if you want to use them as a striker I

don't know you could sobbing woman as a

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.250 
don't know you could sobbing woman as a
