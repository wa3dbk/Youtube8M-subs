onto your cuticles you let it sit for a
few<00:03:23.519> seconds<00:03:23.880> usually<00:03:24.540> I<00:03:24.569> find<00:03:24.780> that<00:03:25.530> by<00:03:25.709> the

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
few seconds usually I find that by the

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.039 
few seconds usually I find that by the
time<00:03:26.040> you've<00:03:26.430> squeezed<00:03:26.970> it<00:03:27.090> on<00:03:27.209> all<00:03:27.419> 10

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
it on for 15 seconds so by that time 15

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.580 
it on for 15 seconds so by that time 15
seconds<00:03:32.250> will<00:03:32.400> have<00:03:32.579> elapsed<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.750> then<00:03:34.019> you

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
seconds will have elapsed and then you

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.009 
seconds will have elapsed and then you

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
essentially is something awesome this

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.470 
essentially is something awesome this
one<00:03:53.099> i<00:03:53.129> think<00:03:53.370> i<00:03:53.549> got<00:03:53.669> it<00:03:53.819> for<00:03:53.879> about<00:03:54.000> seven

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
one i think i got it for about seven

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.470 
one i think i got it for about seven
bucks<00:03:54.660> but<00:03:55.109> this<00:03:55.260> is<00:03:55.379> gonna<00:03:55.500> last<00:03:55.709> forever

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
bucks but this is gonna last forever

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.089 
bucks but this is gonna last forever
because<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:58.049> really<00:03:58.410> don't<00:03:58.560> need<00:03:58.769> very<00:03:58.980> much

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
because you really don't need very much

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.159

is what is called a ridge filler and it

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.120 
is what is called a ridge filler and it
is

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
is

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.800 
is
it<00:04:26.280> leaves<00:04:26.430> a<00:04:26.550> smooth<00:04:26.790> base<00:04:27.060> so<00:04:27.300> that<00:04:27.330> you<00:04:27.630> can

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
it leaves a smooth base so that you can

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.480 
it leaves a smooth base so that you can
put<00:04:28.050> on<00:04:28.230> your<00:04:28.320> nail<00:04:28.800> polish<00:04:29.100> and<00:04:29.130> it<00:04:29.310> dries

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
put on your nail polish and it dries

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.080 
put on your nail polish and it dries
matte<00:04:29.850> um<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:31.200> it<00:04:31.530> dries<00:04:31.740> in<00:04:32.010> almost<00:04:32.340> seconds

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
matte um and it dries in almost seconds

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.420 
matte um and it dries in almost seconds
and<00:04:33.810> it's<00:04:34.200> I<00:04:34.500> think<00:04:34.620> it's<00:04:34.920> really<00:04:35.190> worth<00:04:35.220> it

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
and it's I think it's really worth it

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.500 
and it's I think it's really worth it
because<00:04:35.520> it<00:04:35.700> does<00:04:35.850> make<00:04:36.030> your<00:04:36.180> nails<00:04:36.360> stay

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
because it does make your nails stay

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.270 
because it does make your nails stay
longer<00:04:36.750> especially<00:04:37.080> I<00:04:37.620> don't<00:04:37.920> have<00:04:38.010> super

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
longer especially I don't have super

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.860 
longer especially I don't have super
bumpy<00:04:38.580> nails<00:04:38.790> but<00:04:38.940> at<00:04:39.030> the<00:04:39.120> end<00:04:39.150> of<00:04:39.480> your<00:04:39.630> nails

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
bumpy nails but at the end of your nails

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.480 
bumpy nails but at the end of your nails
if<00:04:40.110> you<00:04:40.200> have<00:04:40.380> some<00:04:40.560> chips<00:04:40.770> or<00:04:41.010> some<00:04:41.160> cracks

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
if you have some chips or some cracks

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.750 
if you have some chips or some cracks
and<00:04:41.820> it<00:04:42.660> fills<00:04:43.170> those<00:04:43.350> up<00:04:43.560> so<00:04:43.770> that<00:04:43.980> when<00:04:44.640> you

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
and it fills those up so that when you

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.400
