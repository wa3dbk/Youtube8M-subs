00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.069 
modding but you should know how to do
this<00:01:41.850> if<00:01:42.030> you're<00:01:42.119> done<00:01:42.270> modding<00:01:42.570> but

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
this if you're done modding but

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.230 
this if you're done modding but
basically<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.649> have<00:01:43.799> one<00:01:44.040> file<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.610> that

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
basically you have one file and that

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.380 
basically you have one file and that
should<00:01:45.600> be<00:01:45.689> called<00:01:45.899> 1.7.9<00:01:46.890> if<00:01:47.369> it's<00:01:47.939> not<00:01:48.149> it

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
should be called 1.7.9 if it's not it

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.789 
should be called 1.7.9 if it's not it
means<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.750> don't<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.170> latest<00:01:49.320> version

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
means you don't have the latest version

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.310 
means you don't have the latest version
of<00:01:49.860> Minecraft<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.689> just<00:01:51.840> want<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.020> go<00:01:52.140> into

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.870 
of Minecraft so you just want to go into
Minecraft<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.979> then<00:01:53.130> just<00:01:53.340> run<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.700> latest

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880
