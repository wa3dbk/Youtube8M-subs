00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.410
 General Frost pretty patted in Europe 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.920
 last week except news from 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.590
 series 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.170
 it's unusual for example some kind of frozen 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.270
 danube hay and venice canals reported on 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.600
 hundreds of casualties and in the south of Russia 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.460
 walked in Astrakhan happened over -30 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.960
 damage from the ice hurricane Kuban 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.390
 It is estimated at hundreds of millions of rubles and 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.340
 because someone in such weather conditions 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.619
 also works Sergey khoroshevsky 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.930
 making your way to the treasures of the north talked 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.969
 with the watch for centuries of the 21st century and found out why 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.800
 Today that Stalin did not work 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.750
 these sturdy guys stand in line for 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.910
 order to get into the right car 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.360
 which goes to the extreme north 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.370
 while I was shooting there where alcohol gas is not 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.530
 place in all fields harsh 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.680
 Prohibition violate which no one 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.489
 decides otherwise job loss and early 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.489
 homecoming 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.170
 from the station at pskov to gas 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.050
 Bovanenkovo field two nights and 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.070
 one day journey request remark 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.070
 will be happy 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.220
 due to 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.720
 because we are building earth lines 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.790
 roadbed still port 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.640
 so far north by rail 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.530
 no one had called in earlier rails 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.240
 these places were laid by order 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.880
 Stalin then were Komsomol construction 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.580
 only now labor exploits accomplish 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.950
 based on the economic need for 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.220
 what is the northernmost iron 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.140
 the road in the world is believed immediately irrevocably 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.080
 not all not even work here 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:52.550
 breathing is sometimes hard underfoot forever 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.140
 permafrost around endless tundra first 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.000
 an attempt to lay the railway for 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.950
 the polar circle undertook in all 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.550
 peoples in the forty-seventh year the second 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.369
 attempt happened 40 years later in 1986 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.590
 Komsomol brigades worked 10 years 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.240
 build managed two hundred twenty four 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.700
 kilometer but then it happened again 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.820
 unforeseen restructuring ruined on 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.110
 the root of all the Komsomol construction of the country 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.240
 Komsomol members now and the romantics 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.830
 in our time it is very difficult to find them 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:25.160
 have given way to pragmatists here 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.830
 what kind of work does he use as a carpenter sling 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.250
 I know the installer no matter where he himself 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.010
 bonfire and thunder photo 67 minutes ten 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.890
 thousand per month in the north and those people 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.080
 will be able to earn an order of magnitude more than 13 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.580
 poppies first time arrived 45 years old 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.590
 back when the barracks were still there 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.050
 wooden and the water is dark brown 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.269
 colors and and no one cleared but so the data 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.270
 and little things didn't pay attention when I 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.070
 was young 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.010
 I was not going to earn money 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.980
 at the union house youth excitement more 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.260
 I want to give more peace in this car 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.870
 the landscape outside the window does not change during 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:06.870
 all the way tundra things will see there 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.870
 luring 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.730
 again the decision to continue construction 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.350
 this road was taken 2005 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.120
 based solely on practical 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.760
 gas considerations in the north of the peninsula 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.650
 there is but to get to it is very difficult 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.650
 navigation lasts only a month and a half 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.630
 summer weather in Yamal as a gift from heaven 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.610
 Alexander Marynchuk tells us how 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.040
 cargo for new fields at first 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.920
 brought to the north pretty 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.810
 convoluted way the cargo was loaded here in 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.480
 labytnangi 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.480
 mean then he is on forever by then 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.340
 walked across the sea means delivered 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.740
 kind him the Kursk field and 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.410
 from there already transported by car 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.150
 directly to construction sites 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.390
 on this way around the peninsula Yamal 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.520
 It took about a month and then all molly 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.410
 fettered the ice and had to count 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.600
 only on trucks that were making their way 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.250
 to the north along winter roads so 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.320
 the only way out was building 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.870
 railway which would cut 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.290
 delivery of goods from one month to one and a half 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.110
 days 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.000
 scientists from 42 research 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.550
 institutions puzzled over how 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.470
 make the road reliable as a result 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.959
 embankment get warm themselves this road has become 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.600
 similar to puff cake on permafrost 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.970
 ground and the fact of dry frozen sand 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.430
 pushes the geotextile clip 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.500
 a layer is used as insulation 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.600
 styrofoam and top it all 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.030
 covered with rocky soil plus 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.100
 geogrid on the slopes and all this in order 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.450
 to make a subgrade bask 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.730
 not 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.650
 motionless freezing which is located 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.230
 the upper tundra we have to climb 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.750
 in the ground but the canvas go in there is not 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.850
 risk of freezing in this way 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.640
 railroad in the world no one else 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.130
 built however and it is not cheap it 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.460
 more expensive to much more expensive than others here 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.350
 no any construction beyond polar 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.790
 a pile of piles begins around 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.790
 otherwise nothing can stand 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:11.410
 all construction exclusively in winter 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.410
 however years and here the concept of conditional 

00:05:12.489 --> 00:05:15.489
 this 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.410
 600 kilometers of 70 most bridges 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.889
 the long ones here are this bridge over the river 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.870
 Juribe is almost 4 kilometers and 30 thousand tons 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:33.060
 steel structure built it in 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.400
 record time in less than a year and for now 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.370
 it is the longest bridge in the world behind 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.050
 polar circle machinist here in the final 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.880
 from the train if they cross the road 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.440
 herds of deer or a local resident suddenly 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.780
 asked for a ride to the next station 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.520
 arrows translate manually because 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.030
 electronics does not stand low 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.030
 temperatures 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:58.600
 last year reached 60 degrees 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:02.050
 of course then there is no wind but 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:07.180
 60 degrees say metallophone pipe 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:09.160
 glass and people are people against holding 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.750
 a few years after 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.849
 rails reached Bovanenkovo 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:17.309
 deposits in the tundra grew a whole city 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:19.080
 total mentally nothing was now 

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:22.800
 according to various sources live and work here 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:26.789
 up to 15,000 shift workers from all over Russia without 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:29.069
 railway we basically could not 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:31.589
 this build of this building is assigned a code 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:33.449
 001 as the gas workers say she is the first in 

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:35.639
 the country in the summer gas from here will go to 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:40.589
 north european gas pipeline in the meantime here 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:43.529
 working day and night drilling 

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:45.419
 change on Catherine so called here 50 

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:49.019
 4 meter tower from Yekaterinburg 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:53.330
 Lasts 12 hours without a break without any 

00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:53.330
 discounts on harsh northern conditions 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.300
 this gas according to experts 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:03.500
 enough for the next 50 years 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:06.270
 then you have to go further north 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:14.280
 for some reason I like the way 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:15.450
 watch trains and watch the future when 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.810
 i look back 

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:24.330
 it seems to me that I no longer have this 

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:27.890
 I'll see the future, everything will be fine 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.890
 depend on us on the people themselves
