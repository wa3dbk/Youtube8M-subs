00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
foaming on the whole surface and if you

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.030 
foaming on the whole surface and if you
tilt<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.770> pan<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.579> looks<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> thick<00:01:30.600> syrup

we<00:01:32.040> are<00:01:32.220> done<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.520> let's<00:01:33.060> turn<00:01:33.210> off<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.450> heat

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
we are done so let's turn off the heat

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.530 
we are done so let's turn off the heat
and<00:01:34.640> strain<00:01:35.640> through<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.119> fine<00:01:36.540> mesh<00:01:36.570> sieve<00:01:38.540> you

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
and strain through a fine mesh sieve you

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.749 
and strain through a fine mesh sieve you
should<00:01:39.810> end<00:01:39.960> up<00:01:40.110> with<00:01:40.170> about<00:01:40.470> 3/4<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.490> cup<00:01:41.520> of

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
should end up with about 3/4 of a cup of

once cooled transfer the v-cut dough in

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.980 
once cooled transfer the v-cut dough in
