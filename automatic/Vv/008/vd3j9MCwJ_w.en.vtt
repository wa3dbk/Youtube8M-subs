00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.109 
like it's just a mild clean smell
another<00:01:58.890> thing<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.219> really<00:01:59.520> stood<00:01:59.909> out<00:02:00.060> I

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
another thing that really stood out I

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.899 
another thing that really stood out I
mean<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.540> being<00:02:00.840> great<00:02:01.170> or<00:02:01.469> being<00:02:02.250> too<00:02:02.520> bad

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
mean is being great or being too bad

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.410 
mean is being great or being too bad
either<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:04.320> one<00:02:04.500> on<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.829> right

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
either the one on the right

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.609 
either the one on the right
the<00:02:06.380> Neutrogena<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:08.110> didn't<00:02:09.110> really<00:02:09.440> like<00:02:09.590> it

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
the Neutrogena I didn't really like it

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.850 
the Neutrogena I didn't really like it
so<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.160> blue<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:11.030> blue<00:02:11.209> facewash<00:02:11.540> is<00:02:12.140> heavily

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
so the blue the blue facewash is heavily

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.000 
so the blue the blue facewash is heavily
menthol<00:02:13.640> scented<00:02:14.360> but<00:02:15.020> it's<00:02:15.260> blue<00:02:15.590> it<00:02:15.980> has

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
menthol scented but it's blue it has

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.850 
menthol scented but it's blue it has
like<00:02:16.459> a<00:02:16.490> little<00:02:16.610> bit<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.850> a<00:02:16.940> cooling<00:02:17.530> feel<00:02:18.530> to

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
like a little bit of a cooling feel to

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.240 
like a little bit of a cooling feel to
it<00:02:19.010> when<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:19.880> when<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.560> apply<00:02:21.560> it<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:22.160> your

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
it when you when you apply it to your

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.910 
it when you when you apply it to your
skin<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:23.120> also<00:02:23.510> when<00:02:23.959> you're<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:27.890> know

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.650 
skin and also when you're you know
really<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.430> smell<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:28.820> guess<00:02:29.270> is<00:02:29.420> what<00:02:29.570> I'm

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
really the smell I guess is what I'm

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.020 
really the smell I guess is what I'm
saying<00:02:29.870> here<00:02:30.200> is<00:02:30.230> really<00:02:30.890> menthol<00:02:31.700> II<00:02:31.730> I

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
saying here is really menthol II I

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.970 
saying here is really menthol II I
didn't<00:02:32.660> really<00:02:32.870> love<00:02:32.989> it<00:02:33.050> too<00:02:33.320> much<00:02:33.500> it<00:02:33.770> was<00:02:33.950> a

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
didn't really love it too much it was a

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.070 
didn't really love it too much it was a
little<00:02:34.489> too<00:02:34.640> mentally<00:02:34.819> on<00:02:35.209> a<00:02:35.330> lot<00:02:35.569> of<00:02:35.600> counts

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
little too mentally on a lot of counts

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.590

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
wash that's you know the same color and

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.990 
wash that's you know the same color and
the<00:03:44.390> same<00:03:45.220> product<00:03:46.220> basically<00:03:46.370> so<00:03:46.700> these<00:03:46.820> are

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
the same product basically so these are

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.670 
the same product basically so these are
competitors<00:03:47.540> these<00:03:48.170> are<00:03:48.290> not<00:03:48.440> like

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
competitors these are not like

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.140 
competitors these are not like
consecutive<00:03:49.280> products<00:03:49.640> within<00:03:49.880> the<00:03:49.970> same

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
consecutive products within the same

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.880 
consecutive products within the same
product<00:03:50.480> line<00:03:50.600> but<00:03:50.810> I<00:03:50.989> think<00:03:51.410> it<00:03:51.470> gives<00:03:51.560> you<00:03:51.769> an

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
product line but I think it gives you an

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.100 
product line but I think it gives you an
idea<00:03:52.190> of<00:03:52.549> what's<00:03:53.090> going<00:03:53.269> on<00:03:53.450> with<00:03:53.630> each<00:03:53.780> so

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110
