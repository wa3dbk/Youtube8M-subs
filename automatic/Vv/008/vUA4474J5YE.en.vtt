00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
machine is actually frozen it's the skin

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.350 
machine is actually frozen it's the skin
itself<00:01:12.409> remains<00:01:12.860> soft<00:01:13.159> and<00:01:13.430> supple<00:01:13.610> but<00:01:14.150> the

sensation how are you doing so far while

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.590 
sensation how are you doing so far while
it<00:01:24.770> removes<00:01:25.159> the<00:01:25.399> fad<00:01:25.640> it<00:01:25.909> doesn't<00:01:25.939> tighten

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
it removes the fad it doesn't tighten

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.840 
it removes the fad it doesn't tighten
the<00:01:26.810> skin<00:01:27.079> or<00:01:27.289> help<00:01:27.469> with<00:01:27.649> weight<00:01:27.829> loss<00:01:27.890> but<00:01:28.670> it

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
the skin or help with weight loss but it

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.359 
the skin or help with weight loss but it
will<00:01:29.090> kill<00:01:29.600> fat<00:01:30.140> cells<00:01:30.469> that<00:01:30.710> freeze<00:01:31.070> at

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
will kill fat cells that freeze at

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.300 
will kill fat cells that freeze at
higher<00:01:31.520> temperatures<00:01:32.649> basically<00:01:33.649> kills<00:01:34.009> them

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
higher temperatures basically kills them

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.099 
higher temperatures basically kills them
and<00:01:34.640> they<00:01:34.729> become<00:01:35.030> naturally<00:01:35.569> eliminated

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:36.109 
and they become naturally eliminated

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:38.260 
and they become naturally eliminated
from<00:01:36.200> your<00:01:36.380> body<00:01:36.649> while<00:01:37.520> allowing<00:01:37.969> the

muscle to be left alone remove the air

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:45.700 
muscle to be left alone remove the air
and<00:01:43.579> you<00:01:43.789> can<00:01:43.909> see<00:01:44.149> it<00:01:44.329> looks<00:01:44.450> like<00:01:44.749> a<00:01:44.780> frozen

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
and you can see it looks like a frozen

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.969 
and you can see it looks like a frozen
stick<00:01:46.189> of<00:01:46.340> butter<00:01:46.609> the<00:01:47.389> area<00:01:47.840> is<00:01:47.899> massaged<00:01:48.530> to
