waiting<00:01:57.960> for<00:01:58.320> breeding<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:59.219> know<00:01:59.310> waiting

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
waiting for breeding you know waiting

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.830 
waiting for breeding you know waiting
for<00:01:59.759> them<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.000> regenerate<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.450> easy<00:02:00.659> for

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
for them to regenerate so easy for

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.929 
for them to regenerate so easy for
breeding<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.680> after<00:02:02.070> we<00:02:02.189> hatched<00:02:02.399> these<00:02:02.729> five

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
breeding so after we hatched these five

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.840 
breeding so after we hatched these five
eggs<00:02:03.240> which<00:02:04.229> I'll<00:02:04.380> show<00:02:04.560> right<00:02:04.710> now<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:05.130> want<00:02:05.790> to

four Oh power you know spinny or you

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.569 
four Oh power you know spinny or you
know<00:03:07.870> region<00:03:08.260> then<00:03:08.799> this<00:03:09.250> doesn't<00:03:09.400> really

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
know region then this doesn't really

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.580 
know region then this doesn't really
matter<00:03:09.849> but<00:03:10.180> on<00:03:10.450> any<00:03:10.720> other<00:03:10.930> day<00:03:11.170> but<00:03:11.200> I<00:03:11.440> only

matter but on any other day but I only
have<00:03:11.739> one<00:03:12.239> o'clock<00:03:13.239> um<00:03:13.540> this<00:03:14.290> will<00:03:14.379> matter<00:03:14.530> a

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
have one o'clock um this will matter a

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.710 
have one o'clock um this will matter a
lot<00:03:14.859> because<00:03:15.159> this<00:03:15.519> would<00:03:15.760> not<00:03:15.909> be<00:03:15.970> full<00:03:16.389> and

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.059 
hatch eggs now why made this method was
to<00:03:22.569> make<00:03:22.750> legitimately<00:03:23.169> faster<00:03:23.799> well<00:03:24.040> I

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
to make legitimately faster well I

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:25.710 
to make legitimately faster well I
didn't<00:03:24.340> make<00:03:24.639> it<00:03:24.700> I<00:03:24.910> just<00:03:25.090> kind<00:03:25.239> of<00:03:25.269> found<00:03:25.450> out

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
didn't make it I just kind of found out

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.629 
didn't make it I just kind of found out
myself<00:03:25.870> and<00:03:26.440> it<00:03:26.500> was<00:03:26.620> you<00:03:26.709> know<00:03:26.829> trial<00:03:27.459> there

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
myself and it was you know trial there

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.300 
myself and it was you know trial there
and<00:03:27.940> I<00:03:28.030> found<00:03:28.419> out<00:03:28.599> this<00:03:28.930> method<00:03:29.620> is<00:03:29.950> a<00:03:29.980> lot

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
and I found out this method is a lot

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.470 
and I found out this method is a lot
faster<00:03:30.549> than<00:03:30.819> the<00:03:30.910> other<00:03:31.090> one<00:03:31.209> and<00:03:31.329> I've

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
faster than the other one and I've

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.539 
faster than the other one and I've
gotten<00:03:32.290> a<00:03:32.500> lot<00:03:32.530> of<00:03:32.709> results<00:03:33.220> from<00:03:33.310> this

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
gotten a lot of results from this

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.759 
gotten a lot of results from this
actually<00:03:33.849> and<00:03:34.359> I<00:03:35.019> will<00:03:35.169> show<00:03:35.379> you<00:03:35.440> them<00:03:35.739> right

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
actually and I will show you them right

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.319 
actually and I will show you them right
now

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.839 

something<00:03:40.329> I<00:03:40.480> may<00:03:40.780> add<00:03:41.079> while<00:03:41.530> I<00:03:41.769> here<00:03:42.489> is<00:03:42.639> that

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
something I may add while I here is that

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.849 
something I may add while I here is that
if<00:03:43.269> you<00:03:43.449> do<00:03:43.569> this<00:03:43.720> method<00:03:43.900> you<00:03:44.139> will<00:03:44.290> have<00:03:44.500> PC

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
if you do this method you will have PC

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.030 
if you do this method you will have PC
boxes<00:03:45.250> full<00:03:45.459> of<00:03:45.730> bread<00:03:46.900> mine<00:03:47.139> um<00:03:47.319> I<00:03:47.799> mean

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
boxes full of bread mine um I mean

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.229 
boxes full of bread mine um I mean
bread<00:03:48.220> behind<00:03:48.489> me<00:03:48.609> like<00:03:48.760> fodder<00:03:49.030> for<00:03:49.090> my

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
bread behind me like fodder for my

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.089 
bread behind me like fodder for my
pocket<00:03:49.510> a<00:03:49.690> wonder<00:03:49.930> trade<00:03:50.169> so<00:03:50.319> this<00:03:50.470> also<00:03:50.680> saves

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
pocket a wonder trade so this also saves

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:52.349 
pocket a wonder trade so this also saves
a<00:03:51.220> lot<00:03:51.370> of<00:03:51.430> time<00:03:51.519> buddies<00:03:51.819> input<00:03:52.090> might<00:03:52.269> as

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
a lot of time buddies input might as

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:53.879 
a lot of time buddies input might as
well<00:03:52.480> so<00:03:52.660> I'm<00:03:52.810> going<00:03:52.930> to<00:03:52.989> worry<00:03:53.139> about<00:03:53.379> then

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
well so I'm going to worry about then

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.339 
well so I'm going to worry about then
clogging<00:03:54.190> up<00:03:54.280> your<00:03:54.310> PC<00:03:54.669> boxes<00:03:55.199> anyway<00:03:56.199> let<00:03:56.319> me

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
clogging up your PC boxes anyway let me

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.780 
clogging up your PC boxes anyway let me
show<00:03:56.440> you<00:03:56.620> what<00:03:57.129> my<00:03:57.280> result<00:03:57.609> is<00:03:59.430> now<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.489> two

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
show you what my result is now the two

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.000 
show you what my result is now the two
zangoose<00:04:01.239> I<00:04:01.389> got<00:04:01.569> right<00:04:01.750> here<00:04:01.780> are<00:04:02.169> two<00:04:02.349> two<00:04:02.980> of

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
zangoose I got right here are two two of

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.409 
zangoose I got right here are two two of
them<00:04:03.250> I<00:04:03.340> got<00:04:03.489> from<00:04:03.609> the<00:04:03.760> student<00:04:04.000> method<00:04:04.180> I<00:04:04.269> got

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:04.419 
them I got from the student method I got

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:06.000 
them I got from the student method I got
one<00:04:04.569> with<00:04:04.690> the<00:04:04.780> unity<00:04:05.109> one<00:04:05.290> with<00:04:05.379> toxic<00:04:05.799> boots

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
one with the unity one with toxic boots

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.319 
one with the unity one with toxic boots
now<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.280> reason<00:04:06.579> why<00:04:06.639> I<00:04:06.669> have<00:04:06.760> two<00:04:06.940> of<00:04:07.090> them<00:04:07.209> is

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
now the reason why I have two of them is

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:09.689 
now the reason why I have two of them is
because<00:04:07.480> well<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:08.590> first<00:04:08.859> one<00:04:09.040> I<00:04:09.160> bred<00:04:09.400> which

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:09.699 
because well the first one I bred which

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:12.360 
because well the first one I bred which
is<00:04:09.970> a<00:04:10.000> threat<00:04:10.449> this<00:04:10.599> one<00:04:10.840> on<00:04:11.049> May<00:04:11.319> 16th<00:04:12.010> I<00:04:12.160> will

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
is a threat this one on May 16th I will

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.210 
is a threat this one on May 16th I will
just<00:04:12.639> show<00:04:12.970> you<00:04:13.000> when<00:04:13.239> I<00:04:13.269> run<00:04:13.540> it<00:04:13.739> it<00:04:14.739> does<00:04:14.919> this

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
just show you when I run it it does this

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.270 
just show you when I run it it does this
one<00:04:15.430> is<00:04:15.579> on<00:04:15.730> May<00:04:15.879> 6th

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
one is on May 6th

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.360 
one is on May 6th
since<00:04:17.120> I'm<00:04:17.269> a<00:04:17.420> 19<00:04:17.900> now<00:04:18.200> I<00:04:18.230> didn't<00:04:18.739> like<00:04:18.950> send<00:04:19.250> my

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
since I'm a 19 now I didn't like send my

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.190 
since I'm a 19 now I didn't like send my
whole<00:04:19.519> life<00:04:19.790> lucida<00:04:20.570> method<00:04:20.840> in<00:04:20.959> I've<00:04:21.079> had

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
whole life lucida method in I've had

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.390 
whole life lucida method in I've had
throughout<00:04:21.560> the<00:04:21.680> course<00:04:21.890> you<00:04:22.040> know<00:04:22.160> a<00:04:22.190> few

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
throughout the course you know a few

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.800 
throughout the course you know a few
days<00:04:22.580> never<00:04:22.820> I<00:04:22.940> was<00:04:23.090> bored<00:04:23.270> remoraid<00:04:23.540> free

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
days never I was bored remoraid free

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.840 
days never I was bored remoraid free
time<00:04:24.020> and<00:04:24.500> I<00:04:24.950> got<00:04:25.070> to<00:04:25.190> Chinese<00:04:25.490> in<00:04:25.580> three<00:04:25.700> days

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
time and I got to Chinese in three days

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.730 
time and I got to Chinese in three days
and<00:04:26.150> from<00:04:26.870> a<00:04:26.960> student<00:04:27.200> method<00:04:27.410> a<00:04:27.470> ting<00:04:27.590> that

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
and from a student method a ting that

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.680 
and from a student method a ting that
isn't<00:04:28.100> that<00:04:28.220> bad<00:04:28.430> at<00:04:28.580> all<00:04:28.700> sessions<00:04:29.330> only<00:04:29.570> one

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
isn't that bad at all sessions only one

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.800 
isn't that bad at all sessions only one
day<00:04:29.840> 400<00:04:30.290> eggs<00:04:30.440> to<00:04:30.650> get<00:04:30.800> these<00:04:30.980> two<00:04:31.310> I<00:04:31.610> also<00:04:32.600> got

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
day 400 eggs to get these two I also got

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.630 
day 400 eggs to get these two I also got
a<00:04:32.840> third<00:04:33.110> one<00:04:33.320> but<00:04:33.770> I<00:04:33.830> don't<00:04:34.160> have<00:04:34.370> that

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
a third one but I don't have that

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.550 
a third one but I don't have that
because<00:04:34.880> I<00:04:35.390> traded<00:04:35.630> it<00:04:35.780> to<00:04:35.870> a<00:04:35.930> friend

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
because I traded it to a friend

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.710 
because I traded it to a friend
so<00:04:36.890> actually<00:04:37.280> three<00:04:38.060> of<00:04:38.180> them<00:04:38.360> but<00:04:38.540> all<00:04:38.630> the

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
so actually three of them but all the

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.970 
so actually three of them but all the
stuck<00:04:38.870> with<00:04:38.990> these<00:04:39.050> two<00:04:39.260> because<00:04:39.470> those<00:04:39.860> are

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
stuck with these two because those are

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.910 
stuck with these two because those are
the<00:04:40.010> students<00:04:40.700> who<00:04:40.790> I<00:04:40.820> have<00:04:41.030> proof<00:04:41.270> up<00:04:41.420> so<00:04:42.350> this

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
the students who I have proof up so this

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.100 
the students who I have proof up so this
I<00:04:43.460> guess<00:04:44.030> is<00:04:44.240> kind<00:04:44.390> of<00:04:44.510> evidence<00:04:44.870> that<00:04:44.930> this

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
I guess is kind of evidence that this

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.640 
I guess is kind of evidence that this
works

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
works

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.560 
works
I<00:04:45.800> mean<00:04:46.370> grim<00:04:46.580> I<00:04:46.670> do<00:04:46.820> with<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:47.000> shiny<00:04:47.270> charm

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
I mean grim I do with the shiny charm

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.810 
I mean grim I do with the shiny charm
but<00:04:47.840> I<00:04:48.020> mean<00:04:48.230> this<00:04:48.680> method<00:04:49.040> does<00:04:49.250> make<00:04:49.669> it

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
but I mean this method does make it

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.909 
but I mean this method does make it
faster<00:04:50.330> getting<00:04:50.750> more<00:04:50.930> eggs<00:04:51.110> faster<00:04:51.620> and<00:04:51.830> he

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
faster getting more eggs faster and he

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.159 
faster getting more eggs faster and he
also<00:04:52.040> gives<00:04:52.220> you<00:04:52.310> infinite<00:04:52.490> power<00:04:52.850> so<00:04:53.210> overall

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
also gives you infinite power so overall

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.080 
also gives you infinite power so overall
I<00:04:54.260> think<00:04:54.440> this<00:04:54.800> method<00:04:55.130> is<00:04:55.430> faster<00:04:55.640> than<00:04:55.940> the

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
I think this method is faster than the

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.240 
I think this method is faster than the
other<00:04:56.240> one<00:04:56.450> if<00:04:56.630> you<00:04:56.750> don't<00:04:56.990> want<00:04:57.260> them<00:04:57.650> sudha<00:04:58.070> I

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
other one if you don't want them sudha I

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.220 
other one if you don't want them sudha I
mean<00:04:58.400> if<00:04:58.520> you<00:04:58.580> don't<00:04:58.669> want<00:04:58.910> the<00:04:59.540> other<00:04:59.750> Pokemon

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
mean if you don't want the other Pokemon

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.420 
mean if you don't want the other Pokemon
as<00:05:00.320> long<00:05:00.440> as<00:05:00.620> usually<00:05:00.890> trying<00:05:01.070> to<00:05:01.130> get<00:05:01.250> one

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
as long as usually trying to get one

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.710 
as long as usually trying to get one
specific<00:05:01.940> thing<00:05:01.970> this<00:05:02.300> method<00:05:02.600> it's

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
specific thing this method it's

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.120 
specific thing this method it's
definitely<00:05:03.050> faster<00:05:03.260> but<00:05:03.590> if<00:05:03.650> you<00:05:03.740> want<00:05:03.919> you

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
definitely faster but if you want you

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.530 
definitely faster but if you want you
know<00:05:04.220> to<00:05:04.280> like<00:05:04.520> keep<00:05:04.700> chained<00:05:04.970> reading<00:05:05.360> then

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
know to like keep chained reading then

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.230 
know to like keep chained reading then
this<00:05:06.140> isn't<00:05:06.350> the<00:05:06.770> method<00:05:06.980> for<00:05:07.340> you<00:05:07.520> but<00:05:08.060> if<00:05:08.150> you

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
this isn't the method for you but if you

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.330 
this isn't the method for you but if you
ever<00:05:08.360> see<00:05:08.540> the<00:05:08.600> method<00:05:08.870> I<00:05:09.080> do<00:05:09.140> say<00:05:09.650> this<00:05:09.830> is<00:05:10.010> way

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
ever see the method I do say this is way

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.030 
ever see the method I do say this is way
faster<00:05:10.640> so<00:05:11.210> throwing<00:05:11.960> it<00:05:12.080> out<00:05:12.169> there<00:05:12.380> but<00:05:13.010> I

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
faster so throwing it out there but I

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.700 
faster so throwing it out there but I
