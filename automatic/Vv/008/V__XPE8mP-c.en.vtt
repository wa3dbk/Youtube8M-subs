 to create a minecraft scheme e 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.770
 in short, upload them to your premium 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.170
 or even mob or block skins 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.150
 to create texture packs let's say one of 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.960
 these other functions is to do 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.360
 these wall papers then go in 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.860
 this link scroll down to see 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.030
 everyone wants to do it because they are there 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:34.270
 take what you like best 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:36.310
 what you want to do click there 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.520
 will bring down a bar 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.030
 and it will load the photo later from there now 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.940
 let's change the various skins 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.400
 then choose if there are more 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.290
 characters in the same in the same 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.290
 photo click on what you want 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.830
 edit this will appear 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.110
 window and here where there is to write 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.420
 you write the name of your skin 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.649
 of a friend of yours to say fairies 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.539
 be careful to capitalize 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.550
 lower case 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.580
 then you can use the search button 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.560
 to search for skins with that name or 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.110
 directly if you wrote yours 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.850
 own precise minecraft name vi 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.560
 I advise you to do this because you do before 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.480
 write your minecraft name 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.460
 precise with small capital letters 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.650
 click the button on the right and make the 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.500
 search for this player screening 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.500
 minecraft puntonet and will load you in 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.180
 automatic your skin as you see 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.360
 then we go to change another one too 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.830
 to say we write the name of another 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.810
 of another player obviously with the 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.400
 skin we always do search for this 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.680
 player skin and we will change the skin ai 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.840
 characters like this we already have 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.610
 created our pigozzo wall paper 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.940
 we go down even lower and 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.740
 we choose the dimension then I will 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.430
 I recommend leaving this basic 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.140
 because that's okay if you want to do it 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.720
 these other low dimensions that 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.730
 click there me 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.520
 I click that default but you can 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.520
 modify various f 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.520
 clarified 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.770
 in short, everyone is a different effect 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.000
 you try them as you are seeing 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:35.710
 however usually it comes better with 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:37.660
 without effects without filters 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.760
 once your wall paper 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:44.290
 you changed it however you like 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:47.710
 go down and select the format 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.830
 jpg or png as you prefer 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:53.940
 do download click you will start the 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.940
 photo download 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.400
 take and have your wall paper 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:06.160
 custom then you can do it on 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.640
 any of these of these photos that 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.470
 see on the site in no time and 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.040
 then maybe put them as the background of the 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.360
 desktop like this now that's cool 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.850
 so guys I hope I've been there 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.600

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.600
