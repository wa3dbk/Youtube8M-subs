runners a pretty simple procedure can

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.189 
runners a pretty simple procedure can
make<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:18.000> pretty<00:00:18.420> good<00:00:18.600> difference<00:00:18.990> though

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
make a pretty good difference though

ported<00:00:22.500> plenum<00:00:22.890> ported<00:00:23.730> base<00:00:24.529> let's<00:00:25.529> take<00:00:25.710> a

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
ported plenum ported base let's take a

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.070 
ported plenum ported base let's take a
look<00:00:26.010> at<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:27.050> the<00:00:28.050> unported<00:00:28.730> stock<00:00:29.730> runner<00:00:30.080> if

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
look at the the unported stock runner if

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.110 
look at the the unported stock runner if
you<00:00:31.260> look<00:00:31.439> up<00:00:31.619> close<00:00:33.469> you<00:00:34.469> can<00:00:34.500> see<00:00:35.870> there's<00:00:36.870> a

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
you look up close you can see there's a

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.700 
you look up close you can see there's a
there's<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.180> lip<00:00:39.510> right<00:00:39.870> in<00:00:40.050> here<00:00:42.559> kind<00:00:43.559> of

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
there's a lip right in here kind of

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.240 
there's a lip right in here kind of
sticks<00:00:44.070> up<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.399> little<00:00:44.610> bit<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.770> it<00:00:46.770> can<00:00:46.980> cause

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
sticks up a little bit and it can cause

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.180 
sticks up a little bit and it can cause
it<00:00:47.879> causes<00:00:48.300> turbulence<00:00:51.620> with<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.739> incoming

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
it causes turbulence with the incoming

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.819 
it causes turbulence with the incoming
air<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:54.149> can<00:00:54.329> hear<00:00:54.660> we'll<00:00:54.870> hit<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.680> little

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
air we can hear we'll hit that little

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.610 
air we can hear we'll hit that little
lag<00:00:56.070> handle<00:00:56.870> it'll<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.020> cause<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.469> air<00:00:58.590> to

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
lag handle it'll just cause the air to

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.540 
lag handle it'll just cause the air to
the<00:00:59.489> bounce<00:00:59.699> around<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.210> little<00:01:00.300> bit<00:01:01.430> so<00:01:02.430> what

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
the bounce around a little bit so what

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.429 
the bounce around a little bit so what
you<00:01:02.699> want<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.940> do<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.930> want<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.580> grind<00:01:05.580> down

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
you want to do is you want to grind down

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:12.770 
you want to do is you want to grind down
that<00:01:07.439> little<00:01:07.740> lip<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:09.920> each<00:01:11.270> on<00:01:12.270> each<00:01:12.299> runner

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
that little lip on each on each runner

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.440 
that little lip on each on each runner
each<00:01:13.470> tube<00:01:15.020> let's<00:01:16.020> take<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> look<00:01:16.590> at<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.640> ported

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
each tube let's take a look at a ported

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.090 
each tube let's take a look at a ported
one<00:01:18.689> when<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.320> finished

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.719 

as<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.400> can<00:01:23.520> see<00:01:23.850> here

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
as you can see here

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.010 
as you can see here
it's<00:01:26.180> all

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.950 

smooth<00:01:29.560> doubt<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:31.060> you<00:01:31.150> don't<00:01:31.330> have<00:01:31.479> that<00:01:31.540> lip

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
smooth doubt so you don't have that lip

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.060 
smooth doubt so you don't have that lip
anymore<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:34.240> it's<00:01:34.390> just<00:01:34.450> smoother<00:01:35.409> transition

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
anymore so it's just smoother transition

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.580 
anymore so it's just smoother transition
for<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.340> air<00:01:36.490> to<00:01:36.970> go<00:01:37.119> into<00:01:37.300> the<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:38.229> runners

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
for the air to go into the the runners

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.520 
for the air to go into the the runners
and<00:01:38.770> then<00:01:38.920> into<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.340> base<00:01:40.020> as<00:01:41.020> you<00:01:41.170> can<00:01:41.320> see

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
and then into the base as you can see

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.740 
and then into the base as you can see
I've<00:01:42.400> done<00:01:42.460> it<00:01:42.640> on<00:01:42.820> the<00:01:42.909> bottom<00:01:43.240> -<00:01:45.540> nice<00:01:46.540> and

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
I've done it on the bottom - nice and

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.530 
I've done it on the bottom - nice and
smooth<00:01:47.369> no<00:01:48.369> more<00:01:48.610> lip<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.850> yeah<00:01:51.850> it<00:01:52.240> makes<00:01:52.390> a

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
smooth no more lip so yeah it makes a

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.070 
smooth no more lip so yeah it makes a
difference<00:01:53.970> any<00:01:54.970> any<00:01:55.300> little<00:01:55.630> thing<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:55.899> can

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
difference any any little thing you can

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.590 
difference any any little thing you can
do<00:01:56.259> to<00:01:57.030> make<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.180> air<00:01:58.330> flow<00:01:58.570> easier<00:01:58.780> into<00:01:59.380> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
do to make the air flow easier into the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.350 
do to make the air flow easier into the
into<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.720> engine<00:02:02.460> it's<00:02:03.460> going<00:02:03.610> to<00:02:04.020> get<00:02:05.020> a<00:02:05.050> help

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
into the engine it's going to get a help

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.460 
into the engine it's going to get a help
combine<00:02:07.360> like<00:02:07.810> I<00:02:07.929> said<00:02:08.140> before<00:02:08.970> combined<00:02:09.970> with

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
combine like I said before combined with

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.800 
combine like I said before combined with
ported<00:02:11.470> plenum<00:02:11.830> and<00:02:11.980> base<00:02:12.810> these

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
ported plenum and base these

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.220 
ported plenum and base these
modifications<00:02:14.260> can<00:02:14.830> really<00:02:15.810> can<00:02:16.810> really<00:02:17.080> help

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
modifications can really can really help

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.350 
modifications can really can really help
