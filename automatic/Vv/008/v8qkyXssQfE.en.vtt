00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.130
 go to the boys and welcome to this 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.630
 video a bit special then it's all 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.779
 because then there were rumors 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.670
 around concerning the team's complexity 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.640
 I think it's stronger in the world in 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.680
 america concerning the use of cit or 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.590
 tricks that increased auto mila and i 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.000
 recoil minivan but they are not tricks 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.860
 because in truth it is only change 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.210
 basic console settings 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.820
 that is, therefore they can not be 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.160
 considered troupe if not change them 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.110
 basic settings of the console what that 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.750
 allows you to do just the console 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.820
 so it's definitely not a chip either 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.260
 a trick at most can be a 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.539
 advantage for those who were there because they did not 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.039
 he has it but it is something sincerely 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.379
 subjective because there are those who can 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.350
 finding good for bad I didn't know 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.690
 nothing until recently is in fact I do 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.100
 build in own system links for 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.480
 let you see screen link systems 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.110
 shared just to show the 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.119
 difference 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.560
 at dawn all this and with the settings 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.909
 normal console defaults 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.479
 look at the car aims at me 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.610
 came closer to loosen you see ok 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.590
 and so when I shoot it has a slight 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.750
 recoil upwards the masses mc as 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.759
 you can see now we make the change 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.460
 trying to change the settings 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.280
 must open the dashboard is only on 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.759
 xbox this thing go to settings 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.350
 profile default game values 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.840
 need to change to general put 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.979
 difficulty easy controller sensitivity 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.689
 low automatic target action activated 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.299
 obviously leave so etcetera 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.810
 Automatically activated mind let's see what 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.270
 will change to the first thing it seems to me 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.100
 that the right and left movement 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.240
 above all it has slightly decreased 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.340
 as a network, look at you is enough 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.570
 slow down below and just left not 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.600
 lot 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.509
 now let's try you see the car aims now if 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.939
 note side aims it seems to be a lot 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.689
 the more you wait, try moving the other one 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.920
 player a little further away they call here 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.790
 back to the wall 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:16.390
 and I'm in the car aiming like you see 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.650
 it looks like you see how it attacks like 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.190
 a glue when it comes to a certain one 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.209
 area 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.540
 the auto aim brings me to the 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.150
 adversary 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:30.130
 now let's try to shoot we see a 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:33.850
 little how it works you see it's like if 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.040
 the weapon had no recoil ie it is not 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:40.000
 which has no recoil has decreased the 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.650
 recoil now we find it is much more 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.410
 far 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.750
 look at or present a long shot 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.459
 with smg from far away in the weapon 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.080
 it almost looks like it doesn't recoil now 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.150
 let's try again with the settings changing 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.140
 instead we put it difficult therefore 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.470
 let's go to settings we put values 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.489
 general defaults we put up 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.940
 difficult sensitive to controller 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.860
 let's put other action in this case 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.640
 always aimed badly centrally or 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:12.010
 curds are now much faster to look at 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.890
 up and down you see look like a lot more 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.820
 fast you notice your naked eye 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:21.269
 ok now let's see it again 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:24.450
 let's put the enemy down here 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.450
 back to the wall 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.880
 I put myself down here and now we open to shoot 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.760
 see how much less car aiming 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.850
 before it was much more sticky on the aiming side 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.049
 now instead from down here look see 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.700
 look how much less there is when 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:44.890
 I do now on the left looks a lot 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:49.060
 faster good we open to shoot well a 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:52.299
 me it seems pretty enough 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.650
 different but this here because now 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.880
 since that reason I understood the 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.340
 because practically in values 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.739
 predefined by changing the difficulty 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.510
 that on general from easy to medium and 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.209
 difficult also determines how much the 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.650
 game we give you an advantage if you 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.359
 put it easy means that you are 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.370
 months you don't know how to shoot the game there 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.260
 gives an advantage giving the aim then 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.209
 that oddo aims more or less recoil 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.850
 etc. etc. so a way to 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.019
 give you an advantage over who you know 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.950
 I do not know 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.550
 normal or difficult as you see then 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.759
 change but as you see now I just did 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.159
 long shot with difficult so maybe ok 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.889
 there may be a little recoil could 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:32.539
 be a little more precise but it is not that 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.539
 this is a quote a trick is not that 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:38.000
 this makes you win games because 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:41.509
 when you play against strong people it is not 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.310
 a gunfight a clash 1 v1 won that 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:46.310
 will make you win the game but only 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:49.190
 the team work the skill and of course the 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.500
 your head then intelligence 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.379
 obviously my advice is for whom 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.240
 maybe he wants to aim a little better or not 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:59.810
 you find yourself with the settings it opens 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.219
 defined to change it which is not 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.750
 can find good 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:03.889
 try hard maybe you are gods 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.719
 players you are used to 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.400
 drag the aim you admire precisely 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:11.960
 of a point that is, they are therefore tastes 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:17.240
 guys it's not necessarily I can tell you 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.949
 one thing to do though as you can see 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.319
 to me he sincerely gave feedback 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.360
 positive put low and difficulty 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:25.190
 easy centralized automatic is said 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.870
 which is better only for ip fire 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.330
 to shoot without aiming so with 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.190
 the weapon is just that 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.630
 I hope you guys have this video 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.139
 liked that he made you understand the 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:38.779
 mechanical of the 360 ​​of why there is more 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.370
 auto mines with easy that with difficult is 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:42.580
 all here let me know what you think 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.940
 and at my signal unleash hell 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.940
 beautiful girl
