00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
in her picture that this brand was a

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.310 
in her picture that this brand was a
cheaper<00:01:17.460> cheaper<00:01:17.909> alternative<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.080> brand

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
cheaper cheaper alternative to the brand

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.890 
cheaper cheaper alternative to the brand
she<00:01:19.500> had<00:01:19.860> purchased<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.549> these<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.540> believe

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
she had purchased and these I believe

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.020 
she had purchased and these I believe
they<00:01:22.830> were<00:01:22.890> under<00:01:23.250> nine<00:01:23.400> dollars<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.759> bottle

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
they were under nine dollars a bottle

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.160 
they were under nine dollars a bottle
and<00:01:24.330> they<00:01:24.420> were<00:01:24.479> pout<00:01:24.750> they<00:01:24.960> would<00:01:25.080> have

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
and they were pout they would have

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.690 
and they were pout they would have
probably<00:01:25.290> been<00:01:25.530> cheaper<00:01:25.860> if<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.070> had<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> Sally's

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
probably been cheaper if I had a Sally's

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.789 
probably been cheaper if I had a Sally's
