00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
hey this is Jared with a daily app show

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.070 
hey this is Jared with a daily app show
and<00:00:02.700> today<00:00:02.909> we're<00:00:03.060> gonna<00:00:03.120> take<00:00:03.419> a<00:00:03.480> look<00:00:03.840> at<00:00:04.049> a

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
and today we're gonna take a look at a

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.860 
and today we're gonna take a look at a
task<00:00:04.440> management<00:00:04.980> application<00:00:05.910> for<00:00:06.569> those<00:00:06.690> of

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
task management application for those of

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.780 
task management application for those of
you<00:00:07.080> that<00:00:07.319> are<00:00:07.529> always<00:00:07.950> on<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.370> go<00:00:08.550> it's

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
you that are always on the go it's

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.540 
you that are always on the go it's
called<00:00:09.059> Tasker<00:00:09.750> now<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.590> application<00:00:10.800> is

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
called Tasker now this application is

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.789 
called Tasker now this application is
slightly<00:00:12.150> different<00:00:12.630> than<00:00:13.170> other<00:00:13.440> task

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
slightly different than other task

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.560 
slightly different than other task
management<00:00:14.309> applications<00:00:15.120> because<00:00:15.540> it

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
management applications because it

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.460 
management applications because it
allows<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.529> geotag<00:00:17.340> all<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:18.390> that<00:00:18.630> the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
allows you to geotag all of that the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.070 
allows you to geotag all of that the
tasks<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.160> create<00:00:20.699> now<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:21.900> would<00:00:22.050> be

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
tasks that you create now this would be

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.640 
tasks that you create now this would be
good<00:00:22.380> if<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.710> are<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.760> traveler<00:00:24.449> or<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.960> business

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
where they are locked into so for

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.780 
where they are locked into so for
example<00:00:37.260> we<00:00:37.350> have<00:00:37.559> some<00:00:37.860> tasks<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.460> come

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
example we have some tasks that come

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.970 
example we have some tasks that come
pre-installed<00:00:39.059> into<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.809> application<00:00:40.500> to

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
pre-installed into the application to

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.740 
pre-installed into the application to
show<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.460> functionality<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.600> we're

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
show you the functionality so we're

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.450 
show you the functionality so we're
going<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.930> take<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> look<00:00:43.350> at<00:00:43.469> those<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:44.309> can

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
going to take a look at those you can

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.090 
going to take a look at those you can
simply<00:00:44.820> hit<00:00:44.969> plus<00:00:45.270> here<00:00:45.600> create<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.289> task<00:00:46.590> so

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
simply hit plus here create a task so

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.900 
simply hit plus here create a task so
let's<00:00:47.370> say<00:00:47.550> we're<00:00:47.789> doing<00:00:47.940> an<00:00:48.239> app<00:00:48.420> review

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
let's say we're doing an app review

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.400 
let's say we're doing an app review
really<00:00:50.910> simply<00:00:51.449> if<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.719> could<00:00:51.870> just<00:00:52.050> spell<00:00:52.260> it

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
really simply if I could just spell it

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.760 
really simply if I could just spell it
here

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
here

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.970 
here
app<00:00:53.489> review<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:54.420> if<00:00:54.989> I'm<00:00:55.260> doing<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.590> anywhere

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
app review and if I'm doing it anywhere

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.950 
app review and if I'm doing it anywhere
I<00:00:56.010> don't<00:00:56.219> really<00:00:56.670> need<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.000> geotag<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.899> just

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
I don't really need to geotag it I just

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.979 
I don't really need to geotag it I just
hit<00:00:58.260> anywhere<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.739> doesn't<00:00:58.890> matter<00:00:59.160> it's<00:00:59.399> not

to<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.680> specific<00:01:38.189> location<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.600> can<00:01:40.200> also

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
to that specific location so I can also

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.649 
to that specific location so I can also
hit<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.979> little<00:01:41.130> Twitter<00:01:41.490> bird<00:01:41.729> there<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.299> if

hit the little Twitter bird there and if

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.690 
hit the little Twitter bird there and if
I've<00:01:42.840> configured<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.710> can<00:01:43.920> go<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.369> tweet

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
I've configured it I can go and tweet

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.330 
I've configured it I can go and tweet
that<00:01:44.880> out<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.689> my<00:01:45.899> Twitter<00:01:46.290> community<00:01:46.470> now
