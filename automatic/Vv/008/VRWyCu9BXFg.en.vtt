some<00:00:09.690> rope<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.769> get<00:00:10.889> it<00:00:10.980> off<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.099> ground<00:00:11.219> in

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
some rope to get it off the ground in

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.600 
some rope to get it off the ground in
just<00:00:12.840> an<00:00:12.990> easy<00:00:13.170> place<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.469> store<00:00:13.799> it

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
just an easy place to store it

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.609 
just an easy place to store it
what<00:00:15.000> involves<00:00:15.570> is<00:00:15.690> just<00:00:15.900> like<00:00:16.199> I<00:00:16.260> said<00:00:16.320> some

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
what involves is just like I said some

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.730 
what involves is just like I said some
rope<00:00:16.859> single<00:00:17.820> pulley<00:00:18.029> in<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.270> back<00:00:18.740> another

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
rope single pulley in the back another

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.830 
rope single pulley in the back another
single<00:00:20.100> pulley<00:00:20.310> up<00:00:20.490> front<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.060> another

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
single pulley up front and another

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.730 
single pulley up front and another
double<00:00:22.800> pulley<00:00:23.070> up<00:00:23.279> above<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:24.350> the<00:00:25.350> reason<00:00:25.650> I

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
double pulley up above that the reason I

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.050 
double pulley up above that the reason I
do<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.130> because<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.519> don't<00:00:26.580> want<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.880> tie

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
do that is because I don't want to tie

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.310 
do that is because I don't want to tie
to<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.359> handles<00:00:27.750> on<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.960> end<00:00:28.109> because

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
to the handles on the end because

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.310 
to the handles on the end because
that'll<00:00:28.710> over<00:00:29.160> time<00:00:29.429> bow<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.970> kayak<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.779> don't

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
that'll over time bow the kayak I don't

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.889 
that'll over time bow the kayak I don't
want<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.560> happening<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.480> I'll<00:00:33.480> throw<00:00:33.750> up

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
want that happening so I'll throw up

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.060 
want that happening so I'll throw up
being<00:00:34.050> about<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.230> foot<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.590> half<00:00:34.649> two<00:00:34.860> feet

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
being about a foot and a half two feet

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.560 
being about a foot and a half two feet
from<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.280> back<00:00:35.550> that'll<00:00:35.820> support<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.390> lot

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
from the back that'll support a lot

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.920 
from the back that'll support a lot
better<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.020> hopefully<00:00:37.380> not<00:00:37.590> bow<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.420> so<00:00:39.420> what

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
better and hopefully not bow it so what

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.119 
better and hopefully not bow it so what
I'll<00:00:40.020> do<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.170> I'll<00:00:40.350> lower<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.590> down<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.040> I'll

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
I'll do is I'll lower it down and I'll

00:00:41.129 --> 00:01:30.510 
I'll do is I'll lower it down and I'll
show<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.399> what<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.390> did

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
all right you can see that was pretty

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.529 
all right you can see that was pretty
easy<00:01:33.459> some<00:01:34.459> of<00:01:34.520> my<00:01:34.610> junk<00:01:34.819> actually<00:01:35.179> fell<00:01:35.360> out

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
easy some of my junk actually fell out

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.260 
easy some of my junk actually fell out
but<00:01:35.899> whatever<00:01:36.679> all<00:01:36.920> right<00:01:37.729> I'll<00:01:37.909> start<00:01:38.090> down

sorry the ceiling and from there the
rope<00:01:59.599> goes<00:01:59.810> over<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.380> there<00:02:00.619> which<00:02:00.890> is<00:02:01.039> that

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
rope goes over to there which is that

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.419 
rope goes over to there which is that
double<00:02:01.939> pulley<00:02:02.179> as<00:02:02.569> you<00:02:03.500> can<00:02:03.649> see<00:02:03.890> here<00:02:04.219> this

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
double pulley as you can see here this

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.819 
double pulley as you can see here this
room<00:02:04.729> and<00:02:05.629> then<00:02:05.750> you<00:02:05.869> follow<00:02:06.110> that<00:02:06.229> one<00:02:06.590> down

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
room and then you follow that one down

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.979 
room and then you follow that one down
and<00:02:07.579> it<00:02:07.759> goes<00:02:07.879> to<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.119> single<00:02:08.509> pulley<00:02:08.690> right

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
and it goes to the single pulley right

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.670 
and it goes to the single pulley right
here<00:02:09.700> once<00:02:10.700> again<00:02:11.000> same<00:02:11.359> as<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.600> back<00:02:11.810> just

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
here once again same as the back just

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.530 
here once again same as the back just
some<00:02:12.799> rope<00:02:12.980> with<00:02:13.130> both<00:02:13.160> ends<00:02:13.700> tied<00:02:13.970> off<00:02:14.209> to<00:02:14.450> the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
some rope with both ends tied off to the

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.160 
some rope with both ends tied off to the
carabiner

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
carabiner

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.020 
carabiner
and<00:02:15.940> then<00:02:16.940> from<00:02:17.510> there<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:19.489> other<00:02:19.670> end<00:02:19.880> of<00:02:19.940> the

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
and then from there the other end of the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.690 
and then from there the other end of the
rope<00:02:20.150> goes<00:02:20.359> back<00:02:20.600> up<00:02:20.859> here<00:02:21.859> into<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.310> double

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
rope goes back up here into the double

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.479 
rope goes back up here into the double
pulley<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.510> then<00:02:24.470> that<00:02:24.709> end<00:02:24.920> of<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.100> rope<00:02:25.280> is

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
pulley and then that end of the rope is

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.890 
pulley and then that end of the rope is
what<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:25.790> pull<00:02:26.030> on<00:02:26.209> here<00:02:27.069> to<00:02:28.780> actually<00:02:29.780> get

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
what you pull on here to actually get

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.140 
what you pull on here to actually get
the<00:02:29.989> front<00:02:30.200> end<00:02:30.319> to<00:02:30.350> come<00:02:30.500> up<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:30.799> down<00:02:31.150> it's

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
the front end to come up and down it's

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.420 
the front end to come up and down it's
pretty<00:02:32.389> easy<00:02:32.510> concept<00:02:33.040> you<00:02:34.040> don't<00:02:34.190> need<00:02:34.310> to

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
pretty easy concept you don't need to

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.030 
pretty easy concept you don't need to
people<00:02:34.819> just<00:02:35.060> want<00:02:35.239> to<00:02:35.329> work<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:36.739> makes<00:02:36.920> it

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
people just want to work and it makes it

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.430 
people just want to work and it makes it
a<00:02:37.069> lot<00:02:37.160> lighter

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
a lot lighter

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.140 

there<00:02:39.769> is<00:02:39.889> one<00:02:40.069> oh<00:02:40.370> there's<00:02:40.760> another<00:02:40.849> way<00:02:41.120> you

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
there is one oh there's another way you

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.819 
there is one oh there's another way you
can<00:02:41.389> actually<00:02:41.569> hook<00:02:41.810> a<00:02:41.870> couple<00:02:42.290> more<00:02:42.440> pulleys

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
can actually hook a couple more pulleys

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.140 
can actually hook a couple more pulleys
up<00:02:43.099> to<00:02:43.220> it<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.400> make<00:02:43.519> an<00:02:43.639> additional<00:02:43.970> one<00:02:44.060> on

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
up to it and make an additional one on

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.539 
up to it and make an additional one on
the<00:02:44.209> back<00:02:44.680> that's<00:02:45.680> more<00:02:45.859> complicated<00:02:46.160> takes

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
the back that's more complicated takes

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:47.680 
the back that's more complicated takes
more<00:02:46.730> rope<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.120> it's<00:02:47.209> actually<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.480> little<00:02:47.540> bit

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
more rope and it's actually a little bit

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.890 
more rope and it's actually a little bit
harder<00:02:48.079> to<00:02:48.260> do<00:02:49.160> so<00:02:49.400> three<00:02:50.299> pulleys<00:02:50.540> of<00:02:50.720> work

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
harder to do so three pulleys of work

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.140 
harder to do so three pulleys of work
makes<00:02:51.620> it<00:02:51.769> easy<00:02:51.950> for<00:02:52.250> one<00:02:52.370> person<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.849> do<00:02:53.000> it

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
makes it easy for one person to do it

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.210 
makes it easy for one person to do it
now<00:02:54.019> raise<00:02:54.230> it<00:02:54.380> back<00:02:54.470> up<00:02:54.650> and<00:02:54.829> show<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:55.099> what

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
now raise it back up and show you what

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.729 
now raise it back up and show you what
I'm<00:02:55.310> doing<00:02:55.630> you'll<00:02:56.630> notice<00:02:56.900> off<00:02:57.079> to<00:02:57.290> help<00:02:57.620> the

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
I'm doing you'll notice off to help the

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.339 
I'm doing you'll notice off to help the
back<00:02:57.919> end<00:02:58.160> up<00:02:58.310> a<00:02:58.430> little<00:02:58.669> bit<00:02:59.079> but<00:03:00.079> it's<00:03:00.200> not<00:03:00.230> a

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
back end up a little bit but it's not a

00:03:00.349 --> 00:04:12.550 
back end up a little bit but it's not a
big<00:03:00.500> deal

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.380 

far<00:04:13.560> as<00:04:13.709> you<00:04:13.769> can<00:04:13.920> see<00:04:14.159> like<00:04:14.700> I<00:04:14.819> said<00:04:15.030> earlier

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
far as you can see like I said earlier

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.990 
far as you can see like I said earlier
that<00:04:15.569> was<00:04:15.719> pretty<00:04:15.930> simple<00:04:16.229> and<00:04:17.220> now<00:04:17.789> what<00:04:17.970> I

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
that was pretty simple and now what I

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.460 
that was pretty simple and now what I
did<00:04:18.209> there<00:04:18.359> at<00:04:18.449> the<00:04:18.570> end<00:04:18.690> is<00:04:18.810> I<00:04:18.900> just<00:04:19.109> took<00:04:19.229> this

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
did there at the end is I just took this

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.560 
did there at the end is I just took this
rope<00:04:19.769> here<00:04:20.070> and<00:04:20.699> it'll<00:04:20.880> loosen<00:04:21.060> up<00:04:21.299> a<00:04:21.419> little

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
rope here and it'll loosen up a little

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.240 
rope here and it'll loosen up a little
bit<00:04:21.720> when<00:04:21.840> you<00:04:21.900> put<00:04:22.049> it<00:04:22.139> down<00:04:22.289> and<00:04:23.160> I<00:04:23.220> just

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
bit when you put it down and I just

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.279 
bit when you put it down and I just
should<00:04:23.580> meet<00:04:23.669> it<00:04:23.789> off<00:04:23.940> this<00:04:24.330> way<00:04:24.570> up<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.900> kayak

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
should meet it off this way up the kayak

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.740 
should meet it off this way up the kayak
just<00:04:25.699> to<00:04:26.699> tighten<00:04:26.970> it<00:04:27.030> up<00:04:27.090> and<00:04:27.300> level<00:04:27.509> it<00:04:27.570> out<00:04:27.690> a

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
just to tighten it up and level it out a

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.850 
just to tighten it up and level it out a
little<00:04:27.960> more<00:04:28.139> and<00:04:28.229> it<00:04:28.259> gives<00:04:28.410> a<00:04:28.470> little<00:04:28.680> more

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
little more and it gives a little more

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.590 
little more and it gives a little more
support<00:04:29.160> in<00:04:29.220> the<00:04:29.280> middle<00:04:29.370> and<00:04:32.330> that's<00:04:33.330> pretty

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
support in the middle and that's pretty

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.810 
support in the middle and that's pretty
much<00:04:33.810> it<00:04:34.080> there's<00:04:34.710> really<00:04:34.979> nothing<00:04:35.460> to<00:04:35.490> it

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
much it there's really nothing to it

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.710 
much it there's really nothing to it
it's<00:04:36.060> pretty<00:04:36.509> easy<00:04:36.870> concept<00:04:37.199> and<00:04:37.830> die<00:04:38.720> and

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
it's pretty easy concept and die and

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.800 
it's pretty easy concept and die and
store<00:04:39.990> your<00:04:40.169> junk<00:04:40.470> in<00:04:40.650> here<00:04:41.360> just<00:04:42.360> remember<00:04:42.599> to

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
store your junk in here just remember to

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.689 
store your junk in here just remember to
take<00:04:42.960> it<00:04:43.020> out<00:04:43.259> I'm<00:04:43.740> like<00:04:43.949> I<00:04:44.099> did<00:04:44.340> so<00:04:44.490> you<00:04:44.550> don't

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
take it out I'm like I did so you don't

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.120 
take it out I'm like I did so you don't
break<00:04:44.910> it<00:04:45.120> when<00:04:45.180> you<00:04:45.810> put<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.080> kayak<00:04:46.440> down<00:04:46.620> and

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.370 

that's<00:04:50.130> all
