00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.719
 recently a look in 17 given 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.050
 This is android turn on 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:22.949
 we show you android 4.2.2011 peri az 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.300
 At the beginning , it's the first one 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.560
 already at the lockscreen 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.619
 you see now you have the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.390
 possibility if you go to the left 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.089
 wipes now also in lockscreen already 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.500
 to create widgets simply the plus 

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:37.080
 press and then we can for example 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.850
 times in the calendar 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.650
 then you have for example directly in the 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.530
 lockscreen hours calendar can become 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.409
 that can make bigger that his 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.400
 show dates 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:49.379
 Just get back with more 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.570
 back can these 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.150
 widgets functional make smaller 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.909
 the middle of a normal 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.100
 Unlock and the display comes like that 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.260
 here at the start screen falls first 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.979
 not great what looks like on 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.840
 what always stands out is that up here 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.439
 This status bar is transparent 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.549
 was higher dull black so very dark 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.119
 has a little something in the display 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.950
 taken away 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.929
 now it is transparent through that 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.700
 whole much bigger directly and 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:20.240
 altogether a bit more pleasant that 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.060
 same here with the virtual buttons 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.710
 yes, the bar very much again 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.469
 this makes it transparent and easy 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.359
 a bit nicer bit more supple 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:35.460
 then we have to look 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:37.439
 we go to the settings and what 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.920
 you can really cool new feature 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.899
 now its the playstation 3 controller 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.009
 get on 3 controllers with the xperia 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.810
 z connect and then with the controller 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.570
 games just play with it you have to 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.840
 just the controller over the 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.210
 connect usb port and then connect 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.210
 Let's show you, of course 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.830
 now no controller since then 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.500
 you will just step for 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:09.080
 step by how to guide the 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:12.260
 controller joins another one 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.720
 smaller feature can now be found here 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.090
 above the status bar after your own 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:28.310
 wish to adapt and take again 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:29.330
 the settings display and fast 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.000
 Settings can be found here now 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.590
 choose what features to put in 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.600
 his status bar will be displayed 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.340
 So I want to think, for example, stopped 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.170
 the gps does not change many things 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.580
 I would like to go away every day 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:47.870
 put the checkmark back at wifi here 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.860
 Now understand ps2 instead of that's it 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.170
 actually so far is still one 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:59.690
 new feature which is relatively prominent 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:03:01.610
 was advertised on android 4.2.2010 the 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.750
 is also found under display 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.370
 and daydream so bardem then activates 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.810
 Can you choose what happens when 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.220
 his mobile phone is somehow docked or 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.480
 just on load now activate what 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.340
 just two options once 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.680
 Colors could be seen for a moment 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.340
 in the end, only as the name already 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.420
 says a colored screen 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.070
 then you have the possibility yourself 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.840
 pull his pictures on in the slideshow 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.860
 It's nice to let it go 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.660
 You can get a picture of leather right away 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.299

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.350
 otherwise nice games yes that were 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.510
 actually the most important 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.829
 functions 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.049
 I thank you for watching and 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.549

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.000
