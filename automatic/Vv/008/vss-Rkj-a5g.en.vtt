the different hummingbird grass and the

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.079 
the different hummingbird grass and the
newer<00:00:13.469> technologies<00:00:14.219> that<00:00:14.370> we<00:00:14.490> have<00:00:14.519> in<00:00:14.789> the

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
newer technologies that we have in the

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.330 
newer technologies that we have in the
fishfinder<00:00:15.299> that<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:16.170> use<00:00:16.769> probably<00:00:16.980> most

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
fishfinder that I use probably most

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.109 
fishfinder that I use probably most
often<00:00:17.849> would<00:00:18.000> be<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.210> 597<00:00:18.960> CI<00:00:19.890> si<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.910> what

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
often would be the 597 CI si and what

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.810 
often would be the 597 CI si and what
that<00:00:21.330> stands<00:00:21.599> for<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:21.990> it's<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.260> combo<00:00:22.820> GPS

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
that stands for is it's a combo GPS

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.870 
that stands for is it's a combo GPS
sonar<00:00:24.449> unit<00:00:24.660> it's<00:00:25.199> got<00:00:25.349> an<00:00:25.439> internal<00:00:25.859> GPS<00:00:26.460> and

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
sonar unit it's got an internal GPS and

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.970 
sonar unit it's got an internal GPS and
it<00:00:27.330> comes<00:00:27.570> with<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.869> functionality<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.650> site

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
it comes with the functionality of site

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.099 
it comes with the functionality of site
imaging<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.580> down<00:00:29.699> image<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.480> when<00:00:30.869> we're

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
imaging and down image and when we're

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.840 
imaging and down image and when we're
talking<00:00:31.230> about<00:00:31.529> fish<00:00:31.980> finders<00:00:32.370> nowadays<00:00:32.700> we

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
talking about fish finders nowadays we

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.660 
talking about fish finders nowadays we
don't<00:00:33.000> just<00:00:33.180> have<00:00:33.330> general<00:00:34.310> underwater<00:00:35.310> sonar

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
don't just have general underwater sonar

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.520 
don't just have general underwater sonar
that<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.120> use<00:00:36.300> with<00:00:36.480> our<00:00:36.600> regular<00:00:36.930> transducer

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
that we use with our regular transducer

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.200 
that we use with our regular transducer
now<00:00:37.650> we<00:00:37.710> have<00:00:37.920> these<00:00:38.040> options<00:00:38.580> of<00:00:38.760> down<00:00:38.910> image

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
now we have these options of down image

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.920 
now we have these options of down image
inside

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
inside

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.840 
inside
so<00:00:40.050> what<00:00:40.200> sound<00:00:40.440> imaging<00:00:40.890> what<00:00:41.370> it's<00:00:41.490> doing<00:00:41.730> is

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
so what sound imaging what it's doing is

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.610 
so what sound imaging what it's doing is
giving<00:00:41.880> you<00:00:42.330> a<00:00:42.360> picture<00:00:42.720> of<00:00:43.080> what's

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
giving you a picture of what's

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.790 
giving you a picture of what's
underneath<00:00:43.950> your<00:00:44.280> boat<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:45.360> previously<00:00:46.140> where

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
underneath your boat so previously where

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.800 
underneath your boat so previously where
you<00:00:46.980> might<00:00:47.160> see<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.430> hump<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.060> bottom<00:00:48.510> or

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.810 
you might see a hump on the bottom or

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.340 
you might see a hump on the bottom or
you<00:00:48.960> might<00:00:49.170> have<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:50.250> darker<00:00:50.970> red<00:00:51.450> signal

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
you might have a darker red signal

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.440 
you might have a darker red signal
coming<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:52.800> your<00:00:52.980> normal<00:00:53.400> sand<00:00:53.640> transducer

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
coming on your normal sand transducer

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.140 
coming on your normal sand transducer
now<00:00:54.960> we<00:00:55.020> actually<00:00:55.380> have<00:00:55.650> almost<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.850> photo

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
now we actually have almost like a photo

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.610 
now we actually have almost like a photo
on<00:00:57.420> your<00:00:57.570> screen<00:00:57.840> or<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.050> actually<00:00:58.140> shows

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
on your screen or it actually shows

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.410 
on your screen or it actually shows
those<00:00:58.950> rocks<00:00:59.280> or<00:00:59.490> it<00:00:59.550> actually<00:00:59.850> shows<00:01:00.120> those

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
those rocks or it actually shows those

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.080 
those rocks or it actually shows those
trees<00:01:00.750> as<00:01:00.990> that<00:01:01.650> image<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.160> your<00:01:02.340> screen<00:01:02.580> the

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
trees as that image on your screen the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.669 
trees as that image on your screen the
other<00:01:03.300> functionality<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.530> is

00:01:04.669 --> 00:01:04.679 
other functionality that we have is

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:06.709 
other functionality that we have is
called<00:01:04.710> side<00:01:05.129> imaging<00:01:05.609> what<00:01:05.850> side<00:01:06.119> imaging<00:01:06.570> is

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:06.719 
called side imaging what side imaging is

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:09.139 
called side imaging what side imaging is
is<00:01:06.899> it<00:01:07.320> actually<00:01:07.710> shoots<00:01:07.979> out<00:01:08.250> both<00:01:08.549> sides<00:01:08.939> of

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
is it actually shoots out both sides of

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.139 
is it actually shoots out both sides of
your<00:01:09.240> boat<00:01:09.479> up<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:10.020> 300<00:01:10.619> feet<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:11.340> each<00:01:11.520> side<00:01:11.850> so

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
your boat up to 300 feet on each side so

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:13.969 
your boat up to 300 feet on each side so
that<00:01:12.539> you<00:01:12.659> can<00:01:12.780> cover<00:01:12.990> off<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.500> bottom<00:01:13.859> and

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
that you can cover off that bottom and

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.649 
that you can cover off that bottom and
see<00:01:14.159> what's<00:01:14.520> down<00:01:14.820> there<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.270> we'll<00:01:15.420> use<00:01:15.630> that

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
see what's down there so we'll use that

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.660 
see what's down there so we'll use that
a<00:01:15.869> lot<00:01:16.079> more<00:01:16.350> smallmouth<00:01:16.829> fishing<00:01:16.859> say<00:01:17.369> out<00:01:17.520> on
