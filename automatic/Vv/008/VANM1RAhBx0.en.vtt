and for the base the base we have don't
have<00:03:47.980> much<00:03:48.160> detailing<00:03:48.640> but<00:03:48.850> I<00:03:48.880> don't<00:03:49.150> think

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
have much detailing but I don't think

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.940 
have much detailing but I don't think
these<00:03:49.540> cars<00:03:49.840> are<00:03:50.019> that<00:03:50.140> detailed<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:50.739> begin

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
these cars are that detailed to begin

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.370 
these cars are that detailed to begin
with<00:03:51.100> because<00:03:51.220> they<00:03:51.370> are<00:03:51.400> a<00:03:52.049> sports<00:03:53.049> racing

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
with because they are a sports racing

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.430 
with because they are a sports racing
car<00:03:53.830> you<00:03:54.549> got<00:03:54.810> actually<00:03:55.810> it<00:03:56.049> looks<00:03:56.260> like

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
car you got actually it looks like

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.110 
car you got actually it looks like
almost<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.860> exact<00:03:57.340> base<00:03:57.880> same<00:03:58.780> base<00:03:59.019> to<00:03:59.890> me

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
almost the exact base same base to me

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.120 
almost the exact base same base to me
almost<00:04:01.120> not<00:04:01.570> quite<00:04:01.630> but<00:04:02.140> almost<00:04:02.290> I<00:04:02.830> mean<00:04:02.890> the

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
almost not quite but almost I mean the

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.930 
almost not quite but almost I mean the
detailing<00:04:03.790> is<00:04:03.970> almost<00:04:04.360> exact<00:04:05.850> so<00:04:06.850> I'm

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
detailing is almost exact so I'm

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.080 
detailing is almost exact so I'm
assuming<00:04:07.650> that<00:04:08.650> these<00:04:08.830> do<00:04:09.160> share<00:04:09.489> I<00:04:09.760> don't

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
assuming that these do share I don't

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.140 
assuming that these do share I don't
know<00:04:10.180> if<00:04:10.239> they<00:04:10.330> share<00:04:10.600> parts<00:04:11.019> but<00:04:11.880> they<00:04:12.880> sure

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
know if they share parts but they sure

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.970 
know if they share parts but they sure
look<00:04:13.390> like<00:04:13.420> it<00:04:13.720> to<00:04:13.840> me<00:04:13.870> the<00:04:14.380> exhaust<00:04:14.709> work

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
look like it to me the exhaust work

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.250 
look like it to me the exhaust work
looks<00:04:15.220> almost<00:04:15.430> the<00:04:15.640> same<00:04:15.760> the<00:04:16.260> detailing

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
looks almost the same the detailing

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.729 
looks almost the same the detailing
where<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:18.120> engine<00:04:19.120> and<00:04:19.359> in<00:04:19.540> the<00:04:20.140> back<00:04:20.350> and<00:04:20.680> the

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
where the engine and in the back and the

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.300 
where the engine and in the back and the
transmission<00:04:21.549> and<00:04:21.729> the<00:04:21.880> tunnel<00:04:23.310> everything

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
transmission and the tunnel everything

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.070 
transmission and the tunnel everything
looks<00:04:24.520> the<00:04:24.610> same<00:04:24.700> to<00:04:25.060> me<00:04:25.210> except<00:04:25.690> for<00:04:25.720> one

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
looks the same to me except for one

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.690 
looks the same to me except for one
little<00:04:26.290> this<00:04:26.620> square<00:04:26.979> right<00:04:27.190> here<00:04:27.460> on<00:04:27.610> the

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
little this square right here on the

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.120 
little this square right here on the
base<00:04:27.870> if<00:04:28.870> you<00:04:28.930> can<00:04:29.140> see<00:04:29.380> it<00:04:29.470> there's<00:04:29.740> a<00:04:29.800> square

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
base if you can see it there's a square

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.950 
base if you can see it there's a square
right<00:04:30.340> here<00:04:32.790> and<00:04:33.790> it's<00:04:33.940> no<00:04:34.150> actually<00:04:34.570> that's<00:04:34.750> a

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
right here and it's no actually that's a

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.240 
right here and it's no actually that's a
square<00:04:35.169> round<00:04:35.349> sights<00:04:35.680> I<00:04:35.800> think<00:04:36.070> it's<00:04:36.190> the

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
square round sights I think it's the

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.060 
square round sights I think it's the
exact<00:04:36.490> same<00:04:36.520> base<00:04:37.200> anyway<00:04:38.200> and<00:04:38.950> get

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
exact same base anyway and get

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.980 
exact same base anyway and get
sidetracked<00:04:39.370> here

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
sidetracked here

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.720

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750

difference<00:05:17.290> in<00:05:17.410> the<00:05:17.470> back<00:05:17.590> and<00:05:17.770> I<00:05:17.800> think

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
difference in the back and I think

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.040 
difference in the back and I think
that's<00:05:18.160> because<00:05:18.280> one's<00:05:18.669> a<00:05:18.760> gt3<00:05:19.120> and<00:05:19.510> was<00:05:19.600> a<00:05:19.690> gt3

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
that's because one's a gt3 and was a gt3

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.620 
that's because one's a gt3 and was a gt3
