scoping I the traditional way kind of

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.970 
scoping I the traditional way kind of
involves<00:03:26.610> skill<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:27.510> go<00:03:27.690> 35<00:03:28.500> +<00:03:28.709> 0<00:03:28.800> for<00:03:29.100> 1<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:30.980> if

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
involves skill to go 35 + 0 for 1 and if

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.949
