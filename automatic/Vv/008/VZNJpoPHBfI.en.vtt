00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.189
 When I'm in the spotlight, each and every one of the crowd is full of exquisite 2 freestyle xr 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.900
 How to enjoy a little better and enjoy the pre-step rice 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.790
 I'll let you know. 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:19.800
 Hello , there's always a winner title in sports. 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:22.710
 So , what is the secret to getting closer to the backseat? 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:27.180
 Indeyo right tail that determine the game outcome immediately 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:30.740
 You have the right axis 4 that you can score in various situations. 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.740
 I'll tell you how to do it. 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.060
 Yes . 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.770
 Ah 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:52.600
 The best way to make a good shot and a goal is to look at the first character 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:57.820
 It is to be looked at and picked up. 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:01.030
 That way, you can shoot with a high probability of seeing the characters here 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:06.160
 I do not know how . It's simple. 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:11.380
 Pressing qt without pressing the white key will look at the character 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:12.910
 The second is that the timing of the shots is the timing when the opponent is not around 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.500
 It's called Mark Chance . 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.880
 No Mark Chance If you 're in juice, you've got your shot timing right. 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.170
 Will 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:26.200
 The fact that there is a relative player around you when you are shooting, 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:30.130
 Please just marketing know-axis 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:34.390
 Submit your opponent's shot once 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.740
 And test it to the player in the marsh area in the month area or cross station 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.479
 Try it. 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.979
 I can clearly feel that the tail is much better than when the opponent is in front of me. 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.540
 There will be. 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:51.850
 In addition, Busan is the case, the narrow, crowded the arena opponents of sbc 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:56.229
 In this case, even if medium shot shooting is very effective, 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:00.520
 Since you are here, it would not be too bad to try the house . 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:04.690
 Finally, I can not comment on Shooting Gage. 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:09.220
 If you chose to have a stronger shot, it would be easier if you chose too high 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:14.170
 Rather than going out, I sometimes get stuck when I come 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:19.840
 About two-thirds fitness shoes broken side's penalty area, particularly outside 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:23.530
 Shooting inside the penalty box is the time and the timing of the character rather than follow up the World 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:29.819
 It is better to extract the emphasis on accuracy 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.819
 Oh, so I told you so, I 'd like to go home and play quickly.
