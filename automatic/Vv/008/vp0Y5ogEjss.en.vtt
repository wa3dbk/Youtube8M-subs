00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
hair in a natural state that means it's

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.619 
hair in a natural state that means it's
curly<00:00:40.590> or<00:00:40.739> you're<00:00:41.370> making<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.879> be<00:00:42.000> curly<00:00:42.450> and

those<00:00:43.230> knots<00:00:43.620> are<00:00:43.860> on<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.070> end<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.550> if<00:00:44.700> you

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
those knots are on the end so if you

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.580 
those knots are on the end so if you
just<00:00:45.120> every<00:00:45.510> once<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.870> while<00:00:45.930> maybe<00:00:46.230> just

just every once in a while maybe just

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.639 
just every once in a while maybe just
once<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:47.039> quarter<00:00:47.719> blow-dry<00:00:48.719> your<00:00:48.930> hair<00:00:48.989> and

past<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.780> because<00:01:12.869> what<00:01:13.170> happens<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> lot<00:01:14.070> of

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
past it because what happens is a lot of

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.499 
past it because what happens is a lot of
people<00:01:14.340> want<00:01:14.520> their<00:01:14.670> hair<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.970> grow<00:01:15.119> and

people want their hair to grow and
they're<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.170> my<00:01:16.979> hair<00:01:17.220> has<00:01:17.340> been<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.580> same

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
they're like my hair has been the same

length<00:01:18.380> for<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.799> year<00:01:20.369> that's<00:01:20.759> not<00:01:20.970> right

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
length for a year that's not right

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.280 
length for a year that's not right
that's<00:01:23.340> like<00:01:23.820> wrong<00:01:24.180> you're<00:01:24.630> supposed<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.140> get

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
that's like wrong you're supposed to get

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.170 
that's like wrong you're supposed to get
six<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.770> seven<00:01:26.100> inches<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.700> year<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.540> growth<00:01:28.439> so

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
six to seven inches a year in growth so

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.429 
six to seven inches a year in growth so
everybody<00:01:30.180> doesn't<00:01:30.509> my<00:01:30.900> hair<00:01:31.079> grows<00:01:31.259> really

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
everybody doesn't my hair grows really

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.429 
everybody doesn't my hair grows really
fast<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:31.950> get<00:01:32.280> my<00:01:32.400> seats<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:33.630> some<00:01:34.170> people

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
fast so I get my seats but some people

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.929 
fast so I get my seats but some people
just<00:01:34.470> get<00:01:34.799> half<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.340> but<00:01:35.549> if<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.700> want<00:01:35.850> to

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
just get half of it but if you want to

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.450 
just get half of it but if you want to
maximise<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.630> your<00:01:36.930> growth<00:01:37.259> then<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:38.009> really

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
maximise on your growth then you really

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.420 
maximise on your growth then you really
need<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.790> take<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.150> time<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.829> get<00:01:40.829> those<00:01:41.009> ends

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
need to take the time and get those ends

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.429 
need to take the time and get those ends
trimmed<00:01:41.759> because<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.689> know<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.049> knotting

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
trimmed because you know the knotting

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.679 
trimmed because you know the knotting
that<00:01:43.590> I'm<00:01:43.710> talking<00:01:44.040> about<00:01:44.119> because<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.420> knots

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
that I'm talking about because it knots

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.929 
that I'm talking about because it knots
and<00:01:45.990> then<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.380> pops<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.250> it's<00:01:47.430> cutting<00:01:47.790> its

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
and then it pops and so it's cutting its

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.120 
and then it pops and so it's cutting its
own<00:01:48.119> hair<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.689> mean<00:01:49.020> your<00:01:49.409> hair<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.680> cutting<00:01:50.009> its

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
own hair I mean your hair is cutting its

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.800 
own hair I mean your hair is cutting its
own<00:01:50.990> hair<00:01:52.009> it's<00:01:53.009> taking<00:01:53.310> away<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.759> length<00:01:54.000> so

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
own hair it's taking away the length so

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.179 
own hair it's taking away the length so
then<00:01:54.990> it's<00:01:55.200> never<00:01:55.350> really<00:01:55.649> grown<00:01:55.979> because

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
then it's never really grown because

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.800 
then it's never really grown because
