00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.620
 niort 13th welcome nîmes 17th it's going very 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.450
 bad for the Nîmes who played during 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.550
 a moment the climb last season 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.220
 this season they won only one 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.590
 match on the first seven days 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.050
 Niortais side is better even if they 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.880
 have lost for the first time the 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.280
 season the previous day a 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.900
 defeat 3 goals to 1 on the lawn of 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.180
 caen 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.090
 the north is expected to find the 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.040
 way to victory at home they in 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.559
 have yet obtained that since the 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.010
 start of the season for 5 draws 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.839
 this is a record matches the null 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.309
 confusion about him level with the 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.170
 ball on the crossbar that's 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.120
 the best opportunity for 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.309
 niortais who starts to have a lot 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.460
 interesting situations and it pays to 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:02.110
 the 35th minute with the goal of jimmy roye 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.129
 his second of the season 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.100
 niort gets in an excellent 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:11.000
 situation with this goal scored in first 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.070
 period 1-0 and that free kick to carry 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.810
 the score at 2 0 the recovery of the head 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.090
 fled by Nimes in great 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.570
 difficulty then a second chance that 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.950
 misses 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.720
 again a countered center it comes back on 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.230
 the Nîmes keeper who captures him in 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.230
 extremis 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.750
 clearing directly in touch and 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.570
 the half time is reported by Jerome 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.380
 miguelgorry the referee of the meeting 1 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.420
 0 at the break 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.910
 it is not expensive paid for niortais 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.940
 enterprising but in private scale 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.730
 bong and injured hague side Nîmes 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.330
 Corrèze is touched and three players are 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:53.490
 suspended 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.770
 if sanaa close and especially granik a 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.240
 only victory for the Nîmes since the 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.890
 start of the season and it's gone 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.930
 to get a second one 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.420
 especially as the Niortais insists 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.060
 during the entire second period and 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.580
 get a penalty in the 87th minute 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.290
 transformed by kévin rocheteau it's his 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.290
 third goal of the season 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.080
 niort will surely continue on his 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.640
 5th unbeaten home run 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.940
 consecutive game without defeat at the 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.280
 House 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.470
 surely the victory even if the Nîmes 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.540
 react in stoppages with 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.030

 crocos still maybe a whole 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.870
 last opportunity to try 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.160
 to tear off the point of the draw with this 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.739
 ball in the surface the recovery saved 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:48.120
