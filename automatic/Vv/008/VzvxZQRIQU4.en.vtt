00:00:19.706 --> 00:00:25.476

00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:35.868

 Jim: Bridget Brady, 40, a surgery doctor and one of the implementation enthusiasts and mother of two children 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.218
 But she said her last pregnancy left her something she wanted, a picture of her next child. 

00:00:53.501 --> 00:00:57.243
 Bridget: No matter how diet or exercise has been adopted, some areas of my body have to be 

00:00:57.538 --> 00:01:00.783
 Weak and low fat. 

00:01:00.783 --> 00:01:03.335
 I have to work on reduction in some areas.

 Jim: Despite having to reduce her weight, Brady did not rush to do 

00:01:07.703 --> 00:01:08.868
 Any treatment or process

 Bridget: There are a minimum of invasive techniques but I have heard of people 

00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:19.764
 It's painful and takes a lot of time. So I did not care about her 

00:01:19.764 --> 00:01:23.150
 Jim: Then I heard "Brady" about the new Venus Fries technology 

00:01:23.852 --> 00:01:28.519

 The RF element drives collagen and elastin 

00:01:49.447 --> 00:01:54.345

00:01:54.612 --> 00:01:58.607
 Good healthy skin with improved flexibility and texture. 

00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:02.661
 Dr. Walden: Treatment involves reducing fat and tightening the skin over a period of time. 

00:02:02.972 --> 00:02:07.263
 It is not an immediate cure but it results 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.065
 We have clinical studies to support this. 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:15.328
