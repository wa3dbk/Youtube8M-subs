the gameplay is poorly designed and

only<00:04:04.300> to<00:04:04.420> prompt<00:04:04.690> to<00:04:04.840> little<00:04:05.110> mini<00:04:05.380> games<00:04:05.680> the

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
only to prompt to little mini games the

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.280 
only to prompt to little mini games the
basic<00:04:06.520> idea<00:04:06.880> is<00:04:06.970> you<00:04:07.600> have<00:04:07.720> to<00:04:07.870> keep<00:04:08.050> bear

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
basic idea is you have to keep bear

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.110 
basic idea is you have to keep bear
alive<00:04:08.620> while<00:04:08.980> you're<00:04:09.100> doing<00:04:09.459> this<00:04:09.610> so<00:04:10.060> you

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
alive while you're doing this so you

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.270 
alive while you're doing this so you
have<00:04:10.239> to<00:04:10.390> keep<00:04:10.600> him<00:04:10.840> hydrated<00:04:11.220> well-fed<00:04:12.220> and

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
have to keep him hydrated well-fed and

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.970 
have to keep him hydrated well-fed and
well<00:04:12.790> rested<00:04:13.330> you<00:04:13.870> do<00:04:14.050> that<00:04:14.230> by<00:04:14.410> drinking

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
well rested you do that by drinking

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.880 
well rested you do that by drinking
water<00:04:15.280> eating<00:04:16.060> animals<00:04:16.540> and<00:04:16.780> sleeping<00:04:17.440> the

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
water eating animals and sleeping the

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.220 
water eating animals and sleeping the
idea<00:04:18.340> isn't<00:04:18.640> bad<00:04:19.090> it<00:04:19.299> actually<00:04:19.660> makes<00:04:19.900> sense

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
idea isn't bad it actually makes sense

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.590 
idea isn't bad it actually makes sense
given<00:04:20.560> the<00:04:20.799> context<00:04:21.310> of<00:04:21.400> the<00:04:21.489> show<00:04:21.519> but<00:04:22.450> the

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
given the context of the show but the

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.820 
given the context of the show but the
execution<00:04:22.930> is<00:04:23.500> just<00:04:23.669> so<00:04:24.669> terrible<00:04:25.480> and<00:04:26.080> boring

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
execution is just so terrible and boring

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.490 
execution is just so terrible and boring
and<00:04:27.130> ah<00:04:27.930> this<00:04:28.930> is<00:04:29.350> ridiculous<00:04:30.690> man<00:04:31.690> vs.<00:04:32.290> wild

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
and ah this is ridiculous man vs. wild

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.240 
and ah this is ridiculous man vs. wild
is<00:04:32.919> a<00:04:32.979> great<00:04:33.310> television<00:04:33.669> show<00:04:34.120> but<00:04:34.390> it's<00:04:34.630> also

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
is a great television show but it's also

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.430 
is a great television show but it's also
low-budget<00:04:36.250> we<00:04:36.790> software<00:04:37.390> at<00:04:37.690> its<00:04:37.840> worst<00:04:38.140> and

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
low-budget we software at its worst and

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:44.130 
low-budget we software at its worst and
it's<00:04:39.010> oh<00:04:40.169> well<00:04:41.169> I<00:04:41.500> guess<00:04:42.490> that<00:04:43.090> basically<00:04:43.720> sums

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
it's oh well I guess that basically sums

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.879 
it's oh well I guess that basically sums
it<00:04:44.320> up<00:04:44.410> well<00:04:44.470> said<00:04:45.040> bear

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:50.980 

watch<00:04:49.789> the<00:04:50.000> color<00:04:50.270> of<00:04:50.479> what<00:04:50.659> you're<00:04:50.840> cooking

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
watch the color of what you're cooking

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.920 
watch the color of what you're cooking
if<00:04:51.770> it<00:04:51.919> gets<00:04:52.099> too<00:04:52.340> dark<00:04:52.550> you're<00:04:53.210> burning<00:04:53.569> it<00:04:53.689> to

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
if it gets too dark you're burning it to

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.700 
if it gets too dark you're burning it to
think<00:04:54.860> it<00:04:55.280> isn't<00:04:55.639> just<00:04:55.759> enough<00:04:56.590> turning<00:04:57.590> that

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
think it isn't just enough turning that

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.800 
think it isn't just enough turning that
spit<00:04:57.919> and<00:04:58.310> an<00:04:58.460> even<00:04:58.759> speed<00:04:59.030> into<00:04:59.479> the<00:04:59.569> best
