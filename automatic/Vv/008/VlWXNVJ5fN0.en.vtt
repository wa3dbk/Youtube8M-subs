00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
capacitors which have been installed

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.430 
capacitors which have been installed
into<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.530> existing<00:00:38.219> cans<00:00:38.809> so<00:00:39.809> we<00:00:39.960> have<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> nice

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
into the existing cans so we have a nice

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.850 
into the existing cans so we have a nice
original<00:00:40.860> look<00:00:41.340> underneath<00:00:42.260> and<00:00:43.260> we<00:00:43.500> got<00:00:43.649> new

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
original look underneath and we got new

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.700 
original look underneath and we got new
parts<00:00:47.840> one<00:00:48.840> other<00:00:48.989> thing<00:00:49.230> -<00:00:49.379> be<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
parts one other thing - be on the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.970 
parts one other thing - be on the
lookout<00:00:49.829> for<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.670> these<00:00:50.820> sets<00:00:51.149> is

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
lookout for on these sets is

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.490 
lookout for on these sets is
deteriorating<00:00:52.980> terminal<00:00:53.850> strips<00:00:54.239> like<00:00:55.230> this

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
deteriorating terminal strips like this

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.670 
deteriorating terminal strips like this
right<00:00:55.770> here<00:00:56.570> those<00:00:57.570> deteriorate<00:00:58.230> because<00:00:58.379> of

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
right here those deteriorate because of

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.590 
right here those deteriorate because of
the<00:00:58.739> extreme<00:00:59.219> heat<00:00:59.489> generated<00:01:00.180> by<00:01:00.359> those

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
the extreme heat generated by those

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.000 
the extreme heat generated by those
power<00:01:01.140> resistors<00:01:03.199> they<00:01:04.199> get<00:01:04.379> super<00:01:04.650> hot<00:01:04.979> and

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
power resistors they get super hot and

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.149 
power resistors they get super hot and
don't<00:01:05.369> burn<00:01:05.729> those<00:01:05.939> things<00:01:06.240> away<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:07.159> that's

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
don't burn those things away so that's

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.130 
don't burn those things away so that's
kind<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.549> proof<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.390> set<00:01:09.659> didn't<00:01:09.960> see

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
kind of proof that this set didn't see

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.820 
kind of proof that this set didn't see
too<00:01:11.070> many<00:01:11.280> hours<00:01:11.520> throughout<00:01:12.090> its<00:01:12.330> lifetime

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.710 

we<00:01:16.830> also<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.630> tube<00:01:18.630> type<00:01:20.390> three<00:01:21.390> point

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
we also have the tube type three point

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.260 
we also have the tube type three point
five<00:01:21.990> eight<00:01:22.229> mega<00:01:22.530> cycle<00:01:23.159> crystal<00:01:27.950> here's<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
five eight mega cycle crystal here's the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:40.070 
five eight mega cycle crystal here's the
delay<00:01:30.270> line<00:01:31.520> May<00:01:32.520> eleventh<00:01:33.200> 1964

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.760 

so<00:01:41.080> this<00:01:41.229> thing<00:01:41.470> is<00:01:41.619> essentially<00:01:42.490> complete

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
so this thing is essentially complete

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.710 
so this thing is essentially complete
while<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.920> potentiometers<00:01:45.820> are<00:01:46.030> cleaned

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.289 

tuner<00:01:49.720> just<00:01:49.930> needs<00:01:50.140> to<00:01:50.290> be<00:01:50.409> cleaned<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:52.090> know

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
tuner just needs to be cleaned you know

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:53.940 
tuner just needs to be cleaned you know
we<00:01:52.450> should<00:01:52.659> pretty<00:01:53.049> much<00:01:53.140> be<00:01:53.290> ready<00:01:53.650> to<00:01:53.799> give

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
we should pretty much be ready to give

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.649 
we should pretty much be ready to give
it<00:01:54.100> a<00:01:54.159> test<00:01:54.369> run<00:01:56.759> as<00:01:57.759> for<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.090> mechanical

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
it a test run as for the mechanical

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.830 
it a test run as for the mechanical
portion<00:02:00.270> we've<00:02:01.270> got<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:04.090> band<00:02:04.360> straps

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
portion we've got the the band straps

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.440 
portion we've got the the band straps
for<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.229> CRT<00:02:05.860> because<00:02:06.159> obviously<00:02:06.850> that's

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
for the CRT because obviously that's

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.280 
for the CRT because obviously that's
removed<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:12.070> reason<00:02:12.400> that's<00:02:12.519> removed<00:02:13.290> just

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
removed the reason that's removed just

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.870 
removed the reason that's removed just
because<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.650> CRT<00:02:15.070> had<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.250> little<00:02:15.459> bit<00:02:15.670> of<00:02:15.760> a

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
because the CRT had a little bit of a

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.910 
because the CRT had a little bit of a
problem<00:02:18.209> deteriorating<00:02:19.209> lens<00:02:19.450> seal<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:20.200> it

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
problem deteriorating lens seal and it

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.590 
problem deteriorating lens seal and it
accumulates<00:02:21.459> oil<00:02:21.730> at<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.060> bottom<00:02:22.420> of<00:02:22.510> the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
accumulates oil at the bottom of the

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.180 
accumulates oil at the bottom of the
cabinet<00:02:22.810> here<00:02:25.380> so<00:02:26.380> that<00:02:26.470> needs<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:26.800> be<00:02:26.890> cleaned

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
cabinet here so that needs to be cleaned

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.970 
cabinet here so that needs to be cleaned
with<00:02:27.400> hot<00:02:27.640> water<00:02:28.140> because<00:02:29.140> that's<00:02:29.380> basically

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
with hot water because that's basically

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:39.600 
with hot water because that's basically
a<00:02:31.019> highly<00:02:32.019> viscous<00:02:32.700> oil<00:02:33.700> down<00:02:34.239> there<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:39.370> here

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
a highly viscous oil down there so here

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.660 
a highly viscous oil down there so here
it<00:02:39.700> is<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:41.680> 21<00:02:42.100> FB<00:02:42.580> P<00:02:42.819> 22<00:02:43.239> I<00:02:43.950> have<00:02:44.950> it<00:02:45.070> supported

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
it is the 21 FB P 22 I have it supported

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.020 
it is the 21 FB P 22 I have it supported

perimeter at a screen that's because

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.240 
perimeter at a screen that's because
that<00:03:14.769> oily<00:03:15.690> deteriorating<00:03:16.690> lens<00:03:17.019> seal<00:03:17.380> turns

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
that oily deteriorating lens seal turns

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.110 
that oily deteriorating lens seal turns
into<00:03:18.459> a<00:03:18.549> kind<00:03:18.880> of<00:03:18.940> a<00:03:19.060> gas<00:03:19.299> in<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:20.410> vapor

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.509 
into a kind of a gas in the vapor
accumulates<00:03:22.120> on<00:03:22.329> the<00:03:22.420> inside<00:03:23.310> but<00:03:24.310> when<00:03:24.430> you

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
accumulates on the inside but when you

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.509 
accumulates on the inside but when you
flip<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.760> TV<00:03:25.239> face<00:03:25.570> down<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:27.100> gravity

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
flip the TV face down the gravity

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.340 
flip the TV face down the gravity
obviously<00:03:28.120> works<00:03:28.359> with<00:03:28.630> you<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.049> it<00:03:29.140> takes

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
obviously works with you and it takes

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.110 
obviously works with you and it takes
all<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.620> oil<00:03:29.980> that<00:03:30.190> accumulates<00:03:30.820> at<00:03:31.030> the

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
all the oil that accumulates at the

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.780 
all the oil that accumulates at the
bottom<00:03:31.630> and<00:03:31.930> it<00:03:32.590> just<00:03:32.799> pools<00:03:33.040> in<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.430> center

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
bottom and it just pools in the center

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.750 
bottom and it just pools in the center
of<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:33.970> screen<00:03:34.650> so<00:03:35.650> obviously<00:03:36.220> that<00:03:36.370> needs<00:03:36.549> to

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
of the screen so obviously that needs to

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.120 
of the screen so obviously that needs to
be<00:03:36.790> addressed<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.840> lens<00:03:38.049> seal<00:03:38.410> here<00:03:38.799> which<00:03:38.980> is

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
be addressed the lens seal here which is

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.289 
be addressed the lens seal here which is
a<00:03:39.160> very<00:03:39.400> pliable<00:03:39.670> rubber<00:03:41.700> really<00:03:42.700> isn't<00:03:43.150> the

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
a very pliable rubber really isn't the

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.770 
a very pliable rubber really isn't the
fact<00:03:43.540> that<00:03:43.780> or<00:03:44.019> you<00:03:44.709> know<00:03:45.090> beyond<00:03:46.090> its<00:03:46.299> usable

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
fact that or you know beyond its usable

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.160 
fact that or you know beyond its usable
life<00:03:46.930> that<00:03:47.829> just<00:03:48.099> simply<00:03:48.459> comes<00:03:48.700> off<00:03:49.000> clean<00:03:49.989> it

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
life that just simply comes off clean it

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.790 
life that just simply comes off clean it
good<00:03:50.379> with<00:03:50.650> hot<00:03:51.190> soapy<00:03:51.760> water<00:03:51.790> and<00:03:52.330> then

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
good with hot soapy water and then

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
good with hot soapy water and then
use<00:03:54.010> a<00:03:54.040> rubber<00:03:54.520> renew<00:03:55.150> chemical<00:03:56.640> kind<00:03:57.640> of

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
use a rubber renew chemical kind of

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.320 
use a rubber renew chemical kind of
treats<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.270> robber<00:03:59.370> and<00:04:00.370> kind<00:04:00.820> of<00:04:00.910> gives<00:04:01.060> it<00:04:01.180> a

treats the robber and kind of gives it a

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.440 
treats the robber and kind of gives it a
new<00:04:01.780> life<00:04:02.520> like<00:04:03.520> I<00:04:03.580> said<00:04:03.760> it's<00:04:03.880> still<00:04:04.090> it's

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
new life like I said it's still it's

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.300 
new life like I said it's still it's
still<00:04:04.510> nice<00:04:04.810> and<00:04:04.840> flexible<00:04:05.470> they<00:04:05.740> always<00:04:06.070> are

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
still nice and flexible they always are

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.830 
still nice and flexible they always are
you<00:04:06.340> don't<00:04:06.790> see<00:04:07.030> these<00:04:07.180> dry<00:04:07.540> rotted<00:04:09.720> it's<00:04:10.720> the

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
you don't see these dry rotted it's the

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:18.720 
you don't see these dry rotted it's the
original<00:04:10.990> tube<00:04:14.100> 1964<00:04:15.100> RC<00:04:15.490> eight-day<00:04:15.850> code<00:04:17.730> and

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
original tube 1964 RC eight-day code and

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.660 
original tube 1964 RC eight-day code and
the<00:04:18.850> nice<00:04:19.330> thing<00:04:19.600> about<00:04:19.630> working<00:04:20.290> on<00:04:20.380> a<00:04:20.440> 21<00:04:21.040> fbp

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670 
the nice thing about working on a 21 fbp

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.980 
the nice thing about working on a 21 fbp
22<00:04:22.300> is<00:04:22.630> that<00:04:23.170> it's<00:04:23.290> not<00:04:23.500> a<00:04:23.530> bonded<00:04:24.160> lens<00:04:24.990> that's

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
22 is that it's not a bonded lens that's

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.010 
22 is that it's not a bonded lens that's
the<00:04:26.170> difference<00:04:26.620> between<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:27.190> 21<00:04:27.640> fbp<00:04:28.270> 22<00:04:28.840> and

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
the difference between the 21 fbp 22 and

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.770 
the difference between the 21 fbp 22 and
21<00:04:29.410> fjp<00:04:30.340> 22<00:04:31.770> the<00:04:32.770> fjp<00:04:33.250> has<00:04:33.730> the<00:04:34.060> bonded<00:04:34.570> lens

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
21 fjp 22 the fjp has the bonded lens

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.130 
21 fjp 22 the fjp has the bonded lens
which<00:04:35.050> you'll<00:04:35.260> see<00:04:35.320> cataracts<00:04:36.160> on<00:04:36.960> so<00:04:37.960> these

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
which you'll see cataracts on so these

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.290 
which you'll see cataracts on so these
essentially<00:04:38.830> are<00:04:38.950> much<00:04:39.250> easier<00:04:39.280> to<00:04:39.730> service

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
essentially are much easier to service

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.270 
essentially are much easier to service
but<00:04:41.260> they<00:04:41.410> both<00:04:41.560> have<00:04:41.890> their<00:04:42.100> shortcomings<00:04:44.280> so

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
but they both have their shortcomings so

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.890 
but they both have their shortcomings so
I'm<00:04:45.370> going<00:04:45.490> to<00:04:45.520> take<00:04:45.730> this<00:04:45.910> lens<00:04:46.240> off<00:04:46.570> real

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
I'm going to take this lens off real

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:54.650 
I'm going to take this lens off real
quick

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.740 

all<00:04:55.660> right<00:04:55.840> now<00:04:55.960> if<00:04:56.020> you<00:04:56.140> could<00:04:56.290> see<00:04:56.500> this<00:04:57.750> just

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
all right now if you could see this just

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:10.200 
all right now if you could see this just
take<00:04:58.960> it<00:04:59.110> off<00:04:59.260> like<00:04:59.500> that<00:04:59.770> nothin<00:05:00.580> to<00:05:00.790> it<00:05:09.210> and

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
take it off like that nothin to it and

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.120 
take it off like that nothin to it and
now<00:05:10.360> we<00:05:10.420> have<00:05:10.570> it<00:05:11.040> with<00:05:12.040> the<00:05:12.220> face<00:05:12.460> down<00:05:13.090> and

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
now we have it with the face down and

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.180 
now we have it with the face down and
here's<00:05:15.130> all<00:05:15.340> the<00:05:15.520> oily<00:05:15.850> residue<00:05:16.980> simply<00:05:17.980> just

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
here's all the oily residue simply just

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.890 
here's all the oily residue simply just
pull<00:05:18.400> this<00:05:18.580> lens<00:05:18.850> seal<00:05:19.120> right<00:05:19.390> off<00:05:19.600> and<00:05:21.900> clean

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
pull this lens seal right off and clean

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:30.260 
pull this lens seal right off and clean
it<00:05:23.050> up<00:05:23.760> and<00:05:24.760> here's<00:05:25.420> the<00:05:25.570> face<00:05:26.170> of<00:05:26.350> the<00:05:26.440> CRT

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:36.720 

here's<00:05:31.270> the<00:05:31.420> oily<00:05:31.870> residue<00:05:35.430> actually<00:05:36.430> it<00:05:36.550> kind

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
here's the oily residue actually it kind

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.370 
here's the oily residue actually it kind
of<00:05:36.820> has<00:05:37.000> the<00:05:37.180> viscosity<00:05:37.600> I'm<00:05:38.380> gonna<00:05:38.680> say<00:05:40.380> like

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
of has the viscosity I'm gonna say like

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.620 
of has the viscosity I'm gonna say like
gear<00:05:41.680> lube<00:05:41.950> like<00:05:42.370> 80<00:05:42.580> W<00:05:43.000> 90<00:05:45.330> that's<00:05:46.330> about

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
gear lube like 80 W 90 that's about

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.060 
gear lube like 80 W 90 that's about
exactly<00:05:47.250> it's<00:05:48.250> about<00:05:48.280> exactly<00:05:48.490> what<00:05:49.060> it<00:05:50.070> what

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
exactly it's about exactly what it what

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.000 
exactly it's about exactly what it what
the<00:05:51.190> viscosity<00:05:51.550> is<00:05:51.940> close<00:05:52.210> to<00:05:52.570> has<00:05:53.530> no<00:05:53.740> odor

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
the viscosity is close to has no odor

00:05:54.010 --> 00:06:00.180 
the viscosity is close to has no odor
though<00:05:56.430> so<00:05:57.430> that's<00:05:57.580> pretty<00:05:57.820> much<00:05:58.030> it<00:05:59.190> this

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
though so that's pretty much it this

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.880 
though so that's pretty much it this
gets<00:06:00.490> cleaned<00:06:00.669> up<00:06:01.030> I'll<00:06:01.570> bring<00:06:02.050> this<00:06:02.260> upstairs

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
gets cleaned up I'll bring this upstairs

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.120 
gets cleaned up I'll bring this upstairs
in<00:06:03.310> the<00:06:03.970> Mike<00:06:04.150> Raj<00:06:04.419> and<00:06:04.840> use<00:06:05.410> some<00:06:05.590> hot<00:06:05.770> water
