00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
but here we go let's go ahead minimize

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.209 
but here we go let's go ahead minimize
that<00:01:49.850> and<00:01:50.590> let's<00:01:51.590> go<00:01:51.740> ahead<00:01:51.799> and<00:01:51.920> get<00:01:52.070> rid<00:01:52.159> of

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
that and let's go ahead and get rid of

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:53.380 
that and let's go ahead and get rid of
Google<00:01:52.579> or<00:01:52.670> so<00:01:52.850> you<00:01:52.909> see<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.149> comparison

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
Google or so you see the comparison

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.789 
Google or so you see the comparison
there<00:01:53.689> the<00:01:53.840> trees<00:01:54.109> I<00:01:54.229> just<00:01:54.409> want<00:01:54.530> to<00:01:54.619> put<00:01:54.770> that

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
there the trees I just want to put that

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.669 
there the trees I just want to put that
up<00:01:55.100> I<00:01:55.689> think<00:01:56.689> it's<00:01:56.810> good<00:01:56.869> to<00:01:56.929> compare<00:01:57.289> stop<00:01:57.560> the

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
up I think it's good to compare stop the

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:00.819 
up I think it's good to compare stop the
earth<00:01:57.799> we<00:01:58.100> can<00:01:58.340> when<00:01:58.579> we<00:01:58.610> can<00:01:59.320> but<00:02:00.320> I'm<00:02:00.439> here<00:02:00.710> to

in it go for it but let's take a look
let's<00:02:45.349> starting<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:46.129> start<00:02:46.970> down<00:02:47.150> here<00:02:47.180> in<00:02:47.810> the

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
let's starting a start down here in the

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.400 
let's starting a start down here in the
middle<00:02:48.079> of<00:02:48.260> it<00:02:48.440> where<00:02:49.250> you've<00:02:49.430> got<00:02:50.140> wood<00:02:51.140> looks

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
middle of it where you've got wood looks

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.349 
middle of it where you've got wood looks
to<00:02:51.530> be<00:02:51.650> pretty<00:02:51.680> much<00:02:52.310> like<00:02:52.579> a<00:02:52.609> forest<00:02:53.120> on<00:02:53.329> earth

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
to be pretty much like a forest on earth

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.720 
to be pretty much like a forest on earth
most<00:02:53.959> forest<00:02:54.410> look<00:02:54.650> just<00:02:54.889> like<00:02:55.069> this<00:02:55.310> if<00:02:55.609> you

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
most forest look just like this if you

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.140 
most forest look just like this if you
look<00:02:55.940> at<00:02:56.090> it<00:02:56.209> from<00:02:56.299> google<00:02:56.690> earth<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:59.000> know

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150

you've<00:02:59.389> got<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:00.139> mixed<00:03:00.410> max<00:03:00.590> of<00:03:00.769> shape<00:03:00.980> if

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
you've got the the mixed max of shape if

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.410 
you've got the the mixed max of shape if
you<00:03:01.220> look<00:03:01.370> at<00:03:01.489> this<00:03:01.579> you<00:03:01.639> can<00:03:01.880> find<00:03:02.060> all<00:03:02.239> sorts

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
you look at this you can find all sorts

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.210 
you look at this you can find all sorts
of<00:03:02.630> shapes<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:03.260> all<00:03:03.380> sorts<00:03:03.650> of<00:03:03.739> things<00:03:03.799> but

of wood bunch of you know you see if i

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.250 
of wood bunch of you know you see if i
can<00:03:09.230> turn<00:03:09.380> it<00:03:09.560> tinted<00:03:10.519> a<00:03:10.579> little<00:03:10.819> there<00:03:11.260> it's

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
can turn it tinted a little there it's

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
actually help it but maybe maybe put up

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.339 
actually help it but maybe maybe put up
the<00:03:18.440> contrast<00:03:18.950> a<00:03:19.220> little<00:03:19.430> bit<00:03:19.810> yeah<00:03:20.810> let's

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
the contrast a little bit yeah let's

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.699 
the contrast a little bit yeah let's
reset<00:03:21.739> it<00:03:21.889> okay<00:03:22.280> i'll<00:03:22.910> sharpen<00:03:23.209> it<00:03:23.450> a<00:03:23.540> tad<00:03:23.780> okay

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709

some huge trees and i do believe that

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.559 
some huge trees and i do believe that
these<00:03:36.410> are<00:03:36.590> a<00:03:36.650> couple<00:03:36.680> huge<00:03:37.220> ones<00:03:37.430> on<00:03:37.639> Mars<00:03:37.940> who

these are a couple huge ones on Mars who

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:39.970 
these are a couple huge ones on Mars who
knows<00:03:38.840> how<00:03:39.109> long<00:03:39.139> they've<00:03:39.500> been<00:03:39.530> there<00:03:39.709> and

living<00:03:40.329> to<00:03:41.329> me<00:03:41.480> that<00:03:41.750> just<00:03:41.780> goes<00:03:42.290> ahead<00:03:42.549> that

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
living to me that just goes ahead that

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.059 
living to me that just goes ahead that
they've<00:03:43.760> got<00:03:43.910> a<00:03:43.940> water<00:03:44.209> table<00:03:44.530> they've<00:03:45.530> got<00:03:45.769> an

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
they've got a water table they've got an

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.890 
they've got a water table they've got an
atmosphere<00:03:46.910> that<00:03:46.940> can<00:03:47.269> at<00:03:47.359> least<00:03:47.480> produce

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
atmosphere that can at least produce

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.949 
atmosphere that can at least produce
rain<00:03:48.230> in<00:03:48.470> some<00:03:48.680> areas<00:03:49.480> they<00:03:50.480> can<00:03:50.660> you<00:03:51.200> know

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
rain in some areas they can you know

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.569 
rain in some areas they can you know
well<00:03:53.959> that<00:03:53.989> would<00:03:54.290> be<00:03:54.319> acquainted<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:55.430> earth

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
well that would be acquainted the earth

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:56.770 
well that would be acquainted the earth
what<00:03:55.819> I'm<00:03:55.910> doing<00:03:56.180> is<00:03:56.269> acquainting<00:03:56.630> at<00:03:56.690> the

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
what I'm doing is acquainting at the

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.159 
what I'm doing is acquainting at the
earth<00:03:56.959> this<00:03:57.620> I<00:03:57.949> guess<00:03:58.160> on<00:03:58.639> Mars<00:03:59.449> is<00:03:59.780> a<00:03:59.810> totally

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169 
earth this I guess on Mars is a totally

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.259 
earth this I guess on Mars is a totally
different<00:04:00.440> planet<00:04:00.799> system<00:04:01.160> so<00:04:01.430> life<00:04:02.030> could

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
different planet system so life could

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:03.939 
different planet system so life could
evolve<00:04:02.479> totally<00:04:02.989> different<00:04:03.290> there<00:04:03.500> than<00:04:03.530> here

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:03.949 
evolve totally different there than here

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:05.879 
evolve totally different there than here
so<00:04:03.979> what<00:04:04.699> I'm<00:04:04.820> saying<00:04:05.120> could<00:04:05.389> you<00:04:05.449> know

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:05.889 
so what I'm saying could you know

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:10.120 
so what I'm saying could you know
totally<00:04:06.889> be<00:04:07.009> false<00:04:07.280> here<00:04:07.609> but<00:04:08.180> I<00:04:09.070> don't<00:04:10.070> know

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
totally be false here but I don't know

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.590 
totally be false here but I don't know
if<00:04:10.220> these<00:04:10.340> trees<00:04:10.549> need<00:04:10.820> oxygen<00:04:11.000> to<00:04:11.269> live<00:04:11.389> there

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
if these trees need oxygen to live there

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.240 
if these trees need oxygen to live there
here<00:04:11.870> on<00:04:11.959> earth<00:04:12.109> I<00:04:12.229> need<00:04:12.380> oxygen<00:04:12.590> may<00:04:12.979> be<00:04:13.040> there

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
here on earth I need oxygen may be there

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.129 
here on earth I need oxygen may be there
they<00:04:13.370> don't<00:04:13.549> but<00:04:14.239> from<00:04:14.570> what<00:04:14.720> everything's

there is water on Mars maybe there's

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.580 
there is water on Mars maybe there's
biological<00:04:28.009> life<00:04:28.190> and<00:04:28.960> what's<00:04:29.960> sad<00:04:30.199> is<00:04:30.229> this

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
biological life and what's sad is this

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.439 
biological life and what's sad is this
