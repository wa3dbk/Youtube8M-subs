actually<00:02:27.860> I<00:02:28.370> tore<00:02:29.060> apart<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.510> stamp<00:02:29.810> on<00:02:29.990> with

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
actually I tore apart the stamp on with

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.970 
actually I tore apart the stamp on with
my<00:02:30.230> bare<00:02:30.380> hands<00:02:30.880> awkward<00:02:31.910> so<00:02:32.390> yeah<00:02:32.980> but

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
my bare hands awkward so yeah but

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.390 
my bare hands awkward so yeah but
whatever

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
whatever

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.800 
whatever
it's<00:02:34.670> pretty<00:02:35.030> time<00:02:35.270> though<00:02:35.420> it's<00:02:35.600> really

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
it's pretty time though it's really

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.979 
it's pretty time though it's really
really<00:02:36.170> thin<00:02:36.640> like<00:02:38.560> super<00:02:39.560> super<00:02:40.100> thin<00:02:40.989> the

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
really thin like super super thin the

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.640 
really thin like super super thin the
bullet<00:02:42.770> yeah<00:02:43.750> so<00:02:44.750> here's<00:02:44.959> my<00:02:45.110> little<00:02:45.260> liquid

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
bullet yeah so here's my little liquid

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.030 
bullet yeah so here's my little liquid
bottle

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
bottle

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.699 
bottle
I<00:02:46.450> think<00:02:47.450> that's<00:02:47.570> pretty<00:02:47.900> full<00:02:48.260> right<00:02:48.440> now

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
I think that's pretty full right now

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.479 
I think that's pretty full right now
I'll<00:02:48.950> probably<00:02:49.280> just<00:02:49.670> dump<00:02:50.090> some<00:02:50.270> of<00:02:50.510> this<00:02:50.600> out

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
I'll probably just dump some of this out

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.920 
I'll probably just dump some of this out
okay<00:02:52.489> so<00:02:52.550> without<00:02:52.730> telling<00:02:53.030> it<00:02:53.300> out<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:53.690> now

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
okay so without telling it out and now

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.920 
okay so without telling it out and now
you<00:02:54.350> can<00:02:54.530> see<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.890> level<00:02:55.220> at<00:02:55.280> which<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:55.610> is<00:02:55.930> I'm

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
you can see the level at which it is I'm

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.600 
you can see the level at which it is I'm
so<00:02:58.060> you<00:02:59.060> can<00:02:59.209> see<00:02:59.390> a<00:02:59.420> little<00:02:59.570> better<00:02:59.810> okay<00:03:00.610> so

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
so you can see a little better okay so

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.540 
so you can see a little better okay so
here<00:03:01.970> we<00:03:02.000> go<00:03:02.270> and<00:03:02.540> for<00:03:03.320> my<00:03:03.410> Tampax<00:03:03.890> pearl<00:03:04.280> I've

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
here we go and for my Tampax pearl I've

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.820 
here we go and for my Tampax pearl I've
had<00:03:04.940> to<00:03:05.090> show<00:03:05.239> you<00:03:05.300> in<00:03:05.570> different<00:03:05.930> way<00:03:06.050> so<00:03:06.739> you

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
had to show you in different way so you

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.320 
had to show you in different way so you
can<00:03:06.980> see<00:03:07.100> how<00:03:07.220> to<00:03:07.280> expand<00:03:07.610> sideways<00:03:07.820> but<00:03:08.209> this

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
can see how to expand sideways but this

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.520 
can see how to expand sideways but this
one<00:03:08.510> expands<00:03:08.810> although<00:03:09.110> your<00:03:09.230> house<00:03:09.350> why

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
one expands although your house why

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.449 
one expands although your house why
don't<00:03:09.620> ye<00:03:09.800> to<00:03:11.350> which<00:03:12.350> is<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.500> good<00:03:12.680> since<00:03:13.280> me<00:03:13.400> as

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
older I think I left some of the water

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.680 
older I think I left some of the water
in<00:03:16.040> there<00:03:16.450> forever

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
it in the water wasn't actually that

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.490 
it in the water wasn't actually that
high<00:03:29.490> ended<00:03:30.090> up<00:03:30.210> is<00:03:30.360> like<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.900> warm<00:03:31.110> just<00:03:31.350> like

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
high ended up is like the warm just like

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.320 
high ended up is like the warm just like
absorb<00:03:31.980> to<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.280> top<00:03:32.720> so<00:03:33.720> there<00:03:34.470> we<00:03:34.590> go

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
absorb to the top so there we go

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.570 
absorb to the top so there we go
this<00:03:36.330> is<00:03:36.600> it<00:03:37.140> is<00:03:37.410> saturated<00:03:38.100> it's<00:03:38.250> like<00:03:38.400> I

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
watching it's kind of a wrapped around

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.500 
watching it's kind of a wrapped around
my<00:03:55.860> finger<00:03:56.690> there's<00:03:57.690> water<00:03:57.989> dripping<00:03:58.110> out<00:03:58.410> oh

all right so if you can do that the

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.600 
all right so if you can do that the
string<00:04:03.690> is<00:04:03.720> more<00:04:04.290> towards<00:04:04.980> one<00:04:05.190> side<00:04:05.400> than

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
string is more towards one side than

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.330 
string is more towards one side than
this<00:04:05.730> towards<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.209> other<00:04:07.070> so<00:04:08.070> I<00:04:08.100> don't<00:04:08.130> really

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
has two round coating on it has a weird

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.350 
has two round coating on it has a weird
design<00:04:34.440> at<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:34.770> bottom<00:04:35.250> I<00:04:35.490> don't<00:04:35.669> know<00:04:36.180> what

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
design at the bottom I don't know what

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.640 
design at the bottom I don't know what
that<00:04:36.540> is<00:04:36.720> all<00:04:36.990> about<00:04:38.479> and<00:04:39.479> at<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:39.750> top<00:04:40.050> might<00:04:40.470> I

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
that is all about and at the top might I

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.380 
that is all about and at the top might I
wouldn't<00:04:40.979> really<00:04:41.100> hurt<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:41.610> top<00:04:41.850> part<00:04:42.090> starts

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
wouldn't really hurt the top part starts

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.090 
wouldn't really hurt the top part starts
coming<00:04:42.660> out<00:04:42.720> a<00:04:42.780> little<00:04:42.900> bit<00:04:43.080> which<00:04:43.950> I<00:04:44.040> don't

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
coming out a little bit which I don't

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.750 
coming out a little bit which I don't
really<00:04:44.310> like

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
really like

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.870 
really like
however<00:04:45.210> the<00:04:45.960> tampon<00:04:46.470> wears<00:04:46.800> really<00:04:47.160> well<00:04:47.310> and

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
however the tampon wears really well and

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.100 
however the tampon wears really well and
there's<00:04:48.570> like<00:04:48.840> minimal<00:04:49.580> leakage<00:04:50.870> I'm<00:04:51.870> gonna

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
there's like minimal leakage I'm gonna

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.740 
there's like minimal leakage I'm gonna
close<00:04:52.350> this<00:04:52.770> thing<00:04:54.140> there's<00:04:55.140> minimal<00:04:55.470> leakage

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
close this thing there's minimal leakage

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.680 
close this thing there's minimal leakage
with<00:04:57.750> it<00:04:58.220> which<00:04:59.220> is<00:04:59.400> really<00:04:59.580> good<00:04:59.940> because<00:05:00.360> you

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
with it which is really good because you

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.060 
with it which is really good because you
do<00:05:00.780> not<00:05:00.900> want<00:05:01.110> to<00:05:01.169> believe<00:05:02.150> um<00:05:03.650> it<00:05:04.650> explains

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
do not want to believe um it explains

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.550 
do not want to believe um it explains
nicely<00:05:05.580> it<00:05:06.150> doesn't<00:05:06.660> hurt<00:05:06.900> to<00:05:06.960> take<00:05:07.260> it<00:05:07.410> out

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
nicely it doesn't hurt to take it out

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.190 
nicely it doesn't hurt to take it out
but<00:05:08.100> because<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:08.820> string<00:05:09.060> isn't<00:05:09.390> that<00:05:09.750> strong

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
but because the string isn't that strong

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.530 
but because the string isn't that strong
it's<00:05:11.190> pretty<00:05:11.550> hard<00:05:11.880> to<00:05:12.060> take<00:05:12.180> out<00:05:12.390> in<00:05:13.580> like<00:05:14.580> so

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
it's pretty hard to take out in like so

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.840 
it's pretty hard to take out in like so
you<00:05:16.020> have<00:05:16.560> to<00:05:16.800> make<00:05:17.100> sure<00:05:17.340> you're<00:05:17.550> pretty

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
you have to make sure you're pretty

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.480 
you have to make sure you're pretty
careful<00:05:18.360> and<00:05:18.600> that<00:05:19.200> you<00:05:19.380> really<00:05:19.740> relaxed<00:05:20.130> that

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
careful and that you really relaxed that

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.670 
careful and that you really relaxed that
it<00:05:20.640> comes<00:05:20.820> out<00:05:21.000> pretty<00:05:21.180> easy<00:05:21.450> but<00:05:22.410> it<00:05:22.560> is

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
it comes out pretty easy but it is

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.129 
it comes out pretty easy but it is
actually<00:05:22.860> really<00:05:23.160> good<00:05:23.370> fan<00:05:23.550> fun
