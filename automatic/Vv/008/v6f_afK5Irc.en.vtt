big bonus is that this is exactly the
same<00:02:35.970> battery<00:02:36.420> that<00:02:36.630> our<00:02:36.750> Nikon<00:02:37.170> DF<00:02:37.560> stake<00:02:37.980> so

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
same battery that our Nikon DF stake so

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.950 
same battery that our Nikon DF stake so
it's<00:02:38.940> going<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.180> be<00:02:39.270> really<00:02:39.510> nice<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.810> be<00:02:39.840> able

it's going to be really nice to be able

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.140 
it's going to be really nice to be able
to<00:02:40.110> just<00:02:40.320> charge<00:02:40.890> one<00:02:41.100> battery<00:02:41.400> system<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.060> it

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
to just charge one battery system and it

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.500 
to just charge one battery system and it
works<00:02:42.270> for<00:02:42.510> all<00:02:42.570> of<00:02:42.690> our<00:02:42.900> DSLRs<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:44.390> just<00:02:45.390> wait

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510

I just want to show you something else
and<00:02:48.330> here's<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.600> comparison<00:02:49.050> for<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.590> size

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
and here's a comparison for the size

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.180 
and here's a comparison for the size
this<00:02:50.580> is<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.940> Nikon<00:02:51.360> 5300<00:02:52.350> this<00:02:52.680> is<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.920> Nikon

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
this is the Nikon 5300 this is the Nikon

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.210 
this is the Nikon 5300 this is the Nikon
DF<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.910> this<00:02:54.210> is<00:02:54.330> a<00:02:54.360> little<00:02:54.690> Fuji<00:02:55.050> x100s<00:02:55.470> and

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
DF and this is a little Fuji x100s and

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.980 
DF and this is a little Fuji x100s and
from<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.820> front<00:02:57.060> they're<00:02:57.480> pretty<00:02:57.750> similar

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
from the front they're pretty similar

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.390 
from the front they're pretty similar
it's<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.230> little<00:02:58.440> bit<00:02:58.530> narrower<00:02:58.740> on<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.160> one

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
it's a little bit narrower on this one

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.330 
it's a little bit narrower on this one
not<00:03:00.090> quite<00:03:00.390> as<00:03:00.570> narrow<00:03:00.930> as<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.890> Fuji<00:03:02.190> but

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
not quite as narrow as the Fuji but

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.130 
not quite as narrow as the Fuji but
pretty<00:03:02.550> pretty<00:03:02.850> darn<00:03:03.060> close<00:03:03.240> and<00:03:03.870> now<00:03:03.930> from

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
pretty pretty darn close and now from

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.780 
pretty pretty darn close and now from
the<00:03:04.260> side<00:03:04.470> here<00:03:04.860> this<00:03:05.070> is<00:03:05.220> where<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:05.460> gets<00:03:05.610> kind

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
the side here this is where it gets kind

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.930 
the side here this is where it gets kind
of<00:03:05.910> interesting<00:03:06.000> you'll<00:03:06.690> notice<00:03:07.080> that<00:03:07.290> the

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
of interesting you'll notice that the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.150 
of interesting you'll notice that the
5300<00:03:08.940> actually<00:03:09.390> has<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.750> beefiest<00:03:10.200> grip<00:03:10.650> but

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
5300 actually has the beefiest grip but

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.490 
5300 actually has the beefiest grip but
I<00:03:11.220> actually<00:03:11.490> like<00:03:11.910> that<00:03:11.940> it<00:03:12.300> feels<00:03:12.510> better<00:03:13.260> in

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
I actually like that it feels better in

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.320 
I actually like that it feels better in
the<00:03:13.620> hand<00:03:13.890> then<00:03:14.220> even<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.580> DF<00:03:14.880> which<00:03:15.120> has<00:03:15.300> a

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
the hand then even the DF which has a

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.030 
the hand then even the DF which has a
little<00:03:15.570> bit<00:03:15.630> of<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:15.810> narrower<00:03:16.200> grip<00:03:16.560> here<00:03:16.860> and

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
little bit of a narrower grip here and

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.300 
little bit of a narrower grip here and
the<00:03:17.850> X<00:03:18.570> 100<00:03:18.930> doesn't<00:03:19.350> have<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.470> grip<00:03:19.680> it's<00:03:19.980> just

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
the X 100 doesn't have a grip it's just

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.620 
the X 100 doesn't have a grip it's just
kind<00:03:20.459> of<00:03:20.490> weird<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.820> hold<00:03:21.000> but<00:03:21.150> it's<00:03:21.300> so<00:03:21.420> light

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
kind of weird to hold but it's so light

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.900 
kind of weird to hold but it's so light
that<00:03:21.660> it<00:03:21.900> actually<00:03:22.050> works<00:03:22.380> ok<00:03:22.770> from<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.730> back

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
that it actually works ok from the back

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.020 
that it actually works ok from the back
you'll<00:03:24.630> notice<00:03:24.840> that<00:03:25.560> it's<00:03:25.830> a<00:03:25.950> fairly<00:03:26.850> similar

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
you'll notice that it's a fairly similar

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.360 
you'll notice that it's a fairly similar
and<00:03:27.530> nothing<00:03:28.530> else<00:03:28.620> really<00:03:28.860> that<00:03:29.130> special

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
and nothing else really that special

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
and nothing else really that special
about<00:03:29.700> it

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
about it

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.390 
about it
the<00:03:30.930> height<00:03:31.230> it<00:03:31.500> is<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:31.650> little<00:03:31.860> bit<00:03:31.980> shorter

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
the height it is a little bit shorter

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.090 
the height it is a little bit shorter
and<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:33.060> weight<00:03:33.570> it<00:03:33.900> is<00:03:34.140> pretty<00:03:34.440> pretty<00:03:34.920> darn

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
and the weight it is pretty pretty darn

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.479 
and the weight it is pretty pretty darn
light<00:03:35.340> quite<00:03:35.640> considerably<00:03:36.150> more<00:03:37.489> light

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
light quite considerably more light

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.030 
light quite considerably more light
weight<00:03:38.610> advantage<00:03:38.730> compared<00:03:39.510> to<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.660> DF

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
weight advantage compared to the DF

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.990 
weight advantage compared to the DF
partially<00:03:41.040> because<00:03:41.280> it's<00:03:41.430> not<00:03:41.580> a<00:03:41.610> magnesium

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
partially because it's not a magnesium

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.760 
partially because it's not a magnesium
body<00:03:42.390> so<00:03:42.660> it's<00:03:42.810> not<00:03:42.900> going<00:03:43.050> to<00:03:43.110> take<00:03:43.260> quite<00:03:43.620> as

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
body so it's not going to take quite as

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.590 
body so it's not going to take quite as
much<00:03:43.920> abuse<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:45.060> because<00:03:45.300> I've<00:03:45.420> started

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
much abuse and because I've started

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.720 
much abuse and because I've started
using<00:03:45.720> that<00:03:45.989> new<00:03:46.380> polycarbonate<00:03:47.220> one-piece

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
using that new polycarbonate one-piece

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.270 
using that new polycarbonate one-piece
molding<00:03:48.239> which<00:03:48.720> is<00:03:48.840> very<00:03:49.020> nice<00:03:49.200> also<00:03:49.770> built<00:03:50.130> in

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
molding which is very nice also built in

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.220 
molding which is very nice also built in
Wi-Fi<00:03:50.459> which<00:03:51.450> is<00:03:51.600> going<00:03:51.720> to<00:03:51.780> be<00:03:51.900> really<00:03:52.050> nice

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
Wi-Fi which is going to be really nice
