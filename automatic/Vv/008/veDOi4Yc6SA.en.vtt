tones<00:03:28.640> inside<00:03:29.299> this<00:03:29.540> app<00:03:29.780> sound<00:03:30.409> like<00:03:30.709> I<00:03:30.950> will

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
tones inside this app sound like I will

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.250 
tones inside this app sound like I will
apologize<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:32.329> sound<00:03:32.540> was<00:03:32.690> coming<00:03:32.810> out<00:03:33.019> of<00:03:33.079> my

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
monitors and going into the microphone

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.180

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
on my video camera so it's really not

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.430 
on my video camera so it's really not
the<00:03:37.250> best<00:03:37.400> sounding<00:03:38.060> thing<00:03:38.329> the<00:03:39.079> video<00:03:39.319> I'm

many petals as i want I got a noise gate
a<00:04:14.780> distortion<00:04:15.709> and<00:04:15.859> then<00:04:15.980> really<00:04:16.370> actually

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
a distortion and then really actually

buy and they have all sorts of different
pedals<00:05:31.069> and<00:05:31.370> things<00:05:31.719> let's<00:05:32.719> look<00:05:32.990> at

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 
pedals and things let's look at

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.379 
pedals and things let's look at
something<00:05:33.409> with<00:05:33.650> a<00:05:33.680> lot<00:05:33.919> of<00:05:33.979> petals<00:05:34.520> once<00:05:35.180> this

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
something with a lot of petals once this

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.779 
something with a lot of petals once this
one<00:05:35.629> delay<00:05:36.169> stacks<00:05:36.800> this<00:05:37.099> is<00:05:37.249> actually<00:05:37.610> kind

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
one delay stacks this is actually kind

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:40.719 
one delay stacks this is actually kind
of<00:05:37.849> pretty<00:05:38.060> cool<00:05:38.830> this<00:05:39.830> would<00:05:40.009> be<00:05:40.039> you<00:05:40.610> know

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
of pretty cool this would be you know

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:44.019 
of pretty cool this would be you know
sort<00:05:41.089> of<00:05:41.210> like<00:05:41.270> an<00:05:41.479> edge<00:05:41.830> sound<00:05:42.830> and<00:05:43.580> as<00:05:43.849> you

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:44.029 
sort of like an edge sound and as you

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:46.029 
sort of like an edge sound and as you
can<00:05:44.180> see<00:05:44.210> down<00:05:44.930> here<00:05:45.169> it's<00:05:45.349> got<00:05:45.439> three

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 
can see down here it's got three

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:47.140 
can see down here it's got three
different<00:05:46.069> settings<00:05:46.789> for<00:05:46.939> all<00:05:46.999> these

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
different settings for all these

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.339 
different settings for all these
different<00:05:47.360> delays<00:05:47.719> and<00:05:47.990> a<00:05:48.139> noise<00:05:48.319> gate

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:48.349 
different delays and a noise gate

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:50.050 
different delays and a noise gate
because<00:05:48.740> you<00:05:48.889> got<00:05:49.009> to<00:05:49.129> have<00:05:49.219> one<00:05:49.370> with<00:05:49.939> this

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
because you got to have one with this

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.700 
because you got to have one with this
particular<00:05:50.240> setting<00:05:50.839> it's<00:05:50.960> a<00:05:51.020> real<00:05:51.169> high<00:05:51.349> gain

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
particular setting it's a real high gain

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.369 
particular setting it's a real high gain
thing<00:05:52.360> and<00:05:53.360> then<00:05:53.689> let's<00:05:53.900> look<00:05:53.960> at<00:05:54.110> some<00:05:54.259> other
