00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.290
 a reality that is going on from 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.550
 so many years and yelling you are carrying on 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.940
 you 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.810
 yes it is a reality that started out as 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.980
 I said before by our great-grandparents and now 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.910
 we are trying to carry it forward 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.510
 improving the value of ours 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.510
 products 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.730
 doing our best 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.070
 activity that she rightly said 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.460
 moves with regards to 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.050
 goat breeding comes from a 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.450
 breeding 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.649
 of dairy cows and my father who had 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.120
 my father 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:51.600
 we moved to a farm 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:56.269
 of dairy goats trying to take advantage 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.269
 a reality that is 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.649
 as they say goat cheese is 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:07.360
 much lighter and much more digestible 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:10.600
 to less problems on diseases 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.860
 so we tried to push 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.799
 this is also because other companies are there 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.610
 full there are so many farms that 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:23.640
 produce the cow cheese 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:29.110
 goat cheese was a reality that 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:35.100
 could in my opinion can can go on 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.100
 and then to expand still a lot 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.490
 what does it mean for an activity like 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.899
 this is more than a 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.030
 attempt because the family is a reality 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.830
 already working in the sector for years to give a 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.840
 a little more structured sense 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.789
 agricultural activity what before that 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.490
 was a bit decaying and washes the roses yes 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.039
 it was a bit turning off it's a reality 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.190
 important because who can come to 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:05.289
 visit it and ii invite you to see it 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.879
 a real activity linked more than anything else 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.979
 so little marketing people 

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:11.230
 large and therefore more proper to the market 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.840
 of the door to door and of the customer 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.849
 occasional is an attempt to return 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.170
 to agriculture in a real way a little bit 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.370
 more structured than adequate respect 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.340
 clearly to what ours were 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.590
 grandparents and I believe it was a is a plus that 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.769
 an attempt the true desire to give a 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.840
 a little more concrete sense to many 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.550
 words that is to say in the end be in return 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.140
 to the earth and agricultural activities and since then 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.150
 really makes sense at work 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.879
 maybe I commission you something 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.530
 concrete and brings us back perhaps less to 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.060
 words more coffee facts she has 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.580
 the sector is well specified 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.010
 agriculture is a sector that is 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.170
 however perhaps it is the only one growing for 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.849
 as for Bergamo, it is not 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.110
 I say I say the regional data is there 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:54.140
 a good recovery 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.700
 and occupational and production interiors e 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.620
 then there is also taken from the point of 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.240
 view of quality therefore improvement 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.890
 that qualitative type and also 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.180
 quantitative this is a step 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.830
 important in regards to 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.200
 mountain farming that anyway 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.720
 has great difficulties with regards to 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.010
 the management of the land itself 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.680
 pastures and so on 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.050
 we believe that initiatives nevertheless 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.320
 how these increasingly value the 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.550
 territories should therefore be supported 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.170
 an agriculture miniseries of mountain but 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.600
 which however is a stone's throw from the city 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.030
 it is easily accessible because ce 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.740
 it is a stone's throw from Bergamo and then it is not 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.680
 not so high from the point of view 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:34.520
 height point a farm that 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.780
 sees the goat more and more 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.970
 Main character 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.220
 yes we must still diversify and 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.580
 clear that at a time when there is a 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:47.180
 strong propensity to consume products 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.160
 from obvious goat that diversify and 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.840
 then go towards the goat sector 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.190
 it can still be a big bet 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.890
 winning for the future 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.320
 in his speech he made a tremendous amount 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.150
 comparison you come from milan as I think 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.160
 and when he arrived here in the valley he has 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.000
 compared the red valley to a small one 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.950
 switzerland dress boldone tower though 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.049
 milan work 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:15.049
 it is true because arriving in a valley of 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:18.950
 mountain to find accommodation 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:20.150
 road access to the optimal company 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.360
 which will also allow access to 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.460
 car charges come to pick up 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.729
 we invest the hay milk a stable in 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:32.330
 lamellar wood meadows italy woods 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:34.310
 I say clean but we are in a bar of 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.990
 rose in switzerland because unfortunately us 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.140
 we are used to having this reality 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.720
 here with us that there was one for 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.270
 week of this actually because it is 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.830
 really is the best choice for the 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.600
 revival started from the primary of the 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.340
 nature of the things we had close to 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.560
 just underlined a very fact 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.729
 important is a bit of inaugurations that 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.789
 she's not here today 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:00.069
 practically the spectators are not the 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.930
 men but they are animals 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:03.879
 I must say that between the cuts and clippings that 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.039
 we undergo and what we must do could do 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:08.529
 make a sad statement today 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:11.740
 cut the ribbon of an initiative that 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:13.960
 definitely highlights and love 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.259
 and the attachment to the earth believe 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:20.139
 still that brought agricultural activities 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:22.180
 forward for 50 years and beyond from 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.860
 family and raise all to have faith 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.800
 in the territory faith in what you do 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.649
 above all to give a future to an activity 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.180
 agriculture that for years has really 

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:32.379
 materially fed the valley and that 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.939
 he had also allowed to live 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:35.680
 with dignity 

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:38.080
 I hope this business can 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.580
 of course continue successfully and 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.409
 that others follow an example because 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.129
 this means respecting loving the 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:44.319
 nature 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:45.610
 naturally grow and develop 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:48.990
 an agricultural activity that is one of the 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.990
 important voices for our economy
