00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
comes out of the discharge side after

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.690 
comes out of the discharge side after
passing<00:02:45.660> through<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:46.200> cooling<00:02:46.709> section<00:02:47.160> it

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
passing through the cooling section it

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.120 
passing through the cooling section it
always<00:02:48.090> remains<00:02:48.630> pressed<00:02:49.109> between<00:02:49.829> the

always remains pressed between the

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.530 
always remains pressed between the

rollers during the process

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.640

hence<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:53.040> machine<00:02:53.400> dry<00:02:53.810> cleaners<00:02:54.810> are<00:02:55.410> not

hence the machine dry cleaners are not

hence the machine dry cleaners are not
