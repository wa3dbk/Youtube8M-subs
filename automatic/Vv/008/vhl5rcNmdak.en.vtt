00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.100 
like this color gold even though I'm

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.620 
like this color gold even though I'm
wearing<00:06:53.160> them<00:06:53.490> right<00:06:53.520> now<00:06:53.669> I<00:06:53.940> don't<00:06:54.150> like<00:06:54.210> them

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:54.630

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 
like together on a necklace i guess but

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.290 
like together on a necklace i guess but
this<00:06:57.240> is<00:06:57.570> cool<00:06:57.780> because<00:06:58.639> it's<00:06:59.639> a<00:06:59.760> darker

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 
this is cool because it's a darker

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.120 
this is cool because it's a darker
soberish<00:07:01.199> color<00:07:01.560> I<00:07:01.650> guess<00:07:01.979> so<00:07:02.880> you<00:07:02.970> can<00:07:03.300> see

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.130 
soberish color I guess so you can see

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.260 
soberish color I guess so you can see
that's<00:07:05.130> what<00:07:05.340> it<00:07:05.430> looks<00:07:05.610> like<00:07:05.850> and<00:07:06.060> it's<00:07:06.210> just

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:06.270
