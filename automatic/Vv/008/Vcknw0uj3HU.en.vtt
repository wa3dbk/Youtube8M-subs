00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.110
 Today I show you pour sleek look 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.490
 quite simply many of 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.680
 you always ask me how carina 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.690
 can you make your hair so extremely smooth? 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.490
 look and not something out somewhere 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.050
 Today I'll show you some 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.730
 I use products quite honestly 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.829
 it's not special in any way 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.210
 technology I have there but so it 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.190
 in my opinion, really 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.440
 the products I use the me 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.329
 really help as possible 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.729
 smooth effect to create 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.170
 I know that I extremely rudimentary one from 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:46.149
 the hairstyle appointment is already 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.190
 Today I made the video from now on 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.289
 deduct because it's about products here 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.940
 or technology and not about it 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.159
 not freshly dyed on my hair 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.019
 but yes i know that i coach cesar 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:57.309
 must and the date is already and 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:59.139
 I'm looking forward to living long ago 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.670
 so if you want to know what 

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:02.829
 I use and how I use it 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.960
 remains yes is very important 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.350
 first, of course, the hair through to 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.539
 would come so you have no knots and 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.039
 so that's just better i have 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:13.119
 I mean yesterday I smoothed 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:16.149
 that's why I really have now 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.740
 very smooth hair otherwise by nature 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.750
 it will actually not the case 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.850
 but of course, of course, is important 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.500
 every hairstyle actually that one again 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.509
 combs out unless you want such a 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.969
 right macho look then we come 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.950
 also already possible to a and o what me 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:32.380
 This perfect sleek look helps in too 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.490
 And that is mainly due 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.189
 this stock exchange here 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.259
 that's a nasty one from coach didi 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.640
 Really expensive, I think 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.100
 it costs about 30 euros 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.560
 I have had them for a long time but for 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.780
 this yes she is smart here easy 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.880
 really a huge help and will 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.280
 even those in the real bristle village 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.289
 Wild boar is it and that helps the 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.329
 really quite good I can 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:58.030
 Show you shortly before that 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:00.460
 What would I look like with me? 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.409
 my smoothed hair I have 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.899
 Of course, somewhere a sleek look 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.880
 is clear, but it is keinster wise 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.770
 so perfect and me one of you always 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.220
 only asked if I brush this 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.160
 use 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.490
 and then quite normal your ponytail 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.110
 to do really well by brushing and 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.000
 whatever I do that I do this here 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.000
 side should so backwards 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.930
 it is all right now 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.550
 behind and relatively works but I have 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.680
 of course, any already 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.530
 rule the way and stand for it 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.959
 I use such a bug stick from kiki 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.100
 or chat I do not know exactly 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.630
 how to pronounce it 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.310
 In any case, it's just like that 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.959
 wobbly you can express it here 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.370
 as you can see and I will give it now 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.770
 just such an occasion 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.600
 so that you really nice works on 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.920
 head rest the hairs then stop 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.260
 but stand as a bit away as you do 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.239
 so you can see so perfect is that 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.130
 unfortunately not one of my hair 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.530
 but with it and in connection with the 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.660
 Brush gets the bomb-proof me 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.060
 promise you are just there 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.700
 until then your approach and the 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.830
 hairs that stand so and the rest 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.690
 to delete it then so to speak with the 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.010
 brush backwards that works like that 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.110
 bit the hair 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.190
 and then that really holds the 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:32.900
 there all day and then of course 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.790
 go through the brush again 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.810
 Unfortunately I have no mirror 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:43.610
 I hope that will be here too 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.610
 really the way it should look 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.180
 and he tells her that's it 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.310
 really a completely different number now 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.790
 there really is nothing left to go 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.829
 yes almost perfect and we want that 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:04.440
 Have allowed for this sleek look 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:06.239
 just do not stand anything so I have 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.640
 as I said no mirror because of that 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.500
 Please do not take it so bad if it does 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.299
 not quite perfect but i have to 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.760
 this display next door and I hope 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.650
 of course that it fits reasonably 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.180
 but it's about how I do it 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.650
 you see that that's so easy 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.470
 It's not because something is wrong 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.910
 make something very special 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.950
 but it really is really 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.690
 The two products I use the 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.289
 really help me very well 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.970
 there 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:32.520
 of course you have the possibility 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.440
 if you wear such a sleek look that 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.960
 they just just in the far tail 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.310
 I also like to do that day 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.259
 which of course is very nice 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.970
 me if you are so up to the top 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.979
 wears out instagram I have one as well 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.080
 Of course, a few photos here can do that 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.009
 also to such a kind chili hairstyle 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.870
 convert 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:51.720
 then you just take it 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.550
 A strand away and wrap around here 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.680
 your hair rubber around 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.410
 that was covered a bit 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.630
 and then you just stick it with you 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.030
 steady as I would here now 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.770
 stuck in the side and top and then 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.180
 It looks so cute 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.620
 Nice hairstyle or you could of course 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.050
 also one 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.120
 I would just wear it 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.770
 just look around and again 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.930
 stuck and then watched the 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.120
 of course also very cool as under 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.150
 nice and smooth with the ponytail 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:28.979
 looks like I'm still giving some brand new 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:30.810
 pure it is to sound mica spray so 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.520
 such a neat clan spray maybe 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.380
 Do you also know that marek n roll 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.880
 that used to be more often before 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.830
 and I just always thought so 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.610
 really very good alone the fragrance 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.419
 is a dream really and there I have 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.070
 too short for me 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.690
 bought this finish spray right 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.520
 was curious if you have me longer 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.740
 follows then you know that from gliss 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.740
 This clan always tonic tonic totally 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.509
 I loved that but I have to say that is 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.460
 now unfortunately really from his throne away 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:58.949
 been encountered that here is now my 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:02.419
 new holy grail in matters gloss and 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:09.050
 care and I just give up something 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:09.050
 your serious carina now fully sensed and 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:16.110
 I just spend it on a 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:18.240
 horse harness and that beats and 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.849
 I shone that I hope that comes in the 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.590
 Camera was really natural 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:25.020
 you have to be careful with that 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.599
 dosage so that it does not look finished 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.120
 these sleek look general think 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:31.289
 I for people who have no idea 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.550
 ever fast after greasy hair 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:34.169
 undress but the people the idea 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.849
 they know that the women of the 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:38.460
 can use a lot of mediums 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:39.000
 have our work so stick to 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.009

 also to these delta smooth hairs 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.810
 is coming without us now we are great with 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:50.970

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.660
 and then you can do that too you can me 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:56.310
 really like to write your tips 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.590
 For example, I know that many too 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:01.050
 So toothbrushes use natural 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.220
 fresh toothbrushes around these baby corpses 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.479
 to manage 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.729
 I have to say I have that honestly 

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:06.600
 never said it like that because I think so 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:08.220
 a toothbrush 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:11.669
 I do not know what there all 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:13.979
 head so through what I somehow like that 

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:15.570
 For a long time I'm too impatient 

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:17.550
 That's why I have such a time 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.260
 good brush bought for it and then fits 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.610
 We also like to leave that behind 

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.410
 your feedback and of course if you 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.520

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.160
 happy about it and then to the next 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.160
 Video
