and if you've got a color on the eyelid

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.300 
and if you've got a color on the eyelid
it<00:01:18.020> won't<00:01:18.260> cover<00:01:18.470> it<00:01:18.590> up<00:01:18.710> with<00:01:18.770> this<00:01:19.040> black

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310

now<00:01:50.150> the<00:01:51.049> problem<00:01:51.409> with<00:01:52.159> Asian<00:01:52.580> eyes<00:01:52.729> in

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
now the problem with Asian eyes in

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.690 
now the problem with Asian eyes in
particular<00:01:53.060> is<00:01:53.659> that<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:53.990> lid<00:01:54.580> oftentimes<00:01:55.580> is

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
particular is that the lid oftentimes is

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.429 
particular is that the lid oftentimes is
very<00:01:55.909> small<00:01:56.210> so<00:01:56.780> if<00:01:56.960> you're<00:01:57.080> going<00:01:57.229> to<00:01:57.290> do<00:01:57.409> a

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
very small so if you're going to do a

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.170 
very small so if you're going to do a
winged<00:01:57.740> eyeliner<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:58.700> need<00:01:58.850> to<00:01:59.000> make<00:01:59.150> sure

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
winged eyeliner you need to make sure

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.330 
winged eyeliner you need to make sure
that<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.630> line<00:01:59.869> across<00:02:00.439> the<00:02:00.619> eyelid<00:02:00.920> is<00:02:01.100> very

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
that the line across the eyelid is very

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.880 
that the line across the eyelid is very
small<00:02:01.640> otherwise<00:02:02.090> it<00:02:02.330> can<00:02:02.479> look<00:02:02.720> like<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.590> lid

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
small otherwise it can look like the lid

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.330 
small otherwise it can look like the lid
is<00:02:04.100> colored<00:02:04.520> completely<00:02:05.060> black<00:02:05.590> now<00:02:06.590> this<00:02:07.159> is

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
is colored completely black now this is

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.069 
is colored completely black now this is
where<00:02:07.490> it<00:02:07.610> gets<00:02:07.729> really<00:02:08.060> really<00:02:08.299> tricky<00:02:08.899> I

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:09.079 
where it gets really really tricky I

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:11.710 
where it gets really really tricky I
have<00:02:09.590> filmed<00:02:09.979> a<00:02:10.249> tutorial<00:02:10.389> doing

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
have filmed a tutorial doing

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.130 
have filmed a tutorial doing
wind<00:02:11.990> honor<00:02:12.350> application<00:02:13.280> on<00:02:13.460> a<00:02:13.520> very<00:02:14.450> very

wind honor application on a very very
very<00:02:15.770> hooded<00:02:16.400> I<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:17.330> show<00:02:17.630> you<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.990> trouble

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
very hooded I to show you the trouble

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.670 
very hooded I to show you the trouble
that<00:02:18.590> can<00:02:19.160> happen<00:02:19.370> because<00:02:20.180> if<00:02:20.450> this<00:02:21.020> area<00:02:21.470> of

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
that can happen because if this area of

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.380 
that can happen because if this area of
the<00:02:21.890> island<00:02:22.040> is<00:02:22.370> coming<00:02:22.880> down<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.330> being

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
the island is coming down and being

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.840 
the island is coming down and being
pulled<00:02:23.930> down<00:02:24.140> over<00:02:24.530> this<00:02:24.950> lid<00:02:25.160> so<00:02:25.400> there's<00:02:25.610> no

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
pulled down over this lid so there's no

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.330 
pulled down over this lid so there's no
lid<00:02:26.270> visible<00:02:26.810> you<00:02:27.410> are<00:02:27.440> never<00:02:27.890> going<00:02:28.100> to<00:02:28.190> get

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
lid visible you are never going to get

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.730 
lid visible you are never going to get
the<00:02:28.490> sharpest<00:02:29.150> line<00:02:29.420> that<00:02:29.960> you<00:02:30.140> really<00:02:30.500> want

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
the sharpest line that you really want

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.310 
the sharpest line that you really want
and<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.460> way<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.670> do<00:02:31.940> it<00:02:32.120> is<00:02:32.330> to<00:02:32.540> use<00:02:32.570> tape<00:02:33.080> and

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
and the way to do it is to use tape and

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.710 
and the way to do it is to use tape and
to<00:02:33.590> use<00:02:33.770> tape<00:02:34.190> as<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.430> guideline<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:35.270> do<00:02:35.600> it

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
to use tape as a guideline and do it

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.110 
to use tape as a guideline and do it
that<00:02:35.900> way<00:02:35.960> but<00:02:36.500> even<00:02:36.740> with<00:02:37.220> that<00:02:37.250> it's<00:02:37.730> never

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
that way but even with that it's never

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.180 
that way but even with that it's never
going<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.510> look<00:02:38.780> perfect<00:02:39.470> because<00:02:39.590> there's

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
going to look perfect because there's

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.360 
going to look perfect because there's
too<00:02:40.430> much<00:02:40.610> skin<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.210> too<00:02:41.390> much<00:02:41.600> fold<00:02:42.050> and<00:02:42.770> you

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
too much skin and too much fold and you

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.800 
too much skin and too much fold and you
will<00:02:43.490> see<00:02:43.730> this<00:02:43.880> and<00:02:44.120> I'll<00:02:44.180> upload<00:02:44.390> it<00:02:44.570> in<00:02:44.750> a

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
will see this and I'll upload it in a

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.780 
will see this and I'll upload it in a
week<00:02:44.990> or<00:02:45.140> so<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:45.440> you<00:02:45.530> can<00:02:45.680> see<00:02:45.950> I've<00:02:46.340> done<00:02:46.400> one

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
week or so and you can see I've done one

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.780 
week or so and you can see I've done one
eye<00:02:47.030> with<00:02:47.510> wind<00:02:48.320> and<00:02:48.680> one<00:02:49.160> over<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.580> push

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
eye with wind and one over the push

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.250 
eye with wind and one over the push
liner<00:02:50.030> so<00:02:50.209> you<00:02:50.300> can<00:02:50.360> see<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:50.900> visible

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
liner so you can see the visible

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.970 
liner so you can see the visible
difference<00:02:51.680> in<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.280> two<00:02:52.490> techniques<00:02:52.970> I<00:02:53.300> mean

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
difference in the two techniques I mean

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.440 
difference in the two techniques I mean
the<00:02:54.980> truth<00:02:55.250> of<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.459> matter<00:02:55.670> is<00:02:55.760> there<00:02:56.420> are

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
the truth of the matter is there are

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.150 
the truth of the matter is there are
certain<00:02:56.900> things<00:02:56.930> I<00:02:57.230> think<00:02:57.440> we<00:02:57.530> have<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.800> accept

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
certain things I think we have to accept

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.730 
certain things I think we have to accept
as<00:02:58.340> we<00:02:58.550> get<00:02:58.700> older<00:02:59.090> and<00:02:59.420> if<00:03:00.050> you<00:03:00.170> have<00:03:00.350> a<00:03:00.380> very

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
as we get older and if you have a very

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.090 
as we get older and if you have a very
very<00:03:00.980> hooded<00:03:01.370> eye<00:03:01.520> then<00:03:02.510> using<00:03:03.350> an<00:03:03.500> ultra-thin

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
very hooded eye then using an ultra-thin

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.100 
very hooded eye then using an ultra-thin
line<00:03:04.490> at<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.790> lash<00:03:04.970> line<00:03:05.000> or<00:03:05.450> a<00:03:05.480> push<00:03:05.810> liner

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
line at the lash line or a push liner

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.260 
line at the lash line or a push liner
brush<00:03:06.440> is<00:03:06.650> really<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.550> way<00:03:07.670> to<00:03:07.730> go<00:03:08.000> and

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
brush is really the way to go and

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.699 
brush is really the way to go and
there's<00:03:08.420> nothing<00:03:08.810> wrong<00:03:09.050> with<00:03:09.110> that<00:03:09.320> the

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
there's nothing wrong with that the

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.220 
there's nothing wrong with that the
whole<00:03:09.950> point<00:03:10.490> of<00:03:10.670> eyeliner<00:03:11.140> originally<00:03:12.140> when

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
whole point of eyeliner originally when

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.870 
whole point of eyeliner originally when
it<00:03:12.260> was<00:03:12.470> created<00:03:12.920> was<00:03:13.100> to<00:03:13.280> give<00:03:13.520> the<00:03:13.700> illusion

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
it was created was to give the illusion

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.740 
it was created was to give the illusion
of<00:03:14.180> thicker<00:03:14.510> darker<00:03:15.110> lashes<00:03:15.860> that<00:03:16.040> was<00:03:16.880> it<00:03:17.120> and

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
of thicker darker lashes that was it and

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.120 
of thicker darker lashes that was it and
now<00:03:17.930> we've<00:03:18.140> moved<00:03:18.380> on<00:03:18.530> to<00:03:18.560> different<00:03:18.800> other

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
now we've moved on to different other

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.320 
now we've moved on to different other
techniques<00:03:19.610> and<00:03:19.790> there's<00:03:19.910> nothing<00:03:20.180> wrong

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
techniques and there's nothing wrong

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.370 
techniques and there's nothing wrong
with<00:03:20.480> those<00:03:20.600> techniques<00:03:21.050> and<00:03:21.260> they're

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
with those techniques and they're

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.830 
with those techniques and they're
wonderful<00:03:21.890> but<00:03:22.430> you<00:03:22.850> also<00:03:23.030> need<00:03:23.330> to<00:03:23.480> be<00:03:23.600> aware

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
wonderful but you also need to be aware

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.330 
wonderful but you also need to be aware
of<00:03:23.900> your<00:03:24.140> eye<00:03:24.260> shape<00:03:24.620> because<00:03:24.920> not<00:03:25.100> all<00:03:25.310> eye

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
of your eye shape because not all eye

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.949 
of your eye shape because not all eye
shapes<00:03:25.910> are<00:03:26.800> the<00:03:27.800> most<00:03:28.010> conductive<00:03:28.820> to<00:03:29.090> those

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
shapes are the most conductive to those

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.170 
shapes are the most conductive to those
kind<00:03:30.500> of<00:03:30.620> you<00:03:30.860> know<00:03:31.130> different<00:03:31.370> techniques<00:03:32.030> in

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
kind of you know different techniques in
