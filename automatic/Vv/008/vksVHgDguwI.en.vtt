00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.090

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.750
 we touch a few temples we are 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.220
 how many templars and whether in the jungle 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.810
 more than anything, I'm interested in 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.630
 desert because those who are in the 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.349
 surface those of spanair almost always 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.689
 after I add what is tv 19 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:34.140
 contain what are the fucking chairs 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.530
 for for crazy and good horses 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.410
 the important thing is that it does not start the origin 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.480
 here what it said in a snow biome 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.149
 I do not know if you happen to them that good of 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.719
 done and we have level is removed but 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.930
 well it does not matter we have prairie we have 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.020
 swamp we have snow we have jungle 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:59.550
 meadow blacksmith's house a few 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.960
 crops and I will review in fact 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.960
 there are 10 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.690
 gentlemen, I'm going to check that I do not know if I'm 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.970
 recording now in little fear 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.490
 fast because then made videos us 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.140
 did you record 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.270
 good also contains then wolf 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.570
 pumpkins let's see what they are 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.570
 the stupid and sensual crops that 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.080
 it would be carrot wheat would the one of the 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.320
 potato chips that are the ones here 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.990
 that is, we already have all the most important 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.780
 and let's see what the house of the 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.490
 foc kings a day is not revenue to the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:41.429
 little wheel, let's see what it contains 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:45.750
 gentlemen are 59 are 10 10 ingots of 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:47.970
 excellent iron 12 loaves uco 6 trees 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.970
 and an iron breastplate 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.750
 well, let's go well let's go, gentlemen, the 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:58.020
 origin is that but I'm going to investigate 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.510
 on the side I want to see how much 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.000
 of snow and how much of a level because 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.510
 I do not normally like snow, I wish 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.460
 that is not much but as it is 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.190
 encompassing what is the middle zone 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:15.510
 even so I hope there is a temple of what 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.409
 that is either jungle or 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.560
 or desert in this case there was nothing 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:25.560
 they gave me the people of Puebla 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.209
 greetings to the people of puebla and hopefully 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.120
 Well, we found the desert with 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.190
 cactus always told this anecdote a 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.290
 I was once touched by a desert that did not contain 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.420
 cactus and can not do anything 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.310
 I had to restart my super world and it was 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.069
 a world that had so many pixelar of 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.069
 fact was my first world and I did not have 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.160
 I did not have what would be the fokin 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.319
 cactus or I think it's a wide desert 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.680
 combined here in the area about what 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:58.620
 it's snow but I do not know if it's going to 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.660
 have a temple I do not know we're going to continue 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.790
 exploring edited we went to what 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.110
 is being this is a figure 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.620
 I do not know if there is a 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.620
 temple 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.480
 I think not 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.170
 but what has been that that stone 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.750
 I imagined what has been a 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.360
 stupid and sensual temple that I do not 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.530
 appeared I'm not going around what 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.240
 asshole here what is being the 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.320
 desert is wide this broad 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:33.320
 desert but I do not see any temple is what 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.700
 that I'm not liking because I do not 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.230
 has left no temple be waterfall 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:43.070
 like lately the seeds of 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.130
 atv 19 in which it generates what comes 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.940
 being him 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:51.550
 the automatic world by the program 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.980
 automatic minecraft are not very 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:58.050
 good that is if they are the same seeds 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.520
 that the previous ones up to tv 14 I think 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.190
 but if you start a new world you 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.850
 leave greetings to jesus extreme or stream 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.890
 and 147 but if you believe a new world 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.230
 the truth will be a seed that are not 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.640
 very very good 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.209
 here I am playing a little bit with what 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.030
 it's been chance but it can not be 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.430
 possible to teach but hey he did not touch me 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:25.430
 I hope there is also a temple 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.949
 mushroom champignon 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:34.310
 I hope that here in the north north 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:36.460
 collective or 45 degrees if there is nothing 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:41.310
 can be 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:46.080
 monster can not be that there is no 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:48.030
 no any templar temple 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.600
 like the area is desert or is 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.760
 good but they are not giving me what 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.470
 I really wanted while you have all 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.420
 the biomass gentlemen here would only miss the 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.250
 mushroom biome 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.560
 because the truth is worth what they come 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.650
 being the 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:08.470
 As you want to say hello are worth the 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:13.110
 temples but I do not know if he calls or 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:17.610
 less the champions around here 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:19.650
 a bit of is the countryside 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.000
 here is the island did not let me see the 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.540
 message 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.960
 but hey here's the steep island 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.520
 I think it contains all the biomes 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.830
 it contains snow with him although the congress 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.000
 a little small because it contains forest 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.250
 Meadow 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.490
 I think it contains everything just missing 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:41.220
 check up here below and go and go 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.710
 where was the swamp area for 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:47.010
 see if there is a little witch house and 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:50.310
 if not gentlemen it does not matter because even so 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:53.040
 the witches although there is no house at 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:56.160
 better some people believe or man me 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.380
 they have misinterpreted what I always say 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.450
 to look for the houses of the witches though 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.840
 there is no witch house the witches go to 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.850
 go out 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.550
 but I like that he has all the 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:09.940
 structure of the seed for that and of 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.800
 done before I thought where is 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.800
 screen a there is a structure here in the 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.500
 desert that is like a pyramid I do not know 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.110
 How little I thought that there they go 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.780
 leave the temples in the desert but not 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:25.810
 have nothing to do would have said yes yes yes 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:28.540
 yes yes yes yes it has a witch's house 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.660
 gentlemen I think I think the bad thing about 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:35.289
 this seed 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:37.360
 so it was that I did not have 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:40.479
 good if he had what is being 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.939
 the fact I liked that is a swamp 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:45.909
 broad that we can build what 

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:48.009
 we want, that is, I like this 

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:50.490
 I was a little deep but I 'm another 

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:53.529
 type of swamps in which there is only one 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:57.520
 exist or a layer of millions exists 

00:06:53.529 --> 00:07:01.089
 a layer of water and the rest we could go 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:03.449
 will begin to cover but good this seed 

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:06.069
 it contains good good to do the analysis 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:09.520
 contains the most crops 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:11.940
 important contains the blacksmith's house and 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.800
 we got this 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.060
 contains all the biomes but leave 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:19.020
 what I would have liked 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:21.990
 find would have been a temple or a 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:24.480
 Temple of the desert or one of the jungle 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:26.520
 but still the important thing gentlemen is 

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.620
 that contains all the biomes this 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.820
 seed is randomly I'll leave you in the 

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.950
