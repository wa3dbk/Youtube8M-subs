00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
game and Glick actually out of manner

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.930 
game and Glick actually out of manner
and<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.350> does<00:02:28.500> seem<00:02:28.710> like<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.580> healing

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940

and it does seem like the the to healing
team<00:02:30.120> actually<00:02:30.330> has<00:02:30.600> like<00:02:30.630> an<00:02:30.900> advantage<00:02:31.320> at

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
team actually has like an advantage at

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.950

interesting to see if they couldn't do
it<00:05:41.760> here<00:05:41.940> but<00:05:42.090> you<00:05:42.540> know<00:05:42.660> we<00:05:42.780> were<00:05:42.840> talking

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
it here but you know we were talking

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.110 
it here but you know we were talking
earlier<00:05:43.230> and<00:05:43.470> we<00:05:43.530> actually<00:05:43.800> think<00:05:44.010> that<00:05:44.160> this

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
earlier and we actually think that this

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.180 
earlier and we actually think that this
group's<00:05:45.480> a<00:05:45.630> little<00:05:45.930> bit<00:05:46.020> easier<00:05:46.140> so<00:05:46.830> if

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
group's a little bit easier so if

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.190 
group's a little bit easier so if
fanatic<00:05:47.910> do<00:05:48.060> come<00:05:48.270> out<00:05:48.300> top<00:05:48.660> we<00:05:48.900> actually

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
fanatic do come out top we actually

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.110 
fanatic do come out top we actually
expect<00:05:49.290> them<00:05:49.680> to<00:05:49.890> make<00:05:50.070> it<00:05:50.220> to<00:05:50.340> the<00:05:50.460> finals<00:05:50.880> I

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
expect them to make it to the finals I

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.210 
expect them to make it to the finals I
mean<00:05:51.690> it<00:05:51.840> does<00:05:52.110> say<00:05:52.320> that<00:05:52.500> like<00:05:52.680> I<00:05:52.890> think<00:05:53.130> they

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
mean it does say that like I think they

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.370 
mean it does say that like I think they
will
