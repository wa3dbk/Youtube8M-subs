00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.420 
for two reasons one easier to cook yeah
and<00:02:44.840> secondly<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.620> much<00:02:45.770> easier<00:02:45.800> to<00:02:46.100> wash<00:02:46.220> up

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430

all baked in make it you have a very
similar<00:05:00.060> result<00:05:00.479> set<00:05:01.259> time<00:05:01.500> really<00:05:02.099> really

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
similar result set time really really

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.290 
similar result set time really really
easy<00:05:02.490> okay

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
easy okay

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.700

and of course you can make these way

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.260 
and of course you can make these way
ahead<00:05:04.830> of<00:05:04.949> time<00:05:05.220> so<00:05:05.610> what<00:05:05.699> you<00:05:05.789> could<00:05:05.970> do<00:05:06.150> is

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
ahead of time so what you could do is

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.360 
ahead of time so what you could do is
put<00:05:06.570> all<00:05:06.690> this<00:05:06.780> together<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.560> cold<00:05:07.889> sort<00:05:08.310> of

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
put all this together the cold sort of

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.189

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
mush mean creme fraiche then the egg

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.050 
mush mean creme fraiche then the egg
tomato<00:05:10.410> could<00:05:11.099> be<00:05:11.220> cling<00:05:11.430> film<00:05:11.580> to<00:05:11.760> put<00:05:11.910> in<00:05:12.000> the
