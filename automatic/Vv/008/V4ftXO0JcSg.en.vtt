00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.940
 hi to all of you guys and welcome back up 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.680
 a channel with usual is always me 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.269
 boxes and 90 and here we are finally 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.580
 returned with a bit of gameplay 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.590
 of time from the last but we return to the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.139
 great because we come back here with destinies 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.199
 here finally I got to try 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.820
 the beta this you see the beta between 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.590
 the other for xbox one so here's maybe 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.210
 maybe you can differentiate a little from 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.699
 other videos because I think most 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.320
 part of the videos you can find on 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.810
 almost all are youtube on playstation 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.340
 4 because why the beta suv and station 4 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.960
 it arrived earlier and therefore surely 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.059
 you have already seen many 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.590
 pictures on the sony home console e 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.090
 so maybe you can do it here too 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.550
 an idea of â€‹â€‹how it turns the game up a bit 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.290
 xbox one and I have to say to be really 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.239
 very very similar to the end 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.520
 so playstation 4 version here 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.289
 this certainly a positive note 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.149
 at the beginning there were some doubts about how 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.120
 could make this video game on 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.710
 plos one but I have to say to be 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.289
 quite satisfied here then 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.670
 nevertheless how I will play this 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.460
 videogame on playstation 4 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.650
 I have already ordered the console in 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.630
 bundled with video game I look forward to that 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.280
 September arrivals then to play at 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.040
 full game because I have to say about 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.479
 to have been rather satisfied 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.540
 from beta here and I already rather 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.119
 intrigued and enthralled by the video game that 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.460
 I was looking forward to having the opportunity to do the 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.810
 beta point to then implement those 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.909
 who may have only theory 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.340
 of ideas on what was destinies and 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.070
 I must say that I was not sorry 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.600
 by no means the video game itself is a 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.520
 stylistic level but also later 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.220
 especially what is important to 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.030
 gameplay level as it behaves 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.409
 video game 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.210
 here now 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.249
 and there with some of the aspects that I most like 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.140
 they liked to then maybe finish 

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:46.329
 with the negative ones I have to say 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.600
 I really have to say very few and this 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:52.659
 surely already makes you understand that the 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.429
 game promises good and above all me 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.420
 leads to being rather serene 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.829
 on buying this video game 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.509
 you know very often you buy i 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.340
 video games saying scazzi the trailers 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.780
 all Jews had children but the 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.880
 game is really cool then when you do 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.520
 play good lyrics looks just like that 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.659
 well then first of all the appearance 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.459
 important of this video game is 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.750
 surely the cooperative I have to say 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.970
 to be above all I'm unlucky 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.000
 because I did I played the first ones 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.190
 leave and often solo and I have to 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.930
 to say that some missions are not much 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.420
 calibrate yourself by playing alone because 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.980
 I do not think so 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.629
 matches are going to balance a lot 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.360
 where you play alone in the sense that 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:31.000
 are the number of enemies are those you 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.620
 revenue alone plus more people are there 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.660
 always the same role as enemies e 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.810
 therefore alone can often be a 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.180
 however the game is difficult 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.540
 played in a cooperative in my opinion renders 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.519
 much more if you played alone at the 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.060
 game really makes very little second 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:52.120
 me that is and this can be an aspect 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.860
 negative in the sense that if you 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.450
 had no one to play with 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.769
 right in your friends let it go 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.900
 were he even buying this 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.610
 video game because you might lose yourself 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.560
 much of the gaming experience that 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.670
 could therefore offer and do much 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.950
 caution 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.870
 the other aspect certainly not positive 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.190
 I can also say how it looks 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.620
 visually here they are rather 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.739
 satisfied now the game you see 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.180
 it's inside a building though 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.280
 especially in open spaces and so on 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.079
 it's a pretty sight 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.599
 I have to say are bullshit audi is 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.430
 rather pretty cool looking bed 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.079
 positive is that you have to help me out of 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.790
 turn it off the cellular task primates 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.370
 surely hears a ring 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.810
 that was my phone anyway 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.970
 leaving this the other aspect 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.730
 positive or whatever I like and the 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.440
 made that anyway our character 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.909
 at levels you can go to level 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.290
 in short, in this video game we have 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:43.390
 possibility to choose between classes 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.609
 different and what I play now 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.420
 and the witch the witch because a 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.970
 female character 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.909
 you can also choose the breeds you have 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:55.569
 three guys you can use 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:57.130
 choose sex if male audon is 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.810
 anyway the one I'm saying 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.370
 I like this question 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.079
 this fact that you can rebel against 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.639
 own character then you will go up by 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.859
 their level is improved 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:08.139
 skills you will learn new skills 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.060
 and it will also be possible to access a 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:12.459
 always give me stronger and stronger 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.780
 as it is normal that it is often a little 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.630
 bad thing the thing that bothers me is that a 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.970
 low levels normally not possible 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.680
 use certain weapons then maybe a 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.419
 you go shopping that this cunt 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.760
 weapon you can't buy it because it has to 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:28.270
 be at least level 18 perfect are 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.669
 a level 5 at level 7 today is the 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.139
 I will never buy that but thank you very much 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.510
 however it is beautiful but beautiful from the non mi 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.190
 sorry is certainly very reminiscent of how 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.810
 said in the stream where I have 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.610
 made with you where I have 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.340
 shown the game remembers so much 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.440
 borderlands the system that it was 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.810
 proposed 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.640
 it cannot be said that it is the same though 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.470
 we say that almost the same is an aspect 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.210
 however that we cannot define of the 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.620
 all the negative ie cazzola madballs 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.610
 liked this game so like it 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:00.820
 we are okay ie fantastic mice 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.830
 which I think we can pass too 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.840
 talk about pvp that's why you can 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.850
 also try multiplayer no more a p 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.450
 so you could play against others 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:13.210
 players and I have to say that maybe it's a 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.950
 I look a little weak I don't know 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.990
 are some doubts about win first and foremost 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.580
 balancing in the sense that when you do 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.990
 enter the pvp you enter with your own 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.580
 character the own level with the 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.440
 own skills then match making 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.900
 will have to be very delicate to try 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.370
 to match people who have more or 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.630
 less the same skills and the same 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.120
 levels if not it would really be too much 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.000
 however unbalanced also mode 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:37.150
 there should be where then if I'm not mistaken 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.590
 they are not made cannot be done 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.180
 use their skills and that 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.900
 all this is trying to put everyone 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.000
 at the same level 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.550
 obviously the character is the same as 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.100
 all the same in such a way that there is none 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.810
 are too many differences, however, what 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.260
 I did n't like it and let's just say the 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:55.540
 multiplayer is monotonous somewhat lacking in 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.280
 I don't have a real personality 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.460
 liked it I did n't get a feedback 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.560
 feeling spi what else not optimal on 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.650
 what many beautiful but I think this 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.720
 game is nice to explore especially 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.500
 in its single side for cooperative the 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.950
 multiplayer 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.390
 I see it already very accessory maybe then 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.520
 in the final version it will not be so 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.620
 improved a lot however here in the 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.360
 beta my my pressure was that 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.700
 the multiplayer will be able to escape 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.500
 quietly told this guys and 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.970
 we can therefore say that it is destined 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.800
 one more game really looks a lot 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.630
 really really very interesting a lot 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.460
 solid cooperative aspect of this 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.930
 however, a much weaker video game is 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.190
 lacking when mike on what the 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.570
 multiplayer 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.890
 I thank you for your kindness 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.810
 be careful if I liked this 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.580
 video I leave you with I invite you to leave 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.780
 a beauty is that and maybe even a 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.370
 comment on your impressions 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.690
 about your opinions on this 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.250
 destiny videogame we get you 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.810
 we can 20 on this channel with i 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.810
 next videos, hello everyone
