forest over 50 150 years what we do is

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.139 
forest over 50 150 years what we do is
we<00:00:42.289> plant<00:00:42.559> it<00:00:42.680> up<00:00:42.770> all<00:00:42.920> at<00:00:43.070> once<00:00:43.250> or<00:00:43.579> as<00:00:43.670> fast<00:00:43.850> as

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
we plant it up all at once or as fast as

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.180 
we plant it up all at once or as fast as
the<00:00:44.270> water<00:00:44.510> will<00:00:44.750> allow<00:00:45.020> yes<00:00:45.680> putting<00:00:46.129> the

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
the water will allow yes putting the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.750 
the water will allow yes putting the
hardiest<00:00:46.520> species<00:00:46.820> in<00:00:47.120> first<00:00:47.449> and<00:00:48.760> pretty

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
hardiest species in first and pretty

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.330 
hardiest species in first and pretty
well<00:00:49.940> this<00:00:50.239> is<00:00:50.510> a<00:00:50.750> temperate<00:00:51.500> forest

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
well this is a temperate forest

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.490 
well this is a temperate forest
ecological<00:00:53.210> model<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:53.960> only<00:00:54.109> difference<00:00:54.379> is

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
ecological model the only difference is

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.259 
ecological model the only difference is
we<00:00:54.680> pick<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.070> species<00:00:55.519> and<00:00:55.789> the<00:00:55.879> varieties

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
we pick the species and the varieties

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:57.669 
we pick the species and the varieties
that<00:00:56.300> benefit<00:00:56.870> us<00:00:56.989> things<00:00:57.230> that<00:00:57.289> we<00:00:57.440> can<00:00:57.559> eat

00:00:57.669 --> 00:00:57.679 
that benefit us things that we can eat

00:00:57.679 --> 00:00:59.950 
that benefit us things that we can eat
things<00:00:57.890> that<00:00:57.949> we<00:00:58.100> can<00:00:58.250> use<00:00:58.640> know<00:00:59.359> things<00:00:59.899> that

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
things that we can use know things that

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.060 
things that we can use know things that
we<00:01:00.109> like<00:01:00.320> the<00:01:00.350> look<00:01:00.559> of<00:01:00.769> and<00:01:01.809> ultimately<00:01:03.070> what

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
we like the look of and ultimately what

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.250 
we like the look of and ultimately what
we<00:01:04.190> do<00:01:04.309> is<00:01:04.460> leveraging<00:01:05.059> the<00:01:05.630> processes<00:01:06.230> of

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
we do is leveraging the processes of

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.660 
we do is leveraging the processes of
nature<00:01:06.650> that<00:01:06.740> evolved<00:01:07.130> over<00:01:07.190> hundreds<00:01:07.610> of

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
nature that evolved over hundreds of

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.460 
nature that evolved over hundreds of
millions<00:01:07.820> of<00:01:08.180> years<00:01:08.450> yeah<00:01:08.960> rather<00:01:09.260> than

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
millions of years yeah rather than

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.020 
millions of years yeah rather than
trying<00:01:09.680> to<00:01:09.770> reinvent<00:01:10.100> how<00:01:10.340> to<00:01:10.400> grow<00:01:10.700> plants

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
trying to reinvent how to grow plants

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.470 
trying to reinvent how to grow plants
and<00:01:11.300> how<00:01:11.420> to<00:01:11.480> grow<00:01:11.720> food<00:01:11.960> and<00:01:13.090> what<00:01:14.090> we<00:01:14.210> do<00:01:14.360> is

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
and how to grow food and what we do is

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.180 
and how to grow food and what we do is
we<00:01:14.630> setup<00:01:14.900> the<00:01:14.990> way<00:01:15.110> nature<00:01:15.380> sets<00:01:15.710> it<00:01:15.860> up<00:01:15.950> and

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
we setup the way nature sets it up and

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.700 
we setup the way nature sets it up and
in<00:01:16.280> nature<00:01:16.550> takes<00:01:16.790> over<00:01:17.140> because<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.410> natural

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
in nature takes over because the natural

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.920 
in nature takes over because the natural
processes<00:01:19.100> processes<00:01:19.970> have<00:01:20.390> evolved<00:01:20.840> over

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
processes processes have evolved over

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.300 
processes processes have evolved over
such<00:01:21.260> a<00:01:21.290> long<00:01:21.500> time<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:21.920> they're<00:01:22.010> pretty<00:01:22.130> well

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
such a long time and they're pretty well

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.190 
such a long time and they're pretty well
perfected<00:01:22.820> by<00:01:22.940> nature<00:01:23.390> it's<00:01:23.870> the<00:01:23.990> most

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
perfected by nature it's the most

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.810 
perfected by nature it's the most
sustainable<00:01:24.740> model<00:01:25.010> you<00:01:25.070> can<00:01:25.220> actually<00:01:25.370> get

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
sustainable model you can actually get

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.910 
sustainable model you can actually get
we<00:01:26.600> in<00:01:26.870> permaculture<00:01:27.290> we<00:01:27.470> call<00:01:27.770> it<00:01:27.890> a

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
we in permaculture we call it a

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.610 
we in permaculture we call it a
small-scale<00:01:28.430> intensive<00:01:29.090> system<00:01:29.540> because<00:01:29.930> we

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
small-scale intensive system because we

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.560 
small-scale intensive system because we
pack<00:01:30.860> a<00:01:30.890> lot<00:01:31.070> into<00:01:31.220> a<00:01:31.340> small<00:01:31.640> space<00:01:31.820> and<00:01:32.330> it

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
pack a lot into a small space and it

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.280 
pack a lot into a small space and it
makes<00:01:32.720> it<00:01:32.870> far<00:01:33.080> easier<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.800> manage<00:01:34.630> purely<00:01:35.630> in

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
makes it far easier to manage purely in

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.660 
makes it far easier to manage purely in
terms<00:01:36.680> of<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:39.560> energy<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:40.100> effort<00:01:40.280> that<00:01:40.490> you

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
terms of the energy and effort that you

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.430 
terms of the energy and effort that you
can<00:01:41.090> actually<00:01:41.240> put<00:01:41.630> into<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:41.900> garden<00:01:42.260> you<00:01:42.350> can

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
can actually put into the garden you can

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.140 
can actually put into the garden you can
produce<00:01:42.650> four<00:01:43.100> times<00:01:43.400> as<00:01:43.640> much<00:01:43.850> than<00:01:44.090> a

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
produce four times as much than a

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.790 
produce four times as much than a
regular<00:01:44.330> farm<00:01:44.750> because<00:01:45.200> it's<00:01:45.440> easier<00:01:45.740> to

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
regular farm because it's easier to

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.570 
regular farm because it's easier to
manage<00:01:45.980> space<00:01:46.400> wise<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:47.800> the<00:01:48.800> other<00:01:49.010> benefit

manage space wise and the other benefit

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.680 
manage space wise and the other benefit
of<00:01:50.350> this<00:01:51.350> model<00:01:51.800> is<00:01:51.980> it's<00:01:54.130> because<00:01:55.130> you're

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
of this model is it's because you're

of this model is it's because you're
leveraging<00:01:56.690> a<00:01:56.840> natural<00:01:57.230> process<00:01:57.500> it<00:01:58.010> means

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
leveraging a natural process it means

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.310 
leveraging a natural process it means
there's<00:01:58.610> less<00:01:58.670> inputs<00:01:59.270> from<00:01:59.660> you<00:01:59.960> there's

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
there's less inputs from you there's

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.940 
there's less inputs from you there's
less<00:02:00.590> labour<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.160> effort<00:02:01.510> so<00:02:02.510> you<00:02:02.840> know<00:02:03.680> it's

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
less labour and effort so you know it's

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.090 
less labour and effort so you know it's

this level what it's intensive in is

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.240 
this level what it's intensive in is

information you have to know your plains

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.610 
information you have to know your plains
but<00:02:17.180> you<00:02:17.450> can<00:02:17.599> keep<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:17.959> as<00:02:18.079> simple<00:02:18.379> as

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
but you can keep it as simple as

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.050 
but you can keep it as simple as
you<00:02:18.680> like<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.069> use<00:02:19.159> some<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.489> processes

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
you like and use some of the processes

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.559 
you like and use some of the processes
or<00:02:20.269> you<00:02:20.330> can<00:02:20.480> take<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.720> full<00:02:21.019> ball<00:02:21.349> this<00:02:22.040> is

or you can take a full ball this is

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.220 
or you can take a full ball this is

a<00:03:24.230> proof<00:03:24.590> of<00:03:24.680> concept<00:03:24.919> and<00:03:25.459> it<00:03:25.609> shows<00:03:26.060> that<00:03:26.299> you

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
a proof of concept and it shows that you

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.780 
a proof of concept and it shows that you
