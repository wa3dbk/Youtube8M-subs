just collecting that and I'm going to

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.550 
just collecting that and I'm going to
shift<00:04:06.090> D<00:04:06.360> as<00:04:06.570> I<00:04:06.780> mentioned<00:04:07.080> the<00:04:07.140> past<00:04:07.350> will

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
shift D as I mentioned the past will

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.229 
shift D as I mentioned the past will
clone<00:04:07.830> something<00:04:08.519> and<00:04:08.640> I'll<00:04:08.700> move<00:04:08.880> that<00:04:08.910> to

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
clone something and I'll move that to

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.470 
clone something and I'll move that to
hear<00:04:09.600> so<00:04:10.500> here<00:04:10.650> we<00:04:10.769> go<00:04:10.799> we<00:04:11.070> have<00:04:11.250> one<00:04:12.030> video<00:04:12.330> and

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
hear so here we go we have one video and

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.920 
hear so here we go we have one video and
it<00:04:12.540> cuts<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.989> other<00:04:13.140> video<00:04:13.440> and<00:04:14.690> we<00:04:15.690> can<00:04:15.840> do

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
it cuts to the other video and we can do

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.080 
it cuts to the other video and we can do
layer<00:04:16.260> effects<00:04:16.799> there's<00:04:17.130> a<00:04:17.190> few<00:04:17.459> built<00:04:17.790> into

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
layer effects there's a few built into

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.589 
layer effects there's a few built into
blender<00:04:18.299> um<00:04:18.739> and<00:04:20.090> if<00:04:21.090> you've<00:04:21.269> ever<00:04:21.390> worked

if you worked with gimp you know that

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:27.020 
if you worked with gimp you know that
you<00:04:26.820> can

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
you can

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.570 
you can
and<00:04:27.150> layer<00:04:27.540> effects<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:28.080> that's<00:04:28.200> how<00:04:28.580> images

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
and layer effects and that's how images

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.010 
and layer effects and that's how images
there<00:04:30.000> on<00:04:30.090> top<00:04:30.240> of<00:04:30.389> each<00:04:30.510> other<00:04:30.600> blend

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
there on top of each other blend

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.600 
there on top of each other blend
together<00:04:31.230> what<00:04:32.130> I'm<00:04:32.190> gonna<00:04:32.280> do<00:04:32.370> is<00:04:32.400> I'm<00:04:32.490> going

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
together what I'm gonna do is I'm going

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.860 
together what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to<00:04:32.670> click<00:04:32.820> this<00:04:33.000> top<00:04:33.270> layer<00:04:33.510> and<00:04:33.780> then

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
to click this top layer and then

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.500 
to click this top layer and then
shift-click<00:04:34.260> this<00:04:34.830> bottom<00:04:35.190> layer<00:04:35.400> video<00:04:35.790> hits

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
shift-click this bottom layer video hits

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.290 
shift-click this bottom layer video hits
space<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:37.260> I<00:04:37.440> can<00:04:37.590> do<00:04:37.740> add<00:04:38.250> subtract<00:04:39.060> multiply

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
space and I can do add subtract multiply

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.620 
space and I can do add subtract multiply
or<00:04:39.780> alpha<00:04:40.290> over<00:04:40.680> i'll<00:04:41.130> do<00:04:41.580> a<00:04:42.440> add<00:04:43.639> so<00:04:44.639> now<00:04:44.820> you

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
or alpha over i'll do a add so now you

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.710 
or alpha over i'll do a add so now you
can<00:04:45.810> see<00:04:46.020> I<00:04:46.290> have<00:04:46.320> the<00:04:46.770> I<00:04:46.950> can<00:04:47.160> move<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.570> red<00:04:48.570> up

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
can see I have the I can move the red up

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.560 
can see I have the I can move the red up
and<00:04:48.900> down<00:04:49.050> that's<00:04:49.710> that<00:04:50.580> is<00:04:50.610> our<00:04:50.910> effect<00:04:51.300> right

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
and down that's that is our effect right

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.330 
and down that's that is our effect right
there<00:04:52.020> and<00:04:52.530> you<00:04:52.560> just<00:04:52.770> put<00:04:53.040> that<00:04:53.070> somewhere

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
there and you just put that somewhere

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.000 
there and you just put that somewhere
just<00:04:53.520> so<00:04:53.669> you<00:04:53.730> know<00:04:53.940> that<00:04:54.120> effect<00:04:54.450> is<00:04:54.600> there

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
just so you know that effect is there

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.980 
just so you know that effect is there
and<00:04:56.030> that's<00:04:57.030> all<00:04:57.240> that<00:04:57.270> really<00:04:57.450> tells<00:04:57.810> you

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
and that's all that really tells you

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.530 
and that's all that really tells you
right<00:04:58.110> there<00:04:58.250> but<00:04:59.250> you'll<00:04:59.370> see<00:04:59.669> the<00:05:00.240> videos

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
right there but you'll see the videos

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.180 
right there but you'll see the videos
are<00:05:00.570> kind<00:05:00.990> of<00:05:01.050> overlaid<00:05:01.560> each<00:05:01.740> other<00:05:01.980> right

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
are kind of overlaid each other right

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.580 
are kind of overlaid each other right
now<00:05:02.370> kind<00:05:03.360> of<00:05:03.419> a<00:05:03.510> screening<00:05:03.870> effect<00:05:04.290> with<00:05:04.470> the

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
now kind of a screening effect with the

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.590 
now kind of a screening effect with the
ad<00:05:06.169> we<00:05:07.169> can<00:05:07.410> right<00:05:07.800> click<00:05:07.830> and<00:05:08.250> delete<00:05:08.640> that<00:05:09.060> if

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
ad we can right click and delete that if

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.140 
ad we can right click and delete that if
you<00:05:10.380> try<00:05:10.620> to<00:05:10.680> only<00:05:11.190> select<00:05:11.430> one<00:05:11.669> video

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
you try to only select one video

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.210 
you try to only select one video
depending<00:05:13.020> on<00:05:13.020> what<00:05:13.290> effect<00:05:13.620> you're<00:05:13.770> adding

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
depending on what effect you're adding

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.010 
depending on what effect you're adding
like<00:05:14.400> if<00:05:14.520> I<00:05:14.610> do<00:05:14.669> subtract<00:05:15.540> it<00:05:15.660> selling<00:05:15.930> you

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
like if I do subtract it selling you

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.070 
like if I do subtract it selling you
need<00:05:16.290> to<00:05:16.530> select<00:05:16.710> to<00:05:17.160> sequence<00:05:17.790> strips<00:05:18.180> so

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
need to select to sequence strips so

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.510 
need to select to sequence strips so
make<00:05:19.350> sure<00:05:19.380> you<00:05:19.620> select<00:05:19.800> the<00:05:20.070> two<00:05:20.250> that<00:05:20.460> you

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
make sure you select the two that you

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.640 
make sure you select the two that you
want<00:05:20.700> to<00:05:20.790> blend<00:05:21.030> and<00:05:21.390> we'll<00:05:21.960> do<00:05:22.110> subtract

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
want to blend and we'll do subtract

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.770 
want to blend and we'll do subtract
which<00:05:23.490> is<00:05:23.669> kind<00:05:23.850> of<00:05:23.910> the<00:05:23.970> opposite<00:05:24.240> of<00:05:24.330> add<00:05:24.570> it

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
which is kind of the opposite of add it

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.210 
which is kind of the opposite of add it
kind<00:05:24.960> of<00:05:24.990> makes<00:05:25.139> everything<00:05:25.440> darker<00:05:25.979> kind<00:05:26.100> of

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
kind of makes everything darker kind of

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.370 
kind of makes everything darker kind of
gives<00:05:26.340> you<00:05:26.430> a<00:05:26.460> negative<00:05:26.940> on<00:05:27.090> the<00:05:27.330> bottom<00:05:28.080> video

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
gives you a negative on the bottom video

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.980 
gives you a negative on the bottom video
there<00:05:30.080> delete<00:05:31.080> that<00:05:31.729> click<00:05:32.729> both<00:05:33.630> of<00:05:33.840> them

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
there delete that click both of them

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.570 
there delete that click both of them
multiply<00:05:34.880> which<00:05:36.169> kind<00:05:37.169> of<00:05:37.290> gives<00:05:37.410> you<00:05:37.580> it's

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
multiply which kind of gives you it's

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.210 
multiply which kind of gives you it's
more<00:05:39.419> like<00:05:39.630> advocates<00:05:40.229> the<00:05:40.470> opposite<00:05:40.950> making

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
more like advocates the opposite making

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.630 
more like advocates the opposite making
things<00:05:41.460> darker<00:05:42.950> so<00:05:43.950> those<00:05:44.070> are<00:05:44.190> a<00:05:44.280> few<00:05:44.310> little

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
things darker so those are a few little

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.040 
things darker so those are a few little
layer<00:05:45.570> effects<00:05:46.080> you<00:05:46.289> can<00:05:46.320> add<00:05:46.650> two<00:05:46.890> videos

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
layer effects you can add two videos

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.690 
layer effects you can add two videos
