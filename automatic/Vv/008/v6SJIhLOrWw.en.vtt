00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
them have like a solid block that goes

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.960 
them have like a solid block that goes
back<00:01:48.320> to<00:01:48.560> what<00:01:48.920> is<00:01:49.009> it<00:01:49.130> know<00:01:49.280> I<00:01:49.310> heard<00:01:49.880> about

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
back to what is it know I heard about

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:50.320 
back to what is it know I heard about
that

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
that

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.999 
that
what's<00:01:50.479> that<00:01:50.600> solid<00:01:51.020> block<00:01:51.229> gonna<00:01:51.500> do<00:01:51.649> for<00:01:51.920> me

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
what's that solid block gonna do for me

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.680 
what's that solid block gonna do for me
that's<00:01:52.160> supposed<00:01:52.430> to<00:01:52.490> be<00:01:52.580> good<00:01:52.820> right<00:01:53.030> yes

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
that's supposed to be good right yes

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.400 
that's supposed to be good right yes
that'll<00:01:54.410> add<00:01:54.619> sustain<00:01:55.520> actually<00:01:56.149> because<00:01:56.600> the

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
that'll add sustain actually because the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.540 
that'll add sustain actually because the
back<00:01:57.950> here<00:01:58.490> would<00:01:59.330> be<00:01:59.649> where<00:02:00.649> it<00:02:00.680> is<00:02:00.860> it<00:02:01.100> mounts

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
back here would be where it is it mounts

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.840 
back here would be where it is it mounts
into<00:02:02.060> it<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:02.930> I<00:02:03.080> think<00:02:03.350> it<00:02:03.440> brings<00:02:03.920> really

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
into it and I think it brings really

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.259 
into it and I think it brings really
more<00:02:05.830> you<00:02:06.830> know<00:02:06.979> the<00:02:07.190> sonic<00:02:07.640> thing<00:02:07.909> you<00:02:08.090> get

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
more you know the sonic thing you get

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.580 
more you know the sonic thing you get
more<00:02:08.420> vibration<00:02:09.200> transferred<00:02:10.239> to<00:02:11.239> it<00:02:11.590> Richard

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
more vibration transferred to it Richard

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.229 
more vibration transferred to it Richard
and<00:02:12.799> moon<00:02:13.010> that<00:02:13.250> but<00:02:13.489> ain't<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:13.700> gotta<00:02:13.940> try<00:02:14.180> it
