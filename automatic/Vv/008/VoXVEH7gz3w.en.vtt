play this cooperatively with a frame
rate<00:03:00.859> like<00:03:01.070> this<00:03:01.280> I<00:03:02.890> just<00:03:03.890> hit<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.220> jump

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
rate like this I just hit the jump

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.349 
rate like this I just hit the jump
button<00:03:05.150> once<00:03:05.630> a<00:03:06.170> long<00:03:06.350> damn<00:03:06.850> get<00:03:07.850> there<00:03:08.090> wait

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
the lasers do you have time as it like a

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.680 
the lasers do you have time as it like a
time<00:03:18.350> limit<00:03:18.709> you

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
time limit you

well if we weren't well if you weren't a
complete<00:03:35.250> idiot<00:03:35.460> I<00:03:36.410> would<00:03:37.410> have<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.680> do<00:03:37.830> is<00:03:37.980> one

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
complete idiot I would have to do is one

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.950 
complete idiot I would have to do is one
person<00:03:38.550> jumps<00:03:38.910> over<00:03:39.120> at<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.210> time<00:03:39.420> then<00:03:39.870> we

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
person jumps over at a time then we

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.560 
person jumps over at a time then we
would<00:03:40.110> had<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.880> shimmy<00:03:41.880> all<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.330> way<00:03:42.450> around

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
would had to shimmy all the way around

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.900 
would had to shimmy all the way around
this<00:03:42.990> I<00:03:43.260> read<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.130> wall<00:03:44.340> so<00:03:44.640> we<00:03:44.670> get<00:03:44.820> for

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
this I read to the wall so we get for

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.180 
this I read to the wall so we get for
the<00:03:44.970> other<00:03:45.090> side<00:03:45.360> it<00:03:46.230> would<00:03:46.350> hop<00:03:46.590> over<00:03:46.980> it

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
the other side it would hop over it

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.030 
the other side it would hop over it
would<00:03:47.670> take<00:03:47.820> an<00:03:47.940> elevator<00:03:48.180> down<00:03:48.890> would<00:03:49.890> come

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
would take an elevator down would come

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.060 
would take an elevator down would come
out<00:03:50.190> on<00:03:50.400> that<00:03:50.580> side<00:03:50.880> over<00:03:51.090> there<00:03:51.210> and<00:03:52.070> someone

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
out on that side over there and someone

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.700 
out on that side over there and someone
uses<00:03:53.460> their<00:03:53.640> ocp<00:03:54.270> on<00:03:54.420> that<00:03:54.600> glowing<00:03:54.870> red<00:03:55.230> panel

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
uses their ocp on that glowing red panel

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.230 
uses their ocp on that glowing red panel
on<00:03:55.770> the<00:03:55.890> wall<00:03:55.920> there<00:03:56.310> it<00:03:56.730> turns<00:03:57.000> all<00:03:57.120> the

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
on the wall there it turns all the

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.330 
on the wall there it turns all the
lasers<00:03:57.570> off<00:03:57.720> well<00:03:58.350> my<00:03:58.620> way<00:03:58.770> was<00:03:58.950> quicker<00:04:01.340> why

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
lasers off well my way was quicker why

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.890 
lasers off well my way was quicker why
would<00:04:02.520> you<00:04:02.610> think<00:04:02.760> you<00:04:03.210> why<00:04:03.390> would<00:04:03.450> you<00:04:03.630> run

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
would you think you why would you run

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.290 
would you think you why would you run
through<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.350> lasers<00:04:04.910> we're<00:04:05.910> on<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.150> right

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
through the lasers we're on the right

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.650 
through the lasers we're on the right
side<00:04:06.600> already<00:04:06.780> oh<00:04:07.790> my<00:04:08.790> god<00:04:08.970> that<00:04:09.210> we're<00:04:09.390> trying

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
side already oh my god that we're trying

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
you escape from the hotel he'll try and

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.430 
you escape from the hotel he'll try and
get<00:04:14.100> on<00:04:14.130> the<00:04:14.190> boat<00:04:14.430> escape<00:04:14.960> with<00:04:15.960> the<00:04:16.049> puncture

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
get on the boat escape with the puncture

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.110 
get on the boat escape with the puncture
the<00:04:16.470> gas<00:04:16.769> tank<00:04:17.100> on<00:04:17.280> it<00:04:17.430> so<00:04:17.580> even<00:04:17.700> if<00:04:17.850> he<00:04:17.940> makes

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
the gas tank on it so even if he makes

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.720 
the gas tank on it so even if he makes
the<00:04:18.450> boat<00:04:18.600> you<00:04:18.989> still<00:04:19.230> can't<00:04:19.410> leave<00:04:19.650> but<00:04:20.640> right
