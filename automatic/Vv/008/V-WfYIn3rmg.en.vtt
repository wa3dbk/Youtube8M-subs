utility blade we're going to add that in
and<00:00:48.969> what<00:00:49.660> I've<00:00:49.750> done<00:00:50.079> is<00:00:50.410> I've<00:00:50.920> raised<00:00:51.340> up

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
and what I've done is I've raised up

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.869 
and what I've done is I've raised up
I've<00:00:52.870> raised<00:00:53.199> up<00:00:53.379> my<00:00:53.500> bar<00:00:53.739> put<00:00:54.070> my<00:00:54.160> slip<00:00:54.460> mat<00:00:54.670> in

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
I've raised up my bar put my slip mat in

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.209 
I've raised up my bar put my slip mat in
and<00:00:55.090> I<00:00:55.180> have<00:00:55.360> my<00:00:55.480> foam<00:00:55.809> core<00:00:56.170> in<00:00:56.350> so<00:00:57.070> I<00:00:57.100> can

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
and I have my foam core in so I can

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:59.029 
and I have my foam core in so I can
measure<00:00:57.550> the<00:00:57.820> exact<00:00:58.120> depth<00:00:58.539> of<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:58.870> blade

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
measure the exact depth of the blade

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.979 
measure the exact depth of the blade
push<00:01:00.039> the<00:01:00.190> blade<00:01:00.370> down<00:01:00.640> and<00:01:00.969> I<00:01:01.480> got<00:01:01.600> to<00:01:01.840> push

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
push the blade down and I got to push

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.170 
push the blade down and I got to push
the<00:01:02.109> blade<00:01:02.320> in<00:01:02.469> just<00:01:02.829> tell<00:01:03.039> it<00:01:03.190> just<00:01:03.879> till<00:01:04.059> it

we're going to do this at three and a
half<00:01:27.939> three<00:01:28.479> inch<00:01:28.689> I<00:01:29.130> have<00:01:30.130> it<00:01:30.220> set<00:01:30.369> up<00:01:30.400> at

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
doing a traditional four cuts because I

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.240 
doing a traditional four cuts because I
don't<00:02:02.520> like<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.850> adjust<00:02:03.330> my<00:02:03.750> blade<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.530> just<00:02:05.100> do

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
don't like to adjust my blade I just do

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.039 
don't like to adjust my blade I just do
that<00:02:05.430> manually<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.119> don't<00:02:06.360> do<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.750> fine<00:02:07.020> tuning

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
that manually I don't do the fine tuning

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.020 
that manually I don't do the fine tuning
adjustment<00:02:07.950> because<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.190> only<00:02:08.489> do<00:02:08.640> these<00:02:08.759> cuts

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
adjustment because I only do these cuts

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.160 
adjustment because I only do these cuts
every<00:02:09.269> now<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.509> then<00:02:09.569> if<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.750> was<00:02:09.869> gonna<00:02:09.989> do<00:02:10.110> a

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
every now and then if I was gonna do a

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.500 
every now and then if I was gonna do a
large<00:02:10.440> production<00:02:10.860> run<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.489> would<00:02:12.090> adjust<00:02:12.180> it

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
large production run I would adjust it

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.440 
large production run I would adjust it
real<00:02:12.660> critically<00:02:13.430> so<00:02:14.430> my<00:02:14.580> over<00:02:14.940> my<00:02:15.090> under

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
real critically so my over my under

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.809 
real critically so my over my under
isn't<00:02:15.630> exactly<00:02:16.200> precision<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.220> all<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.430> do<00:02:17.610> is

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
isn't exactly precision so all I do is

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.800 
isn't exactly precision so all I do is
take<00:02:18.209> one<00:02:18.480> of<00:02:18.510> our<00:02:18.690> scrap<00:02:19.110> blades<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:20.810> come

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
take one of our scrap blades and come

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.039 
take one of our scrap blades and come
back<00:02:22.019> and<00:02:22.380> cut<00:02:22.680> those<00:02:22.950> out<00:02:23.750> you're<00:02:24.750> gonna<00:02:24.840> do<00:02:25.019> a

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
back and cut those out you're gonna do a

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.780 
back and cut those out you're gonna do a
lot<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.319> those<00:02:25.530> in<00:02:25.769> production<00:02:26.340> then<00:02:26.610> what

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
lot of those in production then what

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.860 
lot of those in production then what
you're<00:02:26.910> gonna<00:02:27.000> do<00:02:27.269> is<00:02:27.420> you're<00:02:27.540> going<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.720> go

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
you're gonna do is you're going to go

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.199 
you're gonna do is you're going to go
adjust<00:02:28.319> that<00:02:28.530> critically<00:02:29.130> but<00:02:29.790> I'm<00:02:29.910> doing

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
adjust that critically but I'm doing

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.120 
adjust that critically but I'm doing
mostly<00:02:30.569> traditional<00:02:30.840> window<00:02:31.620> mats<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.040> I

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130
