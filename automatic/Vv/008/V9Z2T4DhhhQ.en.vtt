maybe like a eighth of an inch away and
now<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.299> one<00:02:02.479> that's<00:02:02.509> already<00:02:02.930> like<00:02:03.110> three<00:02:03.320> to

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
then we do another one a little bit off

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.870 
then we do another one a little bit off
the<00:02:07.159> route<00:02:07.340> about<00:02:07.549> half<00:02:08.030> an<00:02:08.179> inch<00:02:08.239> away<00:02:08.450> and

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
the route about half an inch away and

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.580 
the route about half an inch away and
like<00:02:10.880> I<00:02:10.910> said<00:02:11.030> you<00:02:11.300> don't<00:02:11.420> be<00:02:11.600> perfect<00:02:12.170> on<00:02:12.380> this

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
like I said you don't be perfect on this
