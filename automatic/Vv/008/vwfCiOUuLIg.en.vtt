00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
year or independence then in September

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.959 
year or independence then in September
next<00:00:51.449> year<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.840> think<00:00:52.170> by<00:00:52.289> then<00:00:52.789> Canelo<00:00:53.789> will

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
next year I think by then Canelo will

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.279 
next year I think by then Canelo will
have<00:00:54.120> three<00:00:54.300> or<00:00:54.360> four<00:00:54.510> more<00:00:54.629> fights<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.140> so

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
have three or four more fights and so

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.229 
have three or four more fights and so
will<00:00:55.410> Gennady<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.250> think<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.910> bill<00:00:57.090> that

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
will Gennady so I think in the bill that

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.060 
will Gennady so I think in the bill that
would<00:00:57.390> be<00:00:57.510> perfect<00:00:57.719> last<00:00:58.559> question<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.980> know

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
would be perfect last question you know

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.319 
would be perfect last question you know

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
we talked about there not being a star

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.310 
we talked about there not being a star
he's<00:01:00.420> already<00:01:00.539> start<00:01:00.809> with<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.989> hardcore

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
he's already start with the hardcore

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.930

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.130 
boxing fans they want to get into the
mainstream<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.629> going<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.809> happen<00:01:03.840> until

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
mainstream is that going to happen until

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.660 
mainstream is that going to happen until
he<00:01:04.439> fights<00:01:04.650> mayweather<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.220> two<00:01:05.339> bites<00:01:05.549> of

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
he fights mayweather in two bites of

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.520 
he fights mayweather in two bites of
code<00:01:05.850> or<00:01:05.880> Canelo<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.049> what<00:01:07.170> he<00:01:07.200> needs<00:01:07.409> the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
code or Canelo is that what he needs the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.039 
code or Canelo is that what he needs the
kind<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.770> transition<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.430> superstar<00:01:09.090> no<00:01:09.990> I

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
kind of transition to superstar no I

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.300 
kind of transition to superstar no I
don't<00:01:10.290> think<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.470> i<00:01:10.560> think<00:01:10.650> he<00:01:10.860> needs<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.130> just

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
don't think so i think he needs to just

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.500 
don't think so i think he needs to just
keep<00:01:11.460> fighting<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.939> think<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.180> just<00:01:12.299> need<00:01:12.390> to

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
keep fighting I think you just need to

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.179 
keep fighting I think you just need to
stay<00:01:12.630> busy<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:12.990> keep<00:01:13.229> putting<00:01:13.500> on<00:01:13.560> shows<00:01:13.799> and

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
stay busy and keep putting on shows and

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.030 
stay busy and keep putting on shows and
keep<00:01:14.549> winning<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.030> keep<00:01:15.680> having<00:01:16.680> dramatic

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
keep winning and keep having dramatic

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.520 
keep winning and keep having dramatic
knockouts<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.670> think<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.509> if<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:18.659> wait<00:01:19.080> for

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
knockouts I think that if we wait for

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.030 
knockouts I think that if we wait for
that<00:01:19.650> opportunity<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.310> may<00:01:20.400> never<00:01:20.549> come<00:01:20.700> and

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
that opportunity it may never come and

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.789 
that opportunity it may never come and
get<00:01:23.040> me<00:01:23.130> i<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.460> UH<00:01:24.200> sitting<00:01:25.200> not<00:01:25.470> not
