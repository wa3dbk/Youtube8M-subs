00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
instead instead of this barrel which

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.600 
instead instead of this barrel which
which<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.390> find<00:01:42.540> out<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.750> useful<00:01:45.049> because

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
which I find out that useful because

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.440 
which I find out that useful because
even<00:01:47.610> though<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.970> will<00:01:48.030> bend<00:01:48.420> or<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.560> can<00:01:49.710> like

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
even though it will bend or you can like

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.330 
even though it will bend or you can like
switch<00:01:51.450> around<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:52.320> position<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:52.979> stock

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
switch around the position of the stock

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.609 
switch around the position of the stock
I<00:01:53.810> still<00:01:54.810> like<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:54.960> right<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.350> stock<00:01:55.500> because

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
I still like the right of stock because

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.270 
I still like the right of stock because
you<00:01:55.829> can<00:01:56.009> adjust<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.700> your<00:01:56.880> liking<00:01:58.280> and

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
you can adjust it to your liking and

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.420 
you can adjust it to your liking and
also<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.420> long<00:02:00.840> shot<00:02:01.170> barrel<00:02:01.469> or<00:02:01.920> sorry

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
also the long shot barrel or sorry

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.850 
also the long shot barrel or sorry
launch<00:02:02.700> Strike<00:02:03.119> barrel<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.750> because<00:02:04.110> it

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
launch Strike barrel is because it

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.570 
launch Strike barrel is because it
change<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.159> sighting<00:02:05.670> on<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:07.340> now<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.369> don't

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
change the sighting on it now I don't

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.020 
change the sighting on it now I don't
think<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:08.940> increases<00:02:09.479> arranged<00:02:09.810> whatsoever

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
think it increases arranged whatsoever

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.160 
think it increases arranged whatsoever
I<00:02:11.090> think<00:02:12.100> increases<00:02:13.100> style<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:14.030> looks<00:02:14.810> and

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
I think increases style and looks and

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.110 
I think increases style and looks and
everything<00:02:15.560> maybe<00:02:15.680> maybe<00:02:16.430> it<00:02:16.610> does<00:02:16.819> increase

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
everything maybe maybe it does increase

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.690 
everything maybe maybe it does increase
a<00:02:17.209> little<00:02:17.630> bit<00:02:17.840> of<00:02:17.930> accuracy<00:02:18.230> not<00:02:18.980> much<00:02:19.190> but<00:02:19.490> a

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
a little bit of accuracy not much but a

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.230 
a little bit of accuracy not much but a
very<00:02:19.910> tiny<00:02:20.240> bit<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:21.100> you<00:02:22.100> know<00:02:22.220> a<00:02:22.490> little<00:02:23.120> bit

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
very tiny bit and you know a little bit

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.740 
very tiny bit and you know a little bit
of<00:02:23.360> range<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:23.870> firepower<00:02:25.420> ok<00:02:26.420> maybe<00:02:26.630> not

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
of range and firepower ok maybe not

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.050 
of range and firepower ok maybe not
firepower<00:02:27.020> but<00:02:27.410> definitely<00:02:28.069> range<00:02:30.790> all<00:02:31.790> you

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
firepower but definitely range all you

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.710 
firepower but definitely range all you
need<00:02:32.270> really<00:02:32.480> is<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:33.020> specter<00:02:33.980> gun<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:35.510> long
