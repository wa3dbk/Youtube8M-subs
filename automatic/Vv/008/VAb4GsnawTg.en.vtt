every time they get a new planet it's

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.430 
every time they get a new planet it's

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
understand the laws of gravity and so

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.440 
understand the laws of gravity and so
you<00:01:49.069> know<00:01:49.160> we<00:01:49.250> had<00:01:49.369> to<00:01:49.490> modify<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:50.000> laws<00:01:50.270> of

and they suggested that you also need to

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:58.449 
and they suggested that you also need to
modify<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.200> laws<00:01:57.440> of<00:01:57.590> gravity<00:01:57.890> for<00:01:58.039> very<00:01:58.220> low

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.839 
that particular theory probably isn't
going<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.230> go<00:02:21.380> anywhere<00:02:21.410> for<00:02:22.010> various<00:02:22.400> reasons

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
going to go anywhere for various reasons

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.130 
going to go anywhere for various reasons
it<00:02:23.000> doesn't<00:02:23.330> seem<00:02:23.450> to<00:02:23.599> be<00:02:23.720> self-consistent

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
it doesn't seem to be self-consistent

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.819 
it doesn't seem to be self-consistent
but<00:02:25.690> nevertheless<00:02:26.690> this<00:02:27.170> was<00:02:27.349> seriously

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
but nevertheless this was seriously

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:29.589 
but nevertheless this was seriously
proposed<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.579> was<00:02:28.640> also<00:02:29.000> I<00:02:29.030> have<00:02:29.299> to<00:02:29.420> say<00:02:29.569> a

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
proposed it was also I have to say a

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.119 
proposed it was also I have to say a
little<00:02:29.900> philosophically<00:02:30.590> dubious<00:02:30.980> because

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
little philosophically dubious because

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.070 
little philosophically dubious because
if<00:02:31.400> you<00:02:31.489> want<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:31.760> new<00:02:31.909> theory<00:02:32.269> of<00:02:32.299> gravity<00:02:32.390> you

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
if you want a new theory of gravity you

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.140 
if you want a new theory of gravity you
want<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.350> go<00:02:33.500> back<00:02:33.800> to<00:02:34.100> Newton<00:02:34.460> and<00:02:34.640> start<00:02:34.940> over

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
want to go back to Newton and start over

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.240 
want to go back to Newton and start over
again<00:02:35.630> you<00:02:36.170> probably<00:02:36.560> want<00:02:36.800> to<00:02:36.860> start<00:02:37.130> with

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
again you probably want to start with

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.730 
again you probably want to start with
relativity<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:38.030> move<00:02:38.240> on<00:02:38.450> but<00:02:39.290> they<00:02:39.470> made<00:02:39.710> it

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
relativity and move on but they made it

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.710 
relativity and move on but they made it
consistent<00:02:40.520> with<00:02:40.580> relativity<00:02:40.880> they<00:02:41.480> worked

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
consistent with relativity they worked

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.110 
consistent with relativity they worked
out<00:02:41.900> all<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.250> all<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.460> stuff<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:43.850> it<00:02:43.910> seemed

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
out all the all the stuff and it seemed

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.910 
out all the all the stuff and it seemed
to<00:02:44.270> work<00:02:44.540> okay<00:02:44.990> except<00:02:45.320> it<00:02:45.440> turns<00:02:45.620> out<00:02:45.770> it

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
to work okay except it turns out it

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.060 
to work okay except it turns out it
disagrees<00:02:46.400> with<00:02:46.430> observations<00:02:47.180> also<00:02:47.890> but<00:02:48.890> it

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
disagrees with observations also but it

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.900 
disagrees with observations also but it
was<00:02:49.250> a<00:02:49.280> real<00:02:49.610> attempt<00:02:50.270> to<00:02:51.520> imagine<00:02:52.520> that<00:02:52.670> these

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
was a real attempt to imagine that these

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.490 
was a real attempt to imagine that these
things<00:02:53.270> might<00:02:53.570> really<00:02:53.900> turn<00:02:54.170> out<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.470> be

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
things might really turn out to be

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.250 
things might really turn out to be
epicycles<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.490> if<00:02:55.730> if<00:02:56.030> there<00:02:56.300> isn't<00:02:56.510> progress

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
epicycles and if if there isn't progress

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.530 
epicycles and if if there isn't progress
in<00:02:57.770> finding<00:02:58.100> out<00:02:58.400> what's<00:02:58.610> going<00:02:58.970> on<00:02:59.120> I<00:02:59.360> think

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
in finding out what's going on I think

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.140 
in finding out what's going on I think
we're<00:02:59.870> going<00:02:59.960> to<00:03:00.020> see<00:03:00.230> more<00:03:00.470> of<00:03:00.530> that<00:03:00.650> as<00:03:01.640> time

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
we're going to see more of that as time

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.440 
we're going to see more of that as time
goes<00:03:02.180> on<00:03:02.890> and<00:03:04.660> it<00:03:05.660> maybe<00:03:05.990> than<00:03:06.410> in<00:03:06.530> 50<00:03:06.950> years

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
goes on and it maybe than in 50 years

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.620 
goes on and it maybe than in 50 years
these<00:03:08.450> things<00:03:08.990> will<00:03:09.770> look<00:03:10.040> like<00:03:10.390> what<00:03:11.390> we

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
these things will look like what we

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.020 
these things will look like what we
think<00:03:11.930> about<00:03:12.440> people<00:03:12.950> who<00:03:12.980> thought<00:03:13.340> that<00:03:13.880> the

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
think about people who thought that the

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.290 
think about people who thought that the
earth<00:03:14.209> was<00:03:14.660> the<00:03:14.930> center<00:03:15.050> of<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:15.440> universe<00:03:16.300> so

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
earth was the center of the universe so

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.850 
earth was the center of the universe so
we'll<00:03:17.480> see<00:03:17.890> now<00:03:19.300> there<00:03:20.300> is<00:03:20.600> one<00:03:21.260> additional

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
we'll see now there is one additional

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.730 
we'll see now there is one additional
thing<00:03:22.459> that<00:03:22.490> we<00:03:22.820> know<00:03:23.000> about<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.450> universe<00:03:23.740> in

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
thing that we know about the universe in

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.740 
thing that we know about the universe in
addition<00:03:25.310> to<00:03:25.459> you<00:03:25.700> know<00:03:25.790> these<00:03:26.000> three<00:03:26.420> lines

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
addition to you know these three lines

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.960 
addition to you know these three lines
which<00:03:27.140> are<00:03:27.260> kind<00:03:27.560> of<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.709> basic<00:03:28.190> information

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
which are kind of the basic information

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.850 
which are kind of the basic information
that<00:03:29.150> we<00:03:29.650> we<00:03:30.650> currently<00:03:30.890> have<00:03:31.340> and<00:03:32.240> that<00:03:32.540> is<00:03:32.860> so

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
that we we currently have and that is so

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.140 
that we we currently have and that is so
here's<00:03:34.220> another<00:03:34.490> fact<00:03:34.850> about<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.330> universe

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
here's another fact about the universe

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.690 
here's another fact about the universe
kind<00:03:38.150> of<00:03:38.300> an<00:03:38.390> obvious<00:03:38.930> one<00:03:39.070> the<00:03:40.070> fact<00:03:40.310> is<00:03:40.519> that

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
kind of an obvious one the fact is that

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.740 
kind of an obvious one the fact is that
we<00:03:40.880> exist<00:03:43.180> otherwise<00:03:44.180> we<00:03:44.330> wouldn't<00:03:44.540> be<00:03:44.600> having

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
we exist otherwise we wouldn't be having

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.430 
we exist otherwise we wouldn't be having
this<00:03:44.989> conversation<00:03:45.050> right<00:03:46.180> and<00:03:47.260> what<00:03:48.260> does

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
this conversation right and what does

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.820 
this conversation right and what does
that<00:03:48.470> tell<00:03:48.650> you<00:03:49.040> about<00:03:49.070> the<00:03:49.310> universe
