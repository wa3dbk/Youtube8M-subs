00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.920
 or the one that gives you all how are you thanks 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.330
 for being here as you already know my name 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.930
 it is already and today we come with a 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.400
 new java programming tutorial 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.020
 basically today what we are going to 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.739
 to do is to focus on an exercise 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.620
 practical that a few weeks ago 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:47.989
 some of our users in 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:50.870
 applied they had left me that task 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.910
 pending and I wanted to explain it with a 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.470
 practical exercise in java well 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.780
 basically the exercise focuses on what 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.690
 next on that given a number that 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.979
 we have in this case either 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.710
 that we are going to work with a number of 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:11.920
 three four or five figures in this case 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:14.630
 a constant number in this case we're going to 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.200
 decompose that number into units 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.820
 tens and hundreds of thousand units 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.500
 depending on the number of numbers 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.439
 than us or the number of figures 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.640
 sorry that we are going to work in 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.250
 this case I'm doing that 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.000
 algorithm exclusively for a number 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.940
 of 3 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.220
 so in this case it is to enter a 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:39.229
 number like the 754 we're going to run the 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.270
 program and basically what we see is 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.340
 today is to show me how 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.729
 result the units in this case 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.890
 would be four units five tens and 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.430
 seven hundred then well what 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.470
 let's do is let's go to 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.090
 start let's erase everything and we're going to 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.119
 explain in detail what 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.399
 basically it's not very difficult but 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.190
 sometimes this kind of exercises 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.350
 they help us understand many things 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:11.630
 keys at the moment that we are working 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.220
 with projects or applications well 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.450
 basically here in this case what 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.459
 let's do is let's change a 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.709
 whole number and that is in this case 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.280
 74 figures to be a little more 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.280
 interesting 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.069
 and what are we going to do the following 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.110
 then we will declare four 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.440
 variables that are tens units 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.060
 hundreds and we're going to put a whatsoever 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.250
 one thousand unit 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.110
 So the first thing we're going to do is 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:47.440
 the following in this case remember that 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:50.530
 let's start from the first unit 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.930
 what is the corresponding then in this 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.519
 case to decompose it would be the 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.890
 algorithm the next then we would say 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.810
 what units 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.530
 it would be the same as the first thing we are going to do 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.330
 is the following we're going to this number that 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.540
 we have here what we are going to do we are going 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.630
 to get the residue of dividing this 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.030
 number between 10 if we get the 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.480
 remainder of dividing this number 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.550
 between 10 that residue will give us 6 like this 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.740
 that therefore we would already have the unit 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.770
 corresponding then what are we going to 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:27.640
 to do is let's say that number the 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.530
 residue do not forget the operator the receipt 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.450
 of dividing the number by 10 then 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.500
 if we this residue is going to be 6 and 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.890
 we would have the corresponding unit 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.980
 now we would have to modify that 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.070
 number since in this case we have already 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.750
 taken the first digit or the last 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.910
 number the number then what are we going to 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.120
 to do is to modify and we are going to say that 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.510
 the number is equal to the divided number 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.299
 between 10 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.840
 so if I divide it between 10 I go to 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:03.290
 have as number 145 then it's going to be 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.450
 the same logic for tens we're going to 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.579
 get the residue of dividing this 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.370
 number between 10 then we do what 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:13.519
 same we say tens 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:18.380
 will be equal to the number that with this 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:20.930
 line happens to be 145 the residue of 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.660
 divide it by 10 then that residue 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.150
 will give us 5 so we would have 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:30.169
 the tens and we make the same change 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:33.229
 what number is equal to the divided number 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.630
 between 10 then automatically already 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:38.389
 would happen this with this new line of 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:42.800
 code already happens to be number 14 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:45.750
 then we do the same methodology in 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:50.550
 this case we would miss the hundreds 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:54.630
 hundreds will be equal to the number the 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:57.210
 remainder of dividing it by 10 that in 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.460
 this case residue is going to be 4 and by 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.010
 last we would miss the 1 that would be the 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.070
 unit of 1000 that in this case the 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:08.820
 unit of 1000 would be simply divide 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:12.720
 the number between 10 remember that with this 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.490
 line the number we have reduced it to 14 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.760
 then here we get the residue 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.410
 we have the hundred that would be 4 and the 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.470
 divide the number by 10 then 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:26.520
 it's simply going to give us the number 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:29.460
 corresponding that would be 1 then 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.900
 now well once we remember 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.670
 that these are entire divisions 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.460
 then it is something that facilitates us 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.890
 enough for this kind of something and not for 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.830
 last we would use a point system 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.569
 out point print line to be able to print 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.770
 per console 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:48.620
 one of the corresponding results 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.240
 there is a point to point bring line to 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.110
 tell 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.110
 units 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.139
 and we had to print the 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.120
 variable units or concatenate the value 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:02.550
 units remember that like more here 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.050
 we have and the same procedure I'm going 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:08.030
 to do for the four lines of 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:11.130
 remaining codes would be last of 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:13.550
 modify each of the names that 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.550
 would 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.680
 tens 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.130
 hundreds 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:29.270
 and I'm going to 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:32.300
 give m to refer to unit 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:34.849
 1000 or 1000 units for once 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:38.719
 that we save and we go to execute the 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:41.769
 program as we can see here we are going to 

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:44.959
 make a change is printing us 

00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:47.899
 we have the unit let's see what we 

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:50.989
 we have been wrong in this case if many 

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:53.569
 They may have realized I'm not with 

00:06:50.989 --> 00:06:55.399
 the algorithm is in a correct way 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:57.289
 what happens is that I'm printing 

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:59.569
 I'm concatenating the same value that is 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:02.899
 units then and I thought that 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:06.679
 we had made some change or some 

00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:08.719
 calculation that was out of the right thing 

00:07:06.679 --> 00:07:12.069
 but checking the algorithm is fine 

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:17.529
 that we are missing print scene unit 

00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:20.689
 hundred and finally m then now yes 

00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:22.689
 if we go to execute the program we are going 

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:25.939
 to be able to see that we have six units 

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:27.619
 five tens four hundred and one 

00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:29.210
 unit of 1000 then it's basically 

00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:32.090
 how does it work 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:35.330
 the algorithm to decompose numbers in 

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:37.490
 each of the units scenes 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.870
 corresponding well it is true 3 

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.699
 today more than a tutorial is a 

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.560
 kind of practical exercise that you can 

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:44.419
 help a lot I hope you liked it 

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.949
 Do not forget any doubt leave it at 

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:47.630
 comments like if you liked this 

00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:51.190
 video and reminding you will always be more 

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:51.190
 applied until next time thanks
