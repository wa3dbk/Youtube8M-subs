00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.480 
my normal amount of mascara I normally
have<00:04:45.419> a<00:04:45.479> lot<00:04:45.660> more<00:04:45.810> I<00:04:46.050> just<00:04:46.260> have<00:04:46.830> lost<00:04:47.190> my

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
have a lot more I just have lost my

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.120 
have a lot more I just have lost my
makeup<00:04:47.850> case<00:04:48.290> i'll<00:04:49.290> try<00:04:49.440> to<00:04:49.560> find<00:04:49.740> it<00:04:49.860> tonight

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
makeup case i'll try to find it tonight

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.330 
makeup case i'll try to find it tonight
I<00:04:50.160> think<00:04:50.310> I<00:04:50.520> left<00:04:50.639> it<00:04:50.820> at<00:04:50.910> dance<00:04:52.040> anyways<00:04:53.040> back

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
I think I left it at dance anyways back

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.710 
I think I left it at dance anyways back
onto<00:04:53.610> topic<00:04:54.590> and<00:04:55.590> then<00:04:55.680> I<00:04:55.800> got<00:04:56.040> high<00:04:56.400> beam<00:04:56.850> and

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
onto topic and then I got high beam and

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:05.779 
onto topic and then I got high beam and
this<00:04:57.870> is<00:04:58.050> the<00:04:58.200> case<00:05:02.900> and<00:05:03.900> it<00:05:04.350> is<00:05:04.560> a<00:05:04.789> highlighter

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
this is the case and it is a highlighter

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:08.210 
this is the case and it is a highlighter
but<00:05:06.750> it<00:05:06.930> looks<00:05:07.139> like<00:05:07.200> nail<00:05:07.500> polish<00:05:07.710> which<00:05:08.039> is

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
but it looks like nail polish which is

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.390 
but it looks like nail polish which is
really<00:05:08.430> funny<00:05:08.990> and<00:05:09.990> I<00:05:10.169> think<00:05:10.200> it's<00:05:10.560> like<00:05:10.770> model

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
really funny and I think it's like model

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.790 
really funny and I think it's like model
in<00:05:11.520> a<00:05:11.610> bottle<00:05:12.030> I<00:05:12.240> think<00:05:12.840> that's<00:05:12.960> what<00:05:13.620> they

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
in a bottle I think that's what they

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.250 
in a bottle I think that's what they
call<00:05:14.010> it<00:05:14.120> but<00:05:15.120> it's<00:05:15.300> really<00:05:15.479> great<00:05:15.750> you<00:05:15.810> put<00:05:16.169> it

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
call it but it's really great you put it

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.409 
call it but it's really great you put it
on<00:05:16.380> your<00:05:16.860> cheekbones<00:05:17.520> and<00:05:17.820> then<00:05:18.060> your<00:05:18.210> bra

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
on your cheekbones and then your bra

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.219 
on your cheekbones and then your bra
bones<00:05:18.750> and<00:05:20.000> it<00:05:21.000> just<00:05:21.210> really<00:05:21.479> highlights<00:05:22.080> it

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
bones and it just really highlights it

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:24.860 
bones and it just really highlights it
gives<00:05:22.470> you<00:05:22.590> a<00:05:22.620> nice<00:05:22.770> glow<00:05:23.389> and<00:05:24.389> then<00:05:24.600> I<00:05:24.690> got
