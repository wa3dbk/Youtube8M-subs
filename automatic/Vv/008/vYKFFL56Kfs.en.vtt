quarter inch longer a couple of reasons
why<00:01:06.119> i<00:01:06.150> prefer<00:01:06.680> vol<00:01:07.680> 5<00:01:07.890> 52<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.670> o<00:01:08.700> 350<00:01:09.330> is

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
why i prefer vol 5 52 the o 350 is

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.090 
why i prefer vol 5 52 the o 350 is
weight<00:01:11.130> wise<00:01:11.400> they<00:01:12.299> feel<00:01:12.600> about<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.990> same<00:01:13.290> but

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
weight wise they feel about the same but

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.730 
weight wise they feel about the same but
since<00:01:14.369> do<00:01:14.520> 550<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.270> larger<00:01:15.720> feels<00:01:16.470> lighter

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
since do 550 is larger feels lighter

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.060 
since do 550 is larger feels lighter
weight<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:18.380> doesn't<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.619> recurve

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
weight and doesn't have that recurve

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.730 
weight and doesn't have that recurve
which<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.759> very<00:01:20.939> nice<00:01:21.150> it's<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.140> manual<00:01:22.470> action

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
which is very nice it's a manual action

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.469 
which is very nice it's a manual action
knife<00:01:23.159> which<00:01:24.090> still<00:01:24.299> deploys<00:01:24.630> very<00:01:24.930> fast<00:01:25.259> and

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
knife which still deploys very fast and

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.859 
knife which still deploys very fast and
the<00:01:27.479> main<00:01:27.659> thing<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:28.080> me<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.409> steel<00:01:29.310> liner<00:01:29.579> lock

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
the main thing to me is steel liner lock

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.940 
the main thing to me is steel liner lock
versus<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.079> titanium<00:01:32.009> frame<00:01:32.579> lock<00:01:32.810> so<00:01:33.920> this<00:01:34.920> is

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
versus a titanium frame lock so this is

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.310 
versus a titanium frame lock so this is
we<00:01:35.460> know<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.640> just<00:01:35.820> like<00:01:36.119> titanium<00:01:36.659> frame<00:01:37.079> locks

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
we know I just like titanium frame locks

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.109 
we know I just like titanium frame locks
better<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.310> can<00:01:38.400> see<00:01:38.579> how<00:01:38.610> much<00:01:38.790> more<00:01:38.970> beef

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
better so you can see how much more beef

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.289 
better so you can see how much more beef
here<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.630> i'm<00:01:40.560> also<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.220> blade<00:01:42.030> thickness

here it is i'm also the blade thickness

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.350 
here it is i'm also the blade thickness
is<00:01:42.689> beefy<00:01:43.470> around<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.740> globe<00:01:43.860> 550<00:01:46.579> do<00:01:47.579> 550<00:01:48.270> is

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
is beefy around the globe 550 do 550 is

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.230 
is beefy around the globe 550 do 550 is
thicker<00:01:48.950> you<00:01:49.950> know<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.310> i<00:01:50.369> mean<00:01:50.520> overall<00:01:50.970> my

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
than an eighth of an inch so it's

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.190 
than an eighth of an inch so it's
thinner<00:02:05.100> than<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.430> sebenza<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:06.600> know<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.049> it

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
thinner than the sebenza you know and it

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.510 
thinner than the sebenza you know and it

and<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:14.470> liner<00:02:14.740> lock<00:02:14.980> which<00:02:15.840> its<00:02:16.840> sturdy<00:02:17.200> I

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
and that liner lock which its sturdy I

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.020 
and that liner lock which its sturdy I

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
guess but the frame lock is just

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.310

thumb<00:02:27.100> studs<00:02:27.370> are<00:02:27.550> larger<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:29.230> know<00:02:29.290> 350<00:02:29.770> has

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860

thumb studs are larger you know 350 has
a<00:02:29.890> flipper<00:02:30.190> so<00:02:30.550> if<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:30.790> like<00:02:30.910> flippers<00:02:31.390> then

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
a flipper so if you like flippers then

a flipper so if you like flippers then
this<00:02:31.810> is<00:02:31.930> probably<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.410> one<00:02:32.770> for<00:02:33.040> you<00:02:34.320> in

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
hair better because it is thinner you

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.699 
hair better because it is thinner you
know<00:04:15.880> so<00:04:16.120> there's<00:04:16.480> less<00:04:16.690> here's<00:04:17.380> me<00:04:17.530> less

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
know so there's less here's me less

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.979 
know so there's less here's me less
friction<00:04:17.980> going<00:04:18.250> through<00:04:18.549> cutting<00:04:18.850> stuff<00:04:19.060> so

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
friction going through cutting stuff so

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.630 
friction going through cutting stuff so
I<00:04:20.020> mean<00:04:20.320> really<00:04:20.500> I<00:04:20.859> mean<00:04:21.070> but<00:04:21.250> this<00:04:21.340> isn't<00:04:21.580> this

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
I mean really I mean but this isn't this

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.880 
I mean really I mean but this isn't this
laughs<00:04:21.850> this<00:04:21.880> cuts<00:04:22.270> pretty<00:04:22.479> well<00:04:22.720> but<00:04:23.470> overall

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
laughs this cuts pretty well but overall

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.300 
laughs this cuts pretty well but overall
I<00:04:24.070> just<00:04:24.400> think<00:04:24.610> that

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
I just think that

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.490 
I just think that
it<00:04:25.700> depends<00:04:26.000> what<00:04:26.090> you<00:04:26.210> want<00:04:26.450> if<00:04:26.630> you<00:04:27.169> want

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
it depends what you want if you want

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.170 
it depends what you want if you want
something<00:04:27.770> that's<00:04:27.950> a<00:04:28.280> simpler<00:04:28.639> knife<00:04:28.850> through

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
something that's a simpler knife through

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.240 
something that's a simpler knife through
which<00:04:29.270> in<00:04:29.450> my<00:04:29.570> opinion<00:04:29.750> is<00:04:30.080> also<00:04:30.350> tougher<00:04:30.740> do

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
which in my opinion is also tougher do

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.480 
which in my opinion is also tougher do
550<00:04:31.940> if<00:04:32.210> you<00:04:32.930> want<00:04:33.110> a<00:04:33.230> knife<00:04:33.410> that's<00:04:33.710> you<00:04:34.370> know

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
550 if you want a knife that's you know

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.330 
550 if you want a knife that's you know
a<00:04:34.520> ZT<00:04:35.120> but<00:04:35.990> not<00:04:36.139> too<00:04:36.380> big<00:04:36.620> but<00:04:36.650> still<00:04:37.130> in<00:04:37.280> the

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
a ZT but not too big but still in the

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.730 
a ZT but not too big but still in the
heavier<00:04:37.669> side<00:04:37.910> with<00:04:38.330> a<00:04:38.600> flipper<00:04:39.470> and<00:04:39.680> a

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
heavier side with a flipper and a

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.700 
heavier side with a flipper and a
recurve<00:04:40.130> that'll<00:04:40.580> cut<00:04:40.820> pretty<00:04:41.210> well<00:04:41.450> then<00:04:41.810> the

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
recurve that'll cut pretty well then the

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.100 
recurve that'll cut pretty well then the
o<00:04:42.740> 350<00:04:43.520> is<00:04:43.610> probably<00:04:43.970> the<00:04:44.150> night<00:04:44.300> for<00:04:44.570> you<00:04:44.720> but

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
o 350 is probably the night for you but

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.310 
o 350 is probably the night for you but
either<00:04:45.350> way<00:04:45.620> I<00:04:45.919> think<00:04:46.130> he'd<00:04:46.520> be<00:04:46.639> satisfied<00:04:47.320> and

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
either way I think he'd be satisfied and

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.710 
either way I think he'd be satisfied and
um<00:04:48.560> I<00:04:48.800> think<00:04:49.370> that<00:04:49.790> they're<00:04:50.030> different<00:04:50.210> enough

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
um I think that they're different enough

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.710 
um I think that they're different enough
to<00:04:50.990> warrant<00:04:51.740> having<00:04:52.160> both<00:04:52.370> so<00:04:52.850> that's<00:04:53.480> why<00:04:53.660> I

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
to warrant having both so that's why I

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.020 
to warrant having both so that's why I
