00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 unlike the other Korean 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.460
 manufacturer lg is not particularly fond 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.099
 breed in their lineup 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.230
 trash out of a thousand and a half smartphones 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.960
 entry level which is different 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.880
 the name and cover of the back panel in 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.520
 this year, for example, state employees have 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.010
 only 4 and today we will talk about the older 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.199
 models of this four named magna with 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.960
 you dmitry lutsenko and the project ferrum com 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.070
 let's take a closer look at her 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.449
 appearance of the device in many ways 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.970
 intersect with top models 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.219
 recent companies for example 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.100
 the back is very similar to g3 and the front 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.350
 the panel with its fold resembles 2 flex in 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.210
 Overall, the gadget looks quite nice and 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.520
 doesn't look cheap so special 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.160
 no claims for clearance 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.590
 performance good gaps no outsiders 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.230
 the body does not make any sound even in spite of 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.210
 its collapsible design given that 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.129
 that the device got to us is clearly not in 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.289
 among the first we can say that simple 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.809
 passed a good stability test 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.789
 to damage and scratch and on the heel 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.829
 on the front panel there are obvious 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.140
 traces of use but neither there nor there 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.630
 chapter they don't rush so easy 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.430
 crash test can be considered passed and here 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.680
 which is clearly striking so it 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.930
 no oleophobic coating on 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.060
 a glass of truth great joy 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.490
 This fact definitely does not bring 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.500
 gadget ergonomics is not bad thanks to 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.720
 fairly narrow frames and relatively 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.970
 small mass and thickness 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.790
 the bend of the glass I spoke at the beginning 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.770
 in practice, almost imperceptible and not palpable 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.689
 the only thing that he really pleases 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.939
 so this is what the front panel is not 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.579
 scratches when the device lies on the screen 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.710
 down no more the virtue of this bend no 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.450
 as already said before the cap in 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.380
 gadget can be removed under it 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.479
 detect removable battery on 2540 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.820
 milliampere hours and three slots 2 fixes and 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.950
 one for the memory card as slots for 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.720
 cell cards 2 obviously what 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.329
 device supports two 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.509
 sim cards radio module in the device one 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.710
 what does it mean I think you yourself know 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.080
 phone reception quality 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.000
 which speaker with microphone on 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.090
 prices at a high enough level to 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.130
 do not cause complaints device display 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.740
 5 inch viola with matrix with 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.810
 720p resolution which is more than 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.640
 enough for adequate communication with 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.680
 device if desired ladder 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.930
 consider of course you can but if not 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.730
 set a similar goal then clarity 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.340
 pictures you will surely stay 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.770
 satisfied the display color is soft and 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.380
 pleasant visually no defects 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.970
 excellent viewing angles detected 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.920
 no tilt color 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.170
 Distorted unless the brightness at 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.140
 glance a little falls but it 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.570
 trivia brightness range is quite wide 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.150
 but its lower limit I want to underestimate even 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.340
 stronger painfully bright this screen shines 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.510
 in total darkness the brains of the device 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.310
 is a mediatek chipset named mti 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.920
 6582 is a quad stone 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.610
 delegation running on frequency 1 and 3 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.650
 video chews mali-400 mp2 RAM heck 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.440
 built-in memory 8 which can 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.990
 complement the card to 32 GB which 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.430
 potential smartphone owner 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.489
 budget or even middle class 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.959
 for sure there will be more than enough 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.600
 iron works well but by the standards 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.850
 flagship owners frankly tight 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.250
 synthetics do not really favor the magician but yes 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.620
 heavy application like games work 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.660
 here is not too fast if in short then 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.180
 this iron is enough for everyday 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.130
 tasks and simple toys but if you 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.620
 want to turn the smartphone into the center 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.989
 entertainment look for something more powerful and 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.420
 more expensive similar state employee your requests 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.250
 won't exactly satisfy as iron 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.440
 there is currently a battery is not 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.050
 the little machine calmly lives to 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.300
 PM 2 days full battery 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.340
 very worthy indicator especially as 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.620
 for not the coolest smartphone 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.870
 about heating, I can say the following: 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.790
 compared with the flagship of recent times 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.890
 magna is not heated at all 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.320
 and if to make a start from absolute zero 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.720
 then heating when performing complex tasks 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.890
 there is but so weak that when choosing 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.480
 smartphone to him 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.790
 can be neglected musical 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.500
 component implemented well in 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.110
 headphones device sounds quite 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.150
 nice though the frequencies sound like according to 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.250
 many missing multimedia speaker 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.319
 cannot boast exceptional 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.720
 loudness but itâ€™s not at the maximum 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.760
 ripit and does not cut the ear that is uniquely 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.590
 well also music lovers for sure 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.019
 will be pleased with the presence of the radio 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.240
 main 8 megapixel camera shoots 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.640
 good pictures and videos in conditions 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.440
 good and soft lighting on bright 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.290
 the sun and with weak sources of external 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.180
 light content is obtained so so 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.010
 Essentially the same can be said about 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.500
 front 5 megapixel camera 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.900
 which removes good links only in 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.940
 greenhouse shooting conditions software 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.460
 component device is represented 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.890
 android 501 lollypop over which 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.380
 knurled custom shell and you 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.360
 better last works smoothly but very 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.790
 often podlagivaet that great joy 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.980
 definitely does not work if work 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.590
 shell is its fault then 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.660
 functional opposite bright dignity 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.940
 For example, the device has an embedded gesture for 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.669
 double tapu awakenings by name 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.250
 knock knock and its trickier variation under 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.140
 name but the cat allows you to create 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.520
 help blind tapov some password 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.280
 thanks to which you are essentially 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.440
 restrict and access your smartphone 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.360
 can not but rejoice the abundance of settings 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.729
 for example, you can flexibly customize 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.100
 keyboard notification bar and even 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.380
 bottom strip of touch buttons that in 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.180
 Generally available is not everyone in 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.669
 the whole system works quite adequate 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.100
 and stably sorry just slow 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.919
 it's time to wrap up at Jim 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.050
 Ukraine's genome is priced at 220 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.060
 dollars for this money we get not 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.190
 the smartest smart phone with quality 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.200
 body good display decent 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.300
 autonomy and relatively good 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.460
 camera in principle for the money you can 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.440
 take after all among representatives a and 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.570
 Smartphone brand is very difficult to find 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.850
 adequate alternative without any 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.530
 critical flaws detailed 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.690
 characteristics as well as prices 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.610
 Devices in the stores closest to you 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.710
 You can visit the website and my and 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.350
 A link will be waiting for you in the description to

 to this 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.400
 and with you was Dmitry Lutsenko and the project 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.620
 ferrum com don't forget to like and 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.820
 subscribe to the channel everyone thanks for
