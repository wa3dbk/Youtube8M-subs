00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.000
 hello here thierry farmers 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.099
 present-day 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.030
 in this video you will see the 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.030
 fat rice harvest 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.420
 and 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.400
 what is the rpt and fat the ray 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.630
 grass and grass ray gras in English 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.610
 means greasy grass 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.960
 so it's a food that's used 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.510
 mainly for livestock 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.640
 me here I grow it for two things 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.800
 feeding cattle so to have 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.750
 hay and also to harvest the 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.190
 seed in order to be able rpt gets going so 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.699
 resell to other people 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.559
 through a seed company so 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.280
 would be serious to be able to sow them and 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.659
 to make a forage crop so 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.140
 here I had a little problem this 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:00.850
 year that is to say that the rain of the month 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.070
 of July who did not stop falling 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.720
 but prevented from harvesting in time and 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.320
 hour what makes that verdi 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.120
 besides, you will be able to see it and 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.830
 the grass is pushed back by the foot so 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.470
 there what am I doing this morning when I get up 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.290
 early is to be able to try to 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.210
 harvest by mowing it so I 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.130
 cut and if I got up early for the 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.110
 to do that is just so there is 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.400
 humility and so that the seeds do not 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.530
 do not fall to the ground because they are 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.700
 so they start to miss each other so 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.009
 so that the seeds do not pump to 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.960
 earth and that moisture lets it stick 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.850
 at most on the little ones good to know 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.560
 that there is already a big loss that 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.280
 realize and put the goal of the game there it's 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.109
 simply to save the harvest I you 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.429
 invite to see a little how will 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:44.170
 pass the harvest for now I the 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:45.880
 do not know yet I hope it's going to go 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.920
 and then I also invite you to watch 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.049
 especially the end of the video I you 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.369
 will learn something really important when 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.759
 we must get up early she is in the 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.909
 fields of happiness right now 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.240
 so here we are here so the 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.490
 the next day 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.640
 mowing was done so yesterday morning 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.750
 and there you will be able to see how that 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.780
 then we got the chance 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.349
 to have two beautiful days of sunshine 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.770
 today it's a bit cloudier 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:18.300
 but it's okay so it has already dried 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:21.780
 so here you can see at the level of 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.930
 rez fat so they and it is well posed 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.090
 dry well if we look closely at 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.349
 ground level 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.540
 we will be able to see that we still had 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.660
 a lot of losses 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:40.560
 so the fat grains of rice are there are 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:41.970
 the earth and its little seeds there so 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.739
 there we already have a lot of losses but hey 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.019
 is trying to save what we can to 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.700
 the harvest is pretty dry enough so 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.920
 it is already is already a good point 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.060
 and that's what I propose to you 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.459
 do a little trick and then show you 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.760
 how does the thresher work when we 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.760
 work 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:10.440
 here thresher who pick up so the 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.440
 part that was mown 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.580
 a little courage 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.990
 the machine 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.390
 bah the grain the sort puts him in his 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.520
 cell in its water supply and 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.310
 rejects at the back the mini parilla which 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.740
 are ejected right on the left it's 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.910
 down the land and by camp 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.910
 put on the ground 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.900
 so here elegant and brooms in the 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.010
 trailer besides there is the threshing machine 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.010
 who comes to empty 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.720
 of the hopper which is at the top 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.720
 just empty into the trailer 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:46.100
 so here we are at the moment of 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:49.280
 pressing so we are a man more than jce 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.810
 no nonsense j + 4 so we had a 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.300
 day in which we were able to work 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.290
 then it started to rain so there this 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.000
 what I did is that I returned 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:01.040
 the swaths of prb so of rice straw 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.380
 fat that stays and so the press is in 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.140
 doing the bales 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.720
 to be able to recover the rice straw 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:11.650
 fat which is a bit of a quality point 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.650
 I mean I mean 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.640
 so here we are picking up 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.830
 so the bales of straw hay from 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.260
 fatty rice and we will place them on the 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.670
 trolleys with telescopic 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:35.210
 we are hungry to bring them back to the farm for 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:37.480
 to store them to go to give to 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.480
 horses 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:52.140
 on average abalo like that one melts to 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:53.460
 the opposite about 300 350 kg what then 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.250
 for sure it's more comparable to that 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.980
 we did before with little ones 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:02.180
 balocchi weigh the 20 kg roughly 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.180
 had to all handled by hand 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.460
 which was far from obvious at 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.560
 the time I did like that with 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.319
 straw bales right from the start when 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.849
 I was younger and it is true that we 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:16.360
 well improved conditions work by 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:16.360
 report to that 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.980
 what we handle now less 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.970
 five minutes 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:36.360
 well it was done in more than one 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:36.360
 half an hour to the force of arms there on 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:42.360
 reports the 30 years of it not ap 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.809
 so here is the supply of fatty rice that 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.999
 were stored on the ground or 

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:56.550
 more precisely on sheaths of 

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:57.990
 ventilation as we can see here so 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.520
 a ventilation system that is planned 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.930
 for carrot conservation but there 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.449
 which is used here for 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.009
 theirs is big and so that allows for 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:07.650
 to dry in this year we have a harvest 

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:09.539
 quite dry enough relatively dry 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.610
 so I do not have too much trouble 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:13.229
 ventilation years ago where you 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.370
 must break down because humility does 

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:17.270
 raise the temperature 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:21.060
 and it creates a mold and then a 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:23.310
 a loss of germinal value book on 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.710
 the seeds what because of a rise in 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.300
 temperature 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.189
 at the beginning of the video I told you that 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.199
 I was going to give you something 

00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:32.580
 essential if you want to leave early 

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:36.029
 in the morning to go to the fields 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:37.589
 well this thing here it is not 

00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:39.839
 do not forget his toilet paper 

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:42.210
 so I recommend this model that 

00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:44.249
 is very soft flattened sand and in addition 

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:45.479
 very sweet that's eh ben I wish you 

00:07:44.249 --> 00:07:48.439
 have a good day and see you soon on 

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:48.439
 the farmer today 

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.160
 and
