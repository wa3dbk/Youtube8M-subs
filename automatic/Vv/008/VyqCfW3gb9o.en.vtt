00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.429 
it like this and see it ends right at
that<00:01:01.829> just<00:01:02.609> out<00:01:02.820> right<00:01:03.059> here<00:01:03.329> where<00:01:04.320> they

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
that just out right here where they

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.050 
that just out right here where they
split<00:01:04.739> up<00:01:04.890> because<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.430> right<00:01:08.640> one<00:01:08.820> is

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
split up because the the right one is

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.690 
split up because the the right one is
supposed<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.420> go<00:01:09.540> behind<00:01:09.930> your<00:01:10.080> ear<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.700> don't

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
supposed to go behind your ear I don't

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.600 
supposed to go behind your ear I don't
really<00:01:11.880> like<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.479> but<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.560> can<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:14.340> settle

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
really like that but I can just settle

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.480 
really like that but I can just settle
for<00:01:14.760> just<00:01:15.479> putting<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.900> front<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.350> myself<00:01:17.330> I

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
for just putting in front of myself I

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.120 
for just putting in front of myself I
actually<00:01:20.490> already<00:01:21.170> broke<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.500> right<00:01:22.920> one<00:01:23.100> I

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
actually already broke the right one I

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.020 
actually already broke the right one I
believe<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.600> one<00:01:25.400> doesn't<00:01:26.400> work<00:01:26.610> but

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
believe so this one doesn't work but

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.999 
believe so this one doesn't work but
that<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.509> my<00:01:27.840> fault<00:01:27.900> because<00:01:28.290> when<00:01:28.770> i<00:01:28.799> get

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009
