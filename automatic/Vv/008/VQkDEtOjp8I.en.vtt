00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
training for a race doesn't really

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.910

rain

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.969 
rain
they<00:01:02.820> might<00:01:03.030> for<00:01:03.390> extreme<00:01:03.840> thunderstorms<00:01:04.769> or

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
they might for extreme thunderstorms or

they might for extreme thunderstorms or
severe<00:01:05.850> weather<00:01:06.150> conditions<00:01:06.720> but<00:01:07.439> not<00:01:08.420> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
severe weather conditions but not the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.640 
severe weather conditions but not the
rain<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.860> need<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.310> learn<00:01:11.520> how<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.350> run<00:01:13.350> in

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
rain so you need to learn how to run in

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.560 
rain so you need to learn how to run in
the<00:01:13.740> rain<00:01:13.950> because<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.520> don't<00:01:14.760> know<00:01:15.000> what

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
the rain because you don't know what

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.390 
the rain because you don't know what
it's<00:01:15.720> going<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.930> be<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.170> race<00:01:16.439> day<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.009> you

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
it's going to be on race day and you

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.520 
it's going to be on race day and you
absolutely<00:01:17.640> don't<00:01:18.390> want<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.750> show<00:01:18.960> up<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:19.200> a

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
absolutely don't want to show up for a

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.789 
absolutely don't want to show up for a
race<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.159> try<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.000> run<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:22.020> condition<00:01:22.650> that

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
race and try to run in a condition that

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.190 
race and try to run in a condition that
you've<00:01:23.100> never<00:01:23.310> trained<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:24.000> before<00:01:24.420> or<00:01:24.900> in

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
you've never trained in before or in

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.070 
you've never trained in before or in
clothes<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:26.040> you've<00:01:26.580> never<00:01:26.790> worn<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.689> that

clothes that you've never worn in that

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.230 
clothes that you've never worn in that
condition<00:01:28.439> before<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.640> don't<00:01:29.820> want<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.090> do

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
condition before you don't want to do

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.120 
condition before you don't want to do
anything<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.869> race<00:01:31.110> day<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.710> haven't

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
anything on race day that you haven't

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.260 
anything on race day that you haven't
trained<00:01:32.579> for<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.509> if<00:01:34.079> it's<00:01:34.350> raining<00:01:34.590> outside

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
trained for so if it's raining outside

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.200 
trained for so if it's raining outside
get<00:01:36.270> out<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.630> run<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:37.110> actually<00:01:37.530> love<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:39.000> run

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
get out and run I actually love to run

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.780 
get out and run I actually love to run
in<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.509> rain<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:40.560> actually<00:01:40.890> usually<00:01:41.369> merge

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
in the rain I actually usually merge

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.399 
in the rain I actually usually merge
these<00:01:42.060> into<00:01:42.509> what<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.689> call<00:01:42.930> my<00:01:43.079> relaxation

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
these into what I call my relaxation

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.560 
these into what I call my relaxation
runs<00:01:44.189> which<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.640> talked<00:01:44.880> about<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.299> couple<00:01:45.420> of

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
runs which I talked about in a couple of

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.990 
runs which I talked about in a couple of
videos<00:01:45.630> ago<00:01:46.250> so<00:01:47.250> when<00:01:47.399> you're<00:01:47.520> done<00:01:47.640> with<00:01:47.850> this

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
videos ago so when you're done with this

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.359 
videos ago so when you're done with this
go<00:01:48.329> watch<00:01:48.630> my<00:01:48.840> relaxation<00:01:49.409> run<00:01:49.829> video<00:01:50.130> if<00:01:50.280> you

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
go watch my relaxation run video if you

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.330 
go watch my relaxation run video if you
haven't<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:50.939> what<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.750> mean<00:01:52.020> by<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
haven't and what I mean by that is a

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.069 
haven't and what I mean by that is a
completely<00:01:53.850> unplug<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.509> don't<00:01:54.659> listen<00:01:54.869> to

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
completely unplug I don't listen to

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.100 
completely unplug I don't listen to
music<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:56.009> very<00:01:56.579> rarely<00:01:56.670> look<00:01:57.240> at<00:01:57.329> my<00:01:57.509> watch<00:01:57.750> I

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
music I very rarely look at my watch I

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.499 
music I very rarely look at my watch I
know<00:01:58.170> about<00:01:58.500> how<00:01:58.770> far<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.100> want<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.549> go<00:01:59.670> but<00:02:00.299> I

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
know about how far I want to go but I

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.280 
know about how far I want to go but I
just<00:02:00.540> get<00:02:00.869> out

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
just get out

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.830 
just get out
and<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.770> enjoyed<00:02:02.280> running<00:02:02.909> in<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.270> rain<00:02:03.450> that

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
and I enjoyed running in the rain that

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.350 
and I enjoyed running in the rain that
the<00:02:04.320> rain<00:02:04.560> falling<00:02:05.100> on<00:02:05.189> my<00:02:05.369> skin<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.969> usually

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
the rain falling on my skin it usually

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.359 
the rain falling on my skin it usually
keeps<00:02:06.600> me<00:02:06.810> cool<00:02:07.020> you'll<00:02:07.350> often<00:02:07.530> find<00:02:07.770> that

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
keeps me cool you'll often find that

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.740 
keeps me cool you'll often find that
when<00:02:08.849> you're<00:02:08.940> running<00:02:09.090> in<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.420> rain

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
when you're running in the rain

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.870 
when you're running in the rain
you<00:02:10.710> might<00:02:10.860> actually<00:02:11.070> run<00:02:11.460> a<00:02:11.490> little<00:02:11.700> bit

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
you might actually run a little bit

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.810 
you might actually run a little bit
faster<00:02:12.450> than<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:13.200> do<00:02:13.380> in<00:02:13.680> dry<00:02:14.190> conditions

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
faster than you do in dry conditions

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.490 
faster than you do in dry conditions
because<00:02:15.570> there<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.930> rain<00:02:16.110> is<00:02:16.350> actually

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
because there the rain is actually

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.860 
because there the rain is actually
keeping<00:02:17.100> your<00:02:17.250> coop<00:02:17.490> keeping<00:02:17.850> your<00:02:17.970> cool<00:02:18.150> now

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
keeping your coop keeping your cool now

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.740 
keeping your coop keeping your cool now
the<00:02:19.230> downside<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.400> with<00:02:21.060> rain<00:02:21.360> comes

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
the downside to that is with rain comes

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.780 
the downside to that is with rain comes
humidity<00:02:22.410> which<00:02:22.980> makes<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.400> just<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.670> little

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
humidity which makes it just a little

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.340 
humidity which makes it just a little
bit<00:02:24.000> harder<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.420> breathe<00:02:24.690> so<00:02:25.050> while<00:02:25.200> you're

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
bit harder to breathe so while you're

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.600 
bit harder to breathe so while you're
running<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.830> rain<00:02:26.010> you're<00:02:26.220> breathing

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
running in the rain you're breathing

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.850 
running in the rain you're breathing
might<00:02:26.790> be<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:26.970> little<00:02:27.120> bit<00:02:27.330> off<00:02:27.480> but<00:02:28.200> don't

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
might be a little bit off but don't

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.510 
might be a little bit off but don't
worry<00:02:29.010> about<00:02:29.160> it

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
worry about it

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.980 
worry about it
just<00:02:29.730> get<00:02:29.910> out<00:02:30.110> enjoy<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.850> sensation<00:02:32.850> of<00:02:33.600> rain

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
just get out enjoy the sensation of rain

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.410 
just get out enjoy the sensation of rain
