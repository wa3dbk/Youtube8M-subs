00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
that and the other towers fine well as

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.450 
that and the other towers fine well as
we<00:01:54.840> know<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.290> 911<00:01:55.439> that's<00:01:55.979> not<00:01:56.159> what<00:01:56.310> happened

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
we know in 911 that's not what happened

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.789 
we know in 911 that's not what happened
to<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.840> plane<00:01:58.049> kit<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.530> then<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.770> other

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
to the plane kit and then the other

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.499 
to the plane kit and then the other
plane<00:01:59.159> hit<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.579> then<00:01:59.670> both<00:01:59.880> buildings<00:02:00.299> fell

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
plane hit and then both buildings fell

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.719 
plane hit and then both buildings fell
completely<00:02:00.899> down<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.950> may<00:02:02.250> not<00:02:02.280> one

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
completely down so it may not one

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.120 
completely down so it may not one
survived<00:02:03.149> or<00:02:03.420> anything<00:02:03.659> like<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:03.890> and<00:02:04.890> also

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
survived or anything like that and also

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.310 
survived or anything like that and also
it<00:02:05.759> also<00:02:05.850> mentions<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.479> nuclear<00:02:06.840> strike<00:02:07.079> in

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
it also mentions a nuclear strike in

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.719 
it also mentions a nuclear strike in
that<00:02:07.350> card<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:07.979> course<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.429> wasn't<00:02:08.610> a

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
that card and of course it wasn't a

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.290 
that card and of course it wasn't a
nuclear<00:02:09.060> strike<00:02:09.209> at<00:02:09.390> all<00:02:09.539> it's<00:02:09.690> two<00:02:09.810> airplanes

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
nuclear strike at all it's two airplanes

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.000 
nuclear strike at all it's two airplanes
so<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.690> know<00:02:12.840> that's<00:02:13.200> gone<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.830> then<00:02:13.920> the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
so you know that's gone and then the

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.710 
so you know that's gone and then the
other<00:02:14.160> one<00:02:14.220> has<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.670> Pentagon<00:02:15.150> with<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.480> big

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
other one has the Pentagon with a big

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.140 
other one has the Pentagon with a big
fire<00:02:16.290> right<00:02:16.650> in<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.800> middle<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.129> it<00:02:17.310> but<00:02:18.000> we

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
fire right in the middle of it but we

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.070 
fire right in the middle of it but we
know<00:02:18.270> that's<00:02:18.450> not<00:02:18.569> what<00:02:18.629> happened<00:02:18.780> either

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
know that's not what happened either

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.080 
know that's not what happened either
because<00:02:19.379> a<00:02:19.410> plane<00:02:19.680> hit<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.040> in<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.220> side<00:02:20.580> and

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
because a plane hit it in the side and

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.880 
because a plane hit it in the side and
the<00:02:21.680> there<00:02:22.680> was<00:02:22.770> no<00:02:22.920> fire<00:02:23.160> anyway<00:02:23.760> so<00:02:24.890> it's

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
the there was no fire anyway so it's

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.619 
the there was no fire anyway so it's
close<00:02:26.129> enough<00:02:26.160> for<00:02:26.489> most<00:02:26.790> people<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.390> they

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
close enough for most people and they

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.089 
close enough for most people and they
seem<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:27.989> think<00:02:28.110> that<00:02:28.440> this<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.770> our<00:02:28.920> our

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
seem to think that this is our our

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.640 
seem to think that this is our our
launch<00:02:29.580> pad<00:02:29.940> or<00:02:30.239> ideas<00:02:30.810> we're<00:02:31.050> releasing<00:02:31.349> them

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
launch pad or ideas we're releasing them

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.500 
launch pad or ideas we're releasing them
out<00:02:31.739> to<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:31.950> public<00:02:32.129> as<00:02:32.370> if<00:02:32.849> we<00:02:32.970> are<00:02:33.000> compelled
