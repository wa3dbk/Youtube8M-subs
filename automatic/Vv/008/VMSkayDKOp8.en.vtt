 I 'm using a lot of parts and talking. 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:30.369
 Now, as in the preceding text, we now have a medium, 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:35.620
 My friends told me I was emptying. 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:40.690
 Only part of the nose is empty. 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:42.520
 I do not know how to do it. 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.020
 You know, the girls are improving. 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.600
 Only the water here is weird . I do not particularly like it. So at the interview 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.110
 It is very important to love nine people . 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.500
 That's why finding the right pitch for me is paramount. 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:01:00.489

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.820

 I've come to love. Yes. Yes. It's short . It means weed. 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:19.690
 It's not a toy if you think it's easy. 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:26.260
 That voice, that we ate suddenly tense calm when wearing formal non-emergency 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:30.400

 In addition to that, the leveling goes up and down slightly from the treble 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.970
 I told you the communication was not good 4 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:42.430

 The sea is not so good, and treble makes people tired. 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:01.330
 Women, of course , have a higher tone than men, 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:06.220
 I have the ability to do it. 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.780
 However, women are more likely to be overtaken by high-pitched instruments 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.610
 So you do not. 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:18.730

 When I checked the three company announcers , I usually checked one 220 and three 252 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:41.769

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.030
 So if you do not want to be with an anchor man, 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.650
 Because it is not 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:23.590
 Now I've talked about pronunciation, unclear pronunciation, and various other things. 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:29.110
 Can I have a consonant, but only one side, grasp this one 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:34.540

 But when I write a lot, there are plenty of times I do. I have a lot of volunteers . 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:52.700
 얜 2 So if you care about other muscles 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:56.659

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:40.699
 And you see the winner . 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:45.020
 There are so many places where there are many electrons. 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:50.300
 I want you to be a chance to practice a lot when you are finished today . 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:53.720
 So that straighten and do not come to an end connected to the back teeth with the 2000 party

 It will have the ability to touch the border area 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:02.960
 So it 's just like this. 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:07.610

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:13.099

 I think that's good. 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.899
 It is a talk of successful people. Ahn Chul Soo came out a while ago and said 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:14.899
 You dragged too much into it. 

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:19.339

 Work is now named after the stars of heaven, and also prayed La byeolttagi the trail at 4:00 

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:27.020
 It is said that it is the work of throwing back and making again and as much 

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:32.330
 In fact, because it is difficult how to talk so much hard work 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:34.430
 I 'm really lucky to get a job at the place I want to work. 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:38.899
 I'm also thinking about it. 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:43.459
 So you are doing a lot of that effort, which is to see the interview 

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:47.029
 It's a chance to be ready for what you are prepared for when you meet it 

00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:49.969
 I think you can take good luck with your job. 

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:54.229

 I took a break for about five minutes and now the anchor comes back and I will not really get sick. 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:13.099
 You 'll have a lot more fun doing the actual practice. 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:16.339
 Remember , do not get upset, and I'm sure I've told you. 

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:18.370
