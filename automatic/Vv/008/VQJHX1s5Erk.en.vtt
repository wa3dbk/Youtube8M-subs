00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 well then welcome back to the channel 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.130
 today I bring you an informative video a 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.810
 video very different from what we see each 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.090
 week we will not see micardis trini 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.790
 magic and a video that I think that 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.349
 I needed to do because good 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.849
 almost six months ago that 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.800
 start in this new stage in the channel 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.630
 I started posting videos in November 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.010
 last year and practically published 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.109
 like a couple of videos per week and the 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.939
 truth is that I'm super happy from 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.789
 the beginning so far I have the same 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.630
 illusion and good I think from time to time 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.910
 when it 's important to break a bit the 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.309
 rhythm a couple that's going to analyze 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.559
 a little and above all and I do not want 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.500
 put heavy but thank 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.870
 all because for me it's super important 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.180
 that you are there behind not because you see me 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.100
 the videos not because you are subscribed to 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.410
 truth that gives me exactly the same 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.270
 but what I really appreciate is 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.129
 the participation that you have each me 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.590
 like you put me every comment for 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.969
 I'm super important and the truth is 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.410
 that has a super active channel in that 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.149
 I can not complain at all 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.980
 just tell you that very many 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.960
 thanks for that that for me it is super 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.090
 important last week for example 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.750
 published a video that for me is very 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.430
 special 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.530
 of the invisible beams is one of the 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.420
 few of magic that I have published until 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.100
 now it 's a magic that for me means 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.380
 very much is a neighborhood style very 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.050
 peculiar as you saw and the truth is that 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.760
 the feedback I got from the video was 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.820
 unbelievably overwhelming that is, it surpassed me 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.979
 totally and good I see that we appreciate 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.530
 very much what I do and simply 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.000
 tell them that thanks and I say do not say 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.650
 Well I mean it to heart because 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.060
 I'm sorry but not only not only for the 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.590
 videos but for everything that is out 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.240
 of the videos I get messages that are 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.240
 really amazing if you just 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.570
 tell you that what you have up to now 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.550
 it's absolutely nothing compared to 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.610
 what is going to come I have thought 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.830
 many videos for you in 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.130
 many new movements very many 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.420
 amazing magic theory very innovative 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.430
 I'm sure you 'll like it 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.070
 new collaborations with other channels 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.170
 of youtube and new projects that are going 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.880
 to start during all these videos that 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.210
 I'm saying is going to publish sigh 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.520
 3 and it's going to be brutal and the week that 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.040
 comes I start the recording as well 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.960
 say it and well and I'm super excited 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.120
 I think I make an amazing video 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.040
 I'm also going to organize another contest 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.370
 more but this time one much more 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.810
 great and I think we're going to love the 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.790
 contest is not going to be by instagram this 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.070
 time will be on youtube that many 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.080
 you asked me to do it on youtube 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.460
 so good a couple of little things more than 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.980
 I do not want to move forward yet but they will be 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.780
 also very very very big news 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.120
 they are still in development for that but 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.520
 Well I'm sure you'll like it and 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.650
 well just this video comes 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.800
 being this a video of me for you 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.650
 a kind of catch air breathe see 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.510
 what's happening thank you again not 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.850
 I do not get tired of saying it because I think 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.500
 much in that I believe a lot in that 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.810
 youtube does not make sense if you do not have 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.090
 someone behind who is supporting you that 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.880
 you like what you do so although 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.490
 sound very very silly as you want 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.070
 call to give is something to people 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.020
 what's there I think that's better than me 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.850
 believe is that you tell me what 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.610
 you really like what I do 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.130
 and nothing I do not want to put either 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.750
 heavy in this video but good ya you 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.210
 I say is something that I think I needed 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.800
 say and did not want to publish not 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.480
 approach the little videoblogs that 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.750
 I have because I want to throw you all 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.340
 because I think it 's just that everyone 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.470
 you know how the channel is now like 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.460
 I am and tell you that I will continue 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.320
 go ahead with the channel 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.840
 I will keep posting two videos 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.730
 weekly and well I'd like to say goodbye 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.350
 we've already thought about it, I'm going quiet 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.810
 just text and do your things 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.820
 but I would like to tell you something that I believe 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.620
 which is interesting and I think I need 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.630
 share when I started this second 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.040
 stage on youtube I think I needed the 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.260
 why I did it I think it was because 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.590
 There was something I was missing, that is, it was like 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.120
 that he had as a kind of emptiness and not 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.500
 I understand why a lot because I 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.970
 I wanted a lot also in what there is because 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.430
 it is in life that you can not understand 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.380
 of facts the most beautiful as love or 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.870
 even magic are sometimes 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.910
 inexplicable but you feel something inside 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.880
 from you a fire that tells you that you owe it 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.530
 do then I am what I have felt and 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.330
 that's why I 'm here in front of 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.310
 your speaking right now with 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.840
 you because I think I have to be 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.900
 because I think I have to continue 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.299
 videos and well just tell them this 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.070
 this and as I said super happy and 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.720
 well I did not laugh anymore this is more or less 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.090
 what I wanted to say to you I hope that 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.410
 have some magical days and see you in 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.410
 until after the next video 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.670
 and 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.830
 i 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.830
 all right
