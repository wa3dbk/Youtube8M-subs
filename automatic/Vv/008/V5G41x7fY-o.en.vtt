either side of the stem cutting out the

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.459 
either side of the stem cutting out the
stem<00:00:39.280> and<00:00:39.760> this<00:00:40.719> is<00:00:40.870> the<00:00:40.960> part<00:00:41.170> that's<00:00:41.200> going

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:41.469 
stem and this is the part that's going

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:43.139 
stem and this is the part that's going
to<00:00:41.559> get<00:00:41.649> washed<00:00:41.920> so<00:00:42.100> even<00:00:42.309> before<00:00:42.399> I<00:00:42.610> wash<00:00:42.850> I'm

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
to get washed so even before I wash I'm

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.240 
to get washed so even before I wash I'm
get<00:00:43.329> rid<00:00:43.600> of<00:00:43.629> the<00:00:43.780> stems<00:00:44.110> just<00:00:44.950> because<00:00:45.129> I

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
get rid of the stems just because I

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.069

tightly<00:01:59.340> like<00:02:00.180> you'd<00:02:00.390> be<00:02:00.539> rolling<00:02:00.869> cigars<00:02:01.850> and

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
tightly like you'd be rolling cigars and

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.810 
tightly like you'd be rolling cigars and
then<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.180> slice<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.780> pretty<00:02:04.020> thin<00:02:04.820> really

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
then you slice it pretty thin really

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.729 
then you slice it pretty thin really
thin<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:09.229> then<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.289> get<00:02:10.380> these<00:02:10.560> beautiful

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
thin and then you get these beautiful

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.710 
thin and then you get these beautiful
ribbons<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:12.200> look<00:02:13.200> like<00:02:14.690> possibly<00:02:15.690> a

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
ribbons that look like possibly a

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.960 
ribbons that look like possibly a
seaweed<00:02:16.290> or<00:02:16.350> something<00:02:17.010> but<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.340> helps<00:02:17.820> the

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
seaweed or something but it helps the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.420 
seaweed or something but it helps the
kale<00:02:18.410> tenderize<00:02:19.410> once<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:19.830> start<00:02:20.070> adding<00:02:20.160> the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
kale tenderize once you start adding the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.650 
kale tenderize once you start adding the
acid<00:02:21.090> like<00:02:21.299> lemon<00:02:21.600> juice<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:22.080> it

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.880 

hey<00:02:28.530> I'm<00:02:28.680> going<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:28.920> slice<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.400> pomegranate

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
hey I'm going to slice the pomegranate

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.560 
hey I'm going to slice the pomegranate
so<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.160> then<00:02:32.370> I'm<00:02:32.700> going<00:02:32.820> to<00:02:32.910> actually<00:02:33.090> peel

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
so and then I'm going to actually peel

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.190 
so and then I'm going to actually peel
it<00:02:33.780> underwater<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:35.430> in<00:02:36.030> this<00:02:36.240> recipe<00:02:36.630> i<00:02:36.900> think

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
it underwater and in this recipe i think

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.750 
it underwater and in this recipe i think
what<00:02:37.290> i'm<00:02:37.380> going<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.560> do<00:02:37.710> is<00:02:37.740> keep<00:02:38.160> some<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:38.670> the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
what i'm going to do is keep some of the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.880 
what i'm going to do is keep some of the
pomegranate<00:02:38.970> seeds<00:02:39.540> in<00:02:39.750> there<00:02:40.080> as<00:02:40.230> well<00:02:40.740> as

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
juice some of them and i think i learned

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.010 
juice some of them and i think i learned
this<00:02:42.840> on<00:02:43.020> martha<00:02:43.350> stewart1<00:02:43.740> to<00:02:44.070> you<00:02:44.550> do<00:02:44.730> the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
this on martha stewart1 to you do the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.270 
this on martha stewart1 to you do the
pomegranate<00:02:46.020> underwater<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:47.010> you're<00:02:47.190> not

going to get the juice all over the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.720 
going to get the juice all over the
place<00:02:49.380> as<00:02:49.620> you're<00:02:49.830> peeling<00:02:50.070> it<00:02:50.460> and<00:02:50.640> then

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
like a quarter cup pour it in there and

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.460 
like a quarter cup pour it in there and

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
we'll help get them kind of pumped up

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.160 
we'll help get them kind of pumped up
before<00:04:04.430> we<00:04:04.730> add<00:04:04.849> it<00:04:05.030> all<00:04:05.120> to<00:04:05.299> the<00:04:05.359> mixture<00:04:05.720> i

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
before we add it all to the mixture i

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.800 
before we add it all to the mixture i
think<00:04:07.129> i'm<00:04:07.190> going<00:04:07.280> to<00:04:07.340> give<00:04:08.060> it<00:04:08.090> a<00:04:08.209> taste<00:04:08.420> and

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
think i'm going to give it a taste and

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.839 
think i'm going to give it a taste and
if<00:04:08.989> it's<00:04:09.170> needs<00:04:09.650> some<00:04:09.859> sweetening<00:04:10.340> i'll<00:04:10.430> add<00:04:10.579> a

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
if it's needs some sweetening i'll add a

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.599

oil and a little bit of garlic I'm going
to<00:04:47.900> do<00:04:48.050> like<00:04:48.410> a<00:04:48.440> quarter<00:04:48.770> teaspoon<00:04:48.949> just

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
to do like a quarter teaspoon just

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.410 
to do like a quarter teaspoon just
garlic<00:04:51.260> in<00:04:51.470> there<00:04:51.710> cuz<00:04:52.640> I<00:04:52.760> like<00:04:52.940> it<00:04:53.000> that's

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
garlic in there cuz I like it that's

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.970 
garlic in there cuz I like it that's
optional<00:04:53.930> I<00:04:54.080> think<00:04:54.320> I<00:04:54.410> don't<00:04:54.560> think<00:04:54.710> you<00:04:54.800> have

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
optional I think I don't think you have

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.100 
optional I think I don't think you have
to<00:04:55.010> do<00:04:55.280> that<00:04:55.430> a<00:04:55.730> little<00:04:56.150> salt<00:04:56.360> and<00:04:56.480> pepper<00:04:56.540> too

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
to do that a little salt and pepper too

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.980 
to do that a little salt and pepper too
and<00:04:57.740> I'm<00:04:58.670> judging<00:04:59.270> this<00:04:59.360> this<00:04:59.540> is<00:04:59.690> probably

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
and I'm judging this this is probably

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.400 
and I'm judging this this is probably
like<00:05:00.260> a<00:05:00.470> quarter<00:05:00.890> teaspoon<00:05:01.070> as<00:05:01.550> well<00:05:01.730> now<00:05:02.410> it's

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
like a quarter teaspoon as well now it's

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.690 
like a quarter teaspoon as well now it's
a<00:05:03.530> little<00:05:03.560> bit<00:05:03.860> of<00:05:03.950> pepper<00:05:05.740> who<00:05:06.740> are<00:05:07.160> trying<00:05:07.520> to

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.840 
a little bit of pepper who are trying to
suffer<00:05:08.330> so<00:05:08.720> I'm<00:05:08.990> kind<00:05:09.440> of<00:05:09.590> massaging<00:05:10.310> in<00:05:10.550> the

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
suffer so I'm kind of massaging in the

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.000 
suffer so I'm kind of massaging in the
olive<00:05:11.180> oil<00:05:11.420> into<00:05:11.840> the<00:05:12.650> kale<00:05:14.710> just<00:05:15.710> making<00:05:15.950> sure
