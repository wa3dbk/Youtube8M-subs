00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440
 well so that you are ready you are ready buff let's 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:11.160
 let's make heat yes yes yes no god not 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:14.610
 maybe maybe so yes it was 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:23.939
 cool let's jump on the field 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:25.439
 jump like that and there is no bob where the roads are 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.330
 my channel video subscribers are my name 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.269
 Andrei and welcome to the simulator 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.790
 batu yes yes it is a trampoline you are not 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.630
 misheard this is senator trampoline where you 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.790
 have to jump on a trampoline in general and 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:44.329
 try to do any tricks 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:47.879
 it was literally in general the essence is that 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.620
 the more you jump the stronger 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.050
 the likelihood that you can pierce 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.559
 trampolines strength impenetrable yes he 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.949
 punched it means that not everything is so 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.210
 smoothly the following is what we can 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.879
 turn your 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.010
 and a certain turn of events dn 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.600
 Well, that is, let's say here and now in this 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.430
 lower left corner when u allow 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.750
 pitch left turn this was 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.830
 such an icon will appear 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.740
 figure yes oh it hurts for sure 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.990
 and one tension is shorter that is than 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.470
 Further than longer hold 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.670
 and the first case, or the more it this 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.090
 dummy do n't know it 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:32.310
 the robot let's say it will turn 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:36.600
 this side here and accordingly I am 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.659
 that is, the inability to jump but 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.729
 keys 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.030
 Arrows I can precisely rotate 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:47.359
 so here and themselves will click if left and down 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.549
 so here and sit down and easily down then 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:50.109
 just sit down in principle yes one and that 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.850
 same 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:54.499
 right because she will jump on it 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.829
 very cool because on spilling right away 

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:59.450
 trampoline on chm she calls robak and valerie 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.399
 same up I can turn 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:09.250
 that is, roughly speaking, I can then let them 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:11.390
 take a thing like that on the mind and fall 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:22.970
 shorter fun for me here very much 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:32.450
 liked and so does not work so 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:35.359
 ok now stretch make pop 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.299
 it's so not cool lanna is not boxing 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:40.250
 it is a theater it is shorter than this bit to us 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:46.359
 large in a large area for 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.359
 imagination really for a grandson 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.680
 they will not have time to finish the trick 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:03:00.620
 yes and sleep make me war night with just 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:03.120
 yes like an arrow flew articles class 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:09.810
 shorter toy really cool clean 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:14.880
 To postebatsya ear fear so as 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:33.470
 and probably in general who tried to sock 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:40.200
 on the field you can not jump stuck 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:41.940
 cool right in agate plan oh well shorter 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.050
 here you can ideally be cool 5 here 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.600
 shoot videos on 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.830
 and vylazhivat likely or not at all 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.180
 I know how it is right on the trampoline from 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.610
 jump I listen to the logic only flips 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.860
 do on the trampoline 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.640
 experience is not so much but this toy 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:02.280
 do not chain the mind can someone light 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:08.070
 work then so ok let's turn on that 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:11.610
 the side ca n't do not take that 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:26.480
 the side on can basically like this 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:35.280
 jump let's just be wrong oh 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:38.880
 no, well, in short, it's hard to 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:44.450
 I spun at prilovchilis with this tattoo there 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.450
 the middle of the flood there is nothing wrong 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:59.140
 six hundred and dad something about jumping 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:05:00.940
 once again oh well on this finished guys 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.910
 Here is such a senator trampoline principle 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.360
 not bad houses 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:09.670
 original idea actually 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.050
 kapets like a centipede well lan all 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.450
 try to play and cool rooks 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.120
 will tell time and more small 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.500
 period of time to pass andrew himself 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.810
 chaped yourself put huskies 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.800
 subscribe to the channel and see you on 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.800
 good luck to everyone
