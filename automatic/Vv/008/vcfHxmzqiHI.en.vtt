of color range basically you can just

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.599 
of color range basically you can just

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:36.609 
take and hold shift in order to select

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:38.370 
take and hold shift in order to select
different<00:00:36.969> colors<00:00:37.270> you<00:00:37.720> can<00:00:37.870> see<00:00:37.899> the<00:00:38.200> more

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.380 
different colors you can see the more

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.680 
different colors you can see the more
colors<00:00:38.710> on<00:00:38.950> her<00:00:39.130> face<00:00:39.310> that<00:00:39.520> I<00:00:39.579> select<00:00:39.940> on<00:00:40.090> the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
colors on her face that I select on the

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.790 
colors on her face that I select on the
white<00:00:40.870> or<00:00:40.989> her<00:00:41.110> face<00:00:41.320> gets<00:00:41.590> which<00:00:41.770> is

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
white or her face gets which is

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.889 
white or her face gets which is
basically<00:00:42.280> whatever's<00:00:43.180> white<00:00:43.390> is<00:00:43.570> going<00:00:43.809> to

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
basically whatever's white is going to

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:45.600 
basically whatever's white is going to
be<00:00:43.989> your<00:00:44.350> end<00:00:44.559> selection<00:00:45.130> but<00:00:45.280> you<00:00:45.340> can<00:00:45.489> see

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
be your end selection but you can see

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.760 
be your end selection but you can see
that<00:00:45.730> it<00:00:45.820> also<00:00:45.970> selects<00:00:46.450> that<00:00:46.630> in<00:00:46.870> other<00:00:47.350> areas

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
that it also selects that in other areas

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.290 
that it also selects that in other areas
of<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:48.010> photo<00:00:48.160> so<00:00:48.370> you<00:00:48.579> can<00:00:48.760> adjust<00:00:49.180> this

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
of the photo so you can adjust this

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.930 
of the photo so you can adjust this
slider<00:00:49.600> but<00:00:50.440> you<00:00:50.559> can<00:00:50.770> never<00:00:50.860> get<00:00:51.160> a<00:00:51.340> very<00:00:51.850> good

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
slider but you can never get a very good

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.639 
slider but you can never get a very good
selection<00:00:52.450> it's<00:00:53.050> good<00:00:53.200> for<00:00:53.440> some

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
selection it's good for some

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.250 
selection it's good for some
circumstances<00:00:54.370> but<00:00:54.579> in<00:00:55.090> others<00:00:55.329> I<00:00:55.540> gets<00:00:56.170> a

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
circumstances but in others I gets a

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.160 
circumstances but in others I gets a
little<00:00:56.410> rough<00:00:57.340> now<00:00:57.879> in<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.420> last<00:00:58.690> version<00:00:58.989> of

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
little rough now in the last version of

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.900 
little rough now in the last version of
Photoshop<00:00:59.559> you<00:00:59.739> saw<00:01:00.070> localized<00:01:00.610> color

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
Photoshop you saw localized color

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.580 
Photoshop you saw localized color
clusters<00:01:01.030> added<00:01:01.690> so<00:01:01.809> if<00:01:01.870> you<00:01:01.989> check<00:01:02.230> that<00:01:02.260> on

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
clusters added so if you check that on

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.770 
clusters added so if you check that on
you<00:01:03.040> can<00:01:03.219> basically<00:01:03.370> take<00:01:03.850> and<00:01:04.119> adjust<00:01:04.600> this

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
you can basically take and adjust this

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.039 
you can basically take and adjust this
new<00:01:04.960> range<00:01:05.259> slider<00:01:05.619> so<00:01:05.950> if<00:01:06.039> we<00:01:06.270> check<00:01:07.270> in<00:01:07.810> her

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
new range slider so if we check in her

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.710 
new range slider so if we check in her
face<00:01:08.350> here<00:01:08.619> and<00:01:08.829> then<00:01:08.950> we<00:01:09.570> expand<00:01:10.570> that<00:01:10.630> out

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
face here and then we expand that out

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.109 
face here and then we expand that out
you<00:01:10.930> can<00:01:11.049> see<00:01:11.200> that<00:01:11.229> we<00:01:11.409> can<00:01:11.560> kind<00:01:11.770> of<00:01:12.119> just

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
you can see that we can kind of just

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.440 
you can see that we can kind of just
refine<00:01:13.630> our<00:01:13.990> color<00:01:14.770> range<00:01:15.070> to<00:01:15.490> that<00:01:15.909> specific

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
refine our color range to that specific

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.510 
refine our color range to that specific
area<00:01:16.690> again<00:01:17.680> it's<00:01:17.860> still<00:01:18.010> getting<00:01:18.130> a<00:01:18.369> little

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
area again it's still getting a little

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.289 
area again it's still getting a little
bit<00:01:18.760> out<00:01:18.909> now<00:01:19.450> with<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:20.260> new<00:01:20.860> addition<00:01:21.850> in

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
bit out now with the new addition in

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.840 
bit out now with the new addition in
Photoshop<00:01:22.990> cs6<00:01:23.320> what<00:01:23.710> we<00:01:23.830> have<00:01:24.010> is<00:01:24.280> under<00:01:24.670> this

faces<00:01:35.100> now<00:01:36.100> in<00:01:36.549> most<00:01:37.240> things<00:01:37.540> that<00:01:38.080> I've<00:01:38.200> seen

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
faces now in most things that I've seen

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.080 
faces now in most things that I've seen
online<00:01:38.530> this<00:01:38.860> is<00:01:39.070> pretty<00:01:39.310> much<00:01:39.430> just<00:01:39.640> magic

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
online this is pretty much just magic

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.719 
online this is pretty much just magic
and<00:01:40.630> it<00:01:40.780> basically<00:01:41.110> works<00:01:41.380> really<00:01:42.100> super<00:01:42.549> well

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
and it basically works really super well

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.789 
and it basically works really super well
in<00:01:43.479> this<00:01:43.600> case<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:43.960> can<00:01:44.080> see<00:01:44.229> it<00:01:44.409> does<00:01:44.650> not

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
in this case you can see it does not

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.370 
in this case you can see it does not
work<00:01:45.070> super<00:01:45.549> well<00:01:45.580> so<00:01:46.270> in<00:01:46.869> most<00:01:47.049> of<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.259> images

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
work super well so in most of the images

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.499 
work super well so in most of the images
that<00:01:47.860> I've<00:01:47.979> seen<00:01:48.159> people<00:01:48.460> use<00:01:48.490> this<00:01:48.820> on<00:01:49.030> the

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
that I've seen people use this on the

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.749 
that I've seen people use this on the
person<00:01:50.140> either<00:01:50.259> has<00:01:50.500> darker<00:01:50.920> hair<00:01:51.130> than<00:01:51.460> our

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
person either has darker hair than our

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:52.770 
person either has darker hair than our
model<00:01:52.090> here

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
model here

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.210 
model here
they<00:01:53.049> don't<00:01:53.259> have<00:01:53.439> their<00:01:53.619> hands<00:01:53.799> near<00:01:54.070> their

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
they don't have their hands near their

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.370 
they don't have their hands near their
face<00:01:54.400> they're<00:01:54.729> not<00:01:54.880> wearing<00:01:55.299> a<00:01:55.450> tan<00:01:55.930> sweater

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
face they're not wearing a tan sweater

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.710 
face they're not wearing a tan sweater
which<00:01:56.619> is<00:01:56.770> basically<00:01:57.130> has<00:01:57.850> a<00:01:58.090> lot<00:01:58.329> of<00:01:58.360> skin

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
which is basically has a lot of skin

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.840 
which is basically has a lot of skin
tones<00:01:58.960> in<00:01:59.170> it<00:01:59.350> and<00:01:59.799> it's<00:02:00.340> not<00:02:00.430> on<00:02:00.579> a<00:02:00.610> white

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
tones in it and it's not on a white

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.160 
tones in it and it's not on a white
background<00:02:01.329> so<00:02:01.360> this<00:02:01.509> is<00:02:01.630> kind<00:02:01.810> of<00:02:01.869> a<00:02:01.960> worst

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
background so this is kind of a worst

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.690 
background so this is kind of a worst
case<00:02:02.290> scenario<00:02:02.439> so<00:02:03.280> I<00:02:03.310> wanted<00:02:03.490> to<00:02:03.549> show<00:02:03.670> you

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
case scenario so I wanted to show you

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.280 
case scenario so I wanted to show you
guys<00:02:03.909> how<00:02:03.970> exactly<00:02:04.540> you<00:02:04.689> can<00:02:04.840> handle<00:02:05.140> this

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
guys how exactly you can handle this

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.319 
guys how exactly you can handle this
while<00:02:05.470> still<00:02:05.590> using<00:02:05.710> these<00:02:06.130> new<00:02:06.310> features<00:02:06.549> so

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
while still using these new features so

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:08.309 
while still using these new features so
what<00:02:07.509> we're<00:02:07.630> going<00:02:07.780> to<00:02:07.840> do<00:02:07.990> is<00:02:08.140> actually

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
what we're going to do is actually

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.809 
what we're going to do is actually
cancel<00:02:08.860> out<00:02:08.979> of<00:02:09.009> this<00:02:09.189> and<00:02:09.429> we're<00:02:09.610> going<00:02:09.789> to

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
cancel out of this and we're going to

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.789 
cancel out of this and we're going to
try<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:10.149> first<00:02:10.479> refine<00:02:10.989> down<00:02:11.230> what<00:02:11.439> we<00:02:11.560> want

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
try and first refine down what we want

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.830 
try and first refine down what we want
color<00:02:12.040> range<00:02:12.280> to<00:02:12.459> actually<00:02:12.849> deal<00:02:13.120> with<00:02:13.150> so

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
color range to actually deal with so

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.849 
color range to actually deal with so
what<00:02:13.989> we're<00:02:14.109> going<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.260> do<00:02:14.409> is<00:02:14.499> just<00:02:14.650> kind<00:02:14.799> of

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:14.859 
what we're going to do is just kind of

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:17.099 
what we're going to do is just kind of
zoom<00:02:15.069> in<00:02:15.189> here<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.700> I've<00:02:16.239> got<00:02:16.389> my<00:02:16.510> lasso<00:02:16.930> tool

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:17.109 
zoom in here and I've got my lasso tool

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:18.420 
zoom in here and I've got my lasso tool
you<00:02:17.290> can<00:02:17.439> come<00:02:17.620> over<00:02:17.739> here<00:02:17.829> and<00:02:18.040> grab<00:02:18.159> that

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
you can come over here and grab that

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.710 
you can come over here and grab that
from<00:02:18.609> your<00:02:18.730> toolbar

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
from your toolbar

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.090 
from your toolbar
I'm<00:02:19.780> just<00:02:19.900> going<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:20.110> try<00:02:20.320> and<00:02:20.350> make<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:20.830> quick

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
I'm just going to try and make a quick

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.070 
I'm just going to try and make a quick
selection<00:02:21.400> around<00:02:21.970> her<00:02:22.120> face<00:02:22.390> while<00:02:22.660> not<00:02:22.810> try

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
selection around her face while not try

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.170 
selection around her face while not try
and<00:02:23.140> get<00:02:23.350> any<00:02:23.530> of<00:02:23.710> her<00:02:23.800> hands<00:02:24.010> in<00:02:24.190> there<00:02:24.340> again

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
and get any of her hands in there again

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.730 
and get any of her hands in there again
you<00:02:25.300> can<00:02:25.420> use<00:02:25.540> any<00:02:25.750> other<00:02:25.840> kind<00:02:26.020> of<00:02:26.380> selection

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
you can use any other kind of selection

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.500 
you can use any other kind of selection
method<00:02:27.190> you<00:02:27.280> want<00:02:27.490> you<00:02:27.610> can<00:02:27.760> use<00:02:27.910> like<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.180> pen

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
method you want you can use like the pen

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.790 
method you want you can use like the pen
tool<00:02:28.750> or<00:02:28.900> something<00:02:29.110> if<00:02:29.320> you<00:02:29.410> want<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.650> get<00:02:29.770> a

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
tool or something if you want to get a

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.270 
tool or something if you want to get a
really<00:02:30.250> super<00:02:30.690> fine<00:02:31.690> selection<00:02:32.440> but<00:02:32.890> for<00:02:33.160> now

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
really super fine selection but for now

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.760 
really super fine selection but for now
I<00:02:33.490> think<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.210> lasso<00:02:34.510> tool<00:02:34.540> will<00:02:34.900> work<00:02:35.080> for<00:02:35.500> a

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
I think the lasso tool will work for a

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.710 
I think the lasso tool will work for a
quick<00:02:36.010> selection<00:02:36.430> so<00:02:37.240> now<00:02:37.330> we<00:02:37.390> have<00:02:37.570> basically

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
quick selection so now we have basically

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.810 
quick selection so now we have basically
a<00:02:38.050> selection<00:02:38.320> around<00:02:38.530> her<00:02:38.800> face<00:02:39.040> now<00:02:39.640> we're

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
a selection around her face now we're

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.030 
a selection around her face now we're
going<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.060> do<00:02:40.210> is<00:02:40.360> go<00:02:40.480> back<00:02:40.720> up<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:41.140> select<00:02:41.740> down

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
going to do is go back up to select down

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.890 
going to do is go back up to select down
to<00:02:42.190> color<00:02:42.400> range<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:42.880> you<00:02:43.330> can<00:02:43.450> see<00:02:43.600> that<00:02:43.780> our

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
to color range and you can see that our

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.020 
to color range and you can see that our
color<00:02:44.110> range<00:02:44.350> box<00:02:44.560> is<00:02:44.770> now<00:02:44.920> basically<00:02:45.550> zoomed

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
color range box is now basically zoomed

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.430 
color range box is now basically zoomed
in<00:02:46.180> on<00:02:46.300> just<00:02:46.510> that<00:02:46.690> area<00:02:47.020> so<00:02:47.200> we're<00:02:47.350> not

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
in on just that area so we're not

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.950 
in on just that area so we're not
affecting<00:02:47.890> anything<00:02:48.250> else<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:49.660> now<00:02:49.750> what<00:02:49.870> we

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
affecting anything else so now what we

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.720 
affecting anything else so now what we
can<00:02:49.990> do<00:02:50.200> is<00:02:50.350> go<00:02:50.500> up<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.620> our<00:02:50.740> sampled<00:02:51.190> colors<00:02:51.460> go

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
can do is go up to our sampled colors go

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.850 
can do is go up to our sampled colors go
down<00:02:51.850> to<00:02:52.090> skin<00:02:52.450> tones<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:52.930> then<00:02:53.440> we<00:02:53.560> can<00:02:53.680> take

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
down to skin tones and then we can take

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.190 
down to skin tones and then we can take
and<00:02:54.160> if<00:02:54.340> we<00:02:54.490> want<00:02:54.700> turn<00:02:55.090> on<00:02:55.270> detect<00:02:55.660> faces<00:02:55.840> now

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
and if we want turn on detect faces now

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.110 
and if we want turn on detect faces now
in<00:02:56.380> this<00:02:56.500> case<00:02:56.709> it<00:02:56.950> seems<00:02:57.160> like<00:02:57.340> detect<00:02:57.700> faces

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
in this case it seems like detect faces

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.150 
in this case it seems like detect faces
actually<00:02:58.270> takes<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:58.959> adds<00:02:59.440> in<00:02:59.680> a<00:02:59.709> little<00:03:00.070> bit

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
actually takes and adds in a little bit

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.100 
actually takes and adds in a little bit
more<00:03:00.370> than<00:03:00.610> we<00:03:00.730> want<00:03:01.030> it<00:03:01.270> seems<00:03:01.630> like<00:03:01.810> we<00:03:01.930> get<00:03:02.050> a

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
more than we want it seems like we get a

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.170 
more than we want it seems like we get a
better<00:03:02.290> result<00:03:03.070> without<00:03:03.250> turning<00:03:03.790> detect

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
better result without turning detect

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.580 
better result without turning detect
faces<00:03:04.510> on<00:03:04.630> but<00:03:04.660> keep<00:03:04.959> in<00:03:05.110> mind<00:03:05.140> that<00:03:05.380> this

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
faces on but keep in mind that this

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.230 
faces on but keep in mind that this
button<00:03:05.920> is<00:03:06.100> there<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.550> I've<00:03:06.850> seen<00:03:07.000> it<00:03:07.150> work

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
button is there and I've seen it work

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.300 
button is there and I've seen it work
very<00:03:07.480> well<00:03:07.540> in<00:03:07.840> certain<00:03:07.870> circumstances<00:03:08.830> this

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
very well in certain circumstances this

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.610 
very well in certain circumstances this
is<00:03:09.490> not<00:03:09.670> one<00:03:09.910> of<00:03:09.940> those<00:03:10.150> so<00:03:11.110> I'm<00:03:11.230> just<00:03:11.380> going<00:03:11.500> to

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
is not one of those so I'm just going to

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.199 
is not one of those so I'm just going to
keep<00:03:11.740> it<00:03:11.860> turned<00:03:12.070> off<00:03:12.250> so<00:03:12.760> then<00:03:12.880> we<00:03:12.940> can<00:03:13.060> turn

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
keep it turned off so then we can turn

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.730 
keep it turned off so then we can turn
up<00:03:13.240> the<00:03:13.360> fuzziness<00:03:13.690> a<00:03:13.900> little<00:03:14.110> bit<00:03:14.230> I<00:03:14.410> would

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
up the fuzziness a little bit I would

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.500 
up the fuzziness a little bit I would
recommend<00:03:15.280> that<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:15.459> turn<00:03:15.970> it<00:03:16.120> up<00:03:16.209> a<00:03:16.300> little

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
recommend that you turn it up a little

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.170 
recommend that you turn it up a little
bit<00:03:16.660> maybe<00:03:16.959> 10<00:03:17.500> 15<00:03:17.980> something<00:03:18.670> like<00:03:18.790> that<00:03:18.940> so

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
bit maybe 10 15 something like that so

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.150 
bit maybe 10 15 something like that so
that<00:03:19.270> your<00:03:19.450> end<00:03:19.600> result<00:03:19.780> isn't<00:03:20.170> super<00:03:20.680> sharp

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
that your end result isn't super sharp

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.220 
that your end result isn't super sharp
on<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.490> selection<00:03:21.940> but<00:03:22.750> not<00:03:22.900> too<00:03:23.080> much

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
on the selection but not too much

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.540 
on the selection but not too much
because<00:03:23.410> you<00:03:23.590> don't<00:03:23.709> want<00:03:23.950> it<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.130> bleed<00:03:24.340> into

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
because you don't want it to bleed into

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.910 
because you don't want it to bleed into
other<00:03:24.700> areas<00:03:25.300> so<00:03:26.290> then<00:03:26.410> I'm<00:03:26.500> going<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.739> click

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
other areas so then I'm going to click

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.220 
other areas so then I'm going to click
OK<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:27.880> you<00:03:28.090> can<00:03:28.120> see<00:03:28.239> that<00:03:28.450> we<00:03:28.540> have<00:03:28.750> a<00:03:28.780> fairly

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
OK and you can see that we have a fairly

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.110 
OK and you can see that we have a fairly
good<00:03:29.350> selection<00:03:29.950> you<00:03:30.340> can<00:03:30.519> see<00:03:30.730> that<00:03:30.940> there

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:32.930 
this image say her lips you can just
basically<00:04:30.940> just<00:04:31.300> paint<00:04:31.599> those<00:04:31.780> areas<00:04:32.080> in<00:04:32.260> now

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
basically just paint those areas in now

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.340 
basically just paint those areas in now
would<00:04:33.030> recommend<00:04:33.450> taking<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:33.990> turning<00:04:34.320> down

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
would recommend taking and turning down

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.710 
would recommend taking and turning down
your<00:04:34.740> opacity<00:04:35.040> and<00:04:35.730> maybe<00:04:36.150> something<00:04:36.570> around

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
your opacity and maybe something around

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.830 
your opacity and maybe something around
like<00:04:36.860> 1314<00:04:38.330> grabbing<00:04:39.330> a<00:04:39.390> little<00:04:39.570> bit<00:04:39.690> bigger

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
like 1314 grabbing a little bit bigger

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.450 
like 1314 grabbing a little bit bigger
of<00:04:39.930> a<00:04:40.020> brush<00:04:40.260> and<00:04:40.500> then<00:04:40.620> possibly<00:04:41.070> just<00:04:41.250> going

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
of a brush and then possibly just going

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.010 
of a brush and then possibly just going
around<00:04:41.670> this<00:04:41.850> hairline<00:04:42.240> that<00:04:42.300> we<00:04:42.570> kind<00:04:42.780> of<00:04:42.870> had

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
around this hairline that we kind of had

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.810 
around this hairline that we kind of had
a<00:04:43.050> little<00:04:43.200> bit<00:04:43.320> harder<00:04:43.710> of<00:04:43.800> an<00:04:43.860> edge<00:04:44.040> on<00:04:44.250> just

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
a little bit harder of an edge on just

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.970 
a little bit harder of an edge on just
trying<00:04:45.000> to<00:04:45.090> smooth<00:04:45.420> that<00:04:45.540> out<00:04:45.770> so<00:04:46.770> you<00:04:46.830> can<00:04:46.950> see

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
trying to smooth that out so you can see

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.410 
trying to smooth that out so you can see
if<00:04:47.190> we<00:04:47.280> just<00:04:47.310> take<00:04:47.610> and<00:04:47.820> kind<00:04:47.970> of<00:04:48.060> paint<00:04:48.270> that

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
if we just take and kind of paint that

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.270 
if we just take and kind of paint that
in<00:04:48.570> we're<00:04:49.080> adding<00:04:49.350> kind<00:04:49.530> of<00:04:49.620> a<00:04:49.680> lower<00:04:49.890> opacity

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
in we're adding kind of a lower opacity

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.960 
in we're adding kind of a lower opacity
pink<00:04:50.820> to<00:04:51.030> it<00:04:51.060> to<00:04:52.020> our<00:04:52.320> layer<00:04:53.190> mask<00:04:53.280> over<00:04:53.760> here

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
pink to it to our layer mask over here

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.150 
pink to it to our layer mask over here
and<00:04:54.270> we<00:04:54.720> can<00:04:54.810> kind<00:04:55.020> of<00:04:55.110> fade<00:04:55.350> that<00:04:55.500> into<00:04:55.950> her

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
and we can kind of fade that into her

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.220 
and we can kind of fade that into her
hair<00:04:56.400> a<00:04:56.610> little<00:04:56.940> bit<00:04:57.120> better<00:04:57.300> because<00:04:57.780> you<00:04:58.020> can

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
hair a little bit better because you can

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.200 
hair a little bit better because you can
see<00:04:58.530> people's<00:04:59.280> skin<00:04:59.490> tones<00:04:59.700> a<00:04:59.880> little<00:05:00.090> bit

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
see people's skin tones a little bit

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.910 
see people's skin tones a little bit
through<00:05:00.480> a<00:05:00.510> little<00:05:00.750> pieces<00:05:00.930> of<00:05:01.170> hair<00:05:01.350> on<00:05:01.650> so

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
through a little pieces of hair on so

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.340 
through a little pieces of hair on so
you<00:05:02.010> can<00:05:02.100> get<00:05:02.190> a<00:05:02.220> much<00:05:02.400> better<00:05:02.640> result<00:05:03.260> so<00:05:04.260> you

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
you can get a much better result so you

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.390 
you can get a much better result so you
can<00:05:04.470> see<00:05:04.620> with<00:05:04.770> just<00:05:04.800> a<00:05:05.010> little<00:05:05.220> bit<00:05:05.310> of

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
can see with just a little bit of

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.310 
can see with just a little bit of
tweaking<00:05:05.760> and<00:05:06.180> we've<00:05:06.420> basically<00:05:06.600> taken<00:05:06.870> this

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
tweaking and we've basically taken this

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.870 
tweaking and we've basically taken this
worst-case<00:05:07.650> scenario<00:05:08.160> where<00:05:08.340> she<00:05:08.550> has<00:05:08.700> our

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
worst-case scenario where she has our

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.430 
worst-case scenario where she has our
hands<00:05:09.090> next<00:05:09.420> to<00:05:09.510> her<00:05:09.570> face<00:05:09.780> there's<00:05:10.080> a<00:05:10.140> lot<00:05:10.320> of

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
hands next to her face there's a lot of

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.050 
hands next to her face there's a lot of
skin<00:05:10.710> tones<00:05:10.950> in<00:05:11.160> it<00:05:11.310> you<00:05:11.670> have<00:05:11.790> a<00:05:11.820> white

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
skin tones in it you have a white

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.120 
skin tones in it you have a white
background<00:05:12.390> which<00:05:12.840> is<00:05:13.020> closer<00:05:13.620> to<00:05:13.830> the<00:05:13.920> skin

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
background which is closer to the skin

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.060 
background which is closer to the skin
tones<00:05:14.370> of<00:05:14.580> this<00:05:14.730> model<00:05:15.090> so<00:05:15.930> basically<00:05:16.680> you<00:05:16.890> can

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
tones of this model so basically you can

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.940 
tones of this model so basically you can
take<00:05:17.370> and<00:05:17.640> use<00:05:18.420> a<00:05:18.450> selection<00:05:18.870> or<00:05:19.200> to<00:05:19.470> refine

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
take and use a selection or to refine

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.360 
take and use a selection or to refine
your<00:05:19.980> color<00:05:20.670> range<00:05:21.110> options<00:05:22.110> now<00:05:22.890> again<00:05:23.160> I<00:05:23.190> was

things<00:05:25.500> if<00:05:25.710> you<00:05:25.800> want<00:05:26.010> if<00:05:26.100> you<00:05:26.220> switch<00:05:26.610> your

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
things if you want if you switch your
