00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.720
 yes lord recruits zero introducing himself 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.330
 for another video it was and today finally 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.430
 the result of Mario's drawing 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.530
 balotelli are seeing that I have in the 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.380
 My last tim to show you 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.970
 How is the draw going to be made? 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.570
 I'll send a player to you on 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:30.439
 true, then I'll do an auction 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:33.319
 the player and the winner will send me 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.210
 a proposal to exchange for balotelli is the 

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:38.600
 only way start sending the 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.969
 without the person being of one 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.979
 bid at auction then it's the only way 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.109
 You will then have you send me 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:47.719
 any crap you have to see 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:50.059
 sent his bronze player is only for 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.639
 complete the transfer is this exchange 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.350
 So it 's the only way I know not 

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:56.659
 I know if there's a way to go straight 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.309
 If you have a player you can tell us 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:01.159
 comments because I do not know 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.049
 So this is it is the winner I'm going to create 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.360
 an auction with all the data it goes 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.850
 access the balotelli auction that the 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.800
 my balotelli player he will send to 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.220
 proposal of exchange of the example in 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.260
 by rafael garcia there will become a player 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.850
 from him to the exchange list to change 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.980
 with me then send any player 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.350
 crap to make transfers 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.880
 Right this is the only way I know 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.490
 I do not know if there's another way 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.770
 straight I was doing so in this draw 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.170
