the<00:00:16.470> Highland<00:00:16.800> Park<00:00:17.039> for<00:00:17.520> now<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.600> see<00:00:18.750> that

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
the Highland Park for now and I see that

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.070 
the Highland Park for now and I see that
for<00:00:19.109> now<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.770> this<00:00:20.760> was<00:00:20.970> found<00:00:21.210> we<00:00:21.869> didn't

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
for now in that this was found we didn't

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.570 
for now in that this was found we didn't
know<00:00:22.170> we<00:00:22.289> had<00:00:22.439> this<00:00:22.619> until<00:00:22.980> eighteen<00:00:23.310> months

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
know we had this until eighteen months

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.359 
know we had this until eighteen months
ago<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:24.500> there<00:00:25.500> might<00:00:25.650> be<00:00:25.680> something<00:00:26.070> older

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
ago so there might be something older

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.790 
ago so there might be something older
right<00:00:26.490> there<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.880> if<00:00:26.970> there<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.240> we<00:00:27.449> will<00:00:27.800> go

just<00:02:58.080> sits<00:02:58.500> there<00:02:58.620> they<00:02:58.980> were<00:02:59.040> beginning<00:02:59.430> to

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
just sits there they were beginning to

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.960 
just sits there they were beginning to
appear<00:02:59.790> though<00:03:00.120> nice<00:03:00.990> and<00:03:01.260> fat<00:03:01.530> again<00:03:02.490> it<00:03:02.790> was

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
appear though nice and fat again it was

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.210 
appear though nice and fat again it was
just<00:03:03.240> over<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:03.990> forty<00:03:04.320> percent<00:03:04.500> marker<00:03:05.070> but

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
just over the forty percent marker but

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.370 
just over the forty percent marker but
anything<00:03:05.550> between<00:03:05.760> 40<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.210> 45<00:03:06.480> as<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:07.230> can

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
anything between 40 and 45 as you can

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.010 
anything between 40 and 45 as you can
tell<00:03:07.620> this<00:03:08.130> is<00:03:08.190> all<00:03:08.460> natural<00:03:08.670> strength<00:03:09.360> the

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
tell this is all natural strength the

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.570 
tell this is all natural strength the
sample<00:03:10.500> is<00:03:10.680> basically<00:03:11.040> before<00:03:11.250> we've

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
sample is basically before we've

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.220 
sample is basically before we've
actually<00:03:11.790> bottled<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.510> so<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:12.780> won't<00:03:12.900> know<00:03:13.110> the

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
actually bottled it so it won't know the

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.960 
actually bottled it so it won't know the
exact<00:03:13.650> strength<00:03:14.010> until<00:03:14.280> it<00:03:14.400> physically

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
exact strength until it physically

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.210 
exact strength until it physically
wasn't<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.480> glass<00:03:15.720> but<00:03:15.990> not<00:03:16.170> anything<00:03:16.860> about

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
wasn't the glass but not anything about

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.510 
wasn't the glass but not anything about
45<00:03:17.790> percent<00:03:17.970> is<00:03:18.300> probably<00:03:18.540> about<00:03:18.630> right<00:03:19.520> but

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
45 percent is probably about right but

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.930 
45 percent is probably about right but
then<00:03:20.670> when<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:20.850> smell<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:25.550> because<00:03:26.550> there's

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
then when you smell it because there's

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.910 
then when you smell it because there's
no<00:03:27.090> high<00:03:27.360> alcohol<00:03:27.810> there<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.350> sweetness<00:03:28.650> has

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
no high alcohol there the sweetness has

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.500 
no high alcohol there the sweetness has
to<00:03:29.070> faith<00:03:29.310> it's<00:03:29.520> really<00:03:29.820> annoys<00:03:30.030> enemy<00:03:30.330> which

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
to faith it's really annoys enemy which

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.660 
to faith it's really annoys enemy which
it<00:03:30.690> does<00:03:30.960> because<00:03:31.410> easy<00:03:31.830> because<00:03:32.370> it's<00:03:32.520> just

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
it does because easy because it's just

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.210 
it does because easy because it's just
bag<00:03:33.330> baked<00:03:33.630> there's<00:03:34.020> Spanish<00:03:34.380> or<00:03:34.680> jelly<00:03:34.950> cast

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
bag baked there's Spanish or jelly cast

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.720 
bag baked there's Spanish or jelly cast
I<00:03:35.340> mean<00:03:35.490> that's<00:03:36.360> obvious<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:37.520> then<00:03:38.520> when<00:03:38.640> you

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
I mean that's obvious and then when you

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.060 
I mean that's obvious and then when you
when<00:03:39.060> you<00:03:39.180> get<00:03:39.270> that<00:03:39.420> sweetness<00:03:39.900> then<00:03:40.740> you<00:03:40.950> get

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
when you get that sweetness then you get

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.310 
when you get that sweetness then you get
that<00:03:41.190> slight<00:03:41.610> smokiness<00:03:42.300> that<00:03:42.840> comes<00:03:43.080> right

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
that slight smokiness that comes right

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.810 
that slight smokiness that comes right
behind<00:03:43.560> that<00:03:43.740> so<00:03:43.920> you<00:03:44.040> know<00:03:44.220> it's<00:03:44.370> an<00:03:44.520> advance

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
behind that so you know it's an advance

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.670 
behind that so you know it's an advance
there<00:03:45.240> for<00:03:45.420> your<00:03:45.540> new<00:03:45.720> or<00:03:45.840> Thailand<00:03:46.260> part<00:03:46.470> it's

there for your new or Thailand part it's

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.470 
there for your new or Thailand part it's
not<00:03:46.860> a<00:03:46.890> bag<00:03:47.220> sweet<00:03:47.550> monster<00:03:48.030> that's<00:03:48.210> hiding

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
not a bag sweet monster that's hiding

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.200 
not a bag sweet monster that's hiding
