00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.309
 the unique cornet cover solution 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.620
 Variation has arisen from the 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.710
 operating activities of corenet beton 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.780
 Kornett Beton was founded in 2001 by 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.029
 hendrik kornett founded meanwhile 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.340
 Both plants are cornet cover 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.320
 solutions and cornet concrete in two 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.109
 big halls on the industrial site 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.390
 Eisenhardt in the forest where also 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.029
 the own concrete production takes place 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.090
 Kornett concrete supplies the priority 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.219
 agricultural market cornet concrete produced and 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.070
 supplies concrete elements for various 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.590
 applications of frescos and partition walls 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.660
 by now silos are the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.219
 unique silos from the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.160
 Dutch agriculture is not 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.530
 to think away more unique in the system 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.680
 is that the silo walls of their own 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.789
 concrete elements and a special one 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.160
 be constructed steel structure 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.609
 the concrete used has the highest order 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.680
 World class x3 by that are the 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.420
 Concrete elements for use in 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.979
 a highly aggressive chemical 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.439
 environment suitable 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.930
 next to it are the elements with one 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.540
 equipped with special steel reinforcement 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.540
 whereby the load capacity is extra high 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.640
 from the experience and expertise of 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.140
 company cornet concrete has hendrik 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.530
 Kornett a new update system 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.119
 develops the quality of the food is 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.090
 also depending on the method of 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.549
 Cover The update system consists of 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.409
 a special cornet cover solutions 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.070
 blanket and a special update 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.399
 machine 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.520
 The blanket is made of durable acid and 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.979
 fertilizer resistant cloth made that 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.140
 the design of the ceiling serves to improve 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.939
 the quality of the food and the 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.190
 ease of use for the farmer 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.229
 over the whole length of the ceiling are 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.520
 several hoses attached with the 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.530
 be filled with water 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.659
 much spans the ceiling at attention 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.729
 about the roughage so can be practical 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.429
 no air between the ceiling and on it 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.860
 Food is covered by the food 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:06.220
 succeeds with the cornett cover solutions 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.780
 From Beck's he is fast and easy 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.560
 Unrolling is done by the hydraulics 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.090
 your telescopic handler or spoon excavator 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.250
 If the blanket is unrolled close it 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.069
 the hoses on for system and overflow 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.329
 System to the guaranteed assurance if 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.579
 you roll up the blanket 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:25.400
 The filling of the hoses is very 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:27.709
 easy in a silo of 40 meters length 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.630
 and ten meters wide are the hoses 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.459
 filled in about 40 minutes 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.640
 all you have to do is 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.739
 check if everything goes well 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.150
 blanket offers particular advantages 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.150
 ensiling in the meantime 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.450
 open and cover well again is much 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.090
 faster and easier than before 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.459
 There is no air or water in her 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.860
 roughage even if only the first 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.660
 have harvested their precious cut 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.849
 time does not move with 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.000
 car tires and sandbags lost 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.150
 the many and physical heavy work 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.980
 is therefore no obstacle for 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.660
 intersperse if they are 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.180
 want to place the feed 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.950
 machine above the silo at each 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.200
 Feeding connect the machine 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.239
 your telescopic handler or spoon excavator 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.129
 on 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.319
 The machine rolls the desired number 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.930
 meter blanket so determine yourself 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:28.549
 how much roughage is free the whole 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.549
 The process takes only a few minutes 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.730
 the cornett cover solutions from back 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.890
 system offers you many benefits in 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.209
 the efficiency and improvement of the 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.209
 quality in your company
