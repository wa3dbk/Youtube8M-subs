now<00:03:23.349> obviously<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:23.980> screen<00:03:24.370> there<00:03:24.669> if<00:03:24.819> I<00:03:24.910> can

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
now obviously the screen there if I can

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.030 
now obviously the screen there if I can
get<00:03:25.209> that<00:03:25.299> shining<00:03:25.720> nicely<00:03:26.049> the<00:03:26.500> screen<00:03:26.829> there

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
get that shining nicely the screen there

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.740 
get that shining nicely the screen there
is<00:03:27.280> a<00:03:29.519> liquid<00:03:30.519> crystal<00:03:30.940> display<00:03:31.269> an<00:03:31.389> LCD

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
is a liquid crystal display an LCD

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.819 
is a liquid crystal display an LCD
display<00:03:31.930> with<00:03:32.799> a<00:03:32.829> LED<00:03:33.700> backlight<00:03:34.329> and<00:03:35.290> it<00:03:35.500> is<00:03:35.680> a

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
display with a LED backlight and it is a

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.659 
display with a LED backlight and it is a
very<00:03:36.340> very<00:03:37.000> high<00:03:37.329> quality<00:03:37.500> screen<00:03:38.530> it's<00:03:39.430> a

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:39.669 
very very high quality screen it's a

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.819 
very very high quality screen it's a
white<00:03:40.060> digit<00:03:40.569> on<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.750> black<00:03:41.109> face<00:03:41.380> which<00:03:41.709> I

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
white digit on a black face which I

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.280 
white digit on a black face which I
think<00:03:42.130> adds<00:03:42.370> to<00:03:42.700> the<00:03:42.849> retro<00:03:43.419> quality<00:03:43.900> of<00:03:44.109> it

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
think adds to the retro quality of it

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.449 
think adds to the retro quality of it
and<00:03:44.549> this<00:03:45.549> here<00:03:46.090> is<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.450> only<00:03:46.950> control<00:03:47.950> on<00:03:48.250> it

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
and this here is the only control on it

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.159 
and this here is the only control on it
with<00:03:48.669> the<00:03:48.790> exception<00:03:49.060> of<00:03:49.329> this<00:03:49.540> button<00:03:49.840> here

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
with the exception of this button here

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:51.990 
with the exception of this button here
which<00:03:50.349> is<00:03:50.859> the<00:03:51.010> backlight<00:03:51.430> and<00:03:51.459> that's<00:03:51.849> the

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
which is the backlight and that's the

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.190 
which is the backlight and that's the
only<00:03:52.180> thing<00:03:52.359> that<00:03:52.510> button<00:03:52.840> does

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
only thing that button does

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.099 
only thing that button does
but<00:03:53.650> this<00:03:53.859> here<00:03:54.250> is<00:03:54.310> a<00:03:54.459> scroll<00:03:55.120> wheel<00:03:55.389> and<00:03:55.720> you

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
but this here is a scroll wheel and you

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.349 
but this here is a scroll wheel and you
can<00:03:56.260> see<00:03:56.379> I<00:03:56.410> just<00:03:56.680> set<00:03:57.069> it<00:03:57.190> off<00:03:57.310> there<00:03:57.579> and<00:03:58.060> it

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
can see I just set it off there and it

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.830 
can see I just set it off there and it
also<00:03:58.510> pushes<00:03:58.959> in<00:03:59.319> and<00:03:59.590> Braun<00:04:00.430> causes<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.450> easy

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
also pushes in and Braun causes the easy

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.220 
also pushes in and Braun causes the easy
scroll<00:04:02.379> button<00:04:03.129> and<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.359> system<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:04.959> easy

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
scroll button and the system the easy

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.979 
scroll button and the system the easy
scroll<00:04:05.739> operating<00:04:06.459> system<00:04:06.879> which<00:04:07.389> is<00:04:07.660> a

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
scroll operating system which is a

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.439 
scroll operating system which is a
fairly<00:04:08.319> grand<00:04:08.709> way<00:04:09.099> of<00:04:09.400> describing<00:04:09.849> what<00:04:10.299> is

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:10.449 
fairly grand way of describing what is

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.869 
fairly grand way of describing what is
essentially<00:04:11.049> a<00:04:11.199> simple<00:04:11.859> turning<00:04:12.730> mechanism

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
essentially a simple turning mechanism

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.599 
essentially a simple turning mechanism
to<00:04:13.569> go<00:04:13.720> through<00:04:13.989> your<00:04:14.199> settings<00:04:14.590> and<00:04:15.010> as<00:04:15.430> you

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
to go through your settings and as you

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.009 
to go through your settings and as you
can<00:04:15.699> see<00:04:15.910> I'm<00:04:16.030> going<00:04:16.180> to<00:04:16.239> put<00:04:16.389> it<00:04:16.479> close<00:04:16.720> to<00:04:16.900> the

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
can see I'm going to put it close to the

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.420 
can see I'm going to put it close to the
microphone<00:04:17.229> here<00:04:17.680> I'm<00:04:17.859> going<00:04:18.099> to<00:04:18.160> see<00:04:18.250> if<00:04:18.340> you

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
microphone here I'm going to see if you

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.200 
microphone here I'm going to see if you
can<00:04:18.579> hear<00:04:18.820> this<00:04:19.000> little<00:04:19.180> click

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.100 

so<00:04:23.210> I<00:04:23.240> don't<00:04:23.450> know<00:04:23.510> whether<00:04:23.630> you<00:04:23.780> can<00:04:23.930> hear

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
so I don't know whether you can hear

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.080 
so I don't know whether you can hear
that<00:04:24.320> or<00:04:24.500> not<00:04:24.650> I<00:04:24.860> might<00:04:25.340> try<00:04:25.490> and<00:04:25.670> boost<00:04:25.820> the

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
that or not I might try and boost the

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.780 
that or not I might try and boost the
sound<00:04:26.390> in<00:04:26.630> the<00:04:26.720> video<00:04:27.220> but<00:04:28.220> there's<00:04:28.370> a<00:04:28.460> little

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
sound in the video but there's a little

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.880 
sound in the video but there's a little
bit<00:04:28.940> of<00:04:28.970> resistance<00:04:29.420> each<00:04:29.870> time<00:04:30.200> the<00:04:30.710> wheel

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
bit of resistance each time the wheel

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.880 
bit of resistance each time the wheel
turns<00:04:31.220> it<00:04:31.430> clicks<00:04:32.170> now<00:04:33.170> I<00:04:33.200> don't<00:04:33.650> know<00:04:33.740> whether

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
turns it clicks now I don't know whether

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.110 
turns it clicks now I don't know whether
it's<00:04:34.130> a<00:04:34.280> fault

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
it's a fault

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.270 
it's a fault
with<00:04:35.300> my<00:04:35.570> particular<00:04:35.870> or<00:04:36.470> whether<00:04:36.710> it<00:04:36.890> is<00:04:37.070> the

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
with my particular or whether it is the

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.210 
with my particular or whether it is the
intended<00:04:37.790> design<00:04:38.210> but<00:04:38.900> each<00:04:39.140> time<00:04:39.620> that

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
intended design but each time that

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.220 
intended design but each time that
clicks<00:04:40.670> over<00:04:41.120> to<00:04:41.330> me<00:04:41.540> that<00:04:41.840> would<00:04:41.960> be<00:04:42.020> the

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
clicks over to me that would be the

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.040 
clicks over to me that would be the
ideal<00:04:42.620> way<00:04:42.710> of<00:04:43.220> changing<00:04:44.090> the<00:04:44.150> menu<00:04:44.600> so<00:04:44.780> every

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
ideal way of changing the menu so every

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.500 
ideal way of changing the menu so every
time<00:04:45.260> it<00:04:45.320> clicked<00:04:45.890> over<00:04:46.130> it<00:04:46.730> would<00:04:46.940> change<00:04:47.210> to

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
time it clicked over it would change to

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.320 
time it clicked over it would change to
the<00:04:47.600> next<00:04:47.750> setting<00:04:48.610> what<00:04:49.610> it<00:04:49.790> actually<00:04:49.970> does

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
the next setting what it actually does

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.050 
the next setting what it actually does
though<00:04:50.570> is<00:04:50.780> if<00:04:50.900> I<00:04:50.990> show<00:04:51.230> you<00:04:51.290> that<00:04:51.500> now<00:04:51.680> I<00:04:51.980> can

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060

now<00:04:53.570> I've<00:04:53.750> just<00:04:54.080> changed<00:04:54.470> you<00:04:55.460> can<00:04:55.610> see<00:04:55.790> the

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
now I've just changed you can see the

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.300 
now I've just changed you can see the
display<00:04:56.150> moving<00:04:56.630> there<00:04:56.840> but<00:04:57.380> the<00:04:57.500> wheel<00:04:57.740> isn't

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.930 
should be the time that the menu item
changes<00:05:18.200> and<00:05:18.620> that<00:05:19.100> way<00:05:19.250> because<00:05:19.490> it<00:05:19.610> provides

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
changes and that way because it provides

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.120 
changes and that way because it provides
a<00:05:20.090> little<00:05:20.330> bit<00:05:20.480> of<00:05:20.720> extra<00:05:20.960> resistance<00:05:21.560> it

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
a little bit of extra resistance it

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.860 
a little bit of extra resistance it
would<00:05:22.310> be<00:05:22.460> a<00:05:22.490> way<00:05:22.760> of<00:05:22.790> preventing<00:05:23.420> your
