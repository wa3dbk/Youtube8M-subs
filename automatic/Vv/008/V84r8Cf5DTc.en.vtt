and show you guys the secrets of

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.749 
and show you guys the secrets of
slipping<00:00:03.720> punches<00:00:03.950> this<00:00:04.950> will<00:00:05.130> help<00:00:05.279> you<00:00:05.460> slip

slipping punches this will help you slip

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.410 
slipping punches this will help you slip
punches<00:00:06.120> faster<00:00:06.600> easier<00:00:07.259> any<00:00:08.010> punch<00:00:08.820> from<00:00:09.210> any

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
punches faster easier any punch from any

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.160 
punches faster easier any punch from any
position<00:00:09.630> any<00:00:10.440> time<00:00:11.059> so<00:00:12.059> first<00:00:12.269> part<00:00:12.509> the

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
position any time so first part the

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.930 
position any time so first part the
first<00:00:13.440> technique<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.070> slipping<00:00:14.370> punches<00:00:14.519> is

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
first technique of slipping punches is

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.990 
first technique of slipping punches is
really<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.420> focus<00:00:15.809> on<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.440> centerline<00:00:16.970> okay

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
really to focus on the centerline okay

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.939 
really to focus on the centerline okay
the<00:00:18.210> line<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.570> attack<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:19.170> my<00:00:19.439> opponent<00:00:19.890> is

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
the line of attack so my opponent is

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.070 
the line of attack so my opponent is
punching<00:00:20.369> straight<00:00:20.609> up<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.820> middle<00:00:21.020> all<00:00:22.020> I

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
punching straight up the middle all I

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.259 
punching straight up the middle all I
have<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.710> do<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:23.070> get<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.430> other<00:00:23.730> side<00:00:24.119> of

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
have to do is get to the other side of

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.120 
have to do is get to the other side of
that<00:00:24.390> line<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:25.109> keep<00:00:25.350> getting<00:00:25.680> yourself<00:00:26.070> to

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
that line so keep getting yourself to

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.500 
that line so keep getting yourself to
the<00:00:26.220> opposite<00:00:26.640> side<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.060> line<00:00:27.210> keep

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
the opposite side of the line keep

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.380 
the opposite side of the line keep
cutting<00:00:27.840> across<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.260> center<00:00:28.910> what<00:00:29.910> slippin

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
cutting across the center what slippin

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.600 
cutting across the center what slippin
is<00:00:30.510> not<00:00:30.689> about<00:00:31.019> it's<00:00:31.470> not<00:00:31.560> about<00:00:31.710> going<00:00:32.160> side

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
is not about it's not about going side

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.459 
is not about it's not about going side
to<00:00:32.640> side<00:00:32.880> it's<00:00:33.480> not<00:00:33.690> about<00:00:33.930> having<00:00:34.110> two

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
to side it's not about having two

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.790 
to side it's not about having two
positions<00:00:34.980> for<00:00:35.070> your<00:00:35.340> head<00:00:35.600> okay<00:00:36.620> it's<00:00:37.620> about

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
positions for your head okay it's about

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.040 
positions for your head okay it's about
cutting<00:00:38.129> across<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.640> center<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.989> is

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
cutting across the center and this is

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.780 
cutting across the center and this is
where<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.590> lot<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.829> slipping<00:00:41.219> technique<00:00:41.610> and

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
where a lot of slipping technique and

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.000 
where a lot of slipping technique and
positions<00:00:42.239> give<00:00:42.510> get<00:00:43.079> out<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.350> whack<00:00:43.500> because

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
positions give get out of whack because

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.490 
positions give get out of whack because
really<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.940> not<00:00:45.149> about<00:00:45.210> position<00:00:46.050> it's<00:00:46.320> not

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
really it's not about position it's not

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.590 
really it's not about position it's not
about<00:00:46.739> technique<00:00:47.250> okay<00:00:47.489> people<00:00:47.700> go<00:00:47.940> all<00:00:48.120> you

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
about technique okay people go all you

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.330

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
not about position how about singing

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.709 
not about position how about singing
it's<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:56.820> about<00:00:57.000> cutting<00:00:57.270> across<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
it's just about cutting across the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.470 
it's just about cutting across the
center<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.920> better<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.430> are<00:00:59.460> at<00:01:00.030> cutting

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
center and the better you are at cutting

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.150 
center and the better you are at cutting
across<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.899> center<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.410> less<00:01:01.590> work<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:02.010> have

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
across the center the less work you have

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.359 
across the center the less work you have
to<00:01:02.190> do<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:03.239> I'm<00:01:03.510> going<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.660> begin<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.930> boxer<00:01:04.470> I'll

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
to do so I'm going to begin a boxer I'll

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.690 
to do so I'm going to begin a boxer I'll
probably<00:01:05.790> do<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.299> right<00:01:07.159> this<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.280> how<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.430> cut

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
probably do this right this is how I cut

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.730 
probably do this right this is how I cut
across<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.090> center<00:01:09.390> which<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> lot<00:01:10.619> of

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
across the center which is a lot of

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.030 
across the center which is a lot of
energy<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.460> lot<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.360> movement<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.680> takes<00:01:13.920> a

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
energy a lot of movement and it takes a

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.200 
energy a lot of movement and it takes a
you<00:01:14.250> know<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.369> have<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.700> practice<00:01:15.119> this

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
you know I have to practice this

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.670 
you know I have to practice this
technique<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.750> lot<00:01:15.900> because<00:01:16.049> it's<00:01:16.350> actually

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
technique a lot because it's actually

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.980 
technique a lot because it's actually
really<00:01:16.860> hard<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.250> do<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.780> with<00:01:18.780> from<00:01:18.960> a

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
really hard to do that with from a

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.249 
really hard to do that with from a
little<00:01:19.229> more<00:01:19.409> skill<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:20.939> it

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
little more skill I just this is it

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:22.730 
little more skill I just this is it
that's<00:01:22.259> it

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
that's it

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.100 
that's it
not<00:01:23.280> much<00:01:23.490> energy<00:01:23.909> not<00:01:24.509> much<00:01:24.720> technique

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
not much energy not much technique

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.390 
not much energy not much technique
required<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.770> don't<00:01:25.920> have<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.130> be<00:01:26.250> in<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
required I don't have to be in the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.550 
required I don't have to be in the
perfect<00:01:26.610> position<00:01:26.990> okay<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.259> just<00:01:28.409> about

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
perfect position okay it's just about

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.130 
perfect position okay it's just about
cutting<00:01:28.799> across<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.189> center<00:01:29.900> now<00:01:30.900> once

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
cutting across the center now once

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.080 
cutting across the center now once
you'll<00:01:31.320> understand<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:31.979> once<00:01:32.970> you

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
you'll understand that once you

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.810 
you'll understand that once you
understand<00:01:33.450> how<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.630> cut<00:01:33.869> across<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.229> center

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
understand how to cut across the center

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.660 
understand how to cut across the center
using<00:01:35.820> very<00:01:36.060> minimal<00:01:36.479> movement<00:01:37.520> you<00:01:38.520> can

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
using very minimal movement you can

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.719 
using very minimal movement you can
start<00:01:38.939> moving<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.900> center<00:01:40.140> okay<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.579> can

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
start moving the center okay you can

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.249 
start moving the center okay you can
start<00:01:41.909> slipping<00:01:42.240> from<00:01:42.329> any<00:01:42.540> position<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.020> can

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
start slipping from any position you can

across the center that's it and once you

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.140 
across the center that's it and once you
do<00:02:40.210> that<00:02:40.240> you<00:02:40.750> can<00:02:40.900> move<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.140> a<00:02:41.380> new<00:02:41.560> center

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
do that you can move to a new center

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.820 
do that you can move to a new center
okay<00:02:43.150> now<00:02:43.840> once<00:02:44.110> you<00:02:44.260> know<00:02:44.290> how<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.650> move

okay now once you know how to move
yourself<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.400> a<00:02:45.430> new<00:02:45.550> center<00:02:45.940> this<00:02:46.570> open<00:02:46.990> all

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
yourself to a new center this open all

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.440 
yourself to a new center this open all
sorts<00:02:47.320> of<00:02:47.500> opportunities<00:02:47.740> because<00:02:48.250> now<00:02:48.460> you

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
sorts of opportunities because now you

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.480
