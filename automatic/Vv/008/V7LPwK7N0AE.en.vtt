00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:07.940
 let's try to see two simple divisions 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.940
 shared the two figures 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:20.340
 525 divided 25 then 25 cannot 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.750
 stay in 5 then obviously 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:28.410
 we will put a hat in 52 then 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:33.960
 we will consider as separate tens units per 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:39.210
 go look for the part of the result 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:46.140
 2 in 5 how many times can he stand 242 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:48.390
 for 24 15 st in theory go twice 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.460
 a 5 remains one that we move here 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.770
 in front of the 2 in front of the two units 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:01:01.170
 so there remains 12 on 5 in 12 there is two 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:04.199
 sometimes 5 10 yes there is in abundance 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.170
 so two is our result 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.640
 at this point we have to look for the rest 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.020
 and we will do this as well as it does 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.840
 as we have always done so far 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.630
 in shared vision operations 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.090
 to a single figure that is, we will multiply 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.630
 this is why we will write that 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:26.930
 result and then subtract 2x5 ago 10 0 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.930
 carry over one 2x2 made plus 15 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.909
 go ahead let's lower the 5 we see it 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.590
 also eyes that there is once but us 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.460
 we follow the procedure because we are 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:45.310
 learning that then the 2 in the 2 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.130
 fourth times st 2 x 1 2 then one is 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.560
 time could be one then this 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.400
 part of the result we are looking for 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.830
 the 5 in the 5 there is once 5 yes there is 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:03.960
 exactly then we can multiply 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.960
 to look for the rest 1 x 551 for 2 2 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:14.250
 let's see an operation 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:18.100
 obviously more difficult 620 divided by 23 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:22.750
 then the 23 did not bring in the 6 then 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:29.769
 we will try how many times it is strange and 62 the 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:31.420
 2 in 6th would be 24 63 times lo 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.780
 we write light mind because it is alone 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:40.180
 a hypothesis there is no rest because 2x3 does 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:42.000
 exactly 6 the 3 in the 2t st 3 times no 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.190
 because it's not even there once 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.750
 so 3 is too large a number 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:54.640
 our result we will have to go down to 2 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.209
 let's try 2 x 2 ago 4 15 st in abundance 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.810
 on 6 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:02.680
 there are only two dozen left here 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:05.590
 in front of the units therefore remains the 3rd 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.549
 in 22 there is at least two times 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:13.450
 36 c so abundantly two can 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:20.700
 go well let's go and now we can 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:23.950
 go look for the rest 2 x 362 for 24 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:28.209
 this is no longer 2 minus 6 you can't 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:32.590
 ask for a loan 12 minus 662 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:36.140
 remained at least 4 1 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:39.489
 or now we have to see how many times 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:44.470
 23 st in 160 and that is how many times the 2 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:48.290
 from 16 first of all two but you 16 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:52.400
 seemed to be able to stay eight times but others 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.650
 in 0 c st 8 times no then we have to 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.870
 alight 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:02.180
 let's try 72 for 7 to 14 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:08.150
 so leave two dozen discovered that 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:10.819
 go here 3 for 7 is 21 so it is 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:14.540
 also slightly abundant seven 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:16.479
 7 we ca n't do it now we can 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.870
 understand it even without doing the test 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.780
 put 6 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:26.479
 the result will be 6 and go looking 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:36.440
 the rest 6x3 18 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:40.130
 if for 2 12 of 1 13 the rest we can 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:43.010
 make it mind and 22 exactly one less 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.400
 of 23 there was very little for seven 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.400
 times
