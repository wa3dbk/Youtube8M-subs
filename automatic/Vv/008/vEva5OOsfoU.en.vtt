00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.070 
really big thing for me is that all
designs<00:04:26.030> are<00:04:26.180> actually<00:04:26.420> not<00:04:26.540> strengthening

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
designs are actually not strengthening

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.750 
designs are actually not strengthening
those<00:04:27.230> are<00:04:27.380> embroidered<00:04:27.740> so<00:04:28.250> what<00:04:28.370> that<00:04:28.400> means

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
those are embroidered so what that means

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.070 
those are embroidered so what that means
is<00:04:28.880> that<00:04:28.940> when<00:04:29.150> you<00:04:29.240> wash<00:04:29.450> it's<00:04:29.750> not<00:04:29.870> going<00:04:29.990> to

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
is that when you wash it's not going to

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.080 
is that when you wash it's not going to
crack<00:04:30.320> or<00:04:30.650> anything<00:04:31.130> like<00:04:31.160> that<00:04:31.280> it's<00:04:31.970> going

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
crack or anything like that it's going

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.760 
crack or anything like that it's going
