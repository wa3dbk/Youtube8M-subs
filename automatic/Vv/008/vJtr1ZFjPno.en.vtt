in Clerkenwell in London and scientists
extracted<00:01:44.300> DNA<00:01:44.480> of<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.110> diseased<00:01:45.470> bacterium

that had killed them from their teeth it

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.930 
that had killed them from their teeth it
turns<00:01:48.770> out<00:01:48.980> that<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.250> black<00:01:49.460> death<00:01:49.490> was

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
turns out that the black death was

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.090 
turns out that the black death was
almost<00:01:50.180> identical<00:01:50.540> to<00:01:51.170> an<00:01:51.440> outbreak<00:01:51.770> of

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
almost identical to an outbreak of

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.740 
almost identical to an outbreak of
bubonic<00:01:52.310> plague<00:01:52.700> which<00:01:52.940> happened<00:01:53.540> in

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
bubonic plague which happened in

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.740 
bubonic plague which happened in
Madagascar<00:01:54.560> recently<00:01:55.130> which<00:01:55.580> killed<00:01:55.850> only<00:01:56.270> 60

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
Madagascar recently which killed only 60

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.630 
Madagascar recently which killed only 60
people<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:57.650> if<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.830> black<00:01:58.040> death<00:01:58.250> had<00:01:58.520> the

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
people so if the black death had the

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.150 
people so if the black death had the
