00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.520
 create trapillo accessories for this 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.680
 summer in this second part 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.680
 we will make the bracelet and the ring 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.390
 to make the bracelet we will take the same 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.820
 chain with which we have made the 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.220
 necklace and we will take the measure of our 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.390
 doll if necessary add 6 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.930
 links 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.329
 we will take a piece of thread from the zapillo and 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:37.850
 we will measure more or less what the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.690
 chain leaving about 4 fingers of hands 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.930
 and we will go through all the thread 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.540
 link to work 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.030
 we will go up and down and so on 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.040
 successively you also have to have 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.329
 consider that the chain that of well 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.839
 subtracts if it is not twisted 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.839
 Y 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.120
 We are putting one up and another one 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.470
 down 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.810
 and 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.810
 and we will have our bracelet ready 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.910
 let's do the finishing touches 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.910
 we will bend the thread a little 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.190
 and with a little dot of silicone we stick it 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.080
 we cut the excess 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.870
 and this is how we are going to put it 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.700
 between the thread and the string and we paste it 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.700
 also with a little dot of silicone 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:55.770
 and we have to stay this way 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:58.390
 and we put a little link in the end 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.130
 and on the other side we do the same 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.460
 we stick the thread and put it between 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.000
 stockings and we put a tiny link and 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.000
 the closing 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.780
 and we would have our bracelet list 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.370
 I could go leave here or if you want you can 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.320
 add accessories there are many types and 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.530
 this you can find everything in bazaars 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.530
 oriental 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.040
 and now let's make the ring 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.400
 let's go catching all the 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.400
 leftovers 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.870
 and we are going to cut them to measures 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.870
 same 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.680
 Y 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.319
 once we have them cut 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.010
 we will take a ring base 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.579
 like this and we're going to hit first 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.579
 in the center 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.910
 we take more pieces and we're going 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.910
 adding around 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:27.650
 and we keep getting chunks until 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.110
 everything is well covered and dense 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.930
 we're going to put another one around 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.510
 ring and we're going to cut all this 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.370
 leftover but do not waste those remains 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.099
 little ones that you have left because we are going to 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.620
 go using them again as you see has 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.599
 was quite wrong then what 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.640
 let's do is all those bits 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.400
 little ones put them and hit the 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.799
 in between 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.400
 until it stays tight as you see 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:56.519
 here and it stays as if it were a bouquet of 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.519
 roses 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.300
 this would be the result 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.000
 I hope you liked it and I have 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.440

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.440
