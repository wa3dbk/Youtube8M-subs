customers are looking for these days and

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.290 
customers are looking for these days and
how's<00:05:26.690> that<00:05:29.230> so<00:05:30.230> I<00:05:30.260> think<00:05:31.120> with<00:05:32.120> any

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
how's that so I think with any

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.330 
how's that so I think with any
alternative<00:05:33.020> fuel<00:05:33.230> system<00:05:33.980> whether<00:05:34.160> it's

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
alternative fuel system whether it's

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.560 
alternative fuel system whether it's
electric<00:05:36.040> or<00:05:37.040> CNG<00:05:37.460> renounce<00:05:38.210> I<00:05:38.360> think

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
electric or CNG renounce I think

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.120 
electric or CNG renounce I think
customers<00:05:39.050> are<00:05:39.170> looking<00:05:39.290> for<00:05:39.650> the<00:05:39.830> value

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
customers are looking for the value

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.290 
customers are looking for the value
equation

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.559 

something<00:05:44.300> that<00:05:44.449> doesn't<00:05:44.479> compromise

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:48.569 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:51.049 

so<00:05:49.229> it's<00:05:49.379> convenient<00:05:49.919> doesn't<00:05:50.520> make<00:05:50.879> them

00:05:51.049 --> 00:05:51.059 
so it's convenient doesn't make them

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:52.939 
so it's convenient doesn't make them
change<00:05:51.360> how<00:05:51.809> what<00:05:52.229> they<00:05:52.349> know<00:05:52.469> about<00:05:52.499> driving

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:52.949 
change how what they know about driving

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:55.760 
change how what they know about driving
anything<00:05:53.399> else<00:05:53.669> and<00:05:54.300> certainly<00:05:54.749> range<00:05:55.379> is<00:05:55.589> one

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
anything else and certainly range is one

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.149 
anything else and certainly range is one
of<00:05:55.860> those<00:05:55.979> costs<00:05:56.309> is<00:05:56.550> a<00:05:56.819> range<00:05:57.179> of<00:05:57.330> cost<00:05:57.539> a<00:05:58.439> lot

00:05:59.149 --> 00:05:59.159 
of those costs is a range of cost a lot

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.460 
of those costs is a range of cost a lot
of<00:05:59.219> great<00:05:59.580> in<00:05:59.849> rose<00:06:00.059> being<00:06:00.360> made

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470

cost pretending to come

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.210 
cost pretending to come
so<00:06:06.840> I<00:06:07.110> think<00:06:07.229> that<00:06:07.560> there's<00:06:07.770> a<00:06:07.830> greater

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
so I think that there's a greater

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.029 
so I think that there's a greater
greater<00:06:08.490> acceptability<00:06:09.120> in<00:06:09.449> the<00:06:09.539> market

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 
greater acceptability in the market

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:13.279 
greater acceptability in the market
