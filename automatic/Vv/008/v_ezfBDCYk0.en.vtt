00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.250
 Rayo asked how it would not be around 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.870
 forgiveness 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.179
 So I go in person to stop 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.530
 possibility only then car and I want 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.719
 now go where I am 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.759
 I buy this music program 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.929
 Anyway, trying is general 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:24.750
 Pollution can mr 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:25.460
 pending attention totally has on it 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.960
 written 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.349
 Do you believe that nature takes its revenge? 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.480
 sometime with us since we consistently 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.399
 exploit all raw materials 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.500
 I totally think that nature 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:48.120
 At some point it says enough 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:50.340
 stop it so I personally hold 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.260
 actually storm and storm correctly 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.120
 He really only has people around 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.590
 live earthquakes come to us something 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.730
 police spokesman has all that 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.600
 actually already for a warning of 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.600
 nature to us 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.299
 I warned you but we are 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.490
 of course, to notice and to do that 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.610
 understand and that's why we become 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.040
 We should go down someday 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.890
 consciously longer where I access 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:22.229
 now the grass is pretty short but 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.280
 over there for example that all is 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.689
 now somewhere outside germany 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.950
 Mainz I can not stop 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.110
 because I answer as myself in 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.640
 Germany because I just stop in 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.729
 Germany so far extremely swell 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.860
 with that last asked for your franke 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.420
 Do you think you would be in the forest 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.869
 or in the wilderness with 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.790
 to survive his current knowledge 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:45.810
 in principle I believe it quite me 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.520
 I think if I had a knife and 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.880
 if i may still be a flint 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.880
 would have 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.610
 The backpack could handle it 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.170
 I actually wear my clothes on my body 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.320
 I could already think of that 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.150
 nature survive in the meantime in case of emergency 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.350
 Can I do it without me? 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.350
 I'm just growing up naturally 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:20.319
 I did that in my book and there 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.120
 I could well have could do in 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:27.310
 emergency also no animals shoot or 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.380
 I can drop something like that, too 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.400
 could fall even build than 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.470
 is expensive 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.360
 So I think I could be there 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:40.959
 survive if it had to be like that 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.120
 not coming in from tobias in the forest mushrooms 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.340
 tried in the forest respectively 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.870
 that I try now on drugs 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.870
 I would not try to leave 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.900
 Bonn 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.430
 Well then I thank you for watching 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.849
 Hope next time with you 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.890
 and here, if it is just like that 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.599
 beautiful high is just beautiful 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.220
 to put somewhere in the grave 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.780
 the actually individual absolute 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.349
