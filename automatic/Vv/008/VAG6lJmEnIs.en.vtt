00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.220
 today three beauties will come to me 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.490
 one can not understand why they are still 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.620
 I was the one who decided to invite them 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.990
 indulge yourself a little for dinner 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.670
 give chocolate treats and train 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.180
 prescription couples so they can 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.460
 prepare your future buddies for them and 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.449
 so cook wonderful portuguese 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.189
 chocolate cakes 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.230
 no, I'm cheating you actually 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.810
 the Portuguese have a fantastic recipe 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.650
 loose dough but I think because 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.820
 that i don't know him so generally i invented 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.950
 own option 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.230
 brand new and bought in the store 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.140
 the finished puff pastry then take 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:46.170
 butter and a couple of eggs and grease 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:49.770
 dough like this we do it in order to 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.649
 slightly enhance the taste and from very gone 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.460
 I have a mix of spices here now 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.890
 sprinkle dough and here I have cinnamon 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:06.750
 quite a bit just add a little 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:09.560
 taste to be unusual here so good 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.320
 pour the orange dough rub it 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.600
 one orange is more than enough 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.390
 jersey and this is the whole trick of the orange 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.850
 chocolate is a brilliant combination so when 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.740
 you are done with this recommend you one 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.740
 or two tablespoons of sugar 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:35.640
 so ready dough roll it 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:40.880
 pour all the ingredients and then just 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:44.460
 we fold it like this 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.840
 rolls and that's all ready and the only way 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.970
 I can do something like 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.950
 Portuguese cakes because 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.920
 this recipe is too complicated and so 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.420
 Now I will cut pieces in about an inch 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.579
 width like this and look looks 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.210
 like a Swiss roll that is in this spirit 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:07.170
 and now see what I'll do. 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.680
 film for the products that are certainly not 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.680
 make a mistake and 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:19.780
 We put our hand and roll presses so you 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:22.470
 and it remains only to roll it a bottle 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.260
 from milk or something like that 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.740
 these sizes do not need perfect shape 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.680
 perfect round is not necessary and here they are ours 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:36.280
 Portuguese cakes 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.590
 so they look here and I have molds 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.210
 smeared them with sugar but honestly 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.460
 saying you can just take a glass 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:50.070
 small cups something and 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:50.070
 get what you need here 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:02.320
 put the dough on the form of water and she herself 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:04.960
 apple broken and take the necessary look now 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.630
 put all this in the oven at 190 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:11.800
 degrees for 10-15 minutes 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.480
 until the color turns golden and I meanwhile 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.140
 cook the stuffing 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.100
 the best thing about this stuffing is that she 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.300
 simple 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:26.880
 need only pan 160 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:30.520
 milliliters of cream pour into the pan 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:35.230
 just do not boil only preheat 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:39.870
 to be cushy add 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:42.310
 tablespoon of sugar and a pinch of salt 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.739
 bit strange but believe it or 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.750
 no if you add a little bit of chocolate 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.880
 salt while making chocolate sauce 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.910
 chocolate will only taste better 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.180
 strange but true and so warm up 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.180
 pan 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:01.600
 turn off the gas all enough so we take 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.400
 good chocolate and i need two tiles 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:09.480
 200 grams of great chocolate and for 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.480
 cooking break it kill it as it should 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:22.060
 and then immediately fall asleep in hot cream and 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:25.310
 it starts melting immediately 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:32.300
 the last piece is a little stir 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:37.699
 look yes I need butter 1 dining room 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:47.020
 spoon and all have time so much creamy 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:53.120
 oil stir well look 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:54.889
 fiction sometimes needs to be given 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.349
 cream cool a little before 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.150
 you can pour chocolate 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:04.660
 pour some cold milk and 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:08.479
 the temperature drops well that 's it 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.940
 look look how beautiful how 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:16.240
 glitters 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.240
 some cold milk like this 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.289
 about a tablespoon 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.340
 shuffle and you can go further you 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.979
 You can change the taste of chocolate by adding 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.630
 a drop of brandy grated orange can 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.800
 fried nuts or something like that 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:39.349
 that was unusual though to be honest 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:46.479
 chocolate is good in itself so not 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:51.580
 We need to complicate the task of yes fine 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:57.220
 beauty see how our forms are there 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:06:01.340
 perfectly perfect and so what we do 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:04.070
 we get a lattice or something like that 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.919
 and while the dough is hot laid out 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:11.750
 just make sure they are 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:14.389
 exactly ready you look looks 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.550
 amazing sometimes they form holes 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:17.330
 and they will leak to this is not the end 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.250
 Sveta 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:22.520
 when they start to cool everything will come in 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:29.110
 rate now remains the most pleasant 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:29.110
 prevented again and pour 

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:34.849
 just don't pour too much else 

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:49.180
 it will be hard to eat unless you're all 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:49.180
 merge into one form let cool 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:56.710
 wonderful and here we have luxury cakes
