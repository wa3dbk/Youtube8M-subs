and<00:02:52.530> then<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.799> connect<00:02:54.069> it<00:02:54.189> to<00:02:54.340> this<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:56.230> take

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
and then to connect it to this you take

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:07.920 
and then to connect it to this you take
the<00:02:56.980> pedal<00:03:02.549> the<00:03:03.549> girl<00:03:03.700> I<00:03:03.849> don't<00:03:06.720> replace<00:03:07.720> this

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:38.700 

there<00:03:29.140> we<00:03:29.260> go

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:52.970 

less<00:03:39.430> pressure
