multiple banks this is where we're

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.550 
multiple banks this is where we're
finding<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.710> lot<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:02.130> cases<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:03.560> direct

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
finding a lot of cases in direct

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.399

the<00:02:07.680> first<00:02:08.209> true<00:02:09.709> builder<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.770> these<00:02:10.890> things

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
the first true builder of these things

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.260 
the first true builder of these things
that<00:02:11.250> was<00:02:12.050> into<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.140> Cordura<00:02:13.910> foam<00:02:14.910> block

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
that was into the Cordura foam block

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.080 
that was into the Cordura foam block
kind<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:15.930> construction<00:02:16.470> was<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.890> wolf<00:02:17.790> pack

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
kind of construction was the wolf pack

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.660

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
opened the door for case makers to do a

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.180 
opened the door for case makers to do a
lot<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.090> very<00:02:24.239> fun<00:02:24.420> things<00:02:25.010> partitioned<00:02:26.010> off

lot of very fun things partitioned off

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.420 
lot of very fun things partitioned off
three-horn<00:02:27.150> case<00:02:27.680> some<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.709> these<00:02:29.069> cases

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
three-horn case some of these cases

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.900 
three-horn case some of these cases
again<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.420> can<00:02:30.690> pull<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:33.290> foam<00:02:34.290> out<00:02:34.530> and

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
again you can pull the foam out and

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.070 
again you can pull the foam out and
reconfigure<00:02:35.910> them<00:02:36.090> for<00:02:36.750> different

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
reconfigure them for different

reconfigure them for different
instruments<00:02:37.580> this<00:02:38.580> is<00:02:39.390> probably<00:02:39.840> one<00:02:39.989> of<00:02:40.019> the

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
instruments this is probably one of the

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.910 
instruments this is probably one of the
best<00:02:40.410> it<00:02:41.340> costs<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.819> little<00:02:41.910> bit<00:02:42.060> money<00:02:42.920> but

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
best it costs a little bit money but

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.259 
best it costs a little bit money but
this<00:02:44.130> thing<00:02:44.660> is<00:02:45.660> an<00:02:45.900> indestructible<00:02:46.290> case

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
this thing is an indestructible case

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.710 
this thing is an indestructible case
this<00:02:48.269> is<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.900> torpedo<00:02:50.120> okay<00:02:51.120> this<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:51.600> the

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
this is a torpedo okay this is the

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.650 
this is a torpedo okay this is the
torpedo<00:02:52.170> coyote<00:02:52.709> bag<00:02:53.040> some<00:02:53.850> of<00:02:54.000> them<00:02:54.150> are<00:02:54.390> set

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
torpedo coyote bag some of them are set

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.509 
torpedo coyote bag some of them are set
up<00:02:54.810> for<00:02:54.989> like<00:02:55.140> two<00:02:55.500> trumpets<00:02:55.769> one<00:02:56.250> trumpet

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
up for like two trumpets one trumpet

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.150 
up for like two trumpets one trumpet
flugel<00:02:57.090> unsure<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.569> it<00:02:57.750> or<00:02:57.900> two<00:02:58.530> trumpets<00:02:58.739> Pig

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
flugel unsure of it or two trumpets Pig

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.370 
flugel unsure of it or two trumpets Pig
so<00:02:59.819> you<00:02:59.880> can<00:03:00.090> do<00:03:00.180> three<00:03:00.420> trumpets<00:03:00.690> depending

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
so you can do three trumpets depending

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.900 
so you can do three trumpets depending
upon<00:03:01.470> what<00:03:01.830> you're<00:03:01.980> trying<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.250> put<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:02.519> there

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
upon what you're trying to put in there

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.930 
upon what you're trying to put in there
now<00:03:03.540> another<00:03:03.870> good<00:03:04.080> case<00:03:04.489> another<00:03:05.489> good<00:03:05.730> case

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
now another good case another good case

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.559 
now another good case another good case
is<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.959> Boehner<00:03:07.769> case<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:09.269> Boehner

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
is the Boehner case and the Boehner

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.650 
is the Boehner case and the Boehner
multiple<00:03:09.900> cases<00:03:10.110> are<00:03:10.440> fine<00:03:11.280> fine<00:03:11.970> cases<00:03:12.510> that

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
multiple cases are fine fine cases that

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.250 
multiple cases are fine fine cases that
have<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.840> lot<00:03:13.079> of<00:03:13.170> options<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:13.739> can<00:03:14.310> move<00:03:15.260> these

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
have a lot of options you can move these

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.130 
have a lot of options you can move these
things<00:03:16.500> around<00:03:17.060> inside<00:03:18.060> of<00:03:18.299> them<00:03:18.450> to

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
things around inside of them to

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.080 
things around inside of them to
reconfigure<00:03:19.769> that<00:03:20.070> and<00:03:20.640> they<00:03:20.760> have<00:03:20.850> little

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
reconfigure that and they have little

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.970 
reconfigure that and they have little
foam<00:03:21.269> blocks<00:03:21.600> to<00:03:22.260> help<00:03:22.320> keep<00:03:22.530> everything<00:03:22.709> in

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
foam blocks to help keep everything in

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.190 
foam blocks to help keep everything in

protect has a similar design now protec

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.280 
protect has a similar design now protec
cases<00:03:30.420> I<00:03:31.730> think<00:03:32.730> are<00:03:32.850> just<00:03:32.880> a<00:03:33.480> little<00:03:34.049> bit<00:03:34.170> more

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
cases I think are just a little bit more

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.789 
cases I think are just a little bit more
flimsy<00:03:34.620> they're<00:03:35.549> not<00:03:35.820> quite<00:03:36.150> as<00:03:36.329> hard<00:03:36.799> they

flimsy they're not quite as hard they

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.400 
flimsy they're not quite as hard they
don't<00:03:38.100> have<00:03:38.370> quite<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.930> sturdiness

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
don't have quite that the sturdiness

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.750 
don't have quite that the sturdiness
that<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.799> bonus<00:03:41.010> hat<00:03:41.310> but<00:03:41.489> they're<00:03:41.640> very

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
that the bonus hat but they're very

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.870 
that the bonus hat but they're very
close<00:03:42.180> they're<00:03:43.140> definitely<00:03:43.500> not<00:03:43.739> as<00:03:44.130> good<00:03:44.760> as

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
close they're definitely not as good as

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.849 
close they're definitely not as good as
the<00:03:45.000> wolf<00:03:45.209> packs<00:03:45.510> they're<00:03:45.930> definitely<00:03:46.290> not<00:03:46.620> as

protection<00:03:50.370> so<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:50.790> have<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.269> decide<00:03:51.570> how

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
protection so you have to decide how

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.330 
protection so you have to decide how
much<00:03:51.870> protection<00:03:52.470> do<00:03:52.560> I<00:03:52.620> need<00:03:52.799> but<00:03:52.950> again<00:03:53.220> you

looking at gig bags and I'll give a bit

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.200 
looking at gig bags and I'll give a bit
of<00:06:31.460> a<00:06:31.580> demonstration<00:06:31.880> right<00:06:32.419> now<00:06:32.919> working<00:06:33.919> it

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
of a demonstration right now working it

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.740 
of a demonstration right now working it
look<00:06:35.210> at<00:06:35.330> you

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:35.750 
look at you

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.550 
look at you
gig<00:06:36.740> bags<00:06:36.979> this<00:06:37.940> is<00:06:38.000> a<00:06:38.120> sound<00:06:38.479> where<00:06:38.780> this<00:06:39.289> is<00:06:39.500> a

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 
gig bags this is a sound where this is a

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.760 
gig bags this is a sound where this is a
pro<00:06:39.770> tect<00:06:40.070> the<00:06:40.610> pro<00:06:40.880> Tek<00:06:41.180> is<00:06:42.139> rather<00:06:43.210> flimsy

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:44.770 
pro tect the pro Tek is rather flimsy

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:50.260 
pro tect the pro Tek is rather flimsy
okay<00:06:45.880> now<00:06:46.880> it's<00:06:47.600> not<00:06:48.020> that<00:06:48.350> it's<00:06:48.500> made<00:06:49.430> flimsy

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.270 
okay now it's not that it's made flimsy

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.300 
okay now it's not that it's made flimsy
it's<00:06:50.510> just<00:06:50.990> that's<00:06:51.169> how<00:06:51.500> it's<00:06:51.710> designed<00:06:52.160> to

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.310 
it's just that's how it's designed to

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.969 
it's just that's how it's designed to
design<00:06:52.820> basically<00:06:53.560> to<00:06:54.560> be<00:06:54.740> a<00:06:54.919> sack<00:06:55.630> around<00:06:56.979> the

00:06:57.969 --> 00:06:57.979 
design basically to be a sack around the

00:06:57.979 --> 00:06:58.600 
design basically to be a sack around the
horn

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
horn

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.510 
horn
so<00:06:58.970> I'd<00:06:59.120> hate<00:06:59.300> to<00:06:59.360> go<00:07:00.080> like<00:07:00.289> that<00:07:00.620> with<00:07:01.250> that

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 
so I'd hate to go like that with that

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.969 
so I'd hate to go like that with that
because<00:07:02.199> you<00:07:03.199> probably<00:07:03.440> have<00:07:03.740> a<00:07:03.770> lot<00:07:03.949> of

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:03.979 
because you probably have a lot of

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:06.430 
because you probably have a lot of
damage<00:07:04.280> now<00:07:04.699> on<00:07:04.940> the<00:07:05.120> other<00:07:05.300> hand<00:07:05.630> the<00:07:06.110> sound

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:06.440 
damage now on the other hand the sound

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.240 
damage now on the other hand the sound
wear<00:07:06.800> has<00:07:07.550> a<00:07:07.880> lot<00:07:08.419> of<00:07:08.750> padding<00:07:09.260> a<00:07:09.410> lot<00:07:10.010> of

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:10.250 
wear has a lot of padding a lot of

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:12.279 
wear has a lot of padding a lot of
protection<00:07:10.849> and<00:07:11.090> it's<00:07:11.419> a<00:07:11.510> totally<00:07:11.930> different

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:12.289 
protection and it's a totally different

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:14.680 
protection and it's a totally different
type<00:07:12.500> of<00:07:12.530> gig<00:07:12.950> bag<00:07:13.190> it<00:07:13.669> still<00:07:14.060> is<00:07:14.180> a<00:07:14.210> gig<00:07:14.479> bag

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.690 
type of gig bag it still is a gig bag

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.830 
type of gig bag it still is a gig bag
but<00:07:14.930> it's<00:07:15.080> got<00:07:15.320> a<00:07:15.620> good<00:07:16.220> amount<00:07:16.669> of<00:07:16.880> protection

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 
but it's got a good amount of protection

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.620 
but it's got a good amount of protection
so<00:07:18.380> that<00:07:18.500> I<00:07:18.560> probably<00:07:18.830> can<00:07:19.160> go<00:07:19.340> like<00:07:20.180> that<00:07:20.389> and

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:20.630 
so that I probably can go like that and

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.550 
so that I probably can go like that and
not<00:07:21.380> hurt<00:07:21.740> the<00:07:22.340> instrument<00:07:22.820> that's<00:07:23.000> inside<00:07:23.560> so

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 
not hurt the instrument that's inside so

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:30.100 
not hurt the instrument that's inside so
again<00:07:25.990> no<00:07:26.990> dance<00:07:27.260> no<00:07:27.729> twist<00:07:28.729> no<00:07:28.910> turns<00:07:29.210> no<00:07:29.810> runs

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:30.110

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.159 
again no dance no twist no turns no runs
no<00:07:30.289> drips<00:07:30.740> no<00:07:31.099> errors<00:07:31.639> so<00:07:32.330> again<00:07:32.630> the<00:07:32.750> type<00:07:32.990> of

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:33.169 
no drips no errors so again the type of

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:34.360 
no drips no errors so again the type of
protection<00:07:33.590> that<00:07:33.620> you<00:07:33.830> want<00:07:34.130> for<00:07:34.310> your
