God<00:03:56.110> died<00:03:57.110> I<00:03:57.730> also<00:03:58.730> think<00:03:59.060> that<00:03:59.180> when<00:03:59.420> she<00:03:59.540> does

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
God died I also think that when she does

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.380 
God died I also think that when she does
that<00:03:59.900> hurt<00:03:59.990> her<00:04:00.200> defense<00:04:00.530> is<00:04:00.710> weaker

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.580 

there

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.720 

yeah<00:04:07.590> I<00:04:07.620> think<00:04:07.800> at<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.160> core<00:04:08.190> defense<00:04:08.520> gets

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
yeah I think at the core defense gets

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.890 
yeah I think at the core defense gets
higher<00:04:08.850> when<00:04:09.000> she's<00:04:09.120> in<00:04:09.150> her<00:04:09.330> pink<00:04:09.510> hair<00:04:09.690> but<00:04:09.870> i

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
higher when she's in her pink hair but i

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.390 
higher when she's in her pink hair but i
don't<00:04:10.020> remember<00:04:10.320> only<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.740> statistics<00:04:11.220> right
