a picture up on Instagram when i put

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
this on so that is everything I got my

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.950 
this on so that is everything I got my
top<00:03:35.070> box<00:03:35.370> so<00:03:35.880> I<00:03:35.910> think<00:03:36.030> for<00:03:36.210> me<00:03:36.390> this<00:03:36.540> month<00:03:36.750> top

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
top box so I think for me this month top

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.650 
top box so I think for me this month top
box<00:03:37.170> definitely<00:03:37.590> wins<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.910> two<00:03:39.120> because

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
box definitely wins and the two because

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.220 
box definitely wins and the two because
I<00:03:39.900> don't<00:03:40.230> really<00:03:40.380> use<00:03:40.710> Kohl<00:03:41.640> eyeliner<00:03:42.230> but

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
I don't really use Kohl eyeliner but

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.380 
I don't really use Kohl eyeliner but
this<00:03:43.440> color<00:03:43.680> is<00:03:43.800> really<00:03:44.280> pretty<00:03:44.459> so<00:03:45.090> I<00:03:45.120> will

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
this color is really pretty so I will

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.410 
this color is really pretty so I will
try<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:45.720> use<00:03:45.900> this<00:03:46.110> and<00:03:46.490> I<00:03:47.490> don't<00:03:47.910> really

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
try and use this and I don't really

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.300 
try and use this and I don't really
switch<00:03:48.750> out<00:03:48.900> face<00:03:49.110> wash<00:03:49.350> is<00:03:49.560> too<00:03:49.709> much<00:03:49.890> the

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
switch out face wash is too much the

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.970 
switch out face wash is too much the
hand<00:03:50.550> cream<00:03:50.880> is<00:03:51.330> a<00:03:51.390> really<00:03:51.900> funny<00:03:52.110> smell<00:03:52.530> which

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
hand cream is a really funny smell which

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.100 
hand cream is a really funny smell which
I<00:03:53.070> don't<00:03:53.250> really<00:03:53.340> like<00:03:53.610> but<00:03:54.030> I<00:03:54.300> do<00:03:54.510> really<00:03:54.900> like

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
I don't really like but I do really like

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.570 
I don't really like but I do really like
the<00:03:55.260> brush<00:03:55.470> I<00:03:55.740> think<00:03:56.010> that's<00:03:56.250> going<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.459> be

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
the brush I think that's going to be

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.220 
the brush I think that's going to be
super<00:03:56.730> nice<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.240> I<00:03:57.450> decided<00:03:57.750> to<00:03:57.900> try<00:03:57.959> out<00:03:58.050> this

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
super nice and I decided to try out this

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.410 
super nice and I decided to try out this
lip<00:03:58.410> gloss<00:03:58.650> because<00:03:59.010> it<00:03:59.550> does<00:03:59.970> look<00:04:00.150> like<00:04:00.300> he

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
lip gloss because it does look like he

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.600 
lip gloss because it does look like he
shares<00:04:00.660> a<00:04:00.720> little<00:04:01.080> bit<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.470> I<00:04:01.980> think<00:04:02.250> it'll<00:04:02.400> be

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
shares a little bit and I think it'll be

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.520 
shares a little bit and I think it'll be
a<00:04:02.640> nice<00:04:02.850> color<00:04:03.090> for<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.450> fall<00:04:03.660> overall<00:04:04.500> I

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
a nice color for the fall overall I

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.380 
a nice color for the fall overall I
think<00:04:04.740> this<00:04:05.070> may<00:04:05.310> be<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.670> least<00:04:05.880> favorite

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
think this may be the least favorite

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.390 
think this may be the least favorite
Ipsy<00:04:06.750> bag<00:04:06.780> that<00:04:07.200> I've<00:04:07.320> ever<00:04:07.350> received<00:04:07.650> so
