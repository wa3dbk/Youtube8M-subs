page<00:00:36.170> the<00:00:37.170> big<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.680> two<00:00:37.829> reasons<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.219> bought

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
page the big the two reasons I bought

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.950 
page the big the two reasons I bought
this<00:00:38.579> really<00:00:38.790> performance<00:00:39.480> because<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.840> have

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
this really performance because I have

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.540 
this really performance because I have
an<00:00:40.050> Apple<00:00:40.320> TV<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.190> knew<00:00:41.340> would<00:00:41.520> be

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
an Apple TV and this I knew would be

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.760 
an Apple TV and this I knew would be
quicker<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.180> also<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> voice<00:00:43.230> search<00:00:43.559> I

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
quicker and also the voice search I

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.830 
quicker and also the voice search I
wanted<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.129> see<00:00:44.309> how<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.489> would<00:00:44.700> work<00:00:44.840> so

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
wanted to see how that would work so

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.000 
wanted to see how that would work so
let's<00:00:46.050> start<00:00:46.260> with<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.410> voice<00:00:46.530> search<00:00:46.829> I've

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
let's start with the voice search I've

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.740 
let's start with the voice search I've
never<00:00:47.250> searched<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.730> particular<00:00:48.090> movie<00:00:48.629> on

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
never searched this particular movie on

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.220 
never searched this particular movie on
this<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.260> will<00:00:49.440> be<00:00:50.420> right<00:00:51.420> right<00:00:51.750> from

this so this will be right right from

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.869 
this so this will be right right from
scratch<00:00:53.930> the<00:00:54.930> last<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.680> mohicans

could<00:02:22.850> see<00:02:22.970> it<00:02:23.060> loading<00:02:23.240> briefly<00:02:23.630> there<00:02:25.000> the

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
could see it loading briefly there the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.680 
could see it loading briefly there the
HD<00:02:26.540> at<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.750> bottom<00:02:27.050> left<00:02:27.260> is<00:02:27.440> not<00:02:27.620> yet<00:02:28.690> visible

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
HD at the bottom left is not yet visible

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.270 
HD at the bottom left is not yet visible
so<00:02:30.080> this<00:02:30.230> does<00:02:30.440> seem<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:30.710> be<00:02:30.770> a<00:02:30.860> standard

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
so this does seem to be a standard

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.390 
so this does seem to be a standard
definition<00:02:31.460> I'm<00:02:31.880> not<00:02:32.030> sure<00:02:32.240> why<00:02:33.070> it<00:02:34.070> says<00:02:34.250> that

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
definition I'm not sure why it says that

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.860 
definition I'm not sure why it says that
my<00:02:34.490> connection<00:02:34.910> which<00:02:35.030> is<00:02:35.060> over<00:02:35.390> Wi-Fi<00:02:35.810> is

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
my connection which is over Wi-Fi is

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.390 
my connection which is over Wi-Fi is
very<00:02:36.230> strong<00:02:36.590> so<00:02:38.500> there's<00:02:39.500> 10<00:02:39.680> seconds<00:02:40.160> or

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
very strong so there's 10 seconds or

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:50.180 
very strong so there's 10 seconds or
hold<00:02:41.330> it<00:02:41.450> down<00:02:44.380> hit<00:02:45.380> play

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.890 

so<00:02:50.640> I'm<00:02:50.700> gonna<00:02:50.790> click<00:02:50.970> home<00:02:51.270> go<00:02:51.570> back<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.810> the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
so I'm gonna click home go back to the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.750 
so I'm gonna click home go back to the
home<00:02:52.020> screen<00:02:52.050> so<00:02:52.980> actually<00:02:53.280> search<00:02:53.520> works

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
home screen so actually search works

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.580 
home screen so actually search works
very<00:02:53.970> nicely<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.840> one<00:02:55.020> thing<00:02:55.260> about<00:02:55.290> this

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
very nicely the one thing about this

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.620 
very nicely the one thing about this
thing<00:02:55.860> pretty<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.520> evident<00:02:57.150> from<00:02:57.210> the<00:02:57.390> get-go

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
thing pretty I evident from the get-go

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.320 
thing pretty I evident from the get-go
is<00:02:58.050> that<00:02:58.860> this<00:02:59.070> really<00:02:59.310> is<00:02:59.490> a<00:02:59.520> device<00:02:59.880> pushing

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
is that this really is a device pushing

clip

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:14.980 

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:25.900 

we<00:07:15.490> interview

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:25.910 

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.550 

so<00:07:26.480> that's<00:07:26.600> the<00:07:26.690> performance<00:07:26.990> we're<00:07:27.290> looking

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:27.560 
so that's the performance we're looking

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:40.760 
so that's the performance we're looking
at<00:07:27.860> here's<00:07:28.070> fast-forward

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:40.770 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.890 

so<00:07:41.340> the<00:07:41.490> interface<00:07:41.759> is<00:07:41.940> very<00:07:41.970> snappy<00:07:42.389> I'm<00:07:42.690> sure

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:42.900 
so the interface is very snappy I'm sure

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.390 
so the interface is very snappy I'm sure
that<00:07:43.080> changes<00:07:43.440> will<00:07:43.560> come<00:07:43.590> fairly

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 
that changes will come fairly

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.520 
that changes will come fairly
aggressively<00:07:44.880> toward<00:07:45.180> this<00:07:45.300> unit<00:07:45.380> but<00:07:46.380> the

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:46.530 
aggressively toward this unit but the

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.529 
aggressively toward this unit but the
lack<00:07:47.009> of<00:07:47.039> unified<00:07:47.550> voice<00:07:47.789> search<00:07:48.060> to<00:07:48.330> cover

00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:48.539 
lack of unified voice search to cover

00:07:48.539 --> 00:07:50.659 
lack of unified voice search to cover
everything<00:07:48.930> is<00:07:49.259> really<00:07:49.680> a<00:07:49.710> huge<00:07:50.069> drawback<00:07:50.340> at

00:07:50.659 --> 00:07:50.669 
everything is really a huge drawback at

00:07:50.669 --> 00:07:53.870 
everything is really a huge drawback at
this<00:07:50.789> point<00:07:51.060> for<00:07:51.270> me<00:07:51.300> personally
