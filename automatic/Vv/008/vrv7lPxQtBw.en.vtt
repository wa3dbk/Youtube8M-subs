okay let's start off the handle is made
out<00:00:15.679> of<00:00:15.709> 6061-t6<00:00:16.580> aircraft<00:00:17.539> aluminum<00:00:17.779> and

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
out of 6061-t6 aircraft aluminum and

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.679 
out of 6061-t6 aircraft aluminum and
then<00:00:18.410> I<00:00:18.619> have<00:00:18.949> carbon<00:00:19.550> fiber<00:00:19.730> inserts<00:00:20.119> as<00:00:20.419> you

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
then I have carbon fiber inserts as you

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:27.880 
then I have carbon fiber inserts as you
can<00:00:20.810> see<00:00:22.119> both<00:00:23.119> sides<00:00:23.829> the<00:00:24.829> blade<00:00:25.160> is<00:00:26.529> four<00:00:27.529> and

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
can see both sides the blade is four and

open it double sheet of paper let's see

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.190 
open it double sheet of paper let's see
if<00:01:53.110> you<00:01:53.200> can<00:01:53.230> see<00:01:53.410> this<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:55.180> can<00:01:55.300> see<00:01:55.510> it

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
if you can see this you can see it

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.970 
if you can see this you can see it
stopped<00:01:56.620> it<00:01:56.800> and<00:01:57.250> it<00:01:57.580> just<00:01:58.200> barely<00:01:59.200> nicked<00:01:59.770> the

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
stopped it and it just barely nicked the

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.490 
stopped it and it just barely nicked the
paper<00:02:00.220> but<00:02:01.060> um<00:02:01.330> when<00:02:01.960> you<00:02:02.050> do<00:02:02.170> that<00:02:02.290> all<00:02:02.410> you're

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
paper but um when you do that all you're

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.590 
paper but um when you do that all you're
going<00:02:02.590> to<00:02:02.650> do<00:02:02.740> is<00:02:02.890> pull<00:02:03.580> it<00:02:03.700> clicks<00:02:04.180> back<00:02:04.360> into

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
going to do is pull it clicks back into

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.240 
going to do is pull it clicks back into
its<00:02:04.720> whole<00:02:04.840> thing<00:02:05.020> it's<00:02:05.800> good<00:02:05.950> to<00:02:06.040> go<00:02:06.130> again

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
its whole thing it's good to go again

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.359 
its whole thing it's good to go again
and<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.930> reason<00:02:08.110> for<00:02:08.260> that<00:02:08.440> is<00:02:08.560> if<00:02:09.070> you

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
good on the thumb actuator it's really

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.940 
good on the thumb actuator it's really
good<00:02:22.480> on<00:02:22.570> both<00:02:22.720> sides<00:02:23.050> your<00:02:23.320> thumb<00:02:23.560> really

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
digs into it then it's got some Jim pin

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.830 
digs into it then it's got some Jim pin
on<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.620> front<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.280> sides<00:02:27.490> right<00:02:27.730> there<00:02:27.940> so

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
on the front the sides right there so

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.570 
on the front the sides right there so
you<00:02:28.930> can<00:02:29.050> see<00:02:29.200> not<00:02:29.740> too<00:02:29.950> much<00:02:30.100> what<00:02:30.370> it<00:02:30.430> works

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
you can see not too much what it works

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.170 
you can see not too much what it works
quite<00:02:30.820> well<00:02:30.880> um<00:02:31.830> my<00:02:32.830> only<00:02:32.980> criticism<00:02:33.220> of<00:02:33.910> this

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
quite well um my only criticism of this

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.640 
quite well um my only criticism of this
knife<00:02:34.390> is<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:36.130> it<00:02:36.310> does<00:02:36.580> have<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.870> little<00:02:38.530> bit

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
knife is that it does have a little bit

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.840 
knife is that it does have a little bit
of<00:02:38.740> blended<00:02:39.040> play<00:02:39.220> I<00:02:39.250> don't<00:02:39.430> know<00:02:39.580> if<00:02:39.640> you<00:02:39.730> can

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
of blended play I don't know if you can

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.870 
of blended play I don't know if you can
see<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:40.209> which<00:02:40.630> is<00:02:40.810> kind<00:02:41.260> of<00:02:41.370> absurd<00:02:42.370> for<00:02:42.820> a

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
see that which is kind of absurd for a

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.640 
see that which is kind of absurd for a
four<00:02:43.120> hundred<00:02:43.240> fifty<00:02:43.420> dollar<00:02:43.720> knife<00:02:43.900> but<00:02:44.440> I

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
four hundred fifty dollar knife but I

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.730 
four hundred fifty dollar knife but I
mean<00:02:45.580> it's<00:02:46.150> all<00:02:46.450> double<00:02:46.930> action<00:02:47.080> out<00:02:47.590> the

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
mean it's all double action out the

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.790 
mean it's all double action out the
fronts<00:02:47.950> have<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.280> so<00:02:48.630> well<00:02:49.630> oh<00:02:49.810> I'll<00:02:50.560> do<00:02:50.680> it

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
fronts have that so well oh I'll do it

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.260 
fronts have that so well oh I'll do it
cut<00:02:50.950> test<00:02:51.190> since<00:02:51.400> this<00:02:51.580> is<00:02:51.760> double-edged

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
cut test since this is double-edged

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.590 
cut test since this is double-edged
playing<00:02:52.660> it<00:02:52.840> I'll<00:02:53.650> do<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:55.690> way<00:02:55.870> flip<00:02:56.350> it<00:02:56.470> over

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
playing it I'll do that way flip it over

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.150 
playing it I'll do that way flip it over
both<00:02:58.600> sides<00:02:58.930> just<00:03:01.620> slice<00:03:02.620> through<00:03:02.860> it<00:03:02.950> it's

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
both sides just slice through it it's

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.320 
both sides just slice through it it's
just<00:03:03.430> razor<00:03:03.850> razor<00:03:04.239> razor<00:03:04.570> sharp<00:03:04.959> um<00:03:06.330> the

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
just razor razor razor sharp um the

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.170 
just razor razor razor sharp um the
pocket<00:03:07.600> clip<00:03:07.780> is<00:03:07.959> reversible<00:03:08.530> but<00:03:09.520> i<00:03:09.760> like<00:03:10.120> it

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180

and<00:03:37.170> roll<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:38.489> only<00:03:38.730> problem<00:03:39.000> with<00:03:39.269> this<00:03:39.390> is

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
and roll the only problem with this is

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.449 
and roll the only problem with this is
when<00:03:40.260> I<00:03:40.290> have<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:40.620> where<00:03:40.769> I<00:03:40.799> normally<00:03:40.860> carry<00:03:41.310> it

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
when I have it where I normally carry it

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.699 
when I have it where I normally carry it
when<00:03:41.640> I<00:03:41.730> sit<00:03:42.090> kind<00:03:42.810> of<00:03:42.900> diggz<00:03:43.349> into<00:03:43.470> me<00:03:43.620> a

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
when I sit kind of diggz into me a

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.550 
when I sit kind of diggz into me a
little<00:03:43.860> bit<00:03:44.040> but<00:03:44.459> I<00:03:44.810> can<00:03:45.810> live<00:03:45.959> with<00:03:46.080> that<00:03:46.110> for

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
little bit but I can live with that for

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.039 
little bit but I can live with that for
the<00:03:46.590> protection<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:47.610> that<00:03:48.569> gives<00:03:48.870> me

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
the protection that that gives me

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.229 
the protection that that gives me
because<00:03:49.500> I<00:03:49.680> can't<00:03:49.920> carry<00:03:50.099> a<00:03:50.250> gun<00:03:50.400> yet<00:03:50.580> but<00:03:51.540> well

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
because I can't carry a gun yet but well

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.520 
because I can't carry a gun yet but well
if<00:03:54.239> you<00:03:54.540> can<00:03:54.750> think<00:03:54.780> of<00:03:54.959> anything<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.319> I

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
if you can think of anything that I

if you can think of anything that I
didn't<00:03:55.799> say<00:03:55.980> go<00:03:56.310> ahead<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.519> put<00:03:56.819> it<00:03:56.879> in<00:03:56.940> the
