brand slightly unfortunately named when
I<00:00:08.849> was<00:00:09.000> there<00:00:09.210> Vegas<00:00:09.630> actually<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.590> very<00:00:11.130> same

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
I was there Vegas actually the very same

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.070 
I was there Vegas actually the very same
January<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.240> 5th<00:00:12.420> was<00:00:12.570> kicked<00:00:12.719> immediately

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
January the 5th was kicked immediately

January the 5th was kicked immediately
of<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.200> box<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.620> bit<00:00:14.490> ashamed<00:00:14.549> themselves

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:15.109 
of the box and a bit ashamed themselves

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:17.330 
of the box and a bit ashamed themselves
but<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.230> course<00:00:16.379> like<00:00:16.529> so<00:00:16.710> many<00:00:16.800> things<00:00:16.920> named

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
but of course like so many things named

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.609 
but of course like so many things named
after<00:00:17.550> elemental<00:00:18.150> forces<00:00:18.449> we've<00:00:18.990> got<00:00:19.199> punch

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
after elemental forces we've got punch

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.820

and<00:00:19.980> kicker<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:21.590> thunder

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
and kicker and thunder

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.089 
and kicker and thunder
I<00:00:22.859> think<00:00:23.730> it's<00:00:23.820> been<00:00:23.939> typhoons<00:00:24.720> this<00:00:25.470> in<00:00:25.920> case

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
I think it's been typhoons this in case

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.980 
I think it's been typhoons this in case
you're<00:00:26.220> wondering<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.269> capacitor<00:00:27.689> look<00:00:27.900> at

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
you're wondering is it capacitor look at

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.050 
you're wondering is it capacitor look at
the<00:00:28.050> power<00:00:28.289> terminals<00:00:28.800> on<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.980> end<00:00:29.099> that's<00:00:29.910> a

more<00:00:37.739> tell<00:00:37.920> if<00:00:38.010> I'm<00:00:38.129> actually<00:00:38.250> laughing

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
more tell if I'm actually laughing

more tell if I'm actually laughing
bottles<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.390> tried<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.960> plug<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.440> using

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
bottles of I tried to plug this in using

the<00:00:40.860> dial<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.309> power<00:00:41.550> supply<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.450> diodes<00:00:42.809> which

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
the dial a power supply the diodes which

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.790 
the dial a power supply the diodes which
meant<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.820> course<00:00:44.820> there's<00:00:45.469> twenty<00:00:46.469> farads

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
meant of course there's twenty farads

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.350 
meant of course there's twenty farads
there's<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.280> little<00:00:47.610> bit<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.820> electrolytic

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
there's a little bit of electrolytic

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.139 
there's a little bit of electrolytic
capacitors<00:00:48.809> there<00:00:48.960> but<00:00:49.110> most<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
capacitors there but most of it is the

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.110 
capacitors there but most of it is the
slab<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.800> well<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.890> Illuma<00:00:53.190> pro-style<00:00:53.460> I

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
slab of well the Illuma pro-style I

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.369 
slab of well the Illuma pro-style I
think<00:00:54.390> they're<00:00:54.480> going<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:54.960> at<00:00:55.020> first<00:00:55.230> but

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
think they're going to do at first but

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.500 
think they're going to do at first but
it's<00:00:55.559> actually<00:00:55.980> an<00:00:56.280> avionics<00:00:56.670> capacitor<00:00:57.390> was

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
it's actually an avionics capacitor was

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.290 
it's actually an avionics capacitor was
designed<00:00:57.780> for<00:00:57.899> clearing<00:00:58.370> helmets<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.489> mist<00:00:59.760> in
