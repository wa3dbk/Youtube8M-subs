generated stories feeling okay and then

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.069 
generated stories feeling okay and then
it<00:02:38.140> gets<00:02:38.260> heavier<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:38.920> darker<00:02:39.310> as<00:02:39.549> you<00:02:40.079> get

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
it gets heavier and darker as you get

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.509 
it gets heavier and darker as you get
some<00:02:41.349> more<00:02:41.500> do<00:02:41.680> that's<00:02:41.829> right<00:02:42.010> asking<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.430> get

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
some more do that's right asking to get

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:43.770 
some more do that's right asking to get
more<00:02:42.670> intense<00:02:42.879> so<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.209> weather<00:02:43.450> actually

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
more intense so the weather actually

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.780 
more intense so the weather actually
matches<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.410> intensity<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.040> story<00:02:45.400> and

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790
