00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
caprese now one of the things I like to

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.759 
caprese now one of the things I like to
add<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.390> my<00:00:30.480> caprese<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.140> isn't<00:00:31.529> that

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
add to my caprese that isn't that

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.440 
add to my caprese that isn't that
traditional<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.669> think<00:00:32.880> adds<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.270> nice

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
traditional but I think adds a nice

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.590 
traditional but I think adds a nice
flavor<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:34.079> reduced<00:00:35.070> balsamic<00:00:35.309> vinegar<00:00:36.180> so

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
flavor is reduced balsamic vinegar so

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.450 
flavor is reduced balsamic vinegar so
here<00:00:36.840> I'm<00:00:36.930> starting<00:00:37.140> off<00:00:37.410> with<00:00:37.559> four<00:00:37.890> cups<00:00:38.219> of

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
that's large enough to allow it to

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.490 
that's large enough to allow it to
reduce<00:00:47.940> rapidly<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.780> way<00:00:48.899> I'm<00:00:49.170> just<00:00:49.350> saving

time so you're gonna crank it up to high
you're<00:00:51.809> gonna<00:00:51.899> reduce<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.559> down<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.739> about<00:00:53.010> 1/4

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
you're gonna reduce it down to about 1/4

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.750 
you're gonna reduce it down to about 1/4
or<00:00:53.879> 1/8<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.960> its<00:00:55.230> original<00:00:55.649> volume<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.430> for
