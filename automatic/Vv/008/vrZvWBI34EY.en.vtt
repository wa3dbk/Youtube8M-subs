 to be able to share with those generations of little angels as the name is the program 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:43.899
 what these creatures mean 

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:46.389
 It is beautiful to know what the father 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.479
 and what Jesus Christ what the holy spirit 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:51.979
 can do for us because 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:54.049
 It is the only one that would change 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.120
 It is the only thing that transforms 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.420

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.289
 family 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:03.129
 the figure is not like that 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:04.769
 the survey also 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.689
 trip I want to wear last night 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:09.769
 artistic world 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.829
 to him the world d according to that medium 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.040
 clear that always 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.350
 look what the pain my style that 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.519
 the show artists call themselves actresses singers dancers are 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.409
 musicians like in this case 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:26.979
 most artists 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:28.400
 we have a strange body 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.349
 I think it's very happy we went on TV 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.769
 to everything we do we presume what we have up to what we do not have 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.399
 but suddenly this poe and the soul 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:43.359
 to September that tie like that and when all agreement breaks 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.589
 is when you turn your face 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:48.739
 hit for tea 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.549
 and to never let go of the Lord Jesus as it was my case the pain the pain is not 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.749
 very true the minimal artists do not 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:59.439
 live good imitation lived not because I also started my athletic career 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:02.510
 and very miñano my dad was an artist my grandmother artist 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.220
 It looks good nothing as far as it happened to me not what and as to me so many 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.929
 years or so I told him but this fills me 

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:14.709
 I walk in all these facts we travel we go on tours but I felt a great 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.969
 empty not and when I had my encounter with Jesus ec as the sixth equally that 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:22.509
 pain are in your life and your life is filled with a cosmos that reaches people 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:26.650
 It does not mean that you can not compare to anything because it is a joy and nex pipe 

00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:31.830
 unexplainable and it is a joy that lasts here on earth and be there until life 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.619
 eternal headquarters that called sanctions of joy is eternal is a joy andrea sister 

00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:37.770
 that is growing 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.900
 because we can talk about Jesus before I knew him because he was in the 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.069
 world as well as being mocked sometimes I miss birds the right 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.990
 but once when it was estimated 1 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.400
 You may know Mr. Jesus 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.990
 know your wonders know your love you start adopted for you rathy in this 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.990
 heart to give him strength to give meaning to your life 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:07.370
 At that time the embozo invades you day and night and the beautiful thing is that for Jesus 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.550
 there is no one who discriminates action we all qualify no matter if we are 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.970
 restless big delgaditos 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.690
 fat the poor doctors and in my case when I 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.699
 posited at the feet of the Lord Jesus 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:23.400
 it affected me like this 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.930
 by the father 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.490
 ravine 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.800
 I'm going to shit 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.800
 to avoid it 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:33.210
 nobody values ​​our germ 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.080
 the song for all the children and also for the parents that are 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.139
 watching this beautiful song that all the children to know because we have sung 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.009
 since we were children of my generation I think this generation is 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:43.689
 ancient 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:46.939
 and it's a very nice song that has resulted in a 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:51.039
 many languages ​​English and Spanish in Italy there are not many so good what 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:54.400
 it seems to them if we happen to expose pristine servants of Jesus and it is 

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:58.849
 also the song for a child is they have decided to go to vote alabama there is a 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:05:59.160

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.520
 in Leon 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.409
 It also highlights how beautiful it had been in a hollow 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.690
 once beautiful I can play the violin and 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.500
 and like that and how they feel or the music but that reaches your heart 

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:29.349
