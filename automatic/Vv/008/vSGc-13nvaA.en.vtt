out<00:06:09.479> channel<00:06:09.900> but<00:06:10.050> I<00:06:10.289> think<00:06:10.590> this<00:06:10.680> is<00:06:10.910> going

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
out channel but I think this is going

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.790 
out channel but I think this is going
keep<00:06:12.570> to<00:06:12.720> every<00:06:12.930> wave<00:06:13.050> of<00:06:13.229> channel<00:06:13.560> but<00:06:13.740> I

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
keep to every wave of channel but I

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.550 
keep to every wave of channel but I
think<00:06:14.010> this<00:06:14.130> is<00:06:14.250> a<00:06:14.280> lot<00:06:14.520> better<00:06:15.229> so<00:06:16.229> that's<00:06:16.440> it

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
think this is a lot better so that's it
