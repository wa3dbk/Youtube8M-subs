00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:08.770
 When leaving the backyard garage on the road at all 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:11.030
 I installed the corner mirror because I did not know how the road was 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:17.480
 Mirror purchased here 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:22.130
 As a point of caution, the larger one is easy to see, but the line affected by the strong wind 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:25.000
 And it is the point that you must prepare a pet etc. 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.000
 den 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.780
 Assemble the mounting bracket in the ground 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.730
 Fix it loose so that you can adjust the angle later 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:59.700
 It is a bracket attached to the top of the head of the soldier which was attached to the ground purchased separately 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.700
 3 not as painted to look beneath 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.780
 After painting was dry, I installed it on the top of the soldier's head 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.400
 Tightening the nut has a structure that sandwiches a 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:25.030
 Make it lightly stop so that you can adjust the position later 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:34.729
 Pay attention to the good material such as Mr. Otani , as it may hurt if it is tightened tightly. 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.729
 Please 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:42.550
 Invest washers and spring washers on bolts to secure the column 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:04.070
 I also painted the columns for maintenance 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:09.020
 Give fixing bracket treat for the hole stew that came with the mirror 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:11.450
 Simple, which has been included so it did not tighten the nuts in the range that you own 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:17.450
 Tighten the Lentil Rat 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:21.280
 As a point of caution, when attaching to a cylindrical pole, it's pretty tight and it's windy if you don't close it 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.280
 It's easy to rotate 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.530
 Stop borrowed the mirror 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.350
 Make sure you actually see your head like a road 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:41.690
 At this time, you may always see the road from the driver's seat of the actual car 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:47.990
 Please confirm at the time of temporary stop 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:49.170
 I cut it in the video, but I got on and off the full time several times to adjust the angle and position 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:55.800
 The 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:58.940
 Kakedo position adjustment If you stuck around over again from the beginning, remove the ground without compromise 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.940
 I thought it was good 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.290
 All natto which had been temporarily fixed was tightened and completed 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:17.800
 Be careful not to tighten the nut , as even a mirror of this size will cause slight windiness. 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.800
 Please 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.950
 I also check from the road side 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:37.270
 I tried to fix it to the column with the mirror body attached at the beginning 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:44.400
 Since the mirror was not able to account for the way the natto to work to remove only fitting directly below 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:45.950
 a u-shaped rags I thought that it is better that there was a wrench case of fixing a nut 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:52.310
 Tele 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:58.900
 If it can not be attached depending on the shape of the roof, or if it is drilled and fixed with an anchor bolt 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.900
 Please check carefully before purchasing or installing as it may
