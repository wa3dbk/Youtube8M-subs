 a meal these guys there are going to cook you 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.180

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.150
 malagasy dury or a vietnamese a guy 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.400
 who eat rice every day because 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.620
 that the guy who eats does not rhyme everything and 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.530
 saint glinglin him at the level really 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.870
 level 1 is to say that for him duri 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.150

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.670
 laughter 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.159

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.960

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.760

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.290
 the end of their idol 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.090

 warm up and I just put in the pan 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:25.910

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.440
 that we need to explain something to me 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.080

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.580
 worse and put you it in cg 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.590
 200 grams that can make 200 grams 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.750

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.080
 pounds and my pills that these are 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.299
