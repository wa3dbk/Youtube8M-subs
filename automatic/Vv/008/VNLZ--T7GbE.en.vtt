00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.130 
toy box so I think you can let 20 if
you'll<00:01:09.080> have<00:01:09.229> 20<00:01:09.820> soldiers<00:01:10.820> and<00:01:11.240> your<00:01:11.570> box<00:01:11.840> you

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
you guys some more gameplay in the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.570 
you guys some more gameplay in the
future<00:02:12.020> too<00:02:12.200> but<00:02:12.770> I<00:02:12.800> so<00:02:13.130> far<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.459> only

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
future too but I so far the only

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.160 
future too but I so far the only
complaint<00:02:14.030> I<00:02:14.180> have<00:02:14.360> with<00:02:14.540> this<00:02:14.690> games<00:02:14.959> with<00:02:15.140> a

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
complaint I have with this games with a

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.110 
complaint I have with this games with a
multi-player<00:02:15.920> I<00:02:15.950> mean<00:02:16.220> it<00:02:16.670> doesn't<00:02:17.000> only

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
multi-player I mean it doesn't only

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.550 
multi-player I mean it doesn't only
affect<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.630> multi<00:02:17.930> put<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.200> all<00:02:18.290> that<00:02:18.410> much

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
affect the multi put it all that much

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.350 
affect the multi put it all that much
but<00:02:18.830> I<00:02:18.890> mean<00:02:19.069> that<00:02:19.760> that<00:02:19.790> was<00:02:20.120> kind<00:02:20.330> of

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
but I mean that that was kind of

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.449 
but I mean that that was kind of
annoying<00:02:20.980> basically<00:02:21.980> if<00:02:22.069> you<00:02:22.160> guys<00:02:22.280> know<00:02:22.400> what

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
annoying basically if you guys know what

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.770 
annoying basically if you guys know what
dashboarding<00:02:23.090> is<00:02:23.209> it's<00:02:23.390> like<00:02:23.480> when<00:02:23.599> you<00:02:23.720> do

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
dashboarding is it's like when you do

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.289 
dashboarding is it's like when you do
that<00:02:23.959> when<00:02:24.110> you<00:02:24.140> go<00:02:24.260> your<00:02:24.410> dashboard<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.849> like

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
that when you go your dashboard it like

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:27.950 
that when you go your dashboard it like
to<00:02:26.480> avoid<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:26.840> loss<00:02:27.079> like<00:02:27.530> that

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
to avoid a loss like that

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.020 
to avoid a loss like that
and<00:02:28.440> get<00:02:28.650> you<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:29.010> going<00:02:29.340> because<00:02:29.520> with<00:02:29.940> this

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
and get you and going because with this

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.200 
and get you and going because with this
game<00:02:30.300> people<00:02:30.630> do<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.080> all<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.290> time<00:02:32.210> doesn't

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
game people do it all the time doesn't

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.300 
game people do it all the time doesn't
happen<00:02:33.510> in<00:02:33.690> this<00:02:33.750> game<00:02:33.990> what<00:02:34.530> happens<00:02:34.830> in<00:02:34.950> like

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
happen in this game what happens in like

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.040 
happen in this game what happens in like
probably<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.030> lot<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.600> games<00:02:36.810> I've<00:02:37.020> played

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
probably a lot of the games I've played

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.350 
probably a lot of the games I've played
so<00:02:37.410> far<00:02:37.470> probably<00:02:37.860> would<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.070> be<00:02:38.250> like<00:02:38.460> I<00:02:38.730> think

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
so far probably would I be like I think

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.650 
so far probably would I be like I think
I'd<00:02:39.480> be<00:02:39.690> maybe<00:02:40.440> 10<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.190> over<00:02:41.460> now<00:02:41.670> but<00:02:42.300> instead

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
I'd be maybe 10 and over now but instead

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.240 
I'd be maybe 10 and over now but instead
them<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.960> note<00:02:43.230> because<00:02:43.410> everybody<00:02:44.070> likes<00:02:44.130> to

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
them to note because everybody likes to

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.680 
them to note because everybody likes to
