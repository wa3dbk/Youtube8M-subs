00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.279
 speak personal but a good tone in the kitchen 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:09.120
 beginning today we will teach you the 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.700
 make a mouse i / o ratatui is a dish of 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.240
 French origin and is a kind of 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.060
 mix of roasted vegetables you can 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.820
 as both accompanied and pure and 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.010
 It's very delicious, it 's very different, I 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.220
 I think you'll like it a lot then. 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.730
 come on we will start cutting 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.759
 thick onion the onion will 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.710
 be the basis of all ratatui then you 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.329
 can cut and more or less in that 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.239
 thick and we will now start 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.040
 assemble our shape is just put on the bottom 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.040
 shape the cut onions 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.180
 Now we're going to slice our eggplant. 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.010
 does not care about the appearance of my 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.870
 Eggplant is that we just show 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.449
 Chinese eggplant here in our 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.140
 supermarket but the taste is exactly the 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.399
 same 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.079
 it's just the format that 's a little bit 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.359
 different from the eggplant you go 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.530
 find in your house and you will put 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:10.140
 on top of the onion in its shape and then you 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.720
 already can temper this layer puts a 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.830
 a bit little salt also 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.830
 ground pepper 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.120
 and also a pastry of olive oil 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.190
 and now we're going to continue doing the 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.650
 same things with other vegetables. 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.900
 People are going to cut zucchini in this figure. 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.770
 What are you watching, we're going to put 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.800
 on top of our eggplant now the people 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.750
 cut tomatoes in this format is that the 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.850
 people are quoting do not need to take 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.560
 seed because if you took away the mind 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.570
 you will also remove the pulp from your 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.800
 tomatoes and we want you to 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.410
 little water 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.300
 in ratatoum we are going to cut 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.420
 our plate full if you have not 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.770
 laugh you can use the purple onion is 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.720
 important that an onion be a 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.700
 little sweeter than the other that 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.410
 people had previously used 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.410
 We'll put it on top of the tomato. 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.620
 now we're going to cut our 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.300
 thinly sliced ​​bell peppers 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.220
 Here I am using the sunshine pepper 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.990
 red and orange 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.090
 I do not want to use green because I see 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.010
 it's a little strong I do not think it's going to work 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.980
 very sure with ratatui then we 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.340
 use these two colors and just put them in 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.200
 up your note plate 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.750
 now you will cut the garlic into pieces 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.239
 large can be even big piece 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.220
 because it will caramelize a bit it 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.910
 will leave a very special taste in the 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.910
 your actor 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.400
 so after adding the garlic is just 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.530
 finish to temper your shape put 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.790
 a little salt put a little 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.790
 ground black pepper 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.350
 and here we are going to put a 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.250
 very special seasoning that is the servants of 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.500
 province 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.260
 herbs of formal provence which are 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.870
 one has that fancy name they 're easy to 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.080
 find you can find in the 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.390
 supermarket 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.030
 if you do not want to just wear panties 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.060
 even though it's also very good now 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.810
 just put a good amount of 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.230
 olive oil on top of your ratatui and people 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.430
 will put this in the preheated oven 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:27.500
 220 degrees for approximately 30 minutes 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.440
 after this 30 minutes just take the 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.870
 the oven stirred a little with this mixture at 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.180
 people will fiddle so that the part of 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.790
 down is a little bit on top 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.990
 and the top part is a little bit in the 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.210
 bottom 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.459
 so we are sure that we are 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:48.200
 baking equally all the vegetables that 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:51.680
 they are there in our way now it will only come back 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:55.450
