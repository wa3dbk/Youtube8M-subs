00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
been seeing the comment on this video a

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.260 
been seeing the comment on this video a
lot<00:00:40.920> recently<00:00:41.430> if<00:00:41.520> people<00:00:41.790> saying<00:00:42.000> why<00:00:42.210> don't

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
lot recently if people saying why don't

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.729 
lot recently if people saying why don't
you<00:00:42.480> do<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:42.750> with<00:00:42.960> mu<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.379> that's<00:00:43.649> a

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
you do this with mu and that's a

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.310 
you do this with mu and that's a
perfectly<00:00:44.100> logical<00:00:44.370> idea<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.360> mean<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.110> works

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
perfectly logical idea I mean it works

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.049 
perfectly logical idea I mean it works
with<00:00:46.530> ditto<00:00:46.710> because<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> move<00:00:47.460> transform

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
with ditto because of the move transform

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.569 
with ditto because of the move transform
and<00:00:48.360> Mew<00:00:48.660> also<00:00:49.110> knows<00:00:49.320> transform<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.340> learns

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
and Mew also knows transform it learns

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.330 
and Mew also knows transform it learns
it<00:00:50.730> at<00:00:50.820> level<00:00:51.059> 10<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.600> can<00:00:51.809> use<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.340> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
it at level 10 so you can use the the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.279 
it at level 10 so you can use the the
sort<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.850> modified<00:00:54.300> ditto<00:00:54.660> trick<00:00:54.989> where<00:00:55.170> you

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
sort of modified ditto trick where you

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.049 
sort of modified ditto trick where you
can<00:00:55.440> mess<00:00:56.129> with<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.370> level<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.850> what<00:00:57.000> you

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
can mess with the level of what you

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.560 
can mess with the level of what you
encounter<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.780> find<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.140> level<00:00:58.940> 10<00:00:59.940> through<00:01:00.149> 13

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
encounter to find a level 10 through 13

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.510 
encounter to find a level 10 through 13
mu<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.620> will<00:01:01.710> know<00:01:01.829> transform<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.460> then

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
mu so it will know transform and then

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.740 
mu so it will know transform and then
you<00:01:02.640> would<00:01:02.730> just<00:01:02.760> do<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> glitch<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.510> exact

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
you would just do the glitch the exact

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.920 
you would just do the glitch the exact
same<00:01:03.930> way<00:01:04.909> you'll<00:01:05.909> find<00:01:06.240> out<00:01:06.450> unfortunately

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
same way you'll find out unfortunately

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.250 
same way you'll find out unfortunately
that<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.590> doesn't<00:01:07.860> work<00:01:08.040> as<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:09.060> have<00:01:09.180> said<00:01:09.450> I'm

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
that it doesn't work as I have said I'm

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.500 
that it doesn't work as I have said I'm
not<00:01:10.500> 100%<00:01:11.010> sure<00:01:11.310> why<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.760> doesn't<00:01:12.060> work<00:01:12.210> but<00:01:12.479> I

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
not 100% sure why it doesn't work but I

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.590 
not 100% sure why it doesn't work but I
have<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.689> very<00:01:12.990> good<00:01:13.290> theory<00:01:14.060> but<00:01:15.060> before<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.420> get

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
have a very good theory but before I get

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.330 
have a very good theory but before I get
into<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:16.200> will<00:01:16.680> explain<00:01:17.040> what<00:01:17.220> I'm<00:01:17.310> doing

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
into that I will explain what I'm doing

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.590 
into that I will explain what I'm doing
here<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.759> case<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:17.970> don't<00:01:18.270> know<00:01:18.390> how<00:01:18.540> to

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
here in case you don't know how to

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.190 
here in case you don't know how to
modify<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.110> level<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:20.369> ditto<00:01:20.549> trick<00:01:21.200> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
modify the level of the ditto trick the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.480 
modify the level of the ditto trick the
level<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.619> what<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.830> encounter<00:01:23.280> is

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
level of what you encounter is

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.640 
level of what you encounter is
determined<00:01:24.180> by<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.390> attack<00:01:25.020> stat<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.590> the

ditto it's default set to 7 and that can

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.999 
ditto it's default set to 7 and that can
go<00:01:29.700> up<00:01:29.909> by<00:01:30.090> 6<00:01:30.420> or<00:01:30.570> down<00:01:30.869> by<00:01:31.049> 6<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.710> value

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
go up by 6 or down by 6 so that value

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.800 
go up by 6 or down by 6 so that value
can<00:01:32.130> be<00:01:32.159> anywhere<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.700> range<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:33.060> 1<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.240> 13

can be anywhere in the range of 1 to 13
we<00:01:34.680> basically<00:01:34.950> want<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.909> be<00:01:36.090> at<00:01:36.360> 10<00:01:36.900> or

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
we basically want it to be at 10 or

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.480 
we basically want it to be at 10 or
higher<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:38.400> I've<00:01:38.610> taught<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.030> Charmander

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
higher so I've taught this Charmander

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.090 
higher so I've taught this Charmander
I've<00:01:41.490> taught<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.790> Swords<00:01:42.060> Dance<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.810> ditto<00:01:43.770> now

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
I've taught it Swords Dance so ditto now

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.499 
I've taught it Swords Dance so ditto now
no<00:01:44.340> Swords<00:01:44.700> Dance<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.000> I'm<00:01:45.090> just<00:01:45.240> sort<00:01:45.390> of

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
no Swords Dance and I'm just sort of

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.120 
no Swords Dance and I'm just sort of
killing<00:01:45.750> time<00:01:46.049> until<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.530> uses<00:01:46.799> Swords<00:01:47.070> Dance

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
killing time until it uses Swords Dance

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.460 
killing time until it uses Swords Dance
twice<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.420> think<00:01:48.630> right<00:01:48.780> here<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.049> just<00:01:49.229> has

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
twice and I think right here it just has

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.020 
twice and I think right here it just has
done<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.829> second<00:01:50.189> time<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.579> I'm<00:01:50.729> going<00:01:50.909> to

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
done it the second time so I'm going to

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.630 
done it the second time so I'm going to
take<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.390> out<00:01:51.479> with<00:01:51.540> Aerodactyl<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.579> now<00:01:53.579> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
take it out with Aerodactyl and now the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.810 
take it out with Aerodactyl and now the
ditto<00:01:54.030> or<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.689> Mew<00:01:54.990> we<00:01:55.200> encounter<00:01:55.740> should<00:01:56.520> be

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
ditto or the Mew we encounter should be

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.139 
ditto or the Mew we encounter should be
at<00:01:56.969> level<00:01:57.210> 11<00:01:57.270> if<00:01:57.810> I've<00:01:57.990> done<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.320> correctly

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
at level 11 if I've done this correctly

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.700 
at level 11 if I've done this correctly
it<00:02:00.149> turns<00:02:00.360> out<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:00.750> at<00:02:01.140> level<00:02:01.350> 11

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
it turns out that it is at level 11

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.130 
it turns out that it is at level 11
this<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.399> videos<00:02:03.329> recorded<00:02:03.570> separately<00:02:03.930> from

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
this is videos recorded separately from

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.350 
this is videos recorded separately from
the<00:02:04.290> audio<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:04.770> already<00:02:04.890> know<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:06.000> want<00:02:06.329> to

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
the audio so I already know I want to

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.410 
the audio so I already know I want to
talk<00:02:06.540> about<00:02:06.719> what<00:02:07.049> happens<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.649> why<00:02:07.970> so<00:02:08.970> while

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
talk about what happens and why so while

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.420 
talk about what happens and why so while
the<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.720> go<00:02:10.379> through<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.770> rest<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.160> glitch

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
the I go through the rest of the glitch

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.880 
the I go through the rest of the glitch
to<00:02:12.120> get<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.989> quote-unquote<00:02:13.530> shine

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
to get the quote-unquote shine

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.960 
to get the quote-unquote shine
new<00:02:15.500> what's<00:02:16.500> going<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.920> end<00:02:17.100> up<00:02:17.250> happening<00:02:17.460> is

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
new what's going to end up happening is

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.630 
new what's going to end up happening is
when<00:02:18.240> I<00:02:18.270> catch<00:02:18.569> them<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:19.860> will<00:02:20.160> turn<00:02:20.400> into

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
when I catch them you it will turn into

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.270 
when I catch them you it will turn into
a<00:02:20.850> ditto<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:22.110> throw<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.440> master<00:02:22.770> ball<00:02:22.920> at<00:02:23.130> it

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
a ditto you throw the master ball at it

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.580 
a ditto you throw the master ball at it
it<00:02:23.459> says<00:02:23.670> yeah<00:02:24.240> you're<00:02:24.510> congratulations<00:02:25.350> or

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
it says yeah you're congratulations or

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.550 
it says yeah you're congratulations or
whatever<00:02:26.280> yes<00:02:26.550> ditto<00:02:26.880> was<00:02:27.180> caught<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.750> you're

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
whatever yes ditto was caught and you're

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.720 
whatever yes ditto was caught and you're
just<00:02:28.650> like<00:02:28.740> well<00:02:28.920> what<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.160> hell<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.580> was<00:02:29.610> a

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
just like well what the hell it was a

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.410 
just like well what the hell it was a
Mew<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.240> now<00:02:31.020> it's<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.290> ditto<00:02:31.610> my<00:02:32.610> idea<00:02:33.120> for

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
Mew and now it's a ditto my idea for

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.040 
Mew and now it's a ditto my idea for
this<00:02:33.570> is<00:02:34.400> theoretically<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.790> only<00:02:36.510> Pokemon

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
this is theoretically the only Pokemon

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.390 
this is theoretically the only Pokemon
you<00:02:37.200> should<00:02:37.350> be<00:02:37.440> able<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.620> catch<00:02:37.860> with<00:02:38.220> the

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
you should be able to catch with the

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.280 
you should be able to catch with the
move<00:02:38.550> transform<00:02:39.090> at<00:02:39.180> least<00:02:39.330> legitimately<00:02:39.930> is

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
move transform at least legitimately is

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.740 
move transform at least legitimately is
ditto<00:02:40.680> since<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.310> can<00:02:41.459> never<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:42.330> should<00:02:42.570> not

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
ditto since you can never you should not

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.380 
ditto since you can never you should not
be<00:02:42.900> able<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.200> catch<00:02:43.440> Mew<00:02:43.680> in<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:43.890> wild<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.390> my

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
be able to catch Mew in the wild and my

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.470 
be able to catch Mew in the wild and my
theory<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:46.050> this<00:02:46.290> is<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:47.070> game<00:02:47.310> is<00:02:47.610> coded<00:02:48.239> such

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
theory of this is the game is coded such

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.350 
theory of this is the game is coded such
that<00:02:48.780> if<00:02:49.020> you<00:02:49.560> catch<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:50.100> transformed<00:02:50.850> Pokemon

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
that if you catch a transformed Pokemon

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.320 
that if you catch a transformed Pokemon
so<00:02:52.370> anything<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.820> like<00:02:53.970> right<00:02:54.120> here<00:02:54.239> I'm

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
so anything you like right here I'm

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.810 
so anything you like right here I'm
fighting<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.660> Gyarados<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.350> when<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.310> catch<00:02:56.580> it

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
fighting a Gyarados and when I catch it

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.430 
fighting a Gyarados and when I catch it
the<00:02:57.030> game<00:02:57.180> is<00:02:57.300> like<00:02:57.480> oh<00:02:57.630> this<00:02:57.840> is<00:02:57.959> a<00:02:57.989> Gyarados

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
the game is like oh this is a Gyarados

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.110 
the game is like oh this is a Gyarados
but<00:02:58.680> it's<00:02:58.800> not<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:58.980> Gyarados<00:02:59.489> because<00:03:00.000> of

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
but it's not a Gyarados because of

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.199 
but it's not a Gyarados because of
transform<00:03:00.630> it<00:03:00.900> must<00:03:01.200> be<00:03:01.380> ditto<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:01.910> I<00:03:02.910> think

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
transform it must be ditto and I think

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.270 
transform it must be ditto and I think
that<00:03:03.510> is<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.900> logic<00:03:04.260> behind<00:03:04.290> mime<00:03:05.040> you

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
that is the logic behind mime you

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.070 
that is the logic behind mime you
turning<00:03:05.730> into<00:03:05.850> a<00:03:05.940> ditto<00:03:06.180> which<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:06.720> will<00:03:06.870> see

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
turning into a ditto which you will see

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.740 
turning into a ditto which you will see
right<00:03:07.410> here

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
right here

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.509

alright<00:03:09.750> ditto<00:03:10.080> was<00:03:10.380> cause<00:03:10.620> not<00:03:11.160> all<00:03:11.190> right

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
alright ditto was cause not all right

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
actually a ditto you can trade this

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.160 
actually a ditto you can trade this
ditto<00:03:17.700> back<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.239> second<00:03:18.570> gen<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:18.840> it<00:03:18.930> will<00:03:19.049> be

my video on the spoilers in the

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.030 
my video on the spoilers in the
beginning<00:03:27.810> not<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.170> end<00:03:28.350> so<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:28.709> don't<00:03:28.920> waste

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
beginning not the end so you don't waste

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.310 
beginning not the end so you don't waste
your<00:03:29.190> time<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.790> anyway<00:03:30.720> like<00:03:30.900> I<00:03:30.959> said<00:03:30.989> that's

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
your time and anyway like I said that's

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.080 
your time and anyway like I said that's
my<00:03:31.500> theory<00:03:31.890> of<00:03:31.920> why<00:03:32.160> it<00:03:32.220> doesn't<00:03:32.519> work<00:03:32.790> it's

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
my theory of why it doesn't work it's

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.360 
my theory of why it doesn't work it's
because<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:34.200> game<00:03:34.410> has<00:03:34.440> been<00:03:34.799> coded<00:03:35.160> such

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
because the game has been coded such

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.100 
because the game has been coded such
that<00:03:35.579> if<00:03:35.670> you<00:03:35.760> catch<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.150> transformed<00:03:36.690> Pokemon

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
that if you catch a transformed Pokemon

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.650 
that if you catch a transformed Pokemon
it<00:03:37.290> must<00:03:37.530> be<00:03:37.709> a<00:03:37.739> ditto<00:03:38.120> so<00:03:39.120> there<00:03:39.269> you<00:03:39.360> have<00:03:39.540> it

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
it must be a ditto so there you have it

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.630 
it must be a ditto so there you have it
the<00:03:39.900> most<00:03:40.110> disappointing<00:03:40.739> glitch<00:03:40.950> in<00:03:41.190> Pokemon

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
the most disappointing glitch in Pokemon

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.980 
the most disappointing glitch in Pokemon
I<00:03:41.850> hope<00:03:42.120> you<00:03:42.299> enjoyed<00:03:42.630> void<00:03:43.380> 19<00:03:43.769> out
