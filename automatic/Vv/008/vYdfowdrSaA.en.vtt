 that beauty and charm are alone 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:18.029
 a breath is a thrill that the magnificent

 baby rice woman look in the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.760
 mirror glass and many others 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.219
 fantastic things that they just 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.320
 discoveries fade away only the time of a 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.670
 moment only an aroma a breath of 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.239
 wind 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.930
 alas we know it with sadness and this 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.020
 that lasts and remains fixed there is no such thing 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.110
 intimately dear precious stone with 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.980
 frosty fire gold bar of heavy 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:57.480
 splendor the innumerable stars themselves 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:01.320
 they stay away and foreigners do not 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:06.299
 they resemble us ephemeral not 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:09.020
 reach the bottom of the soul no 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.950
 the most profound and worthy of love 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:17.070
 it always seems to be prone to corruption 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:21.180
 close to dying is the most beautiful thing 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.259
 the musical notes that in being born already 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.840
 they run away and spend only sophie 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:31.350
 leakage currents surrounded by quarrels are 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.070
 put of sadness because not even how much 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.860
 lasts a heartbeat you leave 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:43.439
 force to keep note after just note 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:46.860
 beat already vanishes and so does the 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.250
 our heart is consecrated with fraternal 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.220
 loyalty 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:56.190
 to all that flees and flows to life 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:02:00.220
 not to what is firm and able to last 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:03.090
 soon we tire of what remains rocks 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:07.180
 the jewels of a world of stars 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:11.560
 souls wind of wind and soap pushed 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:15.340
 forever change brides of a time without 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.130
 duration for which the dew on a petal 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.160
 rose so a beating of wings 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.700
 of bird the dying of a game of 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:29.080
 rainbow snow glitter clouds 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.180
 butterfly already flown away so it 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.500
 ringing with laughter than passing by 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.510
 it barely touches us can mean party or 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.270
 bring pain 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:44.620
 we love what resembles us and 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:47.160
 we understand what the wind has written 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.160
 on the sand
