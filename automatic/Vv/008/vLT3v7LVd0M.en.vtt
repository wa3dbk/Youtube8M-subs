00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.199
 and we will have four places to go 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.480
 the information pvp das I ask 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.670
 invoice let's start with information 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.830
 since it is necessary and they are very simple 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.050
 the rules that I'm going to practice here 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.120
 do not use hack goes from this already theological 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.570
 do not take advantage of book and insult and in 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.580
 respect not to spam 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.920
 either click and no federal vd 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.049
 neither is nothing nothing of another world 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.629
 as you all know dispute or logic for 

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:52.449
 play well and play between all there is 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:55.570
 you fall like a mind so good 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.909
 let's go to see in the pvp the pvp to 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.080
 here you can say it's in a small 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:03.489
 coliseum in which you can fight and 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.760
 Have fun with other people here if 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.590
 low 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.300
 you will not kill me if you see that all 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.090
 let's go here with the diamond armor 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.980
 it's because it's the armor that they give us 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.990
 start vale is an armor that they give us 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.810
 as a keel, I think there's also 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.280
 x loops or a thing so it's fine 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.810
 but the truth is that it's cool 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.310
 give you all this because then 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.790
 start with a little more 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.490
 security boy is from chicote and more 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.080
 tranquilito good before the fac you have 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.480
 also that I want to show you here the 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.000
 op 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.710
 you are going to get money and once in 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.840
 you can see we have here from 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.850
 all start with all the minerals 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.690
 all colors all types of 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.070
 stone wood sand wool 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.200
 Obsidian different things from bricks 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.760
 and here we have different sites 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.070
 also that they can serve us well 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.840
 for the pvp here different food also 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.280
 good although we also have to 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.430
 principle also gives us different 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.800
 artifacts like reston pistons spencer 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.930
 I know where it stops in cantares lines is 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.730
 very well the truth I did not forget nor 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.820
 a detail here as it is armor 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.320
 diamond more different tools the 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.970
 it's really good if you 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.360
 you want to repair your armor you come here 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.520
 you right click on the little sign and the 90 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.260
 because if I'm not going to spend money I think 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.170
 so then 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.730
 today I will be unrewarded, well, let's go 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.319
 factions is worth if you put some bars for 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.959
 one obviously it will take us three 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.849
 seconds because the web servers 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.650
 have this feature so that 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.230
 you are going to respond to what is 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.390
 kill and well let's show up here this 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.079
 would it be spam is worth here you have 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.329
 the 869 kit if it's the ndr chip you can 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.549
 save here what you want and good is 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.230
 basically this we can come and not go 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.230
 to the site that you want on the side that 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.959
 you want and we'll go down here and we 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.940
 we will go to create a faction worth to 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.319
 all of you who are new where faction 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.760
 I'll show you a little how 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.739
 it works because there are many that do not 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.170
 you will know or I will not look for it because you are like that 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.569
 of bums then good is so easy 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.150
 how to put bar efe is worth and here we go 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.459
 to go out and to a page we are going to put 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.040
 bar health and we will leave then the 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.940
 commands in which we can access 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.389
 efe join and we put the name true of 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.730
 the invoice that we want to go and we go to 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:20.950
 enter not if we want to create an efe 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.850
 create we put you the test name by 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.090
 example 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.310
 I create gives you new fashion test efe es 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.650
 well we can see here to change the 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.390
 different name to invite people 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:36.850
 efe invite and the name you can and then 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.010
 well it's basically is to see I think 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.410
 what was that or to see the power that 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.870
 you have also you power max or orchards 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.300
 of 10 then well you could go watching 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.760
 our faction how it goes if you come here 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.290
 with friends I will certainly do it 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.510
 I will come here with the friends of 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.250
 juanpa web also and we're going to 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.920
 have a good time playing factions against him 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.320
 after agreeing so good nothing 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.810
 apart from this it is very well seriously 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.069
 because he does not have a lot of people he does not have 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.530
 there is nothing of the cval 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.269
 and nothing else all the social networks of 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.129
 server you have them in the description 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.439
 in case you want to pass mine too 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.999
 of course and well I hope that I have 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:16.759
 I hope I have served you already 

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:18.799
 you know he tried to answer the 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:20.599
 comments that are more or less logical 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.750
 within what you ask because 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:25.400
 many are nonsense but well I hope 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.320
 that can help you in any little thing 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.770
 you put it in the comments and until the 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.210
 next 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.210
