00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
this so that's why I picked it up so

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.200 
this so that's why I picked it up so

I don't have a huge like acne issue I've

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.990 
I don't have a huge like acne issue I've
never<00:01:15.780> really<00:01:15.990> had<00:01:16.140> acne<00:01:16.439> but<00:01:16.860> over<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.759> past

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
never really had acne but over the past

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.149 
never really had acne but over the past
couple<00:01:18.299> years<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.780> do<00:01:18.840> have<00:01:19.170> some<00:01:19.380> adult<00:01:19.710> acne<00:01:20.130> I

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
couple years I do have some adult acne I

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.740 
couple years I do have some adult acne I
went<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> dermatologist<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.330> everything

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
went to a dermatologist and everything

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.320 
went to a dermatologist and everything
and<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.229> have<00:01:23.040> some<00:01:23.220> with<00:01:23.340> no<00:01:23.490> acting<00:01:23.909> going<00:01:24.030> on

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
and I have some with no acting going on

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.760 
and I have some with no acting going on
so<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.659> figured<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.140> wouldn't<00:01:25.470> be<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> bad

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
so I figured this wouldn't be a bad

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.880 
so I figured this wouldn't be a bad
thing<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:26.100> try<00:01:26.960> so<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.110> eighth<00:01:28.229> benefit<00:01:28.740> that

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
thing to try so the eighth benefit that

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.450 
thing to try so the eighth benefit that
it<00:01:29.009> claims<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.549> will<00:01:29.700> do<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.900> clear<00:01:31.170> acne

talking about but it kind of feels like
that<00:03:44.440> when<00:03:44.830> you<00:03:44.950> were<00:03:45.040> up<00:03:45.160> it<00:03:45.280> in<00:03:45.480> but<00:03:46.480> it's<00:03:46.630> not

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
that when you were up it in but it's not

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.220 
that when you were up it in but it's not
as<00:03:46.990> liquid<00:03:47.320> so<00:03:48.150> it<00:03:49.150> actually<00:03:49.420> feels<00:03:49.720> really

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
as liquid so it actually feels really

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:57.180 
as liquid so it actually feels really
good<00:03:53.100> alright<00:03:54.100> so<00:03:54.160> that's<00:03:54.490> how<00:03:54.550> it<00:03:54.820> looks<00:03:56.190> the

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
good alright so that's how it looks the

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.390 
good alright so that's how it looks the
color<00:03:57.459> might<00:03:58.300> be<00:03:58.720> slightly<00:03:59.260> too<00:03:59.650> dark<00:04:00.100> for<00:04:00.160> me

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
color might be slightly too dark for me

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.060 
color might be slightly too dark for me
I'm<00:04:00.489> not<00:04:00.640> sure<00:04:00.989> this<00:04:01.989> is<00:04:02.200> the<00:04:02.230> darkest<00:04:02.860> shade

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
I'm not sure this is the darkest shade

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.550 
I'm not sure this is the darkest shade
they<00:04:03.280> have<00:04:03.519> but<00:04:04.000> I<00:04:04.239> thought<00:04:05.140> this<00:04:05.290> would<00:04:05.440> be

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
they have but I thought this would be

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.110 
they have but I thought this would be
the<00:04:05.680> one<00:04:05.860> to<00:04:05.890> match<00:04:06.220> but<00:04:06.489> now<00:04:06.610> I'm<00:04:06.820> kind<00:04:07.090> of

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
the one to match but now I'm kind of

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.970 
the one to match but now I'm kind of
looking<00:04:07.239> in<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:07.540> in<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:08.230> viewfinder<00:04:08.470> I<00:04:08.800> think

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
looking in the in the viewfinder I think

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.460 
looking in the in the viewfinder I think
it's<00:04:09.100> a<00:04:09.190> little<00:04:09.430> dark<00:04:09.640> on<00:04:09.850> me<00:04:10.030> so<00:04:10.290> we'll<00:04:11.290> see

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
it's a little dark on me so we'll see

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.990 
it's a little dark on me so we'll see
I'm<00:04:11.830> going<00:04:12.010> to<00:04:12.040> go<00:04:12.100> ahead<00:04:12.220> and<00:04:12.459> do<00:04:12.580> the<00:04:12.700> rest<00:04:12.820> of

I'm going to go ahead and do the rest of
my<00:04:13.090> makeup<00:04:13.239> and<00:04:13.690> I'll<00:04:13.840> be<00:04:13.989> back<00:04:14.140> in<00:04:14.290> a<00:04:14.350> few<00:04:15.840> okay

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230

highlighter I didn't put on any bronzer
today<00:04:31.780> just<00:04:32.020> because<00:04:32.290> I<00:04:32.350> think<00:04:32.410> this

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
today just because I think this

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.770 
today just because I think this
foundation<00:04:33.220> may<00:04:33.310> be<00:04:33.370> slightly<00:04:33.940> dark<00:04:34.419> on<00:04:34.630> me

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
foundation may be slightly dark on me

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.290 
foundation may be slightly dark on me
and<00:04:35.169> I<00:04:35.440> didn't<00:04:35.740> want<00:04:35.950> to<00:04:36.070> make<00:04:36.580> it<00:04:36.729> look<00:04:36.970> you

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
and I didn't want to make it look you

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.900 
and I didn't want to make it look you
know<00:04:37.510> unnatural<00:04:38.169> so<00:04:38.400> this<00:04:39.400> is<00:04:39.550> what<00:04:39.669> it<00:04:39.760> looks

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
know unnatural so this is what it looks

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.659 
know unnatural so this is what it looks
like<00:04:39.970> so<00:04:40.210> far<00:04:40.240> as<00:04:41.050> I<00:04:41.290> was<00:04:41.440> you<00:04:42.070> putting<00:04:42.460> on<00:04:42.580> the

pretty pleased it looks really natural

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.730 
pretty pleased it looks really natural

accentuate<00:04:56.380> dry<00:04:56.680> patches<00:04:57.010> just<00:04:57.190> because<00:04:57.670> may

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
really like the way it looks and it

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.260 
really like the way it looks and it
feels<00:05:14.530> pretty<00:05:14.680> good<00:05:14.950> it<00:05:15.400> when<00:05:15.790> I<00:05:15.820> touch<00:05:16.090> my

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
feels pretty good it when I touch my

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.600 
feels pretty good it when I touch my
face<00:05:16.480> that<00:05:16.660> kind<00:05:16.840> of<00:05:16.900> feels<00:05:17.140> like<00:05:17.350> a<00:05:17.490> time<00:05:18.490> on

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
face that kind of feels like a time on

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.730 
face that kind of feels like a time on
moisturizer<00:05:19.180> but<00:05:20.020> it<00:05:20.110> doesn't<00:05:20.380> feel<00:05:20.470> greasy

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
moisturizer but it doesn't feel greasy

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.830 
moisturizer but it doesn't feel greasy
at<00:05:20.980> all<00:05:21.070> or<00:05:22.000> anything<00:05:22.180> like<00:05:22.420> that<00:05:22.480> I<00:05:22.660> don't

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
at all or anything like that I don't

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.630 
at all or anything like that I don't
think<00:05:23.170> I<00:05:23.350> need<00:05:23.410> to<00:05:23.620> set<00:05:23.920> it<00:05:23.950> if<00:05:24.190> you<00:05:24.280> have<00:05:24.460> all

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
think I need to set it if you have all

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.610 
think I need to set it if you have all
their<00:05:24.850> skin<00:05:25.210> you<00:05:25.420> know<00:05:25.540> you<00:05:26.080> might<00:05:26.320> want<00:05:26.560> to

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
their skin you know you might want to

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.080 
their skin you know you might want to
set<00:05:26.860> it<00:05:26.980> but<00:05:27.250> so<00:05:28.150> far<00:05:28.420> I<00:05:28.840> pretty<00:05:29.410> much<00:05:29.590> like<00:05:29.800> it

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
set it but so far I pretty much like it

seven<00:06:35.460> hours<00:06:35.880> now<00:06:35.910> I<00:06:36.150> believe<00:06:36.600> or<00:06:37.350> 7<00:06:37.740> a<00:06:37.800> half

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.040 
seven hours now I believe or 7 a half

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.940 
seven hours now I believe or 7 a half
hours<00:06:38.430> and<00:06:39.150> I<00:06:39.990> think<00:06:40.260> it's<00:06:40.410> the<00:06:40.560> old<00:06:40.710> print

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:40.950 
hours and I think it's the old print

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.370 
hours and I think it's the old print
looks<00:06:41.310> pretty<00:06:41.640> good<00:06:41.910> I'm<00:06:42.570> a<00:06:42.630> little<00:06:42.990> bit<00:06:43.080> shiny

looks pretty good I'm a little bit shiny
here<00:06:43.950> and<00:06:44.160> in<00:06:44.430> my<00:06:44.550> t-zone<00:06:45.260> but<00:06:46.260> that's

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 
here and in my t-zone but that's

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.950 
here and in my t-zone but that's
completely<00:06:46.800> normal<00:06:47.580> so<00:06:47.790> for<00:06:48.300> a<00:06:48.330> BB<00:06:48.660> cream<00:06:48.930> I

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
completely normal so for a BB cream I

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.750 
completely normal so for a BB cream I
think<00:06:49.170> this<00:06:49.530> held<00:06:49.770> up<00:06:49.860> pretty<00:06:49.980> well<00:06:50.160> my<00:06:50.520> blush

it<00:07:30.440> as<00:07:30.590> of<00:07:30.740> right<00:07:30.949> now<00:07:31.150> if<00:07:32.150> something<00:07:32.870> changes

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:33.229 
it as of right now if something changes

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:34.480 
it as of right now if something changes
for<00:07:33.410> the<00:07:33.470> next<00:07:33.740> few<00:07:33.889> weeks<00:07:33.949> I<00:07:34.340> would

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:34.490 
for the next few weeks I would

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.950 
for the next few weeks I would
definitely<00:07:34.820> let<00:07:34.880> you<00:07:35.030> know<00:07:35.210> but<00:07:35.479> I<00:07:35.539> think<00:07:35.660> it's

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:35.960 
definitely let you know but I think it's

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.810 
definitely let you know but I think it's
a<00:07:36.080> good<00:07:36.259> product<00:07:36.680> for<00:07:36.710> pretty<00:07:37.130> much<00:07:37.220> all<00:07:37.580> skin

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:37.820 
a good product for pretty much all skin

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.999 
a good product for pretty much all skin
types<00:07:38.090> because<00:07:38.419> like<00:07:38.599> I<00:07:38.720> said<00:07:38.780> earlier<00:07:39.650> I<00:07:39.770> do

00:07:39.999 --> 00:07:40.009 
types because like I said earlier I do

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:43.450 
types because like I said earlier I do
not<00:07:40.310> have<00:07:40.610> necessarily<00:07:41.479> oily<00:07:42.380> skin<00:07:42.710> but<00:07:43.430> I

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:43.460 
not have necessarily oily skin but I

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.820 
not have necessarily oily skin but I
have<00:07:43.729> a<00:07:43.759> fully<00:07:44.180> t-zone<00:07:44.690> and<00:07:45.020> dry<00:07:45.169> cheeks<00:07:45.530> and

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:45.830 
have a fully t-zone and dry cheeks and

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.589 
have a fully t-zone and dry cheeks and
it<00:07:46.039> helped<00:07:46.580> to<00:07:46.669> kind<00:07:46.820> of<00:07:46.910> even<00:07:47.120> out<00:07:47.330> both<00:07:47.570> of

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 
it helped to kind of even out both of

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:49.540 
it helped to kind of even out both of
them<00:07:47.930> and<00:07:48.560> I<00:07:48.650> think<00:07:48.860> the<00:07:48.919> coverage<00:07:49.250> is<00:07:49.400> really

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:49.550 
them and I think the coverage is really

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.070 
them and I think the coverage is really
light<00:07:49.880> and<00:07:50.030> natural<00:07:50.210> which<00:07:50.599> is<00:07:50.630> what<00:07:50.900> I<00:07:50.930> was
