00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.270
 ah 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.730
 she 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.799
 hello friends welcome to a new video 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.049
 and in this we are going to talk about the 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:15.049
 differences that photoshop and site have 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.920
 Many have asked me why sometimes 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.810
 I use one and because sometimes I use the other and 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.550
 well this is because each one of them 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.290
 It has qualities but it also has 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.880
 some deficiencies but also 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.470
 It depends a lot on your ability that you have 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.470
 to be able to use each program 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.290
 photoshop photoshop was originally 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.940
 created to avoid photographs with the 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.950
 time has been adapting so that 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.780
 artists can create illustrations with 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.060
 finishes very similar to the techniques 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.060
 traditional oils such as acrylics 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.620
 that's the way it is with photoshop you can create 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.200
 finishes very similar to the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.780
 traditional techniques but you have to 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.820
 use methods to get it some of 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.550
 they are for example using brushes with 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.520
 texture make selections create circles 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.710
 create vectors use photographs and 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.450
 edited I could say that the process 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.369
 is closer to the artificial than to the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.410
 natural although the results always 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.190
 they liked it and I think in the end you see 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.190
 very cool 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.500
 you will say bon what do you mean by that 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.750
 that the result is like very 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.490
 artificial good I'm going to put a 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.710
 example more or less for you to understand 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.540
 what is photoshop is like if you were 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.149
 to the store you will buy a canned game 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.369
 I'll take it if you said oh and how rich 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.830
 taste the result was very good indeed 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.899
 but behind this juice there is a process 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.270
 chemical there are machines there are people 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.399
 working and does not exactly have to 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.860
 see with the natural orange trees 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:58.140
 apples and the result is something like that 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.140
 It's not natural but it tastes good 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.050
 in it you can find many 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.640
 effects the most used is the blur 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.870
 You can also find the effect of 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.420
 liquify that is what allows us 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.739
 distort any image you know that 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.750
 effect that is used to make 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.819
 fatter or skinnier people have 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.310
 many layer styles the layers 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.319
 focused on lighting the shadows 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.209
 and to different effects that we can create 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.770
 simply with applying an effect of 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.590
 layer most used before people who 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.720
 we are dedicated to drawing with line art es 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.819
 the effect of multiplying you can also 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.430
 create perfect circles triangles 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:41.110
 figures or at the end of the day you can 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.110
 create anything with photoshop 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.040
 that's why the most used program 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.590
 by people who are dedicated to 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.489
 illustration to conceptual art and to 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.489
 photo edition 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.290
 the negative points are that if you 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.170
 you started to draw traditionally with 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.900
 oil with watercolors with acrylic good the 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.239
 process is very very different I could 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.310
 say that totally opposite because 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.829
 when you use oil paintings you can feel how 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.010
 combine the colors with the brush using 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.450
 the oil using turpentine and the smell of 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.260
 the painting obviously as it is a 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.599
 digital program 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.790
 all that is lost so if you are looking for a 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.340
 program that tries to copy more 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.989
 faithfully that painting process I'll 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.519
 I would recommend that you use the choir 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.349
 different but you have to be a 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.030
 person who knows a lot about 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.319
 traditional techniques to understand 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.510
 all that has that 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.239
 program I used it but when I met 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.389
 in tulsa and I definitely changed to 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.389
 the 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.420
 26 or as many know it only is 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.330
 There is a program created in Japan 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.010
 specifically and only to draw or 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.900
 if you want to retouch images 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.520
 in that program it's going to be a little bit more 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.440
 difficult but you can also in 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.450
 comparison with photoshop the process in 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.890
 salt is a little more natural what we 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.720
 lets enjoy when we perform 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.370
 our illustrations a little bit more 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.030
 attached to what a technique is 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.030
 traditional 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.580
 It also has different effects 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.260
 but only the most basic can you 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.630
 change the color you can change the 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.579
 contrast of lighting but never 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.959
 you could make a blur because that 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.959
 does not exist in paint usa 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.270
 You can also create your own 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.250
 brushes apply textures and use some 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.990
 layer effects but I must be honest in 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.879
 everything I mentioned about photoshop is 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.830
 much better then what are the 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:38.539
 qualities that this program has good 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.099
 maybe only by using them can you 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:42.470
 account for the differences but what 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:44.539
 that I can share with you is that on site 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.580
 you feel a little bit of the feeling that 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.530
 you have like when you paint in oil or 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.479
 acrylic something you can do is 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.129
 combine the colors and the result is 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.810
 very similar to what happens in the 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:55.310
 traditional techniques and this in 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.379
 photoshop does not happen 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.500
 you could create that effect by applying a 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:03.639
 process but it's never going to be like 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.639
 can create on site 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.300
 if it has a very simple interface and 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.040
 intuitive that makes it very easy to 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.050
 handle it if you only want to 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.120
 create an illustration to dedicate a 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.490
 time and observe how the colors are 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.450
 they are definitely combining this 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.450
 program is for you 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:32.499
 It is widely used by artists who are dedicated 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:33.669
 to manga also to illustrations though 

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:35.860
 sometimes I realized that they can 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:38.289
 alternate between both and that's what I 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.599
 I do sometimes 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:42.909
 a negative point in paint side is that 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:45.039
 your color circle is very small already 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:46.930
 Sometimes it's a bit complex to choose the 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:48.520
 color that exactly you want to use and 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.409
 this in photoshop does not happen because 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.719
 there are several applications that you can 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:55.449
 install in the program and this improves 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:57.430
 very much one of them is the color that 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:59.499
 allows you to choose between a circle of 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.479
 color that has a box or a triangle 

00:05:59.499 --> 00:06:04.229
 and you can modify the size and that's 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:04.229
 a big advantage 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:11.610
 I hope that in future updates 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.919
 of paint usaid can correct that 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.599
 in conclusion if you asked me 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:17.759
 the program I should choose I would tell you that 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:19.740
 both although if your computer is not very 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:21.659
 powerful photoshop requires a lot of 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.669
 system instead paint tools are there in 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:25.969
 any computer can run very 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:25.969
 all right 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.370
 so at the end of the day you have the 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.540
 decision and choose which program to use 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.830
 depending on the results that 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.830
 you want to get clear truth 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.310
 I hope you give an opportunity to 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.620
 both programs and you decide at the end 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.540
 which of the two suits you and I tell you 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.970
 that the tutorial to draw hands and 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.120
 is in process and will be very very 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.120
 all right 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.680
 thanks for all comments 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.440
 thanks for all the messages I read them 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.780
 all remember to like the page 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:03.560
 of facebook that is facebook.com diagonal 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:05.240
 it's animation is twitter is leo mx table and 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.690
 we are seeing each other for the next 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.690
 video
