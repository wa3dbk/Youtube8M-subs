00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:15.740
 what a chocolate atole looks like 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.360
 remember what the mushroom atole 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.250
 I hear many comments that said 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:25.680
 That's not the way it goes with milk chocolate 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.770
 is that of milk is another way the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.009
 champurrado so they showed it to me with 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.710
 water and with dough and for you that 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.690
 they want the chocolate one, we're going to 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.820
 do it with milk that I have here 2 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:45.200
 liters of milk the cornstarch 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:48.100
 cornstarch corn starch between 4 and 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.710
 5 tablespoons of that starch 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.110
 cinnamon I'm going to put two tablets 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.430
 chocolate chocolate is the brand 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.570
 what you want 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.340
 we're going to need a little bit of blue 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.850
 sugar because the chocolate of postin already 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.250
 it comes very sweet and good milk in this 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.190
 I have the pot and 2 liters of milk the 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.159
 I put it to boil I'll add it once 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.170
 what is cinnamon 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:18.880
 and at once I will add 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.880
 the chocolate tablets 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.270
 Hello 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.369
 and 2 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.280
 if you think it's a lot or 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.159
 chocolate you can put a tablet and 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.359
 mean these tablets are of 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.359
 90 degree 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.189
 and we are going to be removing from time to time 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.680
 dissolve corn starch 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.870
 If you want to dissolve it with water, you can 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.890
 do I use a little milk 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:55.390
 and we are going to add them 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.720
 5 between 4 and 5 tablespoons of this starch 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.720
 of corn 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.439
 I say approximately 2 liters of 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.350
 milk you can add a larger quantity 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.959
 or less 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.750
 well I'm going to dissolve my side well 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.760
 chocolate has already dissolved very well and 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.980
 look at this is boiling if you 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.940
 they want to leave their chocolate so they can 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.380
 just do sweeten and ready 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.100
 now the cornstarch that is already well 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.100
 dissolved 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.959
 let's add 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.959
 to prose 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.730
 and we are going to move 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.610
 so that we are not going to stick 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.390
 if you want to move him with a shovel 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.030
 wood or with spoon can do it now 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.420
 it is everyone's decision to place access 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.760
 to all good I will continue to move and 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.710
 wait for the atole to boil 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.910
 already let the boil 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:02.569
 and began to thicken and remember you 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.689
 they decide how thick they want it 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:08.090
 and I'm not going to sweeten it I just 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:11.650
 try and for the two tablets of 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.650
 chocolate was sweet 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.920
 well now I'll wait between three 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:20.310
 minutes or four to which it continues boiling 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.189
 to turn it off and it's time to turn it off 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.040
 We give our actor chocolate him here 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:28.889

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.189

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:35.040

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:39.319

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:43.040

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.420
