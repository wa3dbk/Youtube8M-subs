00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
and how much power you can put out but

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:51.990 
and how much power you can put out but
it's<00:00:51.050> how<00:00:51.140> you<00:00:51.199> deploy<00:00:51.410> those<00:00:51.829> resources

people than others but regardless of

people than others but regardless of
that<00:02:08.410> fact<00:02:08.770> it's<00:02:09.429> always<00:02:09.850> worth<00:02:10.090> trying<00:02:10.300> to

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:10.480 
that fact it's always worth trying to

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.930 
that fact it's always worth trying to
train<00:02:10.780> it<00:02:10.960> if<00:02:11.710> you're<00:02:12.100> competitive<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:12.910> you

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
train it if you're competitive and you

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.690 
train it if you're competitive and you
want<00:02:13.570> to<00:02:13.660> be<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.840> first<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.230> top<00:02:14.500> so<00:02:15.490> good

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
want to be the first to the top so good

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.420 
want to be the first to the top so good
second<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.900> ride<00:02:17.080> at<00:02:17.260> threshold<00:02:17.500> then

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
second you to ride at threshold then

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.820 
second you to ride at threshold then
sprint<00:02:18.940> out<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.300> saddle<00:02:19.690> for<00:02:19.840> 20<00:02:20.380> seconds

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
sprint out the saddle for 20 seconds

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.000 
sprint out the saddle for 20 seconds
then<00:02:21.610> back<00:02:21.850> to<00:02:22.030> threshold<00:02:22.270> for<00:02:22.570> 40<00:02:23.020> and<00:02:23.230> then

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
then back to threshold for 40 and then

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.980 
then back to threshold for 40 and then
repeat<00:02:24.910> all<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.900> way<00:02:25.990> up<00:02:26.080> a<00:02:26.200> climb

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.740 

so<00:02:29.560> how<00:02:30.160> much<00:02:30.340> of<00:02:30.460> an<00:02:30.550> effect<00:02:30.750> aerodynamics

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
so how much of an effect aerodynamics

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.510 
so how much of an effect aerodynamics
actually<00:02:32.320> make<00:02:32.500> when<00:02:32.740> climbing<00:02:33.190> well

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
actually make when climbing well

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.240 
actually make when climbing well
supposedly<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.930> positive<00:02:35.410> effect<00:02:35.710> of<00:02:35.890> a

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
supposedly the positive effect of a

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
specific aerodynamic bike can still be

the type of climbing that you want to

it's a pretty extreme it's actually

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.490 
it's a pretty extreme it's actually

but a minute is still a minute and your

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.260 
but a minute is still a minute and your

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
light bike is also going to feel

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.210 
light bike is also going to feel

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
significantly nicer and make you feel

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.400 
significantly nicer and make you feel
faster<00:03:40.060> so<00:03:40.210> if<00:03:40.300> you've<00:03:40.390> got<00:03:40.570> the<00:03:40.720> cash<00:03:40.750> and

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
faster so if you've got the cash and

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.560 
faster so if you've got the cash and
it's<00:03:41.590> absolutely<00:03:41.920> still<00:03:42.460> worth<00:03:42.610> doing<00:03:42.910> it<00:03:43.060> but

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
it's absolutely still worth doing it but

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.420 
it's absolutely still worth doing it but
if<00:03:43.780> you<00:03:43.870> don't<00:03:44.080> have<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.380> cash<00:03:44.590> and<00:03:44.770> having<00:03:45.370> a

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
if you don't have the cash and having a

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.250 
if you don't have the cash and having a
heavier<00:03:45.730> bike<00:03:45.940> is<00:03:46.420> not<00:03:46.720> going<00:03:46.870> to<00:03:46.930> stand<00:03:47.170> in

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
heavier bike is not going to stand in

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.750 
heavier bike is not going to stand in
the<00:03:47.380> way<00:03:47.500> of<00:03:47.530> you<00:03:47.920> achieving<00:03:47.950> your<00:03:48.520> full

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
the way of you achieving your full

the way of you achieving your full

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.470 

so<00:03:58.900> that's<00:03:59.080> physical<00:03:59.709> and<00:04:00.190> technical<00:04:00.610> what

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
so that's physical and technical what

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.809

little<00:04:31.540> bit<00:04:31.750> I<00:04:32.020> think<00:04:32.440> we've<00:04:32.530> all<00:04:32.650> done<00:04:32.830> that

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090

the<00:04:34.090> question<00:04:34.450> is<00:04:34.570> though<00:04:34.780> can<00:04:35.740> you<00:04:36.010> improve

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
the question is though can you improve

your rev limiter to release a bit more

your rev limiter to release a bit more
potential<00:04:40.000> and<00:04:40.240> is<00:04:40.780> your<00:04:40.960> rev<00:04:41.139> limiter<00:04:41.590> set

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
nothing concrete you can do so that's

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.370 
nothing concrete you can do so that's
one<00:04:47.889> of<00:04:47.919> the<00:04:48.040> reasons<00:04:48.450> why<00:04:49.450> we<00:04:49.600> do<00:04:49.720> super<00:04:50.169> hard

one of the reasons why we do super hard
brutal<00:04:51.370> intervals<00:04:51.790> is<00:04:52.540> to<00:04:52.720> try<00:04:52.900> and<00:04:52.990> improve

something<00:05:10.330> that<00:05:10.510> I<00:05:10.539> think<00:05:10.630> all<00:05:10.870> of<00:05:10.900> us<00:05:11.050> do<00:05:11.260> I

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
something that I think all of us do I

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.340 
something that I think all of us do I
know<00:05:12.010> I'm<00:05:12.310> selling<00:05:12.610> guilty<00:05:13.000> of<00:05:13.060> it<00:05:13.240> so<00:05:14.050> to<00:05:14.110> get

improve that over time if you don't then

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
that help make it more effective just

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.810 
that help make it more effective just
remember<00:05:44.200> though<00:05:44.320> that<00:05:44.560> actually<00:05:45.220> this<00:05:45.580> is

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
remember though that actually this is
