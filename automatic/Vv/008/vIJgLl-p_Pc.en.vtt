00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.519
 Tablets are known to be the last 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.099
 shout when it comes to mobile computing 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.630
 applies what with the devices, however 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.179
 does not work is the play 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.760
 the spÃ¶ wants now racer with the s 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.699
 Jump the tablet happens 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.020
 Ultrabook hardware that in a good one 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.380
 two centimeters thick housing 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.539
 Accommodate that makes it twice as good 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.289
 thick as the most current sets 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.850
 on arm partner happen 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:36.300
 on the bottom who else recognize 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.129
 two more speakers and a docking 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.960
 Connection so that the device is loaded 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.800
 or extended by a docking station 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.320
 can be 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.309
 most of the controls are located 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.969
 on the top 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.350
 there is the powerknopf on the one hand 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.710
 also a button to call or 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.969
 keyboard here is also a button 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.760
 to determine the alignment and here 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.770
 on the left you will find the buttons to fix 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.210
 the volume 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.640
 the device has one more here 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.070
 single usb 3 connection if you have it 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.200
 So want to operate with massive 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.450
 you need a usb hub or 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.890
 the docking station is the race pro 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.210
 one of the last of the string 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.270
 Vents possesses that we found 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.860
 even at the service point and the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.380
 According to estimates , this is in the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.390
 housing the gpu and here the cpu or 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.070
 the device on this page clearly 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.020
 gets warmer 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.450
 the device corresponds to its construction one 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.869
 10.1 inch tablet but a rather 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.060
 heavy 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.020
 without any accessories weighs the device 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.970
 good 950 grams 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.920
 Windows 8 comes in as an operating system 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.229
 the new position for use 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.270
 on the metro area this can be 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.770
 good service 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.030
 something easier works, however, is on 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.340
 the desktop surface 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.790
 because the individual switching elements on the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.170
 10 inch display pretty classes 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:07.110
 The display itself has a resolution 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:13.020
 of 1366 x 768 pixels 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.910
 and as cpu comes to a core i7 35 17 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.210
 commitment 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.050
 the device also has a good ddr3 1600 here 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.130
 watts installed 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.810
 the graphics chip is a geforce gtx 640 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.800
 a lte to use 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.420
 The race has a typical character 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.950
 Ultrabook hardware which it is 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.040
 reasonably good for playing 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.420
 Here we have a short crysis warhead 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.860
 started on the match 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.860
 Here you can already see the biggest 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.500
 problem of the tablet as good as no 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.020
 windows game is really for that 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.850
 tablet is optimized and can be there 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.010
 that's why it came with it 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.760
 remedy here provides the controller 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:58.830
 but that you insert the edge and that 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.230
 a controller simulated with this 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.750
 then the game can be controlled 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.280
 where you stop with 3d shooters 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.180
 Gamepad usual problem of 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.180
 has inaccuracy 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.920
 as soon as you get something with the device 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.730
 You can hear the air immediately 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.970
 high turns this is located here 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.319
 probably for the frequency and 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.620
 under full load we have one here 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.980
 volume of up to 118 measured with it 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.880
 the match is not just that 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.319
 most powerful but probably that too 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.319
 loudest remains on the market 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.200
 for that it results a whole row 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.650
 accessories razer has us to the pattern 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.290
 this docking station with this sent 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.840
 serves to plug in the device above 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.160
 and offers one on the back 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.530
 variety of connections 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.660
 This can also be, for example 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.590
 Mars and that too without problems at the 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.140
 operate device 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.330
 the most famous accessory piece is probably 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.360
 this controller was printing this 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.220
 already shown at the fair and serves 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.400
 to do the research with a gamepad 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:20.600
 equip the tray by doing so 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.820
 the middle and in which you put it 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:28.420
 pushes in on the bottom and 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:30.830
 this latch is fastened that the 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.760
 Control pressure and you can do it 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.950
 also very stable 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.140
 to use the game as already said 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.070
 the money logs in as a gamepad 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.530
 match 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.680
 Here you have a control cross two analog 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.540
 Sticks and gives us up 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.090
 partner of the functionality 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.030
 that's the principle in that 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:53.030
 halloween xbox 360 changed since the device 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.280
 only an extra keyboard and offers 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.890
 Game new controller is providing 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.890
 the device does not play all pc 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:03.020
 games work best 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.900
 with jump n runs or racing games 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.580
 3d shooter works less well during 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.690
 Strategy games and actually so good 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.760
 how we play 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.640
 what is there to the racer as a spray 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.650
 Actually it's definitely that 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.470
 most powerful there is in the market 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.660
 but also one of the most expensive around 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.660
 You also get 1200 dollars as well 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.160
 powerful ultrabook as well 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.440
 not cheap is the sick that is 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.220
 controller but this suggests 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.980
 currently about 250 dollars to book 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.990
 the docking station to set up the 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.720
 The device costs a good 100 dollars 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.550
 because you absolutely need pc as well 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.460
 games on the tablet is wanting to play 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.529
 that the research is definitely in the 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.839
 to make a narrower choice 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:49.469
 for all others, but also enough 

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:49.469
 normal tablet
