00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.490 
me a subject matter the Civil War
alright<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.179> if<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.360> say<00:00:15.570> Civil<00:00:16.020> War<00:00:16.230> well

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
alright so if you say Civil War well

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.320 
alright so if you say Civil War well
let's<00:00:16.650> think<00:00:16.710> about<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.490> uniforms<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.210> they

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
let's think about the uniforms that they

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.390 
let's think about the uniforms that they
were<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:19.199> weight<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.680> badges<00:00:20.189> were

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
were the weight of the badges were

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.890 
were the weight of the badges were
things<00:00:20.760> like<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.119> maybe<00:00:21.390> we<00:00:21.600> can<00:00:21.750> take

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
things like that maybe we can take

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.650 
things like that maybe we can take
pieces<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.789> utilize<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.359> the

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
pieces of that utilize that and the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.870 
pieces of that utilize that and the
Wardrobe<00:00:25.350> would<00:00:25.529> say<00:00:25.800> or<00:00:26.039> if<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.609> think<00:00:26.820> about

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
Wardrobe would say or if you think about

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.560 
Wardrobe would say or if you think about
it<00:00:27.060> think<00:00:27.689> about<00:00:28.580> modernizing<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:30.449> we

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
it think about modernizing that so we

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.870 
it think about modernizing that so we
basically<00:00:30.720> take<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:32.450> concept<00:00:33.450> or<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:34.760> let's<00:00:35.760> say

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
basically take a concept or a let's say

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.049 
basically take a concept or a let's say
for<00:00:36.239> example<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.899> ocean<00:00:37.320> at<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.770> ocean<00:00:38.309> take

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
for example the ocean at the ocean take

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.510 
for example the ocean at the ocean take
corals<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.079> sea<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.649> what<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.950> see<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.370> that

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
corals and sea and what you see in that

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.240 
corals and sea and what you see in that
and<00:00:41.760> try<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:41.969> create<00:00:42.270> shapes<00:00:42.660> out<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:42.930> that

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
and try to create shapes out of that

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.840 
and try to create shapes out of that
there<00:00:44.250> was<00:00:44.370> an<00:00:44.579> individual<00:00:45.210> by<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.390> name<00:00:45.510> of

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
there was an individual by the name of

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.170 
there was an individual by the name of
Eugene<00:00:47.850> Angelo<00:00:48.750> seminar<00:00:49.200> great<00:00:49.920> great<00:00:50.309> source

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
Eugene Angelo seminar great great source

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.720 
Eugene Angelo seminar great great source
of<00:00:51.449> inspiration<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.559> he<00:00:53.160> was<00:00:53.309> talking<00:00:53.670> about

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
of inspiration and he was talking about

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.760 
of inspiration and he was talking about
how<00:00:54.059> he<00:00:54.120> was<00:00:54.629> able<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.020> take<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> look<00:00:55.500> at<00:00:55.620> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
how he was able to take a look at the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.069 
how he was able to take a look at the
ocean<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.340> see<00:00:57.120> cuz<00:00:57.360> he<00:00:57.449> writes<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.780> scuba

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
ocean and see cuz he writes to scuba

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.290 
ocean and see cuz he writes to scuba
dive<00:00:58.109> we've<00:00:58.949> seen<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.309> corals<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.059> things

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
dive we've seen the corals and things

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.970 
dive we've seen the corals and things
like<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.539> if<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.410> look<00:01:01.590> at<00:01:01.710> his<00:01:01.800> last

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
like that if you look at his last

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.030 
like that if you look at his last
collection<00:01:02.309> he<00:01:02.640> actually<00:01:03.049> twisted<00:01:04.049> extension

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
collection he actually twisted extension

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.280 
collection he actually twisted extension
so<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.369> actually<00:01:06.090> looks<00:01:06.600> like<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.080> with

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
so it actually looks like that with

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.289 
so it actually looks like that with
different<00:01:07.619> types<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.920> colors<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:09.090> it's<00:01:09.210> all

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
different types of colors so it's all

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.000 
different types of colors so it's all
about<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.869> could<00:01:10.020> take<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.260> from<00:01:10.409> nature<00:01:10.740> you

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
about you could take it from nature you

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.649 
about you could take it from nature you
can<00:01:11.130> take<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.400> from<00:01:11.430> fashion<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.390> take<00:01:12.540> it

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
can take it from fashion you can take it

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.960 
can take it from fashion you can take it
from<00:01:12.689> music<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.350> tend<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.950> lend<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.490> little<00:01:14.850> bit

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
from music I tend to lend a little bit

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.109 
from music I tend to lend a little bit
more<00:01:15.150> towards<00:01:15.450> fashion<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.830> for<00:01:17.189> example<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
more towards fashion so for example the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.760 
more towards fashion so for example the
collection<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:18.930> did<00:01:19.140> called<00:01:19.380> cutouts

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
collection that I did called cutouts

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.910 
collection that I did called cutouts
that<00:01:20.450> came<00:01:21.450> from<00:01:21.810> looking<00:01:22.290> at<00:01:22.350> fashion<00:01:22.830> and

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
that came from looking at fashion and

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.170 
that came from looking at fashion and
how<00:01:23.040> they<00:01:23.250> were<00:01:23.310> actually<00:01:23.549> cutting<00:01:24.000> out

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
how they were actually cutting out

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.840 
how they were actually cutting out
pieces<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.380> fabric<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.070> actually<00:01:26.520> using<00:01:26.670> it

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
pieces of fabric and actually using it

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.010 
pieces of fabric and actually using it
in<00:01:26.939> wardrobe<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.659> might<00:01:27.840> have<00:01:27.960> a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
in wardrobe so you might have a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.469 
in wardrobe so you might have a
diamond-shaped<00:01:28.530> cut<00:01:29.009> out<00:01:29.189> or<00:01:29.549> triangle<00:01:30.240> shape

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
diamond-shaped cut out or triangle shape

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.480 
diamond-shaped cut out or triangle shape
cut<00:01:30.689> out<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.380> if<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.530> take<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.710> look<00:01:31.920> at<00:01:31.979> cutouts

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
cut out so if you take a look at cutouts

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.100 
cut out so if you take a look at cutouts
that<00:01:32.729> collection<00:01:33.360> was<00:01:33.450> all<00:01:33.630> about<00:01:33.900> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
that collection was all about the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.960 
that collection was all about the
concept<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.650> just<00:01:35.189> cutting<00:01:35.369> out<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.670> certain

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
concept of just cutting out in certain

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.030 
concept of just cutting out in certain
areas<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.509> certain<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.829> get

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
areas and certain so that you get

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.850 
areas and certain so that you get
different<00:01:38.369> types<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.820> silhouettes<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:40.590> that's

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
different types of silhouettes so that's

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.109 
different types of silhouettes so that's
where<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.130> comes<00:01:41.250> from<00:01:41.430> it's<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.820> matter<00:01:41.970> of

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
where it comes from it's a matter of

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.179 
where it comes from it's a matter of
just<00:01:42.240> thinking

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
just thinking

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.249 
just thinking
you<00:01:44.189> know<00:01:44.340> not<00:01:44.579> necessarily<00:01:44.759> looking<00:01:45.509> at<00:01:45.689> hair

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
you know not necessarily looking at hair

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.630 
you know not necessarily looking at hair
pictures<00:01:46.770> for<00:01:47.009> sister<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:48.259> sense<00:01:49.259> of

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
pictures for sister a sense of

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.160
