Hi everyone, welcome to this episode of Amanda Tastes. Today we are going to make a very easy scallop dish, that is the bacon and scallop roll. First, let me go over the ingredients.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The main ingredients are bacon and scallop, and you also need toothpicks as a tool to secure the shape. You will need olive oil, butter, chives, garlic and black pepper to taste as we'll.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The side dish will be a quick salad. Besides some spinach and racket mix, you will need some toasted pine nuts, a little balsamic vinegar, olive oil, honey,salt and black pepper. And we will make a simple vinaigrette dressing from them.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:44.000
If you want to have your ingredients ready for you in your kitchen, you can go to the xianwei website(please refer to the address below in the description). Then there you go, they will be ready prepackaged and mail to you.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
First, the vinaigrette salad dressing. Combine olive oil and balsamic vinegar together. To that, add in honey.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Add a little salt and black pepper. Mix well, and it's done. Taste and see if you like it, adjust the amount of salt and pepper based on your personal preference.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Place your salad on one side of a plate. We don't need much time to cook this dish, so be prepared for the plating first by dressing your salad, topping with parmesan cheese and toasted pine nuts.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Don't pour your vinaigrette dressing at this point, and set them aside for later.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Slice the garlic, and finely chop the chives.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Cut bacon rashers into halves.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Now it's time for scallops. Some times you will see scallops with some thin layers outside if not prepared well, just tear them away with you hands.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
We don't need the yellow roll around the meat either, which is the gonad of scallops. Remove them since they cannot be seared properly.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
There is also an adductor muscle attached to scallops, make sure you remove them as well.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Because this part will be extremely chewy after cooking. Cut it off with a pairing knife.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
When your scallops are ready, start warping them with half of the bacon rasher one by one.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Like this, and secure with toothpicks.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Sprinkle some salt and fresh ground black pepper on both sides of the scallop rolls.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Now it's time to heat them up on the stove.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Make sure your skillet or saute pan is hot enough before you start searing scallops. So please preheat your pan. Test beforehand with a little water, your pan is ready when water is like dancing around in it.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Even if you are using a stainless steel skillet, you need to preheat it to prevent sticking.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Add in oil when the pan is hot enough. Then turn it down to the lowest heat.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Add in scallop rolls.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Do not move them right away, let them sit for 30 secs until they are lightly brown on one side, then flip over.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Brown both sides nicely, and don't forget the side. Cook them thoroughly. Keep the heat on low.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Add in garlic.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Don't panic if you see those brown glaze on the bottom of your pan, your scallops are safe if you keep on low heat all the way.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Add in butter when scallops are almost done.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Tilt your pan to one side, and let your scallops simmer in melted butter and garlic sauce. Pour the sauce onto your scallop rolls constantly to add flavor. 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Now it's almost there. Even tough your garlic don't get brown enough, leave it there and transfer the scallop rolls to a plate.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000
You need to be very careful with the heat when it comes to sear scallops without overcooking.  So get them out of the pan first for plating, then keep sauteing the garlic.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Place scallop rolls next to the salad.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Remove toothpicks.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Place the garlic on the top of scallop rolls.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Lastly, pour the vinaigrette dressing on the salad, sprinkle toasted pine nuts around the rolls.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Same goes for the chives. Now it's ready to serve.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
For scallops like these, a little sear will give them a nice tender flavor.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:30.000
However, they are very easy to overcook. So we use bacon wraps, they not only add a fragrant and salty flavor, but also protect the plump and meaty scallops from the excess heat.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Let's cut one up and see, it's really easy to cut,just like cutting butter. It's creamy and tender, and very sweet.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.000
It feels so satisfying to have salty bacon with garlic and butter.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
I hope you enjoy the bacon and scallop rolls.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:04.000
