notice that this one moves too and the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.070 
notice that this one moves too and the
other<00:02:07.820> one<00:02:07.940> doesn't<00:02:08.119> move

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.280 

a<00:02:13.400> little<00:02:14.400> bit<00:02:14.520> more<00:02:14.700> play<00:02:14.970> actually<00:02:15.270> but<00:02:16.200> the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
a little bit more play actually but the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.160 
a little bit more play actually but the
other<00:02:16.380> one<00:02:16.530> definitely<00:02:16.830> had<00:02:16.980> its<00:02:17.100> play<00:02:17.280> so

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
other one definitely had its play so

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.490 
other one definitely had its play so
real<00:02:19.170> question<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:23.780> is<00:02:24.780> that<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.170> inner<00:02:25.320> tie

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
real question is is that the inner tie

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.130 
real question is is that the inner tie
rod<00:02:25.560> end<00:02:25.860> I<00:02:26.100> think<00:02:26.640> so

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
rod end I think so

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.610 
rod end I think so
and

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.190 

the<00:02:33.130> reason<00:02:33.489> why<00:02:33.730> because<00:02:34.300> I<00:02:34.660> can<00:02:34.840> get<00:02:34.989> under

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
the reason why because I can get under

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:43.120 
the reason why because I can get under
here<00:02:38.700> watch

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.600 

if<00:02:44.130> I<00:02:44.340> move<00:02:44.580> you<00:02:44.910> know

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.670 

so<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:52.260> tie-rod<00:02:52.500> there<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.330> don't<00:02:54.330> think<00:02:54.680> the

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
so the tie-rod there I don't think the

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.790 
so the tie-rod there I don't think the
entertainment<00:02:56.280> is<00:02:56.810> can<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:57.870> try<00:02:58.050> red<00:02:58.260> moves

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
entertainment is can I try red moves

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.450

Haynes manual for the for the Taurus so
I<00:06:53.710> don't<00:06:54.370> know<00:06:54.639> exactly<00:06:57.180> what<00:06:58.180> the<00:06:58.389> specific

00:06:58.889 --> 00:06:58.899 
I don't know exactly what the specific

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:01.649 
I don't know exactly what the specific
torque<00:06:59.139> was<00:06:59.349> to<00:06:59.589> get<00:06:59.740> these<00:06:59.889> things<00:07:00.159> in<00:07:00.659> my

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:01.659 
torque was to get these things in my

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:04.350 
torque was to get these things in my
guess<00:07:02.110> is<00:07:02.529> probably<00:07:02.949> around<00:07:03.370> 40<00:07:03.759> or<00:07:03.849> 50<00:07:04.180> pounds

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.360 
guess is probably around 40 or 50 pounds

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.629 
guess is probably around 40 or 50 pounds
I<00:07:04.779> didn't<00:07:05.499> put<00:07:05.649> lots<00:07:05.830> of<00:07:06.009> torque<00:07:06.249> on<00:07:06.399> them<00:07:06.610> I

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 
I didn't put lots of torque on them I

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:07.829 
I didn't put lots of torque on them I
didn't<00:07:06.999> want<00:07:07.029> to<00:07:07.240> mess<00:07:07.389> up<00:07:07.419> the<00:07:07.659> power

00:07:07.829 --> 00:07:07.839 
didn't want to mess up the power

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:11.489 
didn't want to mess up the power
steering<00:07:08.229> rack<00:07:08.729> but<00:07:09.729> it<00:07:10.629> is<00:07:10.779> recommended<00:07:11.379> on

00:07:11.489 --> 00:07:11.499 
steering rack but it is recommended on

00:07:27.239 --> 00:07:27.249 
into the power steering rack you tighten

00:07:27.249 --> 00:07:28.889 
into the power steering rack you tighten
it<00:07:27.339> down<00:07:27.370> and<00:07:27.789> then<00:07:28.120> it's<00:07:28.270> not<00:07:28.449> coming<00:07:28.689> out

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:28.899 
it down and then it's not coming out

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:31.649 
it down and then it's not coming out
when<00:07:29.830> I<00:07:29.860> put<00:07:30.099> the<00:07:30.189> bellows<00:07:30.580> back<00:07:30.909> one<00:07:31.449> thing

00:07:31.649 --> 00:07:31.659 
when I put the bellows back one thing

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:36.059 
when I put the bellows back one thing
that<00:07:31.809> I<00:07:31.839> did<00:07:32.199> use<00:07:32.999> to<00:07:33.999> really<00:07:34.300> good<00:07:34.680> result<00:07:35.680> was

00:07:36.059 --> 00:07:36.069 
that I did use to really good result was

00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:40.350 
that I did use to really good result was
a<00:07:36.430> pipe<00:07:37.680> hose<00:07:38.680> clamp<00:07:39.009> a<00:07:39.279> stainless<00:07:40.029> steel<00:07:40.059> hose

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:40.360 
a pipe hose clamp a stainless steel hose

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:45.320 
a pipe hose clamp a stainless steel hose
clamp<00:07:40.689> for<00:07:41.529> the<00:07:41.830> larger<00:07:43.499> larger<00:07:44.499> end<00:07:44.860> of<00:07:45.099> the

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:45.330 
clamp for the larger larger end of the

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.839 
clamp for the larger larger end of the
bellows<00:07:46.740> the<00:07:47.740> hose<00:07:47.919> clamp<00:07:48.279> I<00:07:48.459> think<00:07:48.639> worked

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:48.849 
bellows the hose clamp I think worked

00:07:48.849 --> 00:07:53.010 
bellows the hose clamp I think worked
brilliantly<00:07:49.529> so<00:07:50.699> the<00:07:51.699> size<00:07:52.059> on<00:07:52.599> it

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:53.020 
brilliantly so the size on it

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.249 
brilliantly so the size on it
if<00:07:53.649> I<00:07:53.800> remember<00:07:54.039> right<00:07:54.189> was<00:07:54.599> 37<00:07:55.599> to<00:07:55.779> 54

00:07:56.249 --> 00:07:56.259 
if I remember right was 37 to 54

00:07:56.259 --> 00:07:59.040 
if I remember right was 37 to 54
millimeters<00:07:56.800> or<00:07:57.490> 34<00:07:57.999> to<00:07:58.149> 57<00:07:58.629> millimeters

00:07:59.040 --> 00:07:59.050 
millimeters or 34 to 57 millimeters

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:02.489 
millimeters or 34 to 57 millimeters
something<00:07:59.589> like<00:07:59.740> that<00:07:59.979> it<00:08:00.669> was<00:08:00.819> about<00:08:01.469> two<00:08:02.469> and

00:08:02.489 --> 00:08:02.499 
something like that it was about two and

00:08:02.499 --> 00:08:04.219 
something like that it was about two and
a<00:08:02.649> quarter<00:08:02.800> two<00:08:03.069> and<00:08:03.099> a<00:08:03.219> half<00:08:03.430> inch<00:08:03.669> diameter

00:08:04.219 --> 00:08:04.229 
a quarter two and a half inch diameter

00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:08.040 
a quarter two and a half inch diameter
so<00:08:05.789> if<00:08:06.789> you<00:08:06.939> have<00:08:07.060> updates<00:08:07.389> to<00:08:07.569> that<00:08:07.719> let<00:08:07.959> me

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:08.050 
so if you have updates to that let me

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.320 
so if you have updates to that let me
know

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:09.330 
know

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.170 
know
what<00:08:09.629> else<00:08:09.780> I<00:08:10.370> think<00:08:11.370> that'll<00:08:11.759> do<00:08:11.849> it<00:08:11.970> for<00:08:12.090> this

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:12.180 
what else I think that'll do it for this

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.939 
what else I think that'll do it for this
