man<00:01:59.870> so<00:02:00.860> this<00:02:01.040> is<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.220> question<00:02:01.400> this<00:02:02.120> is<00:02:02.180> for

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
man so this is the question this is for

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.810 
man so this is the question this is for
y'all<00:02:02.570> do<00:02:03.290> we<00:02:03.410> just<00:02:03.590> start<00:02:03.770> this<00:02:03.950> all<00:02:04.160> over<00:02:04.190> or

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
y'all do we just start this all over or

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.120 
y'all do we just start this all over or
maybe<00:02:05.090> some<00:02:05.420> of<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.570> first<00:02:05.750> two<00:02:05.990> seasons<00:02:06.260> well

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
maybe some of the first two seasons well

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.440 
maybe some of the first two seasons well
because<00:02:07.310> I<00:02:07.370> believe<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:07.729> rosters<00:02:08.209> should<00:02:08.360> be

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
because I believe the rosters should be

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.300 
because I believe the rosters should be
the<00:02:08.570> same<00:02:08.810> so<00:02:09.170> maybe<00:02:09.350> we<00:02:09.500> send<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.890> first<00:02:10.130> two

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
the same so maybe we send the first two

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.190 
the same so maybe we send the first two
seasons<00:02:10.610> and<00:02:11.120> I<00:02:11.570> turn<00:02:11.930> fire<00:02:12.770> coach<00:02:13.190> off<00:02:13.610> or<00:02:14.450> we

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
thinking that basketballs gonna take a

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.010 
thinking that basketballs gonna take a
seat<00:03:55.890> back<00:03:56.220> cuz<00:03:56.490> I<00:03:56.580> always<00:03:56.910> view<00:03:57.180> 2k<00:03:57.630> is<00:03:57.660> more

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
seat back cuz I always view 2k is more

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.650 
seat back cuz I always view 2k is more
of<00:03:58.080> a<00:03:58.170> distraction<00:03:58.520> more<00:03:59.520> of<00:03:59.610> a<00:03:59.670> release<00:04:00.180> from

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
of a distraction more of a release from

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.480 
of a distraction more of a release from
getting<00:04:01.050> work<00:04:01.260> done<00:04:01.290> for<00:04:01.710> the<00:04:01.800> football<00:04:02.040> heads

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
getting work done for the football heads

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.340 
getting work done for the football heads
and<00:04:02.970> maybe<00:04:03.180> a<00:04:03.300> few<00:04:03.510> baseball<00:04:03.990> heads<00:04:04.200> that<00:04:04.290> I

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
and maybe a few baseball heads that I

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.980 
and maybe a few baseball heads that I
have<00:04:04.620> on<00:04:04.860> my<00:04:05.280> channel<00:04:05.310> net<00:04:05.850> so<00:04:06.210> I<00:04:06.450> think<00:04:06.720> we'll

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
have on my channel net so I think we'll

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.960 
have on my channel net so I think we'll
start<00:04:07.050> with<00:04:07.260> NC<00:04:07.590> double-a<00:04:07.860> 14<00:04:08.340> dynasty<00:04:08.820> as

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
start with NC double-a 14 dynasty as

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.480 
start with NC double-a 14 dynasty as
well<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:09.810> I<00:04:10.140> think<00:04:10.380> that<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.620> Jazz<00:04:10.890> my<00:04:11.160> GM

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
well and I think that the Jazz my GM

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.670 
well and I think that the Jazz my GM
series<00:04:11.820> might<00:04:11.970> take<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.210> step<00:04:12.630> back<00:04:12.990> this<00:04:13.410> is<00:04:13.650> my

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
series might take a step back this is my

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.470 
series might take a step back this is my
thinking<00:04:14.070> on<00:04:14.370> it<00:04:14.520> I<00:04:14.610> don't<00:04:14.850> really<00:04:15.030> know<00:04:15.240> but

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
thinking on it I don't really know but

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.750 
thinking on it I don't really know but
that's<00:04:16.200> what<00:04:16.410> that's<00:04:16.830> what<00:04:16.950> we<00:04:17.040> are<00:04:17.160> here<00:04:17.370> this
