00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
burning now my initial thoughts on this

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.789 
burning now my initial thoughts on this
is<00:03:15.819> this<00:03:16.569> is<00:03:16.749> an<00:03:16.870> excellent<00:03:17.230> if<00:03:17.439> you're<00:03:17.590> in<00:03:17.709> a

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
is this is an excellent if you're in a

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.949 
is this is an excellent if you're in a
scape<00:03:18.040> invasion<00:03:18.519> type<00:03:18.670> situation<00:03:19.299> and<00:03:19.480> you

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
scape invasion type situation and you

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.780 
scape invasion type situation and you
need<00:03:20.139> heat<00:03:20.469> but<00:03:20.920> you<00:03:21.040> don't<00:03:21.250> want<00:03:21.400> that<00:03:21.519> flame

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
need heat but you don't want that flame

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.270 
need heat but you don't want that flame
to<00:03:21.969> give<00:03:22.120> away<00:03:22.269> your<00:03:22.420> position<00:03:23.010> now<00:03:24.010> you<00:03:24.040> have

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
to give away your position now you have

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.119 
to give away your position now you have
a<00:03:24.310> method<00:03:24.760> of<00:03:24.879> getting<00:03:25.030> some<00:03:25.359> heat<00:03:25.540> going

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
a method of getting some heat going

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.670 
a method of getting some heat going
without<00:03:27.129> giving<00:03:27.639> away<00:03:27.760> your<00:03:27.790> position<00:03:28.450> I

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
without giving away your position I

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.339 
without giving away your position I
guess<00:03:29.680> no<00:03:30.280> smoke<00:03:30.579> I<00:03:30.760> can't<00:03:31.000> smell<00:03:31.269> anything

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
guess no smoke I can't smell anything

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:36.449 
guess no smoke I can't smell anything
usually<00:03:32.790> I<00:03:33.790> don't<00:03:33.909> smell<00:03:34.180> anything<00:03:34.419> so<00:03:35.459> we're

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
usually I don't smell anything so we're

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.490 
usually I don't smell anything so we're
gonna<00:03:36.549> let<00:03:36.790> this<00:03:36.909> burn<00:03:37.209> down<00:03:37.480> now<00:03:37.989> like<00:03:38.139> I<00:03:38.260> said

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
gonna let this burn down now like I said

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.119 
gonna let this burn down now like I said
