most important ideas behind Darwinism in
it<00:00:21.060> could<00:00:21.120> be<00:00:21.180> summed<00:00:21.540> up<00:00:21.750> by<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.080> idea<00:00:22.500> that

it could be summed up by the idea that

it could be summed up by the idea that

as<00:01:09.950> I<00:01:10.950> mentioned<00:01:11.340> previously<00:01:11.520> one<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.570> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
as I mentioned previously one of the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.410 
as I mentioned previously one of the
mottos<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.380> Illuminati<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.280> order<00:01:15.119> out<00:01:15.390> of

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
mottos of the Illuminati is order out of

mottos of the Illuminati is order out of
chaos

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
chaos

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.580 
chaos
like<00:01:17.070> eugenics<00:01:17.789> so<00:01:17.909> they<00:01:18.030> attempted<00:01:18.539> to

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
like eugenics so they attempted to

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.080 
like eugenics so they attempted to
artificially<00:01:19.590> advance<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.189> process<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.939> they

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
artificially advance a process that they

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.169 
artificially advance a process that they
believed<00:01:21.509> was<00:01:21.719> already<00:01:22.170> happening<00:01:22.679> naturally

00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:23.179 
believed was already happening naturally

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:25.669 
believed was already happening naturally
because<00:01:24.179> the<00:01:24.359> goal<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.659> Satan<00:01:25.079> was<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.350> reverse

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
because the goal of Satan was to reverse

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:27.770 
because the goal of Satan was to reverse
the<00:01:25.920> scattering<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.640> fragmentation<00:01:27.359> that

the scattering and fragmentation that

the scattering and fragmentation that

world to a singular system the idea was

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.190 
world to a singular system the idea was
to<00:01:32.609> keep<00:01:32.850> clashing<00:01:33.479> opposing<00:01:33.929> ideologies

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
to keep clashing opposing ideologies

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.709 
to keep clashing opposing ideologies
together<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.280> create<00:01:35.460> conflict<00:01:35.819> which<00:01:36.539> would

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719 
together to create conflict which would

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:38.510 
together to create conflict which would

different ideas through the years of
