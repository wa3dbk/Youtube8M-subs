that<00:02:31.180> in<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.480> good<00:02:31.510> way<00:02:31.690> by<00:02:32.019> the<00:02:32.080> way<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.940> picks

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
that in a good way by the way it picks

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.589 
that in a good way by the way it picks
up<00:02:34.480> all<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:35.489> acoustics<00:02:36.489> in<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:36.849> so<00:02:37.209> when

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
up all the the acoustics in it so when

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.000 
up all the the acoustics in it so when
you<00:02:37.720> plug<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:38.110> in<00:02:38.260> which<00:02:38.470> I<00:02:38.590> don't<00:02:38.650> have<00:02:38.890> a

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
you plug it in which I don't have a

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.880 
you plug it in which I don't have a
plug-in<00:02:39.459> right<00:02:39.670> now<00:02:40.049> but<00:02:41.049> when<00:02:41.410> you<00:02:41.500> plug<00:02:41.739> it

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
plug-in right now but when you plug it

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.400 
plug-in right now but when you plug it
in<00:02:42.010> it<00:02:42.160> sounds<00:02:42.670> just<00:02:43.420> as<00:02:43.599> if<00:02:43.780> it's<00:02:43.959> not<00:02:44.170> on

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
in it sounds just as if it's not on

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.559 
in it sounds just as if it's not on
earth<00:02:44.769> if<00:02:45.099> it's<00:02:45.400> not<00:02:45.700> plugged<00:02:46.269> in<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:48.569> it

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
earth if it's not plugged in so it

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.990 
earth if it's not plugged in so it
definitely<00:02:49.810> picks<00:02:50.290> up<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.709> acoustics<00:02:51.670> in<00:02:51.880> it

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
definitely picks up the acoustics in it

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.020 
definitely picks up the acoustics in it
