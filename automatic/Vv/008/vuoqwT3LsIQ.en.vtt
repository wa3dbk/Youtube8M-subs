00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.230
 just coming out and here another one appears 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:14.990
 who are already winning what happens to them 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.180
 subjects and well we are in a new way 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.099
 that they do not even let me decide in 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.010
 where are we and what are we doing and 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:24.859
 it's about what a few pray in 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.619
 germ or in brothers of worse than 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.119
 minerals that is pretty cool and 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.279
 good the download because you already know always 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.050
 will be in the description and apart 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.670
 I need a texture that even everything is 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.920
 in the download only decompress the 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.960
 zip file and you will be all ready to 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.570
 that may have these curious 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.660
 senerman that as you can see are from 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.430
 minerals and good something great is that 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.410
 automatically exposes in mode 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.050
 survival but also the creator 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.890
 gave us the option to have them in 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.250
 creative so let's get them out 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.809
 to see this lack ok and good are of 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.930
 all the minerals as you can see here 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:05.920
 all all all 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.260
 rainbow already and ok let's put first 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.509
 that of what it would be that they just 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.690
 throw said I'm already going there you see yourself there you 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:16.330
 see if you have this light you are and something 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.330
 also very very good that even me 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.600
 I missed to come see here I need 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.570
 hit you because he hears so much today we put 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.880
 this is that they hear too much leave us 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.850
 hit 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.960
 they run away too good the joke does not 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.240
 leave the joke in this way is that 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.040
 When you kill them, they release you as ender 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.330
 but where is 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.120
 here you are now move since already by 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.250
 finally at last much when the 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.560
 we kill ourselves drop in is to ascend but what 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.900
 good depends on him 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.140
 German that is because the color changes to 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.320
 see if we kill this so they can 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.360
 appreciate where he is he went back to go there 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.840
 is there is there is and goes okey 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:08.080
 when we leave those those those little balls 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.000
 is to ascend because we can say and in the 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.490
 case we killed that one who was a 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.900
 brother of coal if we put it to the 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.880
 oven is that I'm not going to put it because 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.700
 here there are too many are brothers and can 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.490
 that they attack me or we can try it but 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.240
 nothing better so we leave it not so 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.940
 more let's try 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.920
 we put ourselves in survival that does not see me 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.710
 they do not see me not see eye to 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.400
 the eyes we are going to make quick blocks of 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:38.540
 construction we grabbed boards 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.790
 full stack wood is there or there is no 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.200
 to see them in the eyes now I'm going to 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.620
 do 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.540
 what is not so much may have gone and of 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.310
 I keep a diamond there you can see it 's 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.349
 of diamond I do not want to see them in the eyes 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.580
 because if they're not going to kill him but that 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.580
 it would be a diamond anderman 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.850
 very well we are here in no mode 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.380
 creative 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:05.430
 and we are going to take this 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.320
 ok well we are here again and 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.940
 owns an oven and now what 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.370
 we need is to kill a brother who 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.350
 be for example be dead maritime in 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.120
 this moment there is no follows and continues and 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:20.850
 go on, do not go damn brides, you 're not here 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.270
 where are you also a good number 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:27.000
 good number not because today always 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.490
 when I'm about to call you I think 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.180
 that was the one we were giving him 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:36.510
 A moment ago, do not put meter to lean 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.110
 because they do that to me rays move 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:43.440
 too much there is there is that no 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:46.290
 where is where is there is there is 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.660
 finally after 20,000 years ok how 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.390
 can realize I must kill the 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.450
 red because if it's not going to kill me if I 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.360
 I put in creative die there is not the 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.670
 grasp rays ok as I told them we 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.090
 they spoil what they are a kind of 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.370
 ender pills and if we put here the 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.340
 took and now building blocks 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.360
 fast fast if they are not going to kill I feel 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.470
 they're going to kill me they're going to kill me 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:17.040
 we take this ok and in any oven 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:20.220
 if we put this here and we put that to 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.770
 cook will give us what a diamond is and 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.900
 so it would be with all the minerals or that 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.180
 this is it or not 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.360
 ok an apology that that was brought and 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.340
 appeared in a strange place will not mean 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.710
 where I am but good here we have this 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.070
 which is the diamond worst the pearl of 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.810
 diamond and already with this as I was 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.060
 showing before it was believed if the 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.860
 we put in a furnace because it would give us what 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.060
 which is a diamond and so it would happen with 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.639
 all the 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.200
 with everything to ascend worse is that we more 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.680
 well with all the pearls that we drop 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.480
 in the mineral brothers in this 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.280
 case from the solÃ­s pile and we put it in 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.830
 the oven as lapis lazuli and so we will 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.139
 it would be with everyone so nothing in itself would be 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.669
 everything by part of this way I wait for you 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.080
