00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
it let's go with transformation will

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.940 
it let's go with transformation will
begin<00:01:59.850> with<00:02:00.119> tilt<00:02:00.860> you're<00:02:01.860> just<00:02:02.130> going<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.950> get

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
begin with tilt you're just going to get

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.120 
begin with tilt you're just going to get
their<00:02:05.190> legs<00:02:05.460> here<00:02:06.470> make<00:02:07.470> it<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.890> where<00:02:08.009> the

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
their legs here make it to where the

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.330 
their legs here make it to where the
propeller<00:02:08.519> lets<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.660> off<00:02:09.780> get<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.679> off<00:02:10.890> here

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
propeller lets it off get it off here

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.630 
propeller lets it off get it off here
bring<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.269> down<00:02:12.350> like<00:02:13.350> that<00:02:13.560> see<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.430> other

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
bring it down like that see the other

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.640 
bring it down like that see the other
side<00:02:14.760> get<00:02:15.570> off<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:17.239> bring<00:02:18.239> it<00:02:18.390> down<00:02:18.450> just<00:02:18.870> like

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
side get off and bring it down just like

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.870 
side get off and bring it down just like
that<00:02:21.380> braiding<00:02:22.380> this<00:02:22.560> up<00:02:24.440> bring<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.880> little

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
that braiding this up bring the little

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.060 
that braiding this up bring the little
things<00:02:27.540> here<00:02:28.280> push<00:02:29.280> his<00:02:30.680> little<00:02:31.680> feet<00:02:31.860> down

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
things here push his little feet down

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:42.330 
things here push his little feet down
there<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:35.959> and<00:02:36.959> there<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:37.290> go

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.009 

let<00:02:43.340> me<00:02:44.170> do<00:02:45.170> that<00:02:46.480> rotate<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.629> head<00:02:47.780> there

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
let me do that rotate the head there

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.369 
let me do that rotate the head there
seems<00:02:48.950> a<00:02:49.159> little<00:02:49.250> clearer<00:02:49.579> view<00:02:50.079> and<00:02:51.079> that's

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
seems a little clearer view and that's

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:56.559 
seems a little clearer view and that's
how<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:51.680> is<00:02:53.560> there<00:02:54.560> you<00:02:54.709> go<00:02:54.920> that<00:02:55.310> is<00:02:55.569> Minicon

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
how it is there you go that is Minicon

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.610 
how it is there you go that is Minicon
jolt<00:02:57.010> he<00:02:58.010> you<00:02:58.760> know<00:02:58.879> he<00:02:59.750> has<00:02:59.870> articulation

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
jolt he you know he has articulation

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.500 
jolt he you know he has articulation
legs<00:03:01.299> bend<00:03:02.299> down<00:03:03.370> comes<00:03:04.370> back<00:03:04.700> their

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
legs bend down comes back their

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.050 
legs bend down comes back their
articulation<00:03:05.810> in<00:03:06.379> the<00:03:06.469> arms<00:03:06.920> so<00:03:07.609> that's<00:03:07.849> just

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
articulation in the arms so that's just

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.330 
articulation in the arms so that's just
because<00:03:08.180> he's<00:03:08.329> me<00:03:08.799> and<00:03:09.799> there<00:03:09.950> you<00:03:10.010> go<00:03:10.040> that's

might be the main account should have

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.520 
might be the main account should have
been<00:04:25.669> a<00:04:25.699> little<00:04:25.880> smaller<00:04:26.330> but<00:04:26.479> you<00:04:27.349> know<00:04:27.470> you
