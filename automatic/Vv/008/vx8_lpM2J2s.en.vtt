00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.820
 ah 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.960
 A) Yes 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.960
 the eyes 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.270
 hello everyone will follow 77 today I'm 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.250
 with a new tutorial on how to make a 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.910
 kitchen of these with home automation and that you 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.710
 do all you 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.750
 it is so much the meals that can be made 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.650
 and the potions we're going to start for 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.130
 get a golden apple we press 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:34.300
 and it gives us exactly nothing more and nothing 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:37.110
 less than 8 nuggets and an apple 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.309
 with which we make the golden apple 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.030
 we want to make a soup because we press the 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.730
 button and it gives us 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.769
 just to make a soup we put the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:52.079
 this how do you call that the agreement and 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.309
 he gives us our life here to do 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.870
 any type of armor we want 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.870
 make it a helmet 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:05.240
 gives us just 5 to make a helmet 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.240
 we want to make some pants 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.280
 our just to make some pants 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.740
 and if we press the breastplate it gives us 8 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.070
 make a breastplate 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.750
 it's very useful, you can 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.880
 change for diamond whatever and good 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.259
 in the boots exactly the same as that 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.369
 what chambre per diamond came 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.070
 to make the armors of what 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.260
 you want this is the most complicated thing what 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.800
 star of this let's say 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.720
 Come and see I will explain a little 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.910
 does not have much to explain is a 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.500
 creator of potions any kind of 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.900
 position that is in the game can be 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.200
 create with this let's for example do 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.140
 a potion of instant healing but that 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.660
 healing option so we already want it 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.700
 with splash so we can launch it and 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.530
 we also want it with more power 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.530
 Ok, we expel 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.030
 and what has helped us 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.240
 we need with this we go here to the 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.700
 cauldron fill 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.320
 we put it here in accounts does not matter 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.319
 where I put it says it does not matter in 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.670
 absolute and we put the nedergaard and go 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.440
 to leave is being done while we see 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.300
 more things we're going to remove this for 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.830
 that there is no error at all 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.260
 here to afford any 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.710
 game tool we see for example 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.840
 we want to make a diamond shovel 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.790
 we put two sticks and he gives us two sticks and 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.590
 we want with diamond and it gives us a 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.420
 diamond and we can already do it in our 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.970
 shovel 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.280
 and then we want to do if we want a 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.090
 sword press this and press two 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.610
 times here 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.940
 and gives us 2 iron that we make 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.370
 here our sword to kill that 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.050
 come here here the fridge 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.050
 I need to put that here to see 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:58.700
 we need exactly six of six of 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.700
 the steaks that are in here 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:05.499
 then we want we have 16 of a meal 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:08.980
 whatever then we to melt 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:10.629
 16 for every 8 items a coal is needed 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.010
 so to melt 16 7 makes us 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.560
 lack would make two coal these we expel 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.870
 here 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.150
 and gives us two coal just to melt 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.129
 the 16 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.540
 and if we already want to melt a stack by 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.939
 example stack of stone to take out the 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.970
 We are looking for more good stone here 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:28.010
 gives 8 just coal to melt the 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.540
 stack here and here we press so 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.670
 we go out a bit to fill in the change 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.200
 that we are absolutely useless 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.690
 I already know but it 's fun 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.379
 we see this as it goes here is the pressure 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.400
 without effect we put the melon this 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:45.209
 we are doing I am going to teach a little 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.970
 the house to see I'm going to get creative 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.890
 and we are going to see a little like that above 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.620
 let's see the first thing here is about the 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.630
 golden apple if we press the button it 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.630
 turn off this comes the current over here 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.970
 down and here good gives a torch this 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.989
 what it does is send 8 pulses down 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.989
 and one up here 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.400
 when we turn off this send a pulse here 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.379
 above 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.810
 and what he does is send you a course here 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:13.370
 causes it to turn off that it already sends then 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.030
 makes it go off is sending another 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.340
 course and send eight courses here when 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.660
 we give the button here it turns off this is what 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.930
 that stops having energy go out 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:28.310
 these two and here an item of each 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:30.740
 one a mushroom is worth here also here is 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.389
 what of the armors here according to whether 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.600
 we press that I know the boots lose the 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:38.720
 current here the current gives a 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.610
 current down here that first gives a 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.789
 current have begun so it leaves 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.680
 do not come down here give a current here that 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.240
 turn off this is a current this 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.979
 turn off street to a current is that for 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.790
 this so there were four exact for 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:54.060
 what of things 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.470
 and so with everything for example the breastplate is 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.630
 up here 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.090
 valera current flow here gives 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.620
 One click here gives an idea here 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.020
 four of the boots 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.970
 and at the same time it comes through here it comes here 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.060
 He comes here around here but a little while 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.249
 down here the other one and the eight that 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.549
 it takes to make a beautiful 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:18.789
 here the east of the positions this idea 

00:05:15.549 --> 00:05:21.609
 is from minecraft cn he used it in his bat 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:24.189
 The cave that he made seemed very good to me and the 

00:05:21.609 --> 00:05:27.119
 I'm using the same modification of mine 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:27.119
 has two of the sides 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:32.539
 let's see here they have the functions here 

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:35.689
 They have the buttons as pulses as 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:37.519
 one day up and I'm going to put 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:39.019
 disassemble them if you want me to make a 

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:41.839
 tutorial like this in Spanish how it's done 

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:44.299
 this is what you tell me , it's super 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:45.799
 simple here are the three these are not 

00:05:44.299 --> 00:05:47.719
 they have a lot of complication 

00:05:45.799 --> 00:05:49.380
 know the button and one goes out has no more 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:52.440
 complications 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:55.930
 This is certainly guarantees to those of 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:58.720
 the sticks the same if we press 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.699
 if we press the east to get two 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.590
 sticks gives a current this so 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:05.320
 one goes down the stream here from 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.820
 here and another one comes out and if we want it to 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.120
 we get one we press the one in there and 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.860
 there is only one course here for it to come out 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.539
 so the current is exactly the same 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.699
 here low for activities gives you this 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:17.480
 I'm here and he asks me for six courses 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:19.340
 exactly 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.340
 and here with the coal if we want it to 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.920
 eight pulses so that of eight courses for 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.300
 get out our coal you charge the 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.370
 around all the same here is what 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.990
 There was nothing left to install 8 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.110
 exactly if we press the button here 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:35.360
 give 1 here another here does not turn off this it 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.800
 It was something complicated is that it would have 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.600
 that build the part that if not I do not 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.730
 not even me 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.190
 well basically the current 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:45.500
 here they come down here and the current 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:48.050
 to the east to know and after it comes out 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:52.420
 the oven below is exactly one 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.420
 so useless but good here the lever 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:57.730
 unexpected 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:59.230
 and good has been everything if you want me to do 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.540
 a tutorial on how to do it even though the 

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.760
 I've truly taught everything I finished 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:06.310
 to put here this we put the 

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.870
 instant cure position when 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.850
 we put this will be increased by the 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.980
 healing tania 2 and I managed to add this 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.840
 and it will be what can be done and good 

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:18.390
 that has been all like favorites 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.390
 subscribe and good bye
