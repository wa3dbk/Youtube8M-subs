can be a bit confusing to newer players
the<00:00:25.080> core<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.650> just<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.949> stay<00:00:26.160> alive<00:00:26.279> but

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
the core of it is just to stay alive but

the core of it is just to stay alive but
there's<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.029> few<00:00:27.269> things<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.689> need<00:00:27.779> to

consider when trying to stay alive let's
start<00:00:30.570> with<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.810> basics<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.470> get<00:00:31.650> into<00:00:31.890> an

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
start with the basics you get into an

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.889 
start with the basics you get into an
enemy<00:00:32.219> base<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.820> turn<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.390> alarms<00:00:33.750> and

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
enemy base you turn on the alarms and

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.900 
enemy base you turn on the alarms and
then<00:00:34.050> shit<00:00:34.320> hits<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.620> fan<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:35.430> enemies<00:00:35.730> turn

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
then shit hits the fan the enemies turn

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.700 
then shit hits the fan the enemies turn
off<00:00:36.090> life<00:00:36.360> support<00:00:36.390> meaning<00:00:37.230> they're<00:00:37.410> getting

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
off life support meaning they're getting

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.470 
off life support meaning they're getting
rid<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:38.010> all<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.280> oxygen<00:00:38.760> that's<00:00:39.090> how<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.329> might

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
rid of all the oxygen that's how I might

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.360 
rid of all the oxygen that's how I might
explain<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.989> at<00:00:40.079> least<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.559> what<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.100> need<00:00:41.250> to

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
explain it at least and what you need to

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.100 
explain it at least and what you need to
do<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.640> keep<00:00:41.790> yourself<00:00:41.910> breathing<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.750> recover

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
do to keep yourself breathing is recover

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.049 
do to keep yourself breathing is recover
life<00:00:43.379> support<00:00:43.770> from<00:00:43.950> enemies<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.550> what<00:00:45.030> I

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
life support from enemies and what I

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.369 
life support from enemies and what I
mean<00:00:45.239> by<00:00:45.300> recovery<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.200> need<00:00:46.350> to

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
mean by recovery is that you need to

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.020 
mean by recovery is that you need to
pick<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:46.860> after<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.399> drops<00:00:47.579> off<00:00:47.850> their

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
pick it up after it drops off their

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.360 
pick it up after it drops off their
lifeless<00:00:48.420> bodies<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:49.379> sort<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.920> looks<00:00:50.160> like<00:00:50.250> a

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
lifeless bodies it sort of looks like a

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.950 
lifeless bodies it sort of looks like a
bulletproof<00:00:50.730> vest<00:00:51.120> when<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.480> see<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.660> drop

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
bulletproof vest when you see a drop

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.959

another<00:00:52.680> way<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.010> regain<00:00:53.309> life<00:00:53.460> support<00:00:53.850> is

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
another way the regain life support is

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.490 
another way the regain life support is
to<00:00:54.000> use<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.360> life<00:00:54.539> support<00:00:54.690> capsules<00:00:55.379> that

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
to use the life support capsules that

now<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.420> we've<00:01:27.600> covered<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.170> let's<00:01:28.439> talk

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
now that we've covered that let's talk

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.469 
now that we've covered that let's talk
about<00:01:28.650> how<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.130> set<00:01:29.400> up<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.670> survival<00:01:30.180> missions

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
about how to set up in survival missions

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.450 
about how to set up in survival missions
basically<00:01:31.259> enemies<00:01:31.500> won't<00:01:31.950> spawn<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
basically enemies won't spawn in the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.490 
basically enemies won't spawn in the
same<00:01:32.670> room<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:32.970> are<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.329> or<00:01:33.689> if<00:01:34.079> you're<00:01:34.259> at<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
same room you are in or if you're at the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.050 
same room you are in or if you're at the
entrance<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.890> another<00:01:35.100> room<00:01:35.430> they<00:01:35.640> don't<00:01:35.820> seem

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
entrance to another room they don't seem

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.850 
entrance to another room they don't seem
to<00:01:36.210> spawn<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.750> room<00:01:36.960> either<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> best

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
to spawn in that room either so the best

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.649 
to spawn in that room either so the best
way<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.070> keep<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.430> steady<00:01:38.579> flow<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.909> enemies<00:01:39.420> for

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
way to keep a steady flow of enemies for

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.510 
way to keep a steady flow of enemies for
their<00:01:39.810> life<00:01:39.990> support<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.650> stay<00:01:40.829> put<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.130> one

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
their life support is to stay put in one

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.700 
their life support is to stay put in one
room<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.180> don't<00:01:42.390> run<00:01:42.540> around<00:01:42.659> too<00:01:42.990> much<00:01:43.200> or<00:01:43.470> you

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
room so don't run around too much or you

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.319 
room so don't run around too much or you
might<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:43.920> run<00:01:44.310> out<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.460> things<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.880> kill<00:01:45.090> for

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
might just run out of things to kill for

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.450 
might just run out of things to kill for
life<00:01:45.479> support<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.320> way<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.500> do<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.100> just<00:01:47.280> run

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
life support the way I do it is just run

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.130 
life support the way I do it is just run
to<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.640> nearest<00:01:47.880> life<00:01:48.270> support<00:01:48.630> capsule<00:01:49.020> and
