00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:11.109
 how are you 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:13.110
 it seems that the current of the girl 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.109
 is emerging a little while ago because it has rained 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.499
 pretty well to one somewhere in another quite less of course but 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:25.399
 It's still a long time before summer ended up starting better and what to say 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:29.539
 that you do not have to trust a lot in this rain now 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.180
 they keep well now if on the floor 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.170
 55 between 55 and 150 in the north 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.680
 from Paraguay in the south of Brazil 24 in part Rio Grande do Sul but in the south 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.380
 one to five millimeters just 27 in the center of Paraguay 45 in the northwest 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.380
 where 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.190
 it had hardly rained in the last time 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.650
 ute Argentina only remembers in the reader and between 40 and 50 in general 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:03.190
 29 25 24 that is to say rather well the footprint of the fertile layer in 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.290
 change good air between 1 and 8 millimeters nava of almost all the 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.550
 province orense or practically nobody else 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.990
 it should rain in the west also very little 3 millimeters of all this farce 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.660
 see stated is to say that 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.370
 pagadito should normally say little that this is not surprising 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.360
 but the strange thing is that in santiago de estero there is oblivion 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.470
 quite well is good santiago de estero has suffered 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.450
 a quite intense drought and a lot of rain like this last week 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.920
 in the south of the country 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.990
 only the neuquén area already 25 millimeters 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.200
 in the rest of patagonia in the center nothing 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.440
 in the north between 5 and 10 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.670
 and between 1 and 5 millimeters 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.810
 the south of the Patagonian territory to say that is 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.210
 normal for this sector 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.380
 of the Argentine territory 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.180
 we believe we still think that the current of the girl is going to have 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.440
 its influence 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.250
 in later in time say that they will miss the rain do not trust 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.840
 much 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.310
 with this rain tormo is happy that is planting soybean troche and moche 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.630
 now because it's just the area where it had not rained now I'm going to see 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.630
 what can happen next 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.639
 jumps and jujuy 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:19.059
 some drizzles 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:20.869
 slowly improving 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:22.649
 moderate south wind 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:24.689
 rotating then the northeast 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.989
 paul hit temperature rise 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.089
 tucumán and santiago del estero 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:31.779
 rain or drizzle 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:33.319
 then improving 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.229
 winds rotating northwest 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:38.549
 Paul managed to rise in temperature 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.349
 catamarca and la rioja 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.419
 partially clarifying 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:45.419
 I think rotating northeast temperature does not increase 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.679
 mendoza san juan and san luis 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:52.589
 good something cloudy 

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:55.619
 and this rotating north temperature rise 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:58.629
 Patagonia 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.319
 partly cloudy 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.599
 some rains on the north coast 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.599
 little change in temperature 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.729
 the pampa center and south of buenos aires 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:11.519
 partially clarifying 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.489
 percent rotating to the northeast 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.489
 paul activate temperature census 

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:22.279
 north of buenos aires córdoba south of santa fe and between rivers weather improving 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:26.959
 moderate wind from the southwest rotating northwest paul hit climb 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.529
 temperature 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:31.529
 north of santa fe chaco currents formosa and missions 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.819
 storms and showers 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.239
 then improving 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.199
 percent rotating northeast 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:41.199
 temperature rise 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:45.639
 bitch and I see only storms are expected outside of such a storm 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:49.749
 you do not forgive rains until next Thursday possibly 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.839
 there is just there and stability especially in the north of the littoral 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.379
 and some clouds in the downtown area 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.959
 and I am from the Argentine Republic 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.239
 let's see if that happens well we will analyze it again in this 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.089
 same channel next 

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.650
 nothing else
