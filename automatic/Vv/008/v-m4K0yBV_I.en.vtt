only<00:02:13.370> real<00:02:13.610> thing<00:02:13.790> I<00:02:13.940> guess<00:02:14.090> I<00:02:14.209> could<00:02:14.390> complain

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
the arms and on the legs it looks kind

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.330 
the arms and on the legs it looks kind
of<00:02:19.459> like<00:02:19.519> play-doh<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:21.709> sculpt<00:02:22.010> could<00:02:22.249> have

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
of like play-doh the sculpt could have

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.250 
of like play-doh the sculpt could have
been<00:02:22.459> a<00:02:22.489> little<00:02:22.760> better<00:02:22.849> on<00:02:23.030> that<00:02:23.359> I<00:02:23.390> guess

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
been a little better on that I guess

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.440 
been a little better on that I guess
but<00:02:24.500> it's<00:02:24.709> not<00:02:24.860> terrible<00:02:25.370> so<00:02:25.610> I'm<00:02:26.090> not<00:02:26.299> going

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
but it's not terrible so I'm not going

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.899 
but it's not terrible so I'm not going
to<00:02:26.540> complain<00:02:26.840> too<00:02:27.049> much<00:02:27.129> he's<00:02:28.129> got<00:02:28.280> a<00:02:28.340> handful

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909

of<00:02:28.970> variants<00:02:29.590> he's<00:02:30.590> got<00:02:30.799> I<00:02:31.069> think<00:02:31.370> what<00:02:31.459> is<00:02:31.549> it

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
of variants he's got I think what is it

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.210 
of variants he's got I think what is it
five<00:02:31.819> one<00:02:32.209> two<00:02:32.420> three<00:02:32.450> four<00:02:33.019> five<00:02:33.319> six<00:02:33.590> total

five one two three four five six total

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.520 
five one two three four five six total
so<00:02:34.549> five<00:02:34.819> variants<00:02:35.209> plus<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.569> original<00:02:35.659> let's

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.550 
I'm not sure if these were exclusives
anywhere<00:02:44.480> or<00:02:44.659> not<00:02:44.690> dealing<00:02:45.170> what<00:02:45.290> I'm<00:02:45.379> sure

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
anywhere or not dealing what I'm sure

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.580 
anywhere or not dealing what I'm sure
about<00:02:45.769> is<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.040> GameStop<00:02:46.549> but<00:02:47.269> um<00:02:47.480> they<00:02:47.930> they

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
about is the GameStop but um they they

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.470 
about is the GameStop but um they they
do<00:02:48.709> exist<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:49.310> go<00:02:49.549> try<00:02:49.610> to<00:02:49.790> find<00:02:50.060> them<00:02:50.299> the

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
do exist so go try to find them the

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.759 
do exist so go try to find them the
translucent<00:02:50.989> one<00:02:51.049> everything<00:02:51.680> is

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
translucent one everything is

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.440 
translucent one everything is
translucent<00:02:52.190> molded<00:02:52.670> plastic<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.269> only

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
translucent molded plastic the only

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.110 
translucent molded plastic the only
paint<00:02:53.659> is<00:02:53.810> on<00:02:53.900> his<00:02:54.049> face<00:02:54.459> which<00:02:55.459> I<00:02:55.670> think<00:02:55.970> could

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
paint is on his face which I think could

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.220 
paint is on his face which I think could
have<00:02:56.239> been<00:02:56.269> done<00:02:56.540> better<00:02:56.720> if<00:02:56.989> they<00:02:57.109> actually

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
have been done better if they actually

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.530 
have been done better if they actually
painted<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:57.799> pants<00:02:58.159> in<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.430> stretch<00:02:58.760> left

better it's still really nice especially
since<00:03:15.560> it's<00:03:15.680> all<00:03:15.829> molded<00:03:17.530> well<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:18.650> know<00:03:18.769> what

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
since it's all molded well you know what

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.199 
since it's all molded well you know what
now<00:03:19.129> that<00:03:19.159> I'm<00:03:19.340> looking<00:03:19.459> at<00:03:19.700> it<00:03:19.849> I<00:03:19.909> guess<00:03:19.940> the

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
now that I'm looking at it I guess the

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.680 
now that I'm looking at it I guess the
pants<00:03:21.489> maybe<00:03:22.489> they<00:03:22.670> were<00:03:22.730> clear<00:03:23.120> painted<00:03:23.540> with

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
pants maybe they were clear painted with

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.509 
pants maybe they were clear painted with
a<00:03:23.720> clear<00:03:24.049> brown<00:03:24.379> because<00:03:27.129> I'm<00:03:28.129> not<00:03:28.310> positive

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
a clear brown because I'm not positive

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:29.830 
a clear brown because I'm not positive
it<00:03:28.879> looks<00:03:29.030> like<00:03:29.180> they<00:03:29.329> could<00:03:29.389> be<00:03:29.569> two

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
it looks like they could be two

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.270 
it looks like they could be two
different<00:03:29.989> pieces<00:03:30.290> if<00:03:30.620> you<00:03:30.650> look<00:03:30.799> inside<00:03:30.949> you

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
different pieces if you look inside you

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.830 
different pieces if you look inside you
can<00:03:31.310> see<00:03:31.549> some<00:03:31.790> of<00:03:31.819> the<00:03:31.970> green<00:03:32.180> coming<00:03:32.569> up<00:03:32.690> in

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
can see some of the green coming up in

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.170 
can see some of the green coming up in
there<00:03:33.079> so<00:03:34.010> maybe<00:03:34.220> there<00:03:34.400> was<00:03:34.489> two<00:03:34.639> pieces<00:03:35.000> that

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
there so maybe there was two pieces that

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.020 
there so maybe there was two pieces that
end<00:03:35.329> up<00:03:35.419> gluing<00:03:35.750> together<00:03:36.459> down<00:03:37.459> here<00:03:37.699> for<00:03:37.910> the

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
end up gluing together down here for the

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.960 
end up gluing together down here for the
cuffs<00:03:38.959> I'm<00:03:39.620> not<00:03:39.829> sure<00:03:40.099> if<00:03:40.220> it's<00:03:40.370> two<00:03:40.549> pieces<00:03:40.879> or

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
cuffs I'm not sure if it's two pieces or

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.159 
cuffs I'm not sure if it's two pieces or
not<00:03:41.180> you<00:03:41.449> know<00:03:41.540> what<00:03:41.720> now<00:03:41.840> that<00:03:41.870> I'm<00:03:42.079> looking

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
at it I'm not sure it might be painted

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.629 
at it I'm not sure it might be painted
clear<00:03:44.930> for<00:03:45.169> the<00:03:45.260> Browns<00:03:45.500> I'm<00:03:45.949> not<00:03:46.099> positive<00:03:46.310> on

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639 
clear for the Browns I'm not positive on

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:49.059 
clear for the Browns I'm not positive on
that<00:03:46.930> same<00:03:47.930> thing<00:03:48.169> with<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.410> oranges<00:03:48.799> but<00:03:48.949> it

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
that same thing with the oranges but it

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:50.559 
that same thing with the oranges but it
looks<00:03:49.190> like<00:03:49.370> it's<00:03:49.519> all<00:03:49.669> separate<00:03:50.150> I'm<00:03:50.329> gonna

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
looks like it's all separate I'm gonna

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.869 
looks like it's all separate I'm gonna

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.950 
him up glowing I'm not sure if the
camera<00:06:07.700> can<00:06:07.820> handle<00:06:08.150> that<00:06:08.300> or<00:06:08.420> not<00:06:08.510> but<00:06:08.780> we're

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
camera can handle that or not but we're

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.400 
camera can handle that or not but we're
gonna<00:06:09.050> give<00:06:09.230> it<00:06:09.320> a<00:06:09.350> shot<00:06:13.870> turn<00:06:14.870> off<00:06:15.020> this<00:06:15.200> other

gonna give it a shot turn off this other

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:21.580 
gonna give it a shot turn off this other
light<00:06:19.000> yeah<00:06:20.000> it's<00:06:20.150> not<00:06:20.330> so<00:06:20.510> bad<00:06:20.780> cameras

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
light yeah it's not so bad cameras

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:22.810 
light yeah it's not so bad cameras
having<00:06:21.830> a<00:06:21.860> little<00:06:22.070> trouble<00:06:22.220> picking<00:06:22.550> it<00:06:22.730> up

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820 
having a little trouble picking it up

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.610 
having a little trouble picking it up
but<00:06:23.000> you<00:06:23.090> can<00:06:23.210> see<00:06:23.390> glows<00:06:23.780> and<00:06:24.080> glows<00:06:24.230> really

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
but you can see glows and glows really

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.260 
but you can see glows and glows really
well<00:06:24.800> it's<00:06:25.040> just<00:06:25.100> not<00:06:25.310> showing<00:06:25.670> so<00:06:25.820> great<00:06:26.090> in

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
well it's just not showing so great in

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:31.270 
well it's just not showing so great in
the<00:06:26.390> camera

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.900 

I<00:06:31.340> guess<00:06:31.760> that's<00:06:31.970> just<00:06:32.090> to<00:06:32.420> resemble<00:06:32.870> his<00:06:33.910> the

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:34.910 
I guess that's just to resemble his the

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.840 
I guess that's just to resemble his the
electrocution<00:06:35.540> attack<00:06:35.840> so<00:06:36.740> that's<00:06:37.520> fine<00:06:37.700> with

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:37.850 
electrocution attack so that's fine with

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.160 
electrocution attack so that's fine with
me<00:06:37.970> it<00:06:38.030> doesn't<00:06:38.150> have<00:06:38.330> to<00:06:38.389> be<00:06:38.510> great<00:06:38.810> but<00:06:39.020> he

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:39.170 
me it doesn't have to be great but he

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.440 
me it doesn't have to be great but he
does<00:06:39.290> glow<00:06:39.500> pretty<00:06:39.770> well<00:06:40.120> as<00:06:41.120> well<00:06:41.270> as<00:06:41.330> you

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:41.450 
does glow pretty well as well as you

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.610 
does glow pretty well as well as you
would<00:06:41.570> expect<00:06:43.780> and<00:06:44.780> get<00:06:44.930> them<00:06:45.050> all<00:06:45.200> in<00:06:45.350> a<00:06:45.410> group
