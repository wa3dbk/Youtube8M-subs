00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.789 
this case and I don't see any particles
of<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:49.209> steel<00:02:49.930> in<00:02:50.230> it<00:02:50.380> or<00:02:50.560> anything<00:02:50.950> else<00:02:51.329> so

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
of the steel in it or anything else so

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:59.370 
of the steel in it or anything else so
the<00:02:53.799> quality<00:02:54.280> of<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.959> fluid<00:02:55.959> is<00:02:56.140> good<00:02:57.329> now<00:02:58.380> how

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
the quality of the fluid is good now how

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.270 
the quality of the fluid is good now how
we<00:02:59.440> measure<00:03:00.070> correct<00:03:00.940> level<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:02.739> level<00:03:03.010> of

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
we measure correct level the level of

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.729 
we measure correct level the level of
the<00:03:03.579> fluid<00:03:04.000> in<00:03:04.150> these<00:03:04.440> transmissions<00:03:05.440> is

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
the fluid in these transmissions is

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.050 
the fluid in these transmissions is
absolutely<00:03:06.730> critical<00:03:07.200> so<00:03:08.200> I<00:03:08.700> have<00:03:09.700> to<00:03:09.910> make

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
absolutely critical so I have to make

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.470 
absolutely critical so I have to make
sure<00:03:10.120> I<00:03:10.690> will<00:03:11.109> measure<00:03:11.560> it<00:03:11.829> correctly<00:03:12.430> so<00:03:13.239> what

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
sure I will measure it correctly so what

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.979 
sure I will measure it correctly so what
I<00:03:13.510> will<00:03:13.630> do<00:03:14.049> after<00:03:14.320> a<00:03:14.620> very<00:03:15.220> long<00:03:15.400> drive<00:03:16.030> which

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
I will do after a very long drive which

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.620 
I will do after a very long drive which
ensures<00:03:17.650> that<00:03:18.040> transmission<00:03:18.609> fluid<00:03:19.120> is<00:03:19.269> very

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
ensures that transmission fluid is very

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.339 
ensures that transmission fluid is very
hot<00:03:20.019> I<00:03:20.410> will<00:03:21.220> park<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:21.819> vehicle<00:03:22.330> on<00:03:22.510> perfectly

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
hot I will park the vehicle on perfectly

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:29.790 
hot I will park the vehicle on perfectly
level<00:03:23.830> surface<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:26.550> put<00:03:27.550> this<00:03:28.530> dipstick<00:03:29.530> all

running its idling so then I will pull

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.860 
running its idling so then I will pull
it<00:03:37.269> out<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:38.200> level<00:03:38.680> should<00:03:39.550> be<00:03:39.870> right

it out and the level should be right

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.369 
it out and the level should be right
between<00:03:41.290> these<00:03:41.890> two<00:03:42.510> that's<00:03:43.510> where<00:03:44.170> it<00:03:44.349> should

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
between these two that's where it should

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:47.369 
between these two that's where it should
be<00:03:44.769> when<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.159> engine<00:03:45.610> is<00:03:45.760> hot<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.780> fluid<00:03:47.170> is

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 
be when the engine is hot the fluid is

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:49.670 
be when the engine is hot the fluid is
also<00:03:47.650> hot<00:03:48.010> transmission<00:03:48.550> fluid<00:03:48.790> is<00:03:48.940> out<00:03:49.120> and

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
also hot transmission fluid is out and

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.369 
also hot transmission fluid is out and
engine<00:03:50.680> is<00:03:50.950> at<00:03:51.400> idle<00:03:52.000> on<00:03:52.180> perfectly<00:03:52.870> level

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
engine is at idle on perfectly level

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.830 
engine is at idle on perfectly level
surface<00:03:53.860> I<00:03:54.190> repeated<00:03:55.150> it<00:03:55.269> because<00:03:55.629> it's

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
surface I repeated it because it's

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.619 
surface I repeated it because it's
absolutely<00:03:56.310> crucial<00:03:57.310> for<00:03:57.760> correct

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
absolutely crucial for correct

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:01.050 
absolutely crucial for correct
measurements<00:03:59.349> otherwise<00:03:59.950> this<00:04:00.670> will<00:04:00.879> be

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
measurements otherwise this will be

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.220 
measurements otherwise this will be
disaster<00:04:01.720> so<00:04:02.409> if<00:04:03.129> the<00:04:03.670> level<00:04:04.030> it's<00:04:04.150> low<00:04:04.690> you

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
disaster so if the level it's low you

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.009 
disaster so if the level it's low you
can<00:04:05.500> add<00:04:05.709> through<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.400> tube<00:04:07.019> additional

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
can add through the tube additional

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.020 
can add through the tube additional
fluid<00:04:08.620> which<00:04:08.800> is<00:04:08.980> correct<00:04:09.489> for<00:04:09.879> this

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
fluid which is correct for this

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.240 
fluid which is correct for this
transmission<00:04:11.549> definitely<00:04:12.599> be<00:04:13.769> clear<00:04:14.769> that

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
transmission definitely be clear that

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.409 
transmission definitely be clear that
you<00:04:15.430> don't<00:04:15.580> overfill<00:04:16.239> it

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
you don't overfill it

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.690 
you don't overfill it
mercedes-benz<00:04:17.169> it's<00:04:17.650> saying<00:04:17.919> it<00:04:18.159> should<00:04:18.549> be

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
mercedes-benz it's saying it should be

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.539 
mercedes-benz it's saying it should be
on<00:04:18.909> that<00:04:18.940> top<00:04:19.570> mark<00:04:19.989> on<00:04:20.349> the<00:04:20.530> dipstick<00:04:20.919> this<00:04:21.370> is

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
on that top mark on the dipstick this is

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.110 
on that top mark on the dipstick this is
where<00:04:21.789> it<00:04:21.940> should<00:04:22.150> be<00:04:22.360> all<00:04:22.599> the<00:04:23.200> way<00:04:23.380> up<00:04:23.620> here

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
where it should be all the way up here

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.670 
where it should be all the way up here
don't<00:04:25.120> overfill<00:04:25.960> the

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
don't overfill the

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.480 
don't overfill the
transmission<00:04:27.280> evil<00:04:28.060> damage<00:04:28.810> it<00:04:29.050> so<00:04:29.500> hopefully

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
transmission evil damage it so hopefully

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.710 
transmission evil damage it so hopefully
