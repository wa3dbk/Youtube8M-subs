the old themes to because it's the

militarization of police but this racial

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
component is just yes Hymas I mean yes

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.219 
component is just yes Hymas I mean yes
you<00:01:04.920> know<00:01:05.720> but<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.990> mean<00:01:08.299> just<00:01:09.299> no<00:01:09.780> one<00:01:10.020> would

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
you know but I mean just no one would

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.910 
you know but I mean just no one would
allow<00:01:10.350> for<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:12.200> it's<00:01:13.200> just<00:01:13.439> no<00:01:13.710> one

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
allow for this and it's just no one

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.240 
allow for this and it's just no one
would<00:01:14.100> allow<00:01:14.369> for<00:01:14.430> this<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.200> white<00:01:16.409> city

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
would allow for this in in a white city

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.700 
would allow for this in in a white city
it<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:17.820> would<00:01:18.000> not<00:01:18.210> be<00:01:18.390> allowed<00:01:18.659> sorry

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
it just would not be allowed sorry

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.920 
it just would not be allowed sorry
just<00:01:19.890> no<00:01:20.159> way<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.210> think<00:01:21.390> that's<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.720> point

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
just no way and I think that's the point

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.690 
just no way and I think that's the point
right<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.590> maybe<00:01:22.799> some<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
right is that so maybe some of the the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.719 
right is that so maybe some of the the
equipment<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.720> new<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.409> disturbing<00:01:25.770> but<00:01:26.520> like

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
equipment is new and disturbing but like

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.560 
equipment is new and disturbing but like
the<00:01:26.909> idea<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.420> police<00:01:29.210> treating<00:01:30.210> certain

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
the idea of police treating certain

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.600 
the idea of police treating certain
neighborhoods<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.140> an<00:01:31.259> occupying<00:01:31.890> military

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
neighborhoods in an occupying military

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.580 
neighborhoods in an occupying military
like<00:01:32.880> manner<00:01:33.240> but<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.750> zoom<00:01:34.110> here's<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
like manner but you zoom here's the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.830 
like manner but you zoom here's the
thing<00:01:34.799> if<00:01:35.790> you're<00:01:36.390> not<00:01:36.450> if<00:01:36.810> you're<00:01:37.049> just<00:01:37.820> if

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
thing if you're not if you're just if

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.080

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
assume that they need to be wearing this

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.320 
assume that they need to be wearing this
stuff<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:06.570> assume<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.649> they're<00:02:08.580> justified

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
stuff you assume that they're justified

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.410

in<00:02:09.599> having<00:02:09.780> these<00:02:10.170> tanks<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:11.090> it's<00:02:12.090> much

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
in having these tanks and it's much

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.370 
in having these tanks and it's much
easier<00:02:12.450> for

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
easier for

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.640 
easier for
to<00:02:13.530> assume<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:14.870> because<00:02:15.870> you're<00:02:16.410> talking

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
to assume that because you're talking

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.580 
to assume that because you're talking
about<00:02:17.390> people<00:02:18.390> who<00:02:18.720> are<00:02:18.960> living<00:02:19.200> in<00:02:19.410> abject

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
wouldn't and the other fact it has is

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.620 
wouldn't and the other fact it has is
that<00:02:45.650> if<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:47.580> cops<00:02:47.820> are<00:02:48.030> out<00:02:48.060> there<00:02:48.390> dressed

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
that if the cops are out there dressed

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.800 
that if the cops are out there dressed
like<00:02:48.780> cops<00:02:49.820> like<00:02:50.820> people<00:02:51.120> just<00:02:51.300> see<00:02:51.540> in<00:02:51.660> their

normal<00:02:52.320> day<00:02:52.500> life<00:02:54.080> it<00:02:55.130> I<00:02:58.130> think<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.250> would<00:02:59.460> make

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
normal day life it I think it would make

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.860 
normal day life it I think it would make
it<00:03:00.570> easier<00:03:01.050> to<00:03:01.940> empathize<00:03:02.940> on<00:03:03.270> some<00:03:03.510> level

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
it easier to empathize on some level

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.820 
it easier to empathize on some level
with<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.500> protesters<00:03:09.470> it's<00:03:10.470> really<00:03:10.800> a

with the protesters it's really a

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.880 
with the protesters it's really a
problem<00:03:11.310> there's<00:03:11.760> just<00:03:12.030> no<00:03:12.240> way<00:03:12.570> you<00:03:13.500> can<00:03:13.680> put
