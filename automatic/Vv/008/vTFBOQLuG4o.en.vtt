really not but I was like you know I

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.850 
really not but I was like you know I
think<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.670> could<00:01:41.850> design<00:01:42.180> something<00:01:42.210> better

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
think I could design something better

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.090 
think I could design something better
and<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:44.340> did<00:01:44.549> kind<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:46.020> my<00:01:46.229> design<00:01:46.619> for

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
and I did kind of this is my design for

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.670 
and I did kind of this is my design for
the<00:01:47.220> five<00:01:47.430> people<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.850> meet<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.210> heaven<00:01:48.680> it's

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
the five people you meet in heaven it's

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.219 
the five people you meet in heaven it's
very<00:01:50.040> badly<00:01:50.369> drawn<00:01:50.909> because<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.540> can't<00:01:51.930> drop

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
very badly drawn because I can't drop

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.219 
very badly drawn because I can't drop
there<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.159> concept<00:01:53.850> here<00:01:54.270> it's<00:01:55.020> a

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
there is a concept here it's a

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.499 
there is a concept here it's a
minimalist<00:01:56.040> thing<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:56.850> there'd<00:01:57.270> be<00:01:57.479> a

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
minimalist thing so there'd be a

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.569 
minimalist thing so there'd be a
silhouette<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.259> person<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.920> then<00:01:59.430> the

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
silhouette of a person and then the

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.940 
silhouette of a person and then the
silhouette<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.270> five<00:02:00.509> people<00:02:00.780> with<00:02:01.560> cool

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950

silhouette of the five people with cool
typography<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.329> cool<00:02:04.170> typography<00:02:04.799> but<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.340> can

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
typography and cool typography but I can
