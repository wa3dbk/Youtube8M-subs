00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
this really cool idea I think we should

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.560 
this really cool idea I think we should
do<00:00:18.449> this<00:00:18.660> thing<00:00:18.720> called<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.770> tree<00:00:20.189> for<00:00:20.520> all

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
seasons because you go through so much

it<00:00:26.849> up<00:00:26.970> all<00:00:27.150> year<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:28.279> know<00:00:29.279> some<00:00:29.910> may<00:00:30.090> think

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
it up all year I know some may think

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.979

that sounds silly me I think I would

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.440 
that sounds silly me I think I would
compromise<00:00:34.770> if<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.309> could<00:00:35.489> bring<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.820> grill<00:00:36.120> in

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
compromise if I could bring the grill in

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.619 
compromise if I could bring the grill in
all<00:00:37.200> year<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.770> watch<00:00:38.430> football<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.879> year<00:00:39.270> but

maybe nine-foot tree beautiful

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.350 
maybe nine-foot tree beautiful
artificial<00:00:55.410> I'm<00:00:55.739> allergic<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.360> evergreen

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
artificial I'm allergic to evergreen

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.420 
artificial I'm allergic to evergreen
isn't<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.809> nice<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:59.070> tree<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.399> very

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
isn't that nice and this tree is very

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.740 
isn't that nice and this tree is very
difficult<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.030> put<00:01:00.149> together<00:01:00.239> because<00:01:00.600> it's

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
difficult to put together because it's

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.510 
difficult to put together because it's
branch<00:01:01.020> by<00:01:01.260> branch<00:01:01.289> by<00:01:01.739> branch<00:01:01.770> then<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.399> have

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
branch by branch by branch then you have

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.490 
branch by branch by branch then you have
to<00:01:02.609> wrap<00:01:02.879> all<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.600> lights<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:06.020> know<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.290> know

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
to wrap all the lights I know you know

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.490 
to wrap all the lights I know you know
how<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.920> but<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:09.030> keep<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.360> sparkly<00:01:10.020> well

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
how it is but to keep it sparkly well

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.289 
how it is but to keep it sparkly well
here's<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.950> secret<00:01:11.310> for<00:01:11.490> any<00:01:11.640> type<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:11.970> tree

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
here's the secret for any type of tree

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.940 
here's the secret for any type of tree
when<00:01:12.479> you're<00:01:12.630> doing<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.080> lighting<00:01:13.320> lighting

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
when you're doing the lighting lighting

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.980 
when you're doing the lighting lighting
is<00:01:14.070> key<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.580> they<00:01:14.729> almost<00:01:14.880> say<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.509> for

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
is key and they almost say that for

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.350 
is key and they almost say that for
every<00:01:16.140> foot<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.650> want<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.100> hundred<00:01:17.520> lights<00:01:17.790> and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
every foot you want a hundred lights and

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.940 
every foot you want a hundred lights and
you<00:01:18.630> want<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.869> make<00:01:19.049> sure<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.619> start

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
you want to make sure that you start

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.039 
you want to make sure that you start
from<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.400> center<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:20.909> work<00:01:21.150> your<00:01:21.600> lights<00:01:21.810> out

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
from the center and work your lights out

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.830 
from the center and work your lights out
so<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.590> get<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.950> really<00:01:23.250> sparkly<00:01:23.880> tree<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
so to get that a really sparkly tree the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.420 
so to get that a really sparkly tree the
more<00:01:25.049> lights<00:01:25.320> if<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.560> work<00:01:25.830> them<00:01:26.009> into<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
more lights if you work them into the

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.700 
more lights if you work them into the
branches<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.060> then<00:01:27.420> work<00:01:27.720> your<00:01:27.750> way<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.380> and

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
branches and then work your way in and

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.109 
branches and then work your way in and
if<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.250> notice<00:01:29.549> here<00:01:29.700> it's<00:01:29.820> probably<00:01:30.090> a

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
if you notice here it's probably a

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.760 
if you notice here it's probably a
little<00:01:30.299> hard<00:01:30.509> Cherie<00:01:31.110> doesn't<00:01:31.439> let<00:01:31.590> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
little hard Cherie doesn't let the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.710 
little hard Cherie doesn't let the
lights<00:01:32.159> stick<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.939> end<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.299> branches

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
lights stick on the end of the branches

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.300 
lights stick on the end of the branches
she<00:01:33.869> actually<00:01:34.170> works<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.770> man<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.159> that

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
she actually works that man and that

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.910 
she actually works that man and that
helps<00:01:35.610> create<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.090> really<00:01:36.750> magical<00:01:37.380> sparkly

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
helps create that really magical sparkly

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.340 
helps create that really magical sparkly
tree<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.430> think<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:39.000> too<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.299> then<00:01:39.780> obviously

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
tree I think so too and then obviously

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.410 
tree I think so too and then obviously
it's<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.619> ornaments<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.490> do<00:01:41.820> my<00:01:42.060> Christmas

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420

to show a little bit of the snow for the
season<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.130> start<00:01:47.670> with<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.210> know<00:01:48.299> adding<00:01:48.630> some

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
season I start with you know adding some

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.929 
season I start with you know adding some
branches<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.380> have<00:01:49.530> snow<00:01:49.890> on<00:01:49.920> them<00:01:50.280> kind<00:01:50.909> of

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
branches that have snow on them kind of

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.590 
and and then for the red and white I
found<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.340> little<00:01:56.520> roping<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.329> have

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
found this little roping that I have

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.840 
found this little roping that I have
sort<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.840> woven<00:01:58.259> through<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.500> tree<00:01:58.950> certainly

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
sort of woven through the tree certainly

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.420 
sort of woven through the tree certainly
candy<00:02:00.270> canes<00:02:00.509> in<00:02:00.689> red<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.020> white<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:02.250> might

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
candy canes in red and white you might

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.850 
candy canes in red and white you might
notice<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.820> have<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.000> red<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.630> white<00:02:03.860> simple

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
notice I have a red and white simple

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.950 
notice I have a red and white simple
round<00:02:05.070> ball<00:02:05.369> ornament<00:02:05.909> here<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.360> what<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.840> do

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
round ball ornament here and what I do

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.109 
round ball ornament here and what I do
is<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.380> take<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.979> regular<00:02:08.340> little<00:02:08.580> hook<00:02:08.910> that

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
is I take the regular little hook that

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.210 
is I take the regular little hook that
you<00:02:09.270> always<00:02:09.450> use<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.530> just<00:02:10.560> put<00:02:10.950> two

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
you always use and I just put two

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.040 
you always use and I just put two
ornaments<00:02:11.520> on

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
ornaments on

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.660 
ornaments on
instead<00:02:12.350> of<00:02:12.440> one<00:02:12.710> and<00:02:12.980> I<00:02:13.040> think<00:02:13.100> that's<00:02:13.400> kind

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
instead of one and I think that's kind

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.970 
instead of one and I think that's kind
of<00:02:13.730> fun<00:02:14.420> looking<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:15.230> with<00:02:15.560> this<00:02:15.680> I<00:02:15.830> can

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
of fun looking and with this I can

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.590 
of fun looking and with this I can
almost<00:02:16.100> bend<00:02:16.490> the<00:02:16.610> branch<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:17.180> to<00:02:17.300> make<00:02:17.450> sure

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
almost bend the branch to to make sure

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.420 
almost bend the branch to to make sure
these<00:02:17.750> don't<00:02:17.990> fall<00:02:18.170> off<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:18.500> tree<00:02:18.740> you<00:02:19.160> know<00:02:19.280> I

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
these don't fall off the tree you know I

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.910 
these don't fall off the tree you know I
like<00:02:19.850> are<00:02:20.090> these<00:02:20.300> larger<00:02:20.930> bulbs<00:02:21.440> that<00:02:21.530> you

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
like are these larger bulbs that you

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.920 
like are these larger bulbs that you
have<00:02:22.100> in<00:02:22.280> ornaments<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.120> I<00:02:23.480> always<00:02:23.720> thought

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
have in ornaments and I always thought

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.360 
have in ornaments and I always thought
that<00:02:24.140> you<00:02:24.230> had<00:02:24.350> to<00:02:24.380> start<00:02:24.680> with<00:02:24.770> the<00:02:24.980> smaller

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
that you had to start with the smaller

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.610 
that you had to start with the smaller
and<00:02:25.760> then<00:02:26.000> work<00:02:26.270> your<00:02:26.420> way<00:02:26.480> down<00:02:26.840> so<00:02:27.290> the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
and then work your way down so the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.830 
and then work your way down so the
larger<00:02:28.010> ones<00:02:28.190> at<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.490> base<00:02:28.670> of<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:28.970> tree<00:02:29.240> but

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
larger ones at the base of the tree but

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.230 
larger ones at the base of the tree but
you've<00:02:30.050> done<00:02:30.260> almost<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:31.160> opposite<00:02:31.760> or<00:02:31.970> you

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
you've done almost the opposite or you

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.490 
you've done almost the opposite or you
mix<00:02:32.570> and<00:02:32.810> match

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
mix and match

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.920 
mix and match
there's<00:02:33.950> even<00:02:34.250> larger<00:02:34.610> objects<00:02:35.510> up<00:02:35.690> on<00:02:35.840> the

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
there's even larger objects up on the

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.590 
there's even larger objects up on the
top<00:02:36.170> of<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.470> tree<00:02:36.770> large<00:02:37.550> I<00:02:37.820> love<00:02:38.150> that<00:02:38.390> it

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
top of the tree large I love that it

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.080 
top of the tree large I love that it
creates<00:02:38.990> almost<00:02:39.170> a<00:02:39.410> bigger<00:02:39.620> scale<00:02:39.980> tree<00:02:40.430> well

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
creates almost a bigger scale tree well

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.970 
creates almost a bigger scale tree well
when<00:02:41.510> you<00:02:41.600> see<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.870> large<00:02:42.110> ornament<00:02:42.650> against

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
when you see the large ornament against

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.350 
when you see the large ornament against
the<00:02:43.100> smaller<00:02:43.430> portion<00:02:43.880> of<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.120> tree

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
the smaller portion of the tree

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.940 
the smaller portion of the tree
obviously<00:02:44.930> it<00:02:45.020> stands<00:02:45.260> out<00:02:45.410> is<00:02:45.650> more<00:02:45.800> dramatic

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
obviously it stands out is more dramatic

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.810 
obviously it stands out is more dramatic
and<00:02:46.580> I<00:02:47.120> actually<00:02:47.270> have<00:02:47.690> some<00:02:48.050> fun<00:02:48.920> wires<00:02:49.250> here

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
and I actually have some fun wires here

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.790 
and I actually have some fun wires here
that<00:02:50.030> I<00:02:50.060> wire<00:02:50.450> into<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.870> tree<00:02:51.260> so<00:02:51.440> that<00:02:51.530> the

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
that I wire into the tree so that the

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.170 
that I wire into the tree so that the
ornaments<00:02:52.280> aren't<00:02:52.490> even<00:02:52.640> on<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.880> tree

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
ornaments aren't even on the tree

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.270 
ornaments aren't even on the tree
they're<00:02:53.780> sticking<00:02:54.200> out<00:02:54.350> from<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.770> tree<00:02:55.040> so

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
they're sticking out from the tree so

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.680 
they're sticking out from the tree so
you<00:02:55.310> can't<00:02:55.640> get<00:02:55.790> too<00:02:55.910> close<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.150> it<00:02:56.300> get<00:02:56.480> poked

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
you can't get too close to it get poked

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.440 
you can't get too close to it get poked
in<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.840> eye<00:02:56.960> I<00:02:57.590> mean<00:02:58.340> this<00:02:58.610> is<00:02:58.790> a<00:02:58.820> lovely<00:02:59.210> tree

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450
