you<00:00:16.710> might<00:00:16.920> think<00:00:17.100> that<00:00:17.160> that's<00:00:17.310> quite

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
you might think that that's quite

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.450

expensive<00:00:18.029> for<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.449> new<00:00:18.720> doll<00:00:19.160> and<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.279> actually

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
expensive for a new doll and I actually

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.519 
expensive for a new doll and I actually
think<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.060> too<00:00:21.330> but<00:00:21.660> then<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.990> thing<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.320> I

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
think so too but then the thing is I

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.650 
think so too but then the thing is I
actually<00:00:22.769> had<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.640> 30<00:00:23.970> percent<00:00:24.210> off<00:00:24.390> coupon

which I use on these three dolls and I

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.990 
which I use on these three dolls and I
only<00:00:27.689> paid<00:00:28.050> $6.99<00:00:28.859> per<00:00:29.160> doll<00:00:29.429> if<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.910> go

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
only paid $6.99 per doll if you go
