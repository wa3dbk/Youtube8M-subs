00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
colored weapon and we don't really have

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.719 
colored weapon and we don't really have
that<00:01:16.150> many<00:01:16.270> colored<00:01:16.750> deer<00:01:16.990> battle<00:01:17.650> rifles<00:01:18.040> so

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
very nice there's only been one masked

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.999 
very nice there's only been one masked
marine<00:01:21.909> released<00:01:22.299> before<00:01:22.509> and<00:01:23.229> as<00:01:23.740> you<00:01:23.890> can

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
marine released before and as you can

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.920 
marine released before and as you can
see<00:01:24.399> it's<00:01:24.670> a<00:01:24.759> completely<00:01:25.240> different<00:01:25.540> mold

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
see it's a completely different mold

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.620 
see it's a completely different mold
they've<00:01:26.170> changed<00:01:26.409> a<00:01:26.590> lot<00:01:26.829> since<00:01:27.159> then<00:01:27.460> and<00:01:27.640> I

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
they've changed a lot since then and I

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.230 
they've changed a lot since then and I
much<00:01:29.079> prefer<00:01:29.500> this<00:01:29.680> in<00:01:29.950> a<00:01:30.040> much<00:01:30.250> darker<00:01:30.610> black

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
much prefer this in a much darker black

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.139 
much prefer this in a much darker black
color<00:01:31.750> compared<00:01:32.200> to<00:01:32.290> this<00:01:32.409> sort<00:01:33.100> of<00:01:33.219> grey

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
color compared to this sort of grey

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.749 
color compared to this sort of grey
color<00:01:34.540> and<00:01:34.869> just<00:01:35.439> the<00:01:35.619> overall<00:01:35.979> mould<00:01:36.520> with

the nice detailing of a nice mould on
the<00:01:39.070> actual<00:01:39.610> sleeves<00:01:40.600> is<00:01:40.930> a<00:01:40.990> much<00:01:41.979> nicer

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
the actual sleeves is a much nicer

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.609 
the actual sleeves is a much nicer
effect<00:01:42.729> than<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.329> old<00:01:43.540> Marine<00:01:43.990> so<00:01:44.320> a<00:01:44.350> very

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619

now<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.399> cyclopses<00:01:52.329> were<00:01:52.509> released<00:01:52.990> in<00:01:53.350> two

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
now the cyclopses were released in two

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.459 
now the cyclopses were released in two
waves<00:01:54.250> this<00:01:54.729> year<00:01:55.119> at<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:55.930> very<00:01:55.960> beginning<00:01:56.409> of

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
waves this year at the very beginning of

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.350 
waves this year at the very beginning of
the<00:01:56.590> year<00:01:56.740> we<00:01:56.979> had<00:01:57.189> the<00:01:57.399> jungle<00:01:57.939> and<00:01:58.149> desert

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
the year we had the jungle and desert

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.080 
the year we had the jungle and desert
Cyclops<00:01:59.109> which<00:01:59.829> were<00:02:00.039> actually<00:02:00.189> the<00:02:00.609> exact

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
Cyclops which were actually the exact

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.880 
Cyclops which were actually the exact
same<00:02:01.420> in<00:02:01.630> every<00:02:01.869> way<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:02.289> now<00:02:02.469> we've<00:02:02.680> got

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
same in every way and now we've got

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.149 
same in every way and now we've got
these<00:02:03.039> two<00:02:03.310> new<00:02:03.520> ones<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:04.450> TAC<00:02:05.350> Cyclops<00:02:06.009> and

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
these two new ones the TAC Cyclops and

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.240 
these two new ones the TAC Cyclops and
this<00:02:06.549> Arctic<00:02:07.060> Cyclops<00:02:07.570> so<00:02:08.410> this<00:02:08.770> is<00:02:08.920> actually

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
this Arctic Cyclops so this is actually

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.640 
this Arctic Cyclops so this is actually
really<00:02:09.580> nice<00:02:09.789> they've<00:02:10.300> not<00:02:10.750> changed<00:02:11.290> anything

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
really nice they've not changed anything

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.220 
really nice they've not changed anything
on<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.010> actual<00:02:12.310> mould<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:12.879> the<00:02:13.000> Cyclops<00:02:13.450> apart

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
on the actual mould of the Cyclops apart

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.199 
on the actual mould of the Cyclops apart
from<00:02:14.379> adding<00:02:14.530> these<00:02:14.830> two<00:02:15.099> pieces<00:02:15.400> here<00:02:15.640> on<00:02:16.060> the

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
from adding these two pieces here on the

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:16.600 
from adding these two pieces here on the
top

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
top

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.780 
top
but<00:02:17.270> it<00:02:17.390> is<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.570> very<00:02:17.870> nice<00:02:18.140> design<00:02:18.470> people<00:02:19.190> have

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
but it is a very nice design people have

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.290 
but it is a very nice design people have
given<00:02:20.240> a<00:02:20.330> bit<00:02:20.510> of<00:02:21.340> discredit<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.370> this<00:02:22.610> set

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
given a bit of discredit to this set

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.270 
given a bit of discredit to this set
they<00:02:23.750> say<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:24.440> most<00:02:24.650> of<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.770> cyclopses

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
they say that most of the cyclopses

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.980 
they say that most of the cyclopses
aren't<00:02:25.520> really<00:02:25.730> worth<00:02:25.880> 15<00:02:26.270> pounds

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
aren't really worth 15 pounds

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.080 
aren't really worth 15 pounds
I<00:02:27.020> actually<00:02:27.560> beg<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.130> differ<00:02:28.340> they're<00:02:28.640> really

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
I actually beg to differ they're really

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.860 
I actually beg to differ they're really
nice<00:02:30.040> complete<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.220> robust<00:02:31.580> vehicles<00:02:32.210> they

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
nice complete and robust vehicles they

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.990 
nice complete and robust vehicles they
they<00:02:33.410> won't<00:02:33.590> break<00:02:33.950> under<00:02:34.220> any<00:02:34.460> impact

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
they won't break under any impact

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.390 
they won't break under any impact
they're<00:02:35.570> not<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.840> very<00:02:36.110> nice<00:02:36.320> build<00:02:36.800> I<00:02:37.220> mean

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
they're not a very nice build I mean

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.490 
they're not a very nice build I mean
they<00:02:37.670> are<00:02:37.880> only<00:02:38.090> made<00:02:38.390> up<00:02:38.540> of<00:02:38.690> 60<00:02:39.080> odd<00:02:39.200> pieces

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
they are only made up of 60 odd pieces

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.010 
they are only made up of 60 odd pieces
and<00:02:39.950> they<00:02:40.880> take<00:02:41.150> a<00:02:41.180> couple<00:02:41.570> of<00:02:41.660> minutes<00:02:41.900> to

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
and they take a couple of minutes to

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.449 
and they take a couple of minutes to
build<00:02:42.200> so<00:02:42.470> if<00:02:42.620> you<00:02:42.770> if<00:02:42.980> you're<00:02:43.130> into<00:02:43.370> the

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
build so if you if you're into the

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.730 
build so if you if you're into the
building<00:02:43.820> aspect<00:02:44.060> of<00:02:44.420> this<00:02:44.570> it's<00:02:45.290> not<00:02:45.530> really

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
building aspect of this it's not really

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.260 
building aspect of this it's not really
the<00:02:45.830> set<00:02:46.010> for<00:02:46.220> you<00:02:46.310> but<00:02:46.520> it<00:02:46.610> is<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:46.760> fantastic

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
the set for you but it is a fantastic

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.980 
the set for you but it is a fantastic
set<00:02:47.840> otherwise<00:02:48.820> so<00:02:49.820> other<00:02:50.060> than<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.360> standard

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
set otherwise so other than the standard

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.550 
set otherwise so other than the standard

my reviews you know that I actually

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.000 
my reviews you know that I actually
despise<00:03:35.630> the<00:03:36.019> stickers<00:03:36.440> because<00:03:36.769> they<00:03:36.920> had

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
despise the stickers because they had

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.070 
despise the stickers because they had
horrible<00:03:37.580> bubbling<00:03:38.150> effect<00:03:38.510> to<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:38.780> actual

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
horrible bubbling effect to the actual

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.259 
horrible bubbling effect to the actual
vehicles<00:03:39.530> and<00:03:39.830> they're<00:03:40.459> just<00:03:40.670> not<00:03:40.760> very<00:03:40.820> nice

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
vehicles and they're just not very nice
