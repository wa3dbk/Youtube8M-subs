00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:29.580 

you

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.860 

with<00:00:30.590> us<00:00:30.740> we<00:00:30.920> have<00:00:30.949> among<00:00:31.550> the<00:00:31.820> most<00:00:32.029> respected

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
with us we have among the most respected

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.710 
with us we have among the most respected
overclockers<00:00:33.769> in<00:00:34.100> the<00:00:34.370> indie<00:00:34.640> community

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.480 

what<00:00:39.140> we're<00:00:39.380> trying<00:00:39.590> to<00:00:39.770> do<00:00:39.920> is<00:00:40.100> see<00:00:40.250> what<00:00:40.370> we

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:40.490 
what we're trying to do is see what we

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.420 
what we're trying to do is see what we
can<00:00:40.610> do<00:00:40.700> with<00:00:40.760> AMD<00:00:41.060> FX<00:00:41.650> the<00:00:42.650> question<00:00:43.010> is<00:00:43.130> just

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
can do with AMD FX the question is just

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.820 
can do with AMD FX the question is just
how<00:00:43.580> far<00:00:44.030> here<00:00:44.540> we<00:00:44.750> go<00:00:44.930> so<00:00:45.410> we're<00:00:45.530> not<00:00:45.560> running

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
how far here we go so we're not running

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.590 
how far here we go so we're not running
any<00:00:46.040> benchmarks<00:00:46.310> we're<00:00:46.700> just<00:00:46.880> shooting<00:00:47.300> for

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
any benchmarks we're just shooting for

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.720 
any benchmarks we're just shooting for
the<00:00:47.630> highest<00:00:47.810> si<00:00:48.470> tu<00:00:48.710> z<00:00:48.920> then<00:00:49.190> we<00:00:49.280> boot<00:00:49.430> up<00:00:49.580> from

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
the highest si tu z then we boot up from

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.630 
the highest si tu z then we boot up from
the<00:00:49.850> bias<00:00:50.030> pretty<00:00:50.750> save<00:00:51.050> easy<00:00:51.980> settings<00:00:52.460> and

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
the bias pretty save easy settings and

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.790 
the bias pretty save easy settings and
then<00:00:52.940> we'll<00:00:53.630> adjust<00:00:53.930> the<00:00:54.110> frequencies<00:00:54.590> on<00:00:54.710> the

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
then we'll adjust the frequencies on the

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.740 
then we'll adjust the frequencies on the
fly<00:00:55.010> just<00:00:55.430> seeing<00:00:55.700> how<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:55.910> frequency<00:00:56.480> scale

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
fly just seeing how the frequency scale

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.500 
fly just seeing how the frequency scale
is<00:00:56.930> going<00:00:56.990> from<00:00:57.380> air<00:00:57.680> water<00:00:57.980> face<00:00:58.520> with<00:00:59.210> stream

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
is going from air water face with stream

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.630 
is going from air water face with stream
so<00:01:00.260> we're<00:01:00.410> just<00:01:00.440> going<00:01:00.770> off<00:01:01.040> little<00:01:01.430> by<00:01:01.520> little

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
so we're just going off little by little

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.270 
so we're just going off little by little
7<00:01:02.239> gigahertz<00:01:02.890> so<00:01:03.890> far<00:01:04.160> no<00:01:04.790> problem<00:01:06.220> these<00:01:07.220> days

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
7 gigahertz so far no problem these days

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.480 
7 gigahertz so far no problem these days
we've<00:01:07.790> kind<00:01:08.120> of<00:01:08.240> stepped<00:01:08.660> it<00:01:08.840> up<00:01:08.930> a<00:01:09.080> bit<00:01:09.310> we<00:01:10.310> run

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
we've kind of stepped it up a bit we run

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.950 
we've kind of stepped it up a bit we run
liquid<00:01:10.790> nitrogen<00:01:11.150> it's<00:01:11.570> kind<00:01:11.780> of<00:01:11.900> a

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
liquid nitrogen it's kind of a

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.810 
liquid nitrogen it's kind of a
preliminary<00:01:12.229> test<00:01:12.500> for<00:01:12.920> us<00:01:12.979> and<00:01:13.490> it's<00:01:13.640> bit

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
preliminary test for us and it's bit

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.219 
preliminary test for us and it's bit
overclocking<00:01:14.450> for<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.660> rest<00:01:14.840> of<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.020> world

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
overclocking for the rest of the world

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.420 
overclocking for the rest of the world
for<00:01:15.470> a<00:01:15.500> long<00:01:15.680> time<00:01:15.890> 7<00:01:16.460> 873<00:01:17.410> getting<00:01:18.410> any<00:01:19.100> closer

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
for a long time 7 873 getting any closer

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:28.760 
for a long time 7 873 getting any closer

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.490 

when<00:01:29.430> we<00:01:29.549> switch<00:01:29.759> over<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.030> helium<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.990> base

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500

when we switch over to helium the base
temperature<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.310> usually<00:01:32.369> be<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:33.000> between

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420

negative 220 and 230 8.33 five megahertz
that<00:01:39.600> was<00:01:39.719> the<00:01:39.869> highest<00:01:40.289> cpu<00:01:40.860> frequency<00:01:41.100> ever

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
that was the highest cpu frequency ever

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.480 
that was the highest cpu frequency ever
and<00:01:42.329> we<00:01:42.750> had<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.170> virus<00:01:43.350> scanner<00:01:43.890> enabled

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
and we had the virus scanner enabled

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.480 
and we had the virus scanner enabled
let's<00:01:44.819> see<00:01:45.000> if<00:01:45.119> we<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:45.450> go<00:01:45.600> higher<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:49.490> this

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
let's see if we can go higher so this

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.679 
let's see if we can go higher so this
would<00:01:50.670> be<00:01:50.700> 8<00:01:51.030> 420<00:01:51.840> we<00:01:52.500> can<00:01:52.619> make<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.950> 8<00:01:53.670> for<00:01:54.060> 29

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:05.500 

congratulations<00:01:57.689> everyone<00:01:57.990> an<00:01:58.350> awesome

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.570
