00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.100
 that this pleasure 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.029
 the saint germain paris receives toulouse 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.980
 for the tenth day of lnh victory 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.720
 imperative after the disappointment 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.890
 kiel in the first leg the parisians 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.360
 quickly take the game to their account 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.220
 after 20 minutes of play 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.140
 already five goals from advanced everyone 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.950
 takes part in the offensive recital but 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.340
 leach four goals 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.020
 a small email gunnarsson 3 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.550
 in the second half philippe keep have 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.020
 blowing his frames being a 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.740
 new three-day defense of 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.740
 moving to it 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.320
 Paris sees its gap shrink but 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.540
 wins a convincing victory 34-31 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.220
 nice collective benefit with a 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.399
 first half time very good bill 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.960
 the match was well under control of our 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.680
 share so it's still a point 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.019
 positive before the game so he the match 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.850
 back we approach with hope 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.409
 even though we know it's the catheter 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.940
 World bad bank we know that this is 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.250
 extremely difficult to impose but 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.090
 given the look of the first leg we can 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.070
 to say that there is still a small 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.000
 chance to be able to try a shot and I 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.479
 believe we have to get there and 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.479
 a lot of ambition 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.100
 we must act quickly 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.420
 here you can think daniel narcissus and 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.160
 his teammates to foil 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:33.770
 the kiel team and his ball climbs 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:36.380
 fast the start of the match of the Parisians 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.310
 and twirling solid defense attack 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.200
 placed in success 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.470
 and as usual exploits 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.080
 individual +1 for bets at the end of 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.580
 thirty minutes of very high level 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.500
 Marko Vujin wake up and revive his 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.080
 in the second act thanks to his arm 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.090
 left overpowered 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.440
 ditches gnac and khagne alas take the 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.130
 relay and annihilates the hopes 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.980
 Parisian 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.000
 paris finally bows 29 33 but 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.000
 do not be ashamed of his performance 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.210
 we really really have these forty 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.450
 good very good minutes of very high 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.790
 level and you have to ask the guys to 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.709
 stay at that level because it's 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.910
 so we'll get there 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.260
 for the Parisian derby philippe 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.250
 keep years can count on the return 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.239
 from one of his frames 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.980
 luc abalo wounded for six weeks 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.290
 this second place I think it's 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.730
 this is unfortunately because 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.590
 I always hope better for the group 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.989
 but know we 'll say it's normal 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.420
 but I think that if we continue to 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.830
 work like that there will be 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.900
 evolution during the season after one 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.489
 will see where s is our place and the 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.959
 first place and must get used to 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.160
 be done first happened some 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.840
 difficult thing 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.880
 who knows how to do it and we have to take 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.849
 precisely of these teams there to go there 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.730
 if we work well we can always 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.470
 hope to win this championship there it takes 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.760
 not to give up here we are in 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.410
 a situation that is not nice but 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.080
 I think in the history of 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.400
 of our sport there are lifts like 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.160
 that we were done and so that's 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.160
 feasible I hope it must be done 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.670
 or
