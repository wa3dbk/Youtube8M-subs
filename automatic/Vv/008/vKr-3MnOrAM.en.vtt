00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
the saturated fat cause heart attacks

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.690 
the saturated fat cause heart attacks
necessarily<00:00:59.559> there's<00:01:00.070> so<00:01:00.160> many<00:01:00.250> myths<00:01:00.460> out

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
necessarily there's so many myths out

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.549 
necessarily there's so many myths out
there<00:01:00.760> about<00:01:00.940> health<00:01:01.300> care<00:01:01.510> and<00:01:01.780> you<00:01:02.350> know<00:01:02.440> the

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
there about health care and you know the

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.139 
there about health care and you know the
truth<00:01:02.739> is<00:01:02.829> we<00:01:02.950> use<00:01:03.039> a<00:01:03.070> ton<00:01:03.309> of<00:01:03.340> butter<00:01:03.579> and

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
truth is we use a ton of butter and

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:05.880 
truth is we use a ton of butter and
historically<00:01:04.989> people<00:01:05.229> used<00:01:05.409> a<00:01:05.500> lot<00:01:05.619> of<00:01:05.740> butter

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
historically people used a lot of butter

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:06.840 
historically people used a lot of butter
and<00:01:05.950> there<00:01:06.100> were<00:01:06.159> never<00:01:06.250> any<00:01:06.340> heart<00:01:06.610> attacks

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
and there were never any heart attacks

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:07.980 
and there were never any heart attacks
it<00:01:06.940> was<00:01:07.030> only<00:01:07.119> when<00:01:07.270> we<00:01:07.390> started<00:01:07.630> using<00:01:07.750> things

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
it was only when we started using things

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.570 
it was only when we started using things
like<00:01:08.080> margarine<00:01:08.530> and<00:01:08.710> corn<00:01:08.920> oil<00:01:09.010> and<00:01:09.250> all<00:01:09.400> that

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
like margarine and corn oil and all that

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.490 
like margarine and corn oil and all that
so<00:01:10.240> we<00:01:10.270> will<00:01:10.510> use<00:01:10.600> a<00:01:10.659> ton<00:01:10.930> of<00:01:10.960> butter<00:01:11.200> in<00:01:11.350> this

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
so we will use a ton of butter in this

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.500 
so we will use a ton of butter in this
and<00:01:11.850> whoops<00:01:12.850> there<00:01:13.119> we<00:01:13.150> go

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
and whoops there we go

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.510 
and whoops there we go
we'll<00:01:13.930> use<00:01:13.960> salt<00:01:14.320> and<00:01:14.440> pepper<00:01:14.650> when<00:01:15.369> we're

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
we'll use salt and pepper when we're

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.859 
we'll use salt and pepper when we're
done<00:01:15.670> we'll<00:01:15.850> actually<00:01:16.090> put<00:01:16.210> some<00:01:16.330> chives<00:01:16.630> in

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
done we'll actually put some chives in

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.690 
done we'll actually put some chives in
it<00:01:16.990> as<00:01:17.080> well<00:01:17.290> and<00:01:17.770> this<00:01:18.010> is<00:01:18.130> no<00:01:18.250> good<00:01:18.430> for<00:01:18.640> you

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
it as well and this is no good for you

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.300
