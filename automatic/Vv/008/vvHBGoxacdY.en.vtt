00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:21.630

 good child early you're fine yes then 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.570
 I have a little riddle 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.500
 a quick question to ask yourself 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.330
 you send your greeting cards all to 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.769
 its be quiet you have until 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.690
 January 30 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.460
 it is the tradition it is the occasion 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.460
 also for me to teach you to 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.710
 write a letter a letter because 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.379
 you'll use it all the way 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.170
 your life so green a little game I 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.570
 will you leave ten minutes for 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.020
 write a letter to the person of your 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:56.809
 choice 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.809
 you understand 5 4 3 2 1 go 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.270
 no 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.290
 then there is good and there is at least 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.270
 well when we write a letter 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.200
 color is preferably used 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.799
 black possibly blue 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.240
 we will assume that this table 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.960
 okay is a piece of paper to 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.240
 letters so here in water in the corner one 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.539
 writing the place where one is we start to 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.810
 the other side of the paper and one writes 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:58.020
 dear mr or mom you take the first 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.750
 dear letter and align you all 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.729
 your all your writings but we sign 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.750
 always below and we put our things 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.190
 seems stupid to write a 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.549
 envelope and well no it's not so 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.890
 simple 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:13.769
 on an envelope we always write 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.750
 sir let's admit that sir 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:23.579
 is called stone on may be sir and 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:24.900
 madame pierre dupont listen to me well 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.209
 because it gets complicated 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.910
 and if we write like madam dupont we 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.940
 write what exactly 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.410
 sir and madam pierre dupont if you 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.410
 do not write case madame dupont 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.790
 you will put madame pierre dupont if 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.040
 you do not have the courage to write 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.510
 sir and madam we put an m with a 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.670
 dot and madam mm 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.650
 still a little thing to know and 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.790
 after you will know everything and you will not have 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.250
 further to fool you 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.230
 when you write to family and to 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.540
 friends when we thought a 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.299
 intimate correspondence 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.859
 we use a square envelope in 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.269
 revenge when it's a match 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:08.420
 professional we use an envelope 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:11.069
 rectangular when you are going to send 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.959
 a letter to family or friends 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.209
 in a square envelope you go 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.939
 fold your sheet in four in 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.620
