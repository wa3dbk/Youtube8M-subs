make sure that as you drill it it's on
the<00:01:49.980> center<00:01:50.280> wait<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:52.110> when<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.620> put<00:01:53.250> some

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
the center wait so when you put some

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.160 
the center wait so when you put some
pressure<00:01:53.820> or<00:01:54.240> put<00:01:54.540> some<00:01:55.250> force<00:01:56.570> you<00:01:57.570> must<00:01:57.810> turn

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
pressure or put some force you must turn

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.570 
pressure or put some force you must turn
your<00:01:58.470> hand<00:01:59.310> slightly<00:01:59.670> a<00:02:00.060> little<00:02:00.710> so<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.740> it's

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
your hand slightly a little so that it's

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:12.310 
your hand slightly a little so that it's
easier<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.860> pierce<00:02:04.860> through<00:02:05.190> the<00:02:05.400> governor

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.610 

just<00:02:13.320> like<00:02:13.560> that

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
just like that

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.610 
just like that
now<00:02:16.880> there<00:02:17.880> are<00:02:17.970> two<00:02:18.120> ways<00:02:18.150> that<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:19.470> can

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
now there are two ways that you can

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.380 
now there are two ways that you can
drink<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.310> coho<00:02:20.580> duck<00:02:20.790> juice

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
drink the coho duck juice

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:28.120 
drink the coho duck juice
first<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:23.130> by<00:02:24.020> pouring<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:25.170> in<00:02:26.070> a<00:02:26.160> glass

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
first is by pouring it in a glass

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.980 
first is by pouring it in a glass
there<00:02:30.070> but<00:02:31.070> first<00:02:31.370> you<00:02:32.270> must<00:02:32.450> remove<00:02:32.780> it

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
there but first you must remove it

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.140 
there but first you must remove it
because<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.650> piece<00:02:34.100> of<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.580> coconut<00:02:34.970> blocks

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
because a piece of the coconut blocks

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.320 
because a piece of the coconut blocks
the<00:02:38.150> juice<00:02:38.360> in<00:02:38.870> flowing<00:02:39.170> so<00:02:40.040> you<00:02:41.000> have<00:02:41.150> to

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
the juice in flowing so you have to

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.640 
the juice in flowing so you have to
remove<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:43.360> there<00:02:44.360> so<00:02:44.750> you<00:02:44.840> can<00:02:44.960> see<00:02:45.140> there's<00:02:45.500> a

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
remove it there so you can see there's a

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.040 
remove it there so you can see there's a
blockage<00:02:46.720> so<00:02:47.720> first

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
blockage so first

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.220 
blockage so first
you<00:02:50.050> can<00:02:50.200> use<00:02:50.380> chopstick<00:02:51.040> or<00:02:51.250> whatever<00:02:52.230> then

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
you can use chopstick or whatever then

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.360 
you can use chopstick or whatever then
put<00:02:54.010> this<00:02:54.160> here<00:02:55.680> then<00:02:56.680> you<00:02:56.800> just<00:02:56.980> have<00:02:57.100> to<00:02:57.220> push

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
put this here then you just have to push

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.400 
put this here then you just have to push
it<00:02:57.520> up<00:02:57.730> okay<00:02:58.630> that's<00:02:58.990> easy<00:02:59.790> then<00:03:00.790> back<00:03:01.060> again

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:15.810 

then<00:03:05.410> you<00:03:05.470> pour<00:03:05.650> it<00:03:12.330> easy<00:03:13.330> right<00:03:13.630> and<00:03:14.820> the
