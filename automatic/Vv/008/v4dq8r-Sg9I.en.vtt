rare next season big overall I mean this

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.260 
rare next season big overall I mean this
season<00:00:41.190> for<00:00:41.340> Porto<00:00:41.640> he<00:00:41.820> had<00:00:41.910> an<00:00:42.030> unbelievable

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
I think this year he's gonna be a rare

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.530 
I think this year he's gonna be a rare
and<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.439> think<00:01:16.650> he<00:01:16.740> starts<00:01:17.310> up<00:01:17.430> on<00:01:17.580> me<00:01:17.729> even<00:01:18.030> more

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
and I think he starts up on me even more

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.050 
and I think he starts up on me even more
p<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.409> means<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:20.310> which<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.700> gonna<00:01:20.970> be

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
p and that means that which is gonna be

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.370 
p and that means that which is gonna be
expensive<00:01:21.659> as<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.259> mofo<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:23.240> just<00:01:24.350> have<00:01:25.350> a

it<00:02:05.160> was<00:02:05.220> to<00:02:05.370> bring<00:02:05.490> back<00:02:05.670> Modric<00:02:06.330> Khedira

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780

Davari<00:02:07.260> they<00:02:07.500> were<00:02:07.620> all<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:07.950> there<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.399> I

think<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.090> most<00:02:09.270> likely<00:02:10.200> would<00:02:10.320> be<00:02:10.470> much<00:02:10.680> to

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
think the most likely would be much to

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.880 
think the most likely would be much to
go<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.880> llamame<00:02:12.300> teach<00:02:12.600> the<00:02:13.050> play<00:02:13.440> of<00:02:13.620> the
