00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
more leap to right way rather than this

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.050 
more leap to right way rather than this
surely<00:01:12.510> here<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.140> know<00:01:13.260> if<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:14.070> did<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.729> bad

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
job you know it's really hard to cover

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.499 
job you know it's really hard to cover
up<00:01:16.979> also<00:01:17.159> place<00:01:17.580> realize<00:01:18.090> what<00:01:18.360> you're<00:01:18.479> doing

up also place realize what you're doing
you<00:01:18.869> are<00:01:19.020> coming<00:01:19.380> you're<00:01:19.530> here<00:01:19.740> once<00:01:20.040> you

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
you are coming you're here once you

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.130 
you are coming you're here once you
can't<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.700> can't<00:01:20.970> get<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.240> bad<00:01:21.450> or<00:01:21.810> it's

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
can't you can't get that bad or it's

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.510 
can't you can't get that bad or it's
gonna<00:01:22.320> take<00:01:22.530> quite<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.770> long<00:01:22.890> time<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.159> get<00:01:23.400> that

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
gonna take quite a long time to get that

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.370 
gonna take quite a long time to get that
back<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.360> make<00:01:24.540> sure<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.780> do<00:01:24.930> small<00:01:25.350> little

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
back so make sure you do small little

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.819 
back so make sure you do small little
cuts<00:01:25.950> first<00:01:26.939> rather<00:01:27.720> than<00:01:27.840> doing<00:01:28.080> one<00:01:28.380> giant

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
cuts first rather than doing one giant

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.289 
cuts first rather than doing one giant
out<00:01:28.979> because<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.400> can<00:01:29.520> always<00:01:29.700> cut<00:01:29.970> more<00:01:30.150> off

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
and then with 2:30 left at the top the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.710 
and then with 2:30 left at the top the
two<00:01:59.950> dudes<00:02:00.190> at<00:02:00.370> the<00:02:00.520> top<00:02:00.700> just<00:02:00.940> hide<00:02:01.240> up<00:02:01.450> and

two dudes at the top just hide up and

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.870 
two dudes at the top just hide up and
make<00:02:02.050> sure<00:02:02.080> it's<00:02:02.470> out<00:02:02.650> of<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:03.010> way<00:02:03.160> so<00:02:03.730> the

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
make sure it's out of the way so the

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.640 
make sure it's out of the way so the
neck<00:02:04.030> third<00:02:04.330> down<00:02:04.540> boom<00:02:04.840> who<00:02:05.110> wanted<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:05.440> my

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
neck third down boom who wanted to my

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.710 
neck third down boom who wanted to my
bet<00:02:05.950> and<00:02:05.980> half<00:02:06.340> inning<00:02:06.820> bring<00:02:07.060> it<00:02:07.210> round<00:02:07.420> in

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
bet and half inning bring it round in

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.750 
bet and half inning bring it round in
front<00:02:08.050> it's<00:02:08.350> much<00:02:08.710> easier<00:02:09.100> to<00:02:09.280> work<00:02:09.369> in<00:02:09.429> front

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:09.760 
front it's much easier to work in front

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.700 
front it's much easier to work in front
rather<00:02:10.090> than<00:02:10.240> working<00:02:10.630> behind<00:02:10.929> as<00:02:11.440> you<00:02:11.560> can

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
rather than working behind as you can

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.370 
rather than working behind as you can
see<00:02:11.920> you're<00:02:12.100> here<00:02:12.280> and<00:02:12.430> you<00:02:12.550> can<00:02:12.700> use<00:02:12.850> Samara

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.950 

so<00:02:16.160> this<00:02:16.340> is<00:02:16.520> basically<00:02:16.970> going<00:02:17.270> to<00:02:17.420> be<00:02:17.540> your

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
so this is basically going to be your

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.930 
so this is basically going to be your
base<00:02:18.140> leave<00:02:18.470> however<00:02:18.770> much<00:02:19.190> you<00:02:19.370> cut<00:02:19.520> off<00:02:19.700> it's

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
base leave however much you cut off it's

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.610 
base leave however much you cut off it's
going<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.210> be<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:20.540> base<00:02:20.720> length<00:02:21.020> of<00:02:21.260> what<00:02:21.440> your

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
going to be the base length of what your

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.410 
going to be the base length of what your
here<00:02:21.860> is<00:02:22.010> going<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.310> be<00:02:22.550> so<00:02:23.030> if<00:02:23.090> you're<00:02:23.240> just

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
here is going to be so if you're just

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.240 
here is going to be so if you're just
starting<00:02:23.630> off<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:24.140> would<00:02:24.260> refer<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.560> me<00:02:24.680> having

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
starting off I would refer to me having

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.400 
starting off I would refer to me having
a<00:02:25.370> tiny<00:02:25.610> bit<00:02:25.880> fist<00:02:26.180> in<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.660> bringing<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.200> bag

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
a tiny bit fist in the bringing a bag

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.500 
a tiny bit fist in the bringing a bag
behind<00:02:27.710> your<00:02:28.100> back<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:28.460> realizing<00:02:28.820> Coleman

behind your back and realizing Coleman

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.300 
behind your back and realizing Coleman
is<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:29.870> if<00:02:30.260> you<00:02:30.380> do<00:02:30.500> want<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.770> cut<00:02:30.950> more<00:02:31.190> off

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
is and if you do want to cut more off

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.350 
is and if you do want to cut more off
thing<00:02:31.610> cut<00:02:31.820> more<00:02:32.090> off

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
thing cut more off

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.030 
thing cut more off
be<00:02:32.450> very<00:02:32.690> careful<00:02:32.900> with<00:02:33.200> this<00:02:33.380> and<00:02:33.650> try<00:02:33.920> and

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
be very careful with this and try and

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:44.320 
be very careful with this and try and
get<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.220> straight<00:02:34.640> cut<00:02:34.880> as<00:02:35.240> much<00:02:35.480> as<00:02:35.720> possible

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.510 

when<00:02:44.990> you<00:02:45.080> go<00:02:45.230> under<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.710> new<00:02:45.830> teachers

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
measurer against the first section to

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:59.350 
measurer against the first section to
make<00:02:48.770> sure<00:02:48.920> they<00:02:49.130> even

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.360 

so<00:02:59.930> I'm<00:03:00.050> done<00:03:00.470> with<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.710> basic<00:03:01.190> shooting
