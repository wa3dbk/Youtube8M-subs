so<00:00:03.460> in<00:00:03.580> this<00:00:03.670> third<00:00:04.000> and<00:00:04.029> final<00:00:04.210> segment<00:00:04.660> I'd

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:04.960 
so in this third and final segment I'd

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.230 
so in this third and final segment I'd
like<00:00:05.140> to<00:00:05.290> kind<00:00:05.470> of<00:00:05.500> walk<00:00:05.710> through<00:00:06.130> with<00:00:07.089> this

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:07.240 
like to kind of walk through with this

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.660 
like to kind of walk through with this
mess<00:00:07.540> here<00:00:07.870> the<00:00:08.559> normal<00:00:09.549> map<00:00:09.730> extraction

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
mess here the normal map extraction

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.120 
mess here the normal map extraction
workflow<00:00:12.670> and<00:00:13.110> I've<00:00:14.110> got<00:00:14.290> a<00:00:14.320> high<00:00:14.740> res<00:00:14.920> mesh

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.130 
workflow and I've got a high res mesh

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.599 
workflow and I've got a high res mesh
here<00:00:15.400> with<00:00:15.610> I've<00:00:15.880> got<00:00:17.040> three<00:00:18.040> subdivision

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:18.609 
here with I've got three subdivision

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:23.810 
here with I've got three subdivision
levels<00:00:18.910> and<00:00:19.150> around<00:00:21.000> 700,000<00:00:22.000> quad<00:00:22.570> faces<00:00:23.230> and

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
levels and around 700,000 quad faces and

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.310 
levels and around 700,000 quad faces and
so<00:00:24.820> you<00:00:25.180> know<00:00:25.210> I've<00:00:25.359> gone<00:00:25.539> in<00:00:25.750> and<00:00:26.080> and

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
so you know I've gone in and and

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:35.310 
so you know I've gone in and and
sculpted<00:00:27.070> in<00:00:27.240> my<00:00:28.240> detail<00:00:28.689> and<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.960> can<00:00:35.110> see

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
sculpted in my detail and you can see

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.930 
sculpted in my detail and you can see
here<00:00:35.559> this<00:00:35.680> is<00:00:35.739> just<00:00:36.010> a<00:00:36.100> pistol<00:00:36.520> high<00:00:36.610> res<00:00:36.760> mesh

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
here this is just a pistol high res mesh

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.700 
here this is just a pistol high res mesh
okay<00:00:37.300> look<00:00:37.450> at<00:00:37.630> check<00:00:37.870> the<00:00:37.989> density<00:00:38.380> here<00:00:38.530> so

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
okay look at check the density here so

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.190 
okay look at check the density here so
it's<00:00:38.860> pretty<00:00:39.040> pretty<00:00:39.430> dense<00:00:39.780> mesh<00:00:42.989> all<00:00:43.989> you

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200 
it's pretty pretty dense mesh all you

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.780 
it's pretty pretty dense mesh all you
need<00:00:44.350> to<00:00:44.379> do<00:00:44.559> is<00:00:44.800> go<00:00:44.950> into<00:00:45.100> the<00:00:45.370> utility

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
need to do is go into the utility

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.380 
need to do is go into the utility
section<00:00:46.450> go<00:00:46.660> to<00:00:46.719> texture<00:00:47.260> baking<00:00:47.649> and<00:00:48.390> I've

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
section go to texture baking and I've

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.090 
section go to texture baking and I've
already<00:00:49.510> created<00:00:49.719> a<00:00:49.989> texture<00:00:50.379> bake<00:00:50.530> note<00:00:50.800> but

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
already created a texture bake note but

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.319 
already created a texture bake note but
you<00:00:51.129> would<00:00:51.640> just<00:00:51.910> hit<00:00:52.090> new<00:00:52.629> operation<00:00:53.260> go<00:00:54.129> to

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
you would just hit new operation go to

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.760 
you would just hit new operation go to
and<00:00:55.329> it<00:00:55.539> will<00:00:55.629> bring<00:00:55.750> up<00:00:55.930> the<00:00:55.989> texture<00:00:56.559> break

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
and it will bring up the texture break

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.900 
and it will bring up the texture break
options<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:59.530> is<00:00:59.710> a<00:00:59.739> the<00:01:00.370> menu<00:01:00.670> is<00:01:00.789> set<00:01:01.030> up<00:01:01.210> and

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
options this is a the menu is set up and

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.440 
options this is a the menu is set up and
in<00:01:03.910> order<00:01:04.780> of<00:01:05.610> how<00:01:06.610> you're<00:01:06.850> supposed<00:01:07.000> to<00:01:07.180> set

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
in order of how you're supposed to set

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.510 
in order of how you're supposed to set
these<00:01:07.600> options<00:01:08.049> here<00:01:08.229> so<00:01:08.470> you<00:01:09.189> would<00:01:09.310> first

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
these options here so you would first

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.210 
these options here so you would first
set<00:01:09.760> your<00:01:09.939> low<00:01:10.119> resolution<00:01:10.720> mesh<00:01:10.930> and<00:01:11.320> in<00:01:12.130> this

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
set your low resolution mesh and in this

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.340 
set your low resolution mesh and in this
scene<00:01:12.490> if<00:01:12.700> I<00:01:12.820> click<00:01:13.030> on<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.330> menu<00:01:13.630> it<00:01:13.840> should

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
scene if I click on the menu it should

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.859 
scene if I click on the menu it should
give<00:01:14.799> me<00:01:14.920> all<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.220> a<00:01:15.549> list<00:01:16.180> of<00:01:16.299> the<00:01:16.420> objects<00:01:16.780> in

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
give me all the a list of the objects in

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.340 
give me all the a list of the objects in
my<00:01:17.020> scene<00:01:17.320> and<00:01:17.590> I<00:01:18.430> want<00:01:18.820> to<00:01:18.939> actually<00:01:19.350> extract

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
my scene and I want to actually extract

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.420 
my scene and I want to actually extract
a<00:01:20.650> map<00:01:20.860> from<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:22.420> lowest<00:01:22.600> level<00:01:23.200> 0<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:26.430> I

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
a map from the lowest level 0 and I

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.850 
a map from the lowest level 0 and I
don't<00:01:28.210> want<00:01:28.390> any<00:01:28.540> subdivision<00:01:28.810> on<00:01:29.290> the<00:01:29.560> mesh

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
don't want any subdivision on the mesh

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.980 
don't want any subdivision on the mesh
on<00:01:30.189> the<00:01:30.580> low<00:01:30.729> res<00:01:30.939> I<00:01:31.090> just<00:01:31.270> want<00:01:31.420> to<00:01:31.509> keep<00:01:31.630> it<00:01:31.810> as

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
on the low res I just want to keep it as

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.090 
on the low res I just want to keep it as
is<00:01:32.439> and<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:34.420> want<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:35.380> select<00:01:35.619> a<00:01:35.799> high

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
is and I want to select a high

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.090 
is and I want to select a high
resolution<00:01:36.340> mesh<00:01:36.820> for<00:01:37.750> this<00:01:37.869> I<00:01:38.049> choose<00:01:38.680> the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
resolution mesh for this I choose the

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.069 
resolution mesh for this I choose the
highest<00:01:39.610> level<00:01:39.909> on<00:01:40.090> that<00:01:40.240> particular<00:01:40.390> object

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
highest level on that particular object

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.130 
highest level on that particular object
I<00:01:41.759> change<00:01:42.759> the<00:01:42.970> subdivision<00:01:43.570> too<00:01:43.720> good<00:01:43.960> in

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
I change the subdivision too good in

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.280 
I change the subdivision too good in
this<00:01:44.560> case<00:01:44.829> subdivision<00:01:45.520> is<00:01:45.640> not<00:01:46.290> subdividing

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
this case subdivision is not subdividing

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.920 
this case subdivision is not subdividing
the<00:01:47.320> faces<00:01:47.770> themselves<00:01:48.310> but<00:01:48.939> rather<00:01:49.210> the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
the faces themselves but rather the

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.109 
the faces themselves but rather the
smoothing<00:01:50.590> of<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:51.250> it's<00:01:51.759> an<00:01:51.880> additional

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
smoothing of the it's an additional

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.610 
smoothing of the it's an additional
smoothing<00:01:52.750> level<00:01:53.079> on<00:01:53.649> the<00:01:53.890> map

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
smoothing level on the map

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.920 
smoothing level on the map
and<00:01:56.980> then<00:01:57.980> I<00:01:58.010> want<00:01:58.250> to<00:01:58.310> turn<00:01:58.490> on<00:01:58.730> to<00:01:59.150> create<00:01:59.900> a

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
and then I want to turn on to create a

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.600 
and then I want to turn on to create a
normal<00:02:00.320> map<00:02:00.760> just<00:02:01.760> turn<00:02:01.940> that<00:02:01.970> on<00:02:03.460> just<00:02:04.460> give

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
normal map just turn that on just give

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.109 
normal map just turn that on just give
this<00:02:04.760> map<00:02:04.970> a<00:02:05.000> new<00:02:05.270> name<00:02:05.510> and<00:02:06.130> by<00:02:07.130> default<00:02:07.400> we

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
this map a new name and by default we

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.270 
this map a new name and by default we
have<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.780> map<00:02:09.110> width<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.590> height<00:02:09.830> set<00:02:10.130> to

have the map width and height set to

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.090 
have the map width and height set to
1024<00:02:11.000> and<00:02:11.270> we've<00:02:11.690> also<00:02:11.870> specified<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.680> search

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
1024 and we've also specified a search

distance for you on the search distance

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.140 
distance for you on the search distance
is<00:02:18.340> basically<00:02:19.340> our<00:02:19.490> solution<00:02:19.940> what<00:02:20.060> the

solution is doing its firing raised from

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.220 
solution is doing its firing raised from
the<00:02:22.190> low<00:02:22.340> res<00:02:22.580> and<00:02:22.850> going<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.570> finding<00:02:24.020> where

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
the low res and going and finding where

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
kind of sets the limits of the Ray

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.720 
kind of sets the limits of the Ray
length<00:02:33.320> and<00:02:34.780> we<00:02:35.780> used<00:02:35.990> to<00:02:36.190> mudbox<00:02:37.190> used<00:02:37.490> it<00:02:37.640> you

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
length and we used to mudbox used it you

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.860 
length and we used to mudbox used it you
know<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:37.940> user<00:02:38.090> would<00:02:38.330> need<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.690> account

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
know the user would need to account

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.650 
know the user would need to account
guess<00:02:39.560> this<00:02:39.800> value<00:02:40.250> so<00:02:40.550> we've<00:02:40.970> put<00:02:41.120> in<00:02:41.270> some<00:02:41.450> an

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
guess this value so we've put in some an

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.600 
guess this value so we've put in some an
automatic<00:02:42.260> feature<00:02:42.470> which<00:02:42.800> will<00:02:42.830> determine

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
automatic feature which will determine

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.030 
automatic feature which will determine
the<00:02:43.820> proper<00:02:44.120> value<00:02:44.510> for<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:44.870> so<00:02:45.110> usually<00:02:45.830> the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
the proper value for you so usually the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.490 
the proper value for you so usually the
default<00:02:46.700> here<00:02:46.970> is<00:02:47.150> going<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.020> work<00:02:48.140> fine<00:02:48.470> for

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
default here is going to work fine for

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.330 
default here is going to work fine for
you<00:02:50.050> and<00:02:51.050> then<00:02:51.530> all<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:51.800> would<00:02:51.920> need<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.100> do<00:02:52.190> is

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
you and then all you would need to do is

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.130 
you and then all you would need to do is
start<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.700> operation<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.450> that<00:02:53.600> would<00:02:53.780> begin

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
start the operation and that would begin

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.200 
start the operation and that would begin
the<00:02:54.500> calculation<00:02:55.100> but<00:02:55.280> i'll<00:02:55.700> just<00:02:55.910> give<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.060> a

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
the calculation but i'll just give you a

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.390 
the calculation but i'll just give you a
peek<00:02:56.450> here<00:02:56.480> there<00:02:57.080> are<00:02:57.230> quite<00:02:57.500> a<00:02:57.560> few<00:02:57.650> advanced

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
peek here there are quite a few advanced

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.470 
peek here there are quite a few advanced
options<00:02:59.320> because<00:03:00.320> as<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:00.830> know<00:03:00.910> there<00:03:01.910> are<00:03:01.940> no

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
options because as you know there are no

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.630 
options because as you know there are no
real<00:03:02.780> standards<00:03:03.500> on<00:03:03.650> normal<00:03:04.010> maps<00:03:04.220> so<00:03:04.400> we<00:03:04.489> had

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
real standards on normal maps so we had

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.390 
real standards on normal maps so we had
provide<00:03:05.030> quite<00:03:05.360> a<00:03:05.420> few<00:03:05.780> options<00:03:06.500> there<00:03:07.010> for

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
provide quite a few options there for

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.310 
provide quite a few options there for
for<00:03:07.970> users<00:03:08.270> to<00:03:08.300> be<00:03:08.510> able<00:03:08.570> to<00:03:08.720> create<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:09.020> map

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
for users to be able to create a map

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.840 
for users to be able to create a map
that's<00:03:09.620> going<00:03:09.800> to<00:03:09.890> work<00:03:10.070> inside<00:03:10.430> their<00:03:10.700> own

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
that's going to work inside their own

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.800 
that's going to work inside their own
renderer<00:03:12.100> but<00:03:13.100> for<00:03:13.280> our<00:03:13.310> purposes<00:03:13.850> and<00:03:14.180> we've

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
renderer but for our purposes and we've

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.020 
renderer but for our purposes and we've
tried<00:03:14.959> to<00:03:15.110> set<00:03:15.290> up<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:15.410> defaults<00:03:15.890> so<00:03:16.040> that<00:03:16.250> you

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
tried to set up the defaults so that you

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.910 
tried to set up the defaults so that you
know<00:03:17.150> it<00:03:17.300> will<00:03:17.750> generate<00:03:17.959> a<00:03:18.170> normal<00:03:18.560> map<00:03:18.709> that

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
know it will generate a normal map that

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.000 
know it will generate a normal map that
will<00:03:19.010> work<00:03:19.220> for<00:03:19.580> you<00:03:20.410> just<00:03:21.410> go<00:03:21.530> ahead<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:21.739> hit

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
will work for you just go ahead and hit

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.920 
will work for you just go ahead and hit
start<00:03:22.250> operation<00:03:24.700> and<00:03:25.700> it<00:03:26.239> will<00:03:26.390> bring<00:03:26.570> up<00:03:26.750> a

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
start operation and it will bring up a

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.470 
start operation and it will bring up a
map<00:03:27.260> extraction<00:03:28.160> results<00:03:28.520> window<00:03:28.700> you<00:03:29.360> can

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
map extraction results window you can

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.880 
map extraction results window you can
see<00:03:29.540> at<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.780> bottom<00:03:29.989> there<00:03:30.320> should<00:03:30.350> be<00:03:30.590> a<00:03:30.620> bar

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
see at the bottom there should be a bar

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.670 
see at the bottom there should be a bar
progress<00:03:31.459> bar<00:03:31.670> that<00:03:32.020> give<00:03:33.020> you<00:03:33.110> an<00:03:33.260> idea<00:03:33.380> how

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
progress bar that give you an idea how

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.559 
progress bar that give you an idea how
the<00:03:33.920> map<00:03:34.310> extraction<00:03:34.880> is<00:03:35.000> going

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.840 

I'll<00:03:39.569> just<00:03:39.720> let<00:03:39.900> this<00:03:40.050> go<00:03:40.950> along<00:03:41.220> in<00:03:41.250> real<00:03:41.580> time

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
I'll just let this go along in real time

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:53.870 
I'll just let this go along in real time
here

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.900 

okay<00:03:54.880> so<00:03:54.940> that<00:03:55.270> map's<00:03:55.480> just<00:03:55.960> about<00:03:56.170> finished

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
okay so that map's just about finished

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.340 
okay so that map's just about finished
and<00:03:58.050> it's<00:03:59.050> finished<00:03:59.530> the<00:03:59.650> map<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:01.090> it's<00:04:01.960> taken

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
and it's finished the map and it's taken

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.650 
and it's finished the map and it's taken
23<00:04:02.710> seconds<00:04:03.370> and<00:04:03.640> that's<00:04:03.790> on<00:04:04.030> a<00:04:04.060> mesh<00:04:04.360> that's

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
23 seconds and that's on a mesh that's

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.690 
23 seconds and that's on a mesh that's
you<00:04:05.560> know<00:04:07.650> 700,000<00:04:08.650> quads<00:04:08.890> so<00:04:09.190> double<00:04:09.520> that

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
you know 700,000 quads so double that

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.190 
you know 700,000 quads so double that
for<00:04:09.910> char<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.300> number<00:04:10.570> of<00:04:10.690> triangles<00:04:10.990> that

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
for char the number of triangles that

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.680 
for char the number of triangles that
that<00:04:11.470> meshes<00:04:12.040> and<00:04:14.640> then<00:04:15.640> we<00:04:15.820> can<00:04:15.940> go<00:04:16.030> on<00:04:16.209> to<00:04:16.420> our

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
that meshes and then we can go on to our

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.449 
that meshes and then we can go on to our
image<00:04:17.049> browser<00:04:18.239> and<00:04:19.890> have<00:04:20.890> a<00:04:20.920> look<00:04:21.190> at<00:04:21.280> that

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
image browser and have a look at that

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.620 
image browser and have a look at that
map<00:04:21.700> and<00:04:22.390> you<00:04:22.920> can<00:04:23.920> see<00:04:24.160> here<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:24.580> results<00:04:25.030> of

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
map and you can see here the results of

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.160 
map and you can see here the results of
the<00:04:25.720> 1k<00:04:26.110> map<00:04:28.170> and<00:04:29.170> the<00:04:29.290> maps<00:04:29.860> pretty<00:04:30.220> clean<00:04:30.490> and

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
the 1k map and the maps pretty clean and

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.540 
the 1k map and the maps pretty clean and
this<00:04:32.170> map<00:04:32.350> you<00:04:32.530> can<00:04:32.650> use<00:04:32.860> were<00:04:33.040> straight<00:04:33.340> away

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
this map you can use were straight away

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.700 
this map you can use were straight away
in<00:04:33.730> your<00:04:33.820> renderer<00:04:34.150> you<00:04:34.930> can<00:04:35.080> import<00:04:35.230> this<00:04:35.590> in

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
in your renderer you can import this in

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.520 
in your renderer you can import this in
my<00:04:35.860> and<00:04:36.070> test<00:04:36.310> it<00:04:39.480> but<00:04:40.480> yeah<00:04:41.140> it<00:04:41.230> should<00:04:41.440> be

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
my and test it but yeah it should be

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.410 
my and test it but yeah it should be
that<00:04:41.680> simple<00:04:41.950> to<00:04:42.220> extract<00:04:42.640> maps<00:04:42.910> from

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
that simple to extract maps from

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.600 
that simple to extract maps from
arbitrary<00:04:43.960> with<00:04:44.740> mud<00:04:44.950> box<00:04:45.130> you<00:04:45.340> can<00:04:45.460> also

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
arbitrary with mud box you can also

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.970 
arbitrary with mud box you can also
extract<00:04:46.150> maps<00:04:46.570> from<00:04:46.810> arbitrary<00:04:47.440> measures<00:04:47.770> as

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
extract maps from arbitrary measures as

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.610 
extract maps from arbitrary measures as
well<00:04:48.010> so<00:04:48.460> for<00:04:49.090> example<00:04:49.210> if<00:04:49.810> this<00:04:50.020> was<00:04:50.200> my<00:04:50.380> high

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
well so for example if this was my high

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.300 
well so for example if this was my high
res<00:04:50.890> mesh<00:04:51.460> and<00:04:51.850> I<00:04:52.240> had<00:04:52.420> an<00:04:52.570> arbitrary<00:04:53.220> you<00:04:54.220> know

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
res mesh and I had an arbitrary you know

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.090 
res mesh and I had an arbitrary you know
triangulated<00:04:55.060> triangulated<00:04:55.900> mesh<00:04:56.710> that<00:04:56.980> was

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
triangulated triangulated mesh that was

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.730 
triangulated triangulated mesh that was
from<00:04:57.280> a<00:04:57.400> game<00:04:57.640> engine<00:04:57.910> or<00:04:58.270> an<00:04:58.870> arbitrary<00:04:59.410> mesh

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
from a game engine or an arbitrary mesh

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.550 
from a game engine or an arbitrary mesh
that<00:04:59.980> had<00:05:00.190> n-sided<00:05:00.940> faces<00:05:01.570> in<00:05:01.720> it<00:05:01.810> you<00:05:02.380> could

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
that had n-sided faces in it you could

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.860 
that had n-sided faces in it you could
bring<00:05:02.800> that<00:05:02.860> object<00:05:03.580> in<00:05:03.760> as<00:05:04.030> a<00:05:04.090> separate

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
bring that object in as a separate

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:12.260 
bring that object in as a separate
object<00:05:05.440> and<00:05:05.880> in<00:05:06.880> the<00:05:07.480> texture<00:05:07.960> baking<00:05:08.850> window

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.300 

you<00:05:13.270> would<00:05:13.450> just<00:05:13.660> specify<00:05:14.440> that<00:05:14.680> that<00:05:15.010> that

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
you would just specify that that that

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.730 
you would just specify that that that
object<00:05:15.910> here<00:05:16.300> and

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.249 

so<00:05:20.430> for<00:05:20.669> low<00:05:20.789> res<00:05:21.030> you'd<00:05:21.180> have<00:05:21.360> one<00:05:21.599> object<00:05:22.110> and

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 
so for low res you'd have one object and

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:23.719 
so for low res you'd have one object and
for<00:05:22.410> high<00:05:22.560> res<00:05:22.800> you'd<00:05:23.009> have<00:05:23.160> a<00:05:23.190> completely

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
for high res you'd have a completely

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:25.909 
for high res you'd have a completely
different<00:05:24.030> object<00:05:24.389> here<00:05:24.599> and<00:05:24.750> the<00:05:25.229> extraction

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
different object here and the extraction

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.670 
different object here and the extraction
would<00:05:26.069> still<00:05:26.340> work<00:05:26.550> so<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.780> mesh<00:05:27.990> the<00:05:28.380> meshes

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
would still work so the mesh the meshes

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.249 
would still work so the mesh the meshes
don't<00:05:28.919> have<00:05:29.099> to<00:05:29.250> be<00:05:29.340> related<00:05:29.699> in<00:05:29.970> any<00:05:30.180> way<00:05:30.300> in

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259 
don't have to be related in any way in

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:34.879 
don't have to be related in any way in
fact<00:05:31.530> you<00:05:31.740> can<00:05:31.919> extract<00:05:32.729> from<00:05:33.479> a<00:05:33.599> low<00:05:33.810> res<00:05:34.139> to

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
fact you can extract from a low res to

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.270 
fact you can extract from a low res to
an<00:05:35.340> object<00:05:35.789> that<00:05:35.849> is<00:05:36.030> comprised<00:05:36.449> of<00:05:36.660> multiple

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
an object that is comprised of multiple

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.839 
an object that is comprised of multiple
high<00:05:38.280> res<00:05:38.520> objects<00:05:39.090> as<00:05:39.240> well<00:05:39.419> so<00:05:40.160> quite<00:05:41.160> quite

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:41.849 
high res objects as well so quite quite

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:45.110 
high res objects as well so quite quite
a<00:05:42.479> few<00:05:43.199> you<00:05:44.069> have<00:05:44.220> some<00:05:44.400> flexibility<00:05:45.030> there

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
a few you have some flexibility there

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.860 
a few you have some flexibility there
with<00:05:45.419> with<00:05:45.750> the<00:05:45.780> map<00:05:46.050> extraction<00:05:46.650> options
