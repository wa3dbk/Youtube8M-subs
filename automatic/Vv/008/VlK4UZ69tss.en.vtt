00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:10.050
 we will now work out the modes by 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.599
 burning water and what you did is 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.560
 we already understood that water should be served 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.070
 your coal and be sure to by this 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.250
 a layer of coal 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:25.109
 was air approach can not supply water 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.300
 its for there is no air supply for 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.170
 so that the design we get 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.539
 not quite like 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.700
 successful cutting given gives blame 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.309
 the tube further you see here there is water here 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.960
 she falls but sullenness got you 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.520
 everything is hot enough that ours 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.579
 did mean you are doing this 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:57.800
 the thing we will do now is guaranteed 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:57.800
 air supply to the place where we serve 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:17.040
 such a construction, that is, it's just 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:23.009
 sheet and which was thin enough we 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:25.259
 we will put him on a pipe very hotly 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.360
 guarantees that the year will fall 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.590
 so say that there is this that park and 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:36.450
 to mix with air everything that is to them 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.820
 still laying here we poured back 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.530
 coals yes and here in color do not live 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.840
 possible to rate and where is the highest 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.030
 the temperature that is here here 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.509
 main main air supply and needle 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.610
 here and expected to be here 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.530
 it was the reddest one too 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.280
 part can be estimated to passveta 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:01.460
 temperature here but you see it is not red 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.460
 and the red here are the parts we serve water 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.330
 you can stand off take a look at 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.780
 you there brother 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:14.620
 a flame which well let's smoothly which 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.920
 It is extracted here as a mixture of thermolysis 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.590
 the waters are actually here on the coals 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.710
 say it here it happens 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.230
 share a bit later and we carry more 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.140
 take off well now i'll show how it 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.830
 everything looks the other way we went into 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:40.180
 bath means respectively here we have 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:43.390
 see if you see us yes yes 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:57.459
 yes that's probably show the flow will start 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:03:01.450
 the jar 1 1 2 is 2 drops push in means 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:04.530
 one drop in two seconds so tube you 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:10.780
 already seen this tube 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:13.480
 means from such a plan it goes 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:18.640
 correspondingly inserted here 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:21.430
 through the system and through the bottle yes all this 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.769
 served went here you can see yes 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.200
 really something is about to 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:30.340
 darina here it is black all and here it is 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.480
 red serve water I do not offer close 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.860
 because it is very hot 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.870
 Well, you can see here that I can see red 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.209
 the question is still there but you now 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.120
 let's say here does it work before the water burns 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:48.880
 and if we still put firewood on top 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:51.340
 gorenje gorenje absolutely does not hurt 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.160
 just report let's make sense 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.340
 that is, we sort of take as a basis 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.000
 do we need to understand now how long 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.489
 will be 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.910
 Here are the coals to carry live when serving 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:07.470
 water is usually life and so they are in half an hour 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.990
 burn out yes yes and here is such a reality not 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.230
 a few hours and here's the more carry 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:16.820
 this time will be more effective to carry 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.410
 flow again don't start you can on 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:24.720
 woods just can only culture on 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:26.810
 the fight starts but then all the cities 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.810
 Russia 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:38.690
 Well, yes there is a mod here right here 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:43.500
 it is perfectly right to see red 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:45.120
 up to a third how does the plot look like with 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.890
 burning and there is a red hour we just 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.390
 when the door was closed the temperature 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.630
 increased percentage entered more 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.670
 intense burning yes and here's the top 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.580
 she just red hill can be seen very 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:05:08.120
 some kind of this here is how 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:11.190
 with water you can see how 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.390
 there is a burning that is there google and 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:17.730
 George already has nothing to say 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:20.790
 just water and flames 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.830
 It turns out quite large and so time 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:27.180
 by saying something 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:29.250
 there is a roar from the water and it burns stainless steel 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.560
 red as we said and here 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:36.000
 the spectrum is very interesting this is it not 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:38.940
 he looks like he, too, on the spectrum 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.820
 which in Omsk videos and he does not look like 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:44.510
 on the spectrum of burning coal to overcome 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:49.830
 the effects of such a flame of such tongues 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:53.280
 rubles you can see the color even changing this 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:58.410
 here we are let's open let's see more 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:01.440
 once just beauty of course right fire 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:07.800
 idiot fire straight from the embers goes fire so 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:13.680
 they lie simply and more I close that 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:16.130
 I live the temperature is very big so everything and 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.130
 turn on
