00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
easy it is to make this with this is

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.559 
easy it is to make this with this is
this<00:02:44.829> Big<00:02:45.160> Shot<00:02:45.370> machine<00:02:45.549> I<00:02:46.060> am<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.989> climber

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
this Big Shot machine I am a climber

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.240 
this Big Shot machine I am a climber
first<00:02:49.569> of<00:02:49.750> all<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:49.900> want<00:02:50.230> to<00:02:50.290> show<00:02:50.500> people<00:02:50.769> what

a diet is I would never thought that
this<00:02:54.489> is<00:02:54.549> what<00:02:54.910> a<00:02:54.940> dye<00:02:55.150> looks<00:02:55.389> like<00:02:55.569> I<00:02:55.720> would

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
this is what a dye looks like I would

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.430 
this is what a dye looks like I would
expect<00:02:56.290> blades<00:02:56.769> and<00:02:57.400> cutting<00:02:58.019> mechanisms<00:02:59.019> but

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
expect blades and cutting mechanisms but

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.110 
expect blades and cutting mechanisms but
it's<00:02:59.620> just<00:02:59.739> foam<00:03:00.069> I<00:03:00.430> mean<00:03:00.609> I<00:03:00.670> don't<00:03:00.849> see<00:03:00.970> the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
it's just foam I mean I don't see the

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.879 
it's just foam I mean I don't see the
blades<00:03:01.660> anywhere<00:03:07.139> so<00:03:08.139> let's<00:03:08.349> show<00:03:08.530> how<00:03:08.650> easy

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:08.889 
blades anywhere so let's show how easy

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:11.879 
blades anywhere so let's show how easy
it<00:03:09.069> is<00:03:09.160> to<00:03:09.340> make<00:03:09.489> this<00:03:10.079> you<00:03:11.079> put<00:03:11.500> you<00:03:11.739> make<00:03:11.859> a

this little sandwich

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.650 
this little sandwich
and<00:03:32.950> you<00:03:33.010> put<00:03:33.190> it<00:03:33.220> in<00:03:33.400> one<00:03:33.550> end<00:03:33.910> and<00:03:34.030> then<00:03:34.360> crank

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
and you put it in one end and then crank

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:54.680 
and you put it in one end and then crank
it<00:03:34.810> out<00:03:34.900> so<00:03:35.350> why<00:03:35.560> do<00:03:35.620> you<00:03:35.740> do<00:03:35.830> the<00:03:35.950> honors<00:03:36.250> I

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
I used to put the lollipop at the very

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.720 
I used to put the lollipop at the very
edge<00:05:24.560> but<00:05:25.560> then<00:05:25.710> I'd<00:05:25.980> be<00:05:26.160> like<00:05:26.310> looking

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
edge but then I'd be like looking

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.159 
edge but then I'd be like looking
everywhere<00:05:27.030> for<00:05:27.180> the<00:05:27.360> hole<00:05:27.540> the<00:05:27.750> stick<00:05:27.960> of<00:05:28.080> it

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
everywhere for the hole the stick of it

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.290 
everywhere for the hole the stick of it
and<00:05:28.500> it<00:05:28.560> was<00:05:28.680> really<00:05:28.919> hard<00:05:29.160> so<00:05:29.520> now<00:05:29.820> I<00:05:29.910> put<00:05:30.210> it

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
and it was really hard so now I put it

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.920 
and it was really hard so now I put it
in<00:05:30.450> this<00:05:30.540> little<00:05:30.720> step<00:05:31.140> here<00:05:31.169> I<00:05:31.910> know<00:05:32.910> I<00:05:33.480> can't

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.220 
in this little step here I know I can't
help<00:05:34.050> it<00:05:34.260> and<00:05:34.470> then<00:05:35.190> as<00:05:36.120> I'm<00:05:36.390> rolling<00:05:36.630> it<00:05:37.020> I
