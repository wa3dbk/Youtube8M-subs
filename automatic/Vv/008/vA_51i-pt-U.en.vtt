00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
to give you a list of things to look for

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.919 
to give you a list of things to look for
things<00:01:53.590> to<00:01:53.890> research<00:01:54.569> before<00:01:55.569> you<00:01:55.599> make<00:01:55.899> your

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
things to research before you make your

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.529 
things to research before you make your
decision<00:01:56.080> of<00:01:56.500> what<00:01:56.679> you're<00:01:56.830> going<00:01:56.950> to<00:01:57.009> get<00:01:57.539> the

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
decision of what you're going to get the

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.449 
decision of what you're going to get the
first<00:01:58.840> thing<00:01:59.080> to<00:01:59.200> look<00:01:59.319> for<00:01:59.590> is<00:01:59.769> what<00:01:59.800> type<00:02:00.429> of

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:00.459 
first thing to look for is what type of

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:02.729 
first thing to look for is what type of
water<00:02:00.910> parameters<00:02:01.360> to<00:02:01.869> your<00:02:02.050> fish<00:02:02.289> require

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:02.739 
water parameters to your fish require

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:04.949 
water parameters to your fish require
this<00:02:03.489> will<00:02:03.700> tell<00:02:03.910> you<00:02:04.149> whether<00:02:04.360> your<00:02:04.660> tap

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:04.959 
this will tell you whether your tap

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:06.869 
this will tell you whether your tap
water<00:02:04.989> at<00:02:05.530> home<00:02:05.739> is<00:02:05.920> acceptable<00:02:06.429> for<00:02:06.580> the<00:02:06.670> fish

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:06.879 
water at home is acceptable for the fish

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:08.249 
water at home is acceptable for the fish
or<00:02:07.300> if<00:02:07.539> you<00:02:07.660> might<00:02:07.840> need<00:02:07.959> to<00:02:08.080> make<00:02:08.200> some

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
or if you might need to make some

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.619 
or if you might need to make some
changes<00:02:08.860> to<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.190> pH<00:02:09.610> or<00:02:09.849> maybe<00:02:10.060> harden<00:02:10.420> it<00:02:10.539> up

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
changes to the pH or maybe harden it up

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.600 
changes to the pH or maybe harden it up
a<00:02:10.750> little<00:02:10.989> bit<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.709> suit<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.160> fish<00:02:12.340> that<00:02:12.550> you

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
a little bit to suit the fish that you

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.610 
a little bit to suit the fish that you
want<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.060> keep<00:02:13.209> all<00:02:13.629> of<00:02:13.690> these<00:02:14.110> things<00:02:14.170> are

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
want to keep all of these things are

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.070 
want to keep all of these things are
easy<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:15.159> do<00:02:15.370> but<00:02:16.000> some<00:02:16.300> people<00:02:16.599> don't<00:02:16.840> want<00:02:17.019> to

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
easy to do but some people don't want to

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.930 
easy to do but some people don't want to
mess<00:02:17.290> with<00:02:17.319> that<00:02:17.530> some<00:02:17.920> people<00:02:18.190> want<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.670> just

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
mess with that some people want to just

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.580 
mess with that some people want to just
put<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.450> fish<00:02:19.629> in<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:19.989> not<00:02:20.110> have<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.379> worry

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
put the fish in and not have to worry

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.890 
put the fish in and not have to worry
about<00:02:20.769> it<00:02:21.069> and<00:02:21.190> in<00:02:21.700> that<00:02:21.879> case<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:22.720> will<00:02:22.840> want

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
about it and in that case you will want

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.110 
about it and in that case you will want
to<00:02:23.170> get<00:02:23.349> fish<00:02:23.620> that<00:02:23.980> are<00:02:24.099> going<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.280> match<00:02:24.580> the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
to get fish that are going to match the

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.330 
to get fish that are going to match the
parameter<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:25.959> you<00:02:26.200> have<00:02:26.440> coming<00:02:27.010> right<00:02:27.310> out

parameter that you have coming right out
of<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.730> top

the next thing you need to look for is

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.930 
the next thing you need to look for is
how<00:02:32.870> big<00:02:33.200> these<00:02:33.440> fish<00:02:33.740> can<00:02:34.010> potentially<00:02:34.580> get

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
how big these fish can potentially get

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.550 
how big these fish can potentially get
now<00:02:35.480> this<00:02:35.600> is<00:02:35.780> going<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:35.990> help<00:02:36.230> you<00:02:36.380> in

now this is going to help you in
deciding<00:02:36.920> what<00:02:37.340> size<00:02:37.610> aquarium<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.750> get<00:02:38.960> when

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
you don't want to end up buying a small

tank and then end up needing to go out
and<00:02:46.040> buy<00:02:46.190> a<00:02:46.220> second<00:02:46.760> tank<00:02:46.910> because<00:02:47.240> the<00:02:47.390> first

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
and buy a second tank because the first

one that you got was too small so know

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.550 
one that you got was too small so know
how<00:02:50.180> big<00:02:50.690> your<00:02:50.900> fish<00:02:51.080> are<00:02:51.200> going<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.350> get

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
how big your fish are going to get

before you even spend a dollar the next
thing<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.480> look<00:02:56.510> for<00:02:56.870> is<00:02:57.050> to<00:02:57.080> find<00:02:57.260> out<00:02:57.770> what
