00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 the progress of modern technology is relentless 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.070
 and who would have thought that it turns out 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.849
 now there is wicker furniture from 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.460
 artificial materials 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.060
 imagine the corner where we are now 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.230
 we are made of artificial 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.199
 rattan 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.029
 it's actually plastic but if not 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.730
 know that this plastic is never 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:31.969
 believe it because it feels like something 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:35.540
 soft and rather skin- like 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:38.489
 here is the feeling of this plate Nasty 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.149
 artificial rattan even emanate 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.420
 more than natural therefore if 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.930
 You are the supporters of modern technology 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.520
 it is quite possible to use such 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.390
 furniture option 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.660
 I believe that she is no worse than 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.469
 what is made of natural wood and 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.829
 the idea 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.350
 probably should be cheaper although it is not 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.170
 known because sometimes modern 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.500
 technologies are even more expensive 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.400
 be that as it may but again if u 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.909
 you have a desire to equip your house 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.750
 or apartment wicker furniture then you 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.860
 there is always an opportunity for it 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.240
 just try to do it 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.070
 elegantly and tastefully 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.280
 because luxurious life is not 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.490
 price tags 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.570
 who hung on these subjects this 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.370
 first of all feeling with 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.060
 body composition and compliance 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.600
 certain rules 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.570
 break that is not recommended to anyone 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:55.030
 because man has only one life 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.150
 and of how he would live it depends 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.050
 well-being 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.670
 but to live it is necessary for this 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.830
 need to use 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.830
 secrets of luxury life
