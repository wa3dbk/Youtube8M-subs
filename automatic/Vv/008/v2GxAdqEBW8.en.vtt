00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.560 

my<00:00:00.450> guys<00:00:00.630> come<00:00:01.439> down<00:00:01.469> to<00:00:01.770> the<00:00:01.860> park<00:00:02.570> it's

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
my guys come down to the park it's

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.470 
my guys come down to the park it's
completely<00:00:04.140> deserted<00:00:04.440> at<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:04.859> moment

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:05.480 
completely deserted at the moment

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.350 
completely deserted at the moment
there's<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.569> very<00:00:07.020> tiny<00:00:07.410> bit<00:00:07.620> of<00:00:07.770> wind<00:00:08.360> and

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
there's a very tiny bit of wind and

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.200 
there's a very tiny bit of wind and
we're<00:00:09.450> going<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.660> give<00:00:09.780> this<00:00:09.929> plane<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.320> try

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.210 
we're going to give this plane a try

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.410 
we're going to give this plane a try
with<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.330> new<00:00:12.480> propellers<00:00:14.030> so<00:00:15.030> it's<00:00:15.179> still

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
with the new propellers so it's still

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.880 
with the new propellers so it's still
the<00:00:15.770> cheap<00:00:16.770> radio-controlled<00:00:17.840> car<00:00:18.920> motor<00:00:20.840> and

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
the cheap radio-controlled car motor and

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:31.359 
the cheap radio-controlled car motor and
receiver<00:00:24.380> so<00:00:25.380> it's<00:00:25.500> going<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.650> be<00:00:25.740> short<00:00:26.010> range

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:01:17.429 

but<00:00:32.369> we'll<00:00:32.489> give<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.759> try

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.370 

it's<00:01:17.950> actually<00:01:18.249> going<00:01:18.369> remarkably<00:01:18.909> well<00:01:19.380> just

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
it's actually going remarkably well just

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.489 
it's actually going remarkably well just
a<00:01:20.469> quick<00:01:20.649> reminder<00:01:20.999> very<00:01:21.999> short<00:01:22.359> range<00:01:22.659> about

00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:23.499 
a quick reminder very short range about

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:27.209 
a quick reminder very short range about
12<00:01:24.069> meters<00:01:24.719> so<00:01:25.719> unless<00:01:25.929> I<00:01:26.079> chase<00:01:26.350> after<00:01:26.649> it<00:01:27.009> it

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:27.219 
12 meters so unless I chase after it it

00:01:27.219 --> 00:02:25.660 
12 meters so unless I chase after it it
cuts<00:01:27.490> out<00:01:27.729> that's<00:01:28.119> why<00:01:28.270> it<00:01:28.329> suddenly<00:01:28.750> drops

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.830 

I<00:02:29.500> think<00:02:30.500> that<00:02:30.620> will<00:02:30.709> do<00:02:31.330> chasing<00:02:32.330> after<00:02:32.480> it<00:02:32.780> in

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
I think that will do chasing after it in

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.400 
I think that will do chasing after it in
the<00:02:32.870> Sun<00:02:33.200> is<00:02:33.440> tiring<00:02:33.890> me<00:02:34.010> out<00:02:34.040> I<00:02:35.140> think<00:02:36.140> we've

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
the Sun is tiring me out I think we've

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.430 
the Sun is tiring me out I think we've
established<00:02:36.880> it's<00:02:37.880> more<00:02:38.209> or<00:02:38.360> less<00:02:38.440> lifting

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
established it's more or less lifting

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.030 
established it's more or less lifting
now<00:02:40.720> but<00:02:41.720> we<00:02:41.810> run<00:02:41.959> out<00:02:42.080> of<00:02:42.110> range<00:02:42.410> too<00:02:42.740> quickly

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
now but we run out of range too quickly

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.280 
now but we run out of range too quickly
so<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:45.950> think<00:02:46.820> summary<00:02:47.330> is<00:02:47.510> not<00:02:47.870> quite<00:02:48.080> enough

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
so I think summary is not quite enough

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.210 
so I think summary is not quite enough
power<00:02:49.810> but<00:02:50.810> if<00:02:50.900> we<00:02:50.990> have<00:02:51.080> any<00:02:51.230> more<00:02:51.470> then<00:02:52.040> we'll

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
power but if we have any more then we'll

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.680 
power but if we have any more then we'll
want<00:02:52.370> some<00:02:52.550> steering<00:02:53.060> so<00:02:53.239> we<00:02:53.300> can<00:02:53.420> bring<00:02:53.540> it

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
want some steering so we can bring it

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:02.530 
want some steering so we can bring it
back<00:02:53.720> again<00:02:54.940> it's<00:02:55.940> a<00:02:56.000> job<00:02:56.209> done<00:02:56.420> today<00:03:01.540> just

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
back again it's a job done today just

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.270 
back again it's a job done today just
remembered<00:03:02.870> I<00:03:02.959> forgot<00:03:02.989> to<00:03:03.470> mention<00:03:03.590> I've<00:03:04.040> got

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
remembered I forgot to mention I've got

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.820 
remembered I forgot to mention I've got
to<00:03:04.640> lipo<00:03:05.120> batteries<00:03:05.600> on<00:03:05.750> there<00:03:06.019> connected<00:03:06.709> in

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
to lipo batteries on there connected in

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.280 
to lipo batteries on there connected in
series<00:03:07.630> so<00:03:08.630> we're<00:03:08.750> actually<00:03:08.870> putting<00:03:09.140> about

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
series so we're actually putting about

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.920 
series so we're actually putting about
seven<00:03:09.769> volts<00:03:10.959> into<00:03:11.959> the<00:03:12.400> receiver<00:03:13.720> not<00:03:14.720> quite

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
seven volts into the receiver not quite

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.540 
seven volts into the receiver not quite
sure<00:03:14.959> what<00:03:15.410> it'd<00:03:15.530> be<00:03:15.590> passing<00:03:16.100> through<00:03:16.250> to<00:03:16.459> the

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
sure what it'd be passing through to the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.770 
sure what it'd be passing through to the
motor<00:03:18.010> but<00:03:19.010> that<00:03:19.790> was<00:03:19.910> to<00:03:20.000> try<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:20.239> boost<00:03:20.540> the

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
motor but that was to try and boost the

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.400 
motor but that was to try and boost the
power<00:03:20.930> of<00:03:21.170> it<00:03:21.320> so<00:03:22.130> -<00:03:23.080> 3.7<00:03:24.080> -<00:03:24.350> that's<00:03:24.530> 7.4<00:03:25.370> and

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
power of it so - 3.7 - that's 7.4 and

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.950 
power of it so - 3.7 - that's 7.4 and
normal<00:03:27.410> 2s
