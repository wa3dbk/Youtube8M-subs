00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.290
 finding many different things here 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.670
 that santiago del estero and in this time 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.380
 we went to the Argentine army neighborhood 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.570
 they told us there was a motorcycle 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.920
 quite special a motorbike can not be 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.930
 say an old motorcycle but yes a 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.340
 pretty special moped and we 're going 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.809
 to leave sebastián that I have here to the 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.330
 side of me to tell us what is 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.140
 try this moped when 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:48.090
 Sebastian, hello, my name is Sebastian. 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.210
 of the Argentine army good since already 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:56.579
 they have my motorcycle that is a zanella I had 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:58.020
 70 of those of year 82 in the motito vos 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.149
 had said that it's an exit 70 that in 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.160
 are not really in the 70s it was 50 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.229
 so I want you to tell me how it is 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.640
 the procedure is your first motorbike this 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.530
 photo with your motorcycle 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.720
 this has been from my dad and well we had 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.740
 another motorcycle and it has been given to me and good 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:22.270
 and made by doing the things that are that 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:25.060
 are all the chrome paint was 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:30.400
 50 happens to 70 has 2 carburetors 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:32.320
 of the ere x 135 that of the yamaha and good 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.880
 in contrast to a more or less 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.290
 your dad took care of her or found her in a 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.140
 catastrophic state as per the history 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.810
 no or it was original 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.280
 we have started from zero good first what 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.520
 first thing that I've done the first time has 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.140
 been painting and chrome nothing else has been the 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.110
 first time you are presented with a 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:55.200
 good expo then I have done the spellings 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.320
 the cut of the naphtha tank to put 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.470
 in the fish tank is this 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.790
 all this part that you see there and let's say 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.560
 but that's where it cuts out what is 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.720
 the fuel tank or load 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.210
 much less for that much much less 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.190
 by this I mean I have cut everything 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.570
 which is on each side not on one side 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.760
 but from both sides to put for 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.610
 can put the fish tank we see that the 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.910
 little fish live not this is not a game 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.250
 and why the fish tank che and why I do 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.320
 Lake compete to the motorcycle and I always want 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.390
 something for my bike that does not have it 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.130
 anybody because many things there 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.470
 on other bikes that it has to be that 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.390
 anyone can put it but everything is 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.060
 handicraft what we have done because 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.040
 no motorcycle here in santiago nor in 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:43.829
 I think everywhere 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.829
 from here there is no motorcycle like this 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.940
 just like its mechanics then it wants 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.150
 say that the mechanical part is either 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.650
 carry the 50 70 you did it and it is and 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.660
 this has two carburetor is that we can 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.250
 see there are two chargers the chargers 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.830
 which are from the 135 of the yamaha and good 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.760
 everything costs point that takes a long time 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.980
 because remember in you that if 250 and 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.510
 is to put every two cars of a motorcycle 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.730
 bigger that is much bigger than 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.220
 one 135 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.080
 the issue of the electric part because 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.379
 we know that the bike the output is 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.030
 find original 50 comes to us comes 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.000
 with light but powered by a coil 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.010
 good to have the lights go 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.950
 The motorcycle must be on the road 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.160
 now it 's with a 6 volt battery that 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:36.360
 flash lights blue lights 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.970
 the fish tank aerator and well so 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.170
 yes or if it has to have battery we see 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.900
 also that you have trophies and that 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.970
 obviously some winners 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.710
 accounting or you are taking it to compete if 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.660
 took her to compete everywhere where I 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.970
 I can go because I do not have in that 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.090
 always move with the help of the 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.930
 friends that take us if here at the expo 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.810
 tucumán force red beltrán everything is 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.450
 our ugly the hot springs river also 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.820
 they have given us and well we always carry it 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.310
 to compete is made exclusively by 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.470
 compete every good possesses this motorbike to the 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.870
 street did not go to the railing 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.850
 if he took the park for a walk 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.470
 but it is exclusively to compete 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.730
 in it is for nothing and what happens when the 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.430
 go out to the street take her to the park 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.130
 good is everything be all the world stops 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:26.000
 to see something that a lot of people do not 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.960
 you have the possibility to enter an expo 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.290
 I put it on any any 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.300
 part of the park or somewhere that 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.430
 there is confluence of people so that 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.840
 see why the fact for that 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.880
 sincerely, what we are looking for 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.310
 they are also like in this case in this 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.380
 part we look for rare bikes bikes in the 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.910
 incentive that have had reforms and 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.160
 we see if we always find 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.780
 which are motorcycles to which they put a lot 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.600
 beyond money but a lot 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.490
 dedication in this case you really have 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.550
 something to say that a lot 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.680
 dedication time as you say of magic 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.410
 of silver, silver does everything but 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.660
 I try back and I try to do everything to myself 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.820
 beyond that we have to send 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.730
 do something else but the 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.070
 dedication time think about being 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.140
 you can do motorcycle because owl you who 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.240
 they walk in this also I do not know the people 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.890
 Do not expect me to take it as it is 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.690
 now the bike in all of them is for the 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.790
 people are going to see other things 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.110
 then I come here every time because there is something 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.240
 you have to do the motorcycle I do not take them 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.000
 always as it always is or is 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.860
 as with the fish tank everything but always with 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.910
 other things that I have in plan in many 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.310
 things to do it 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.140
 to the little horse that havana sees inside 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.740
 little that the first ones that are going to see them 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.740
 you are 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:46.030
 many nice things that there are not in 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.030
 santiago I can assure you that
