00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:08.900
 ok bye to all real guys found in 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.969
 this new video is here today 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.840
 unfortunately to inform you of a bad one 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.940
 thing 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.599
 one day a few days ago I was 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.669
 trying to adjust I usually leave 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:22.070
 the 3ds on the desk then it 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:25.310
 find yourself on your desk or on or 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.279
 connected the cable to the connection for the 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.480
 capture card and I found myself 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.570
 inexplicably with problems of 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.839
 what is it simply the cable does not 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.089
 makes better contact with the attack of the 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:40.250
 caption is not a cable problem 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:43.940
 I tried four different guys 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.729
 4 however all the various accrocchi that there 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.040
 I had anyway I 'm all branded 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:51.830
 they are good declines it is not Chinese stuff 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.949
 which may not work here I wanted 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.629
 tell you this unfortunately I don't know the 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:01.339
 problem so I think it's right 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:03.229
 in the attack of the capture card 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:05.799
 I have to hold the cable and 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:08.539
 sincerely to me to do an ex play of 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.969
 make an explain by holding the cable 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:12.979
 and by really playing with one hand you can 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:15.079
 to say is not that he actually has it 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.450
 minimum desire in the end that is me guys 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:20.149
 when I play I have to have fun if then 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.070
 playing becomes holding the cable 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:22.700
 to really sincerely register not 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.999
 I want it 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.840
 so what will i do these days without 

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:28.909
 capture 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.399
 first of all I have a bit of struggle and already 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.499
 record that I have to comment and 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.020
 surely those sails I will show a 

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:39.350
 couple of fights I will definitely show you 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:43.100
 are almost 6 6 sets more or less then the 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.960
 the struggles we then try these 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.960
 days to upload some videos of the 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.340
 spectral race I wanted to show you 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.310
 some fight 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.619
 unfortunately I will have to keep the cable pressed 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.109
 I'll have to do strange things that I don't know 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.040
 not even if I succeed in doing so, I hope so 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:01.830
 and therefore you will probably see 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.330
 spectral challenges on the channel at least those 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.340
 sails I want to wear absolutely 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:11.250
 guys there is our dear ig slash and e 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:13.500
 then use it once finished with 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.510
 finished with the notes finished with the race 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.210
 finished with the ghostly race I have 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.250
 intention of the former play began the former 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.140
 play that was not programmed ie 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.460
 that of a new nose that boys 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.370
 I was planning to start a new one 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.080
 nana slots on a game but still 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.200
 I didn't decide so I wanted to take advantage 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.970
 of this video also to ask you the 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.440
 new nasdaq on what game you want it 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.520
 let me know your game maybe 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.530
 favorite 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.600
 and I will try to accommodate you 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.060
 normally little in platinum though 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.959
 obviously nothing prevents us from doing 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.630
 green leaf red fire diamond for the 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.610
 nero 2 and all the others obviously 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.660
 masa the ok will end once the 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:58.620
 then binds once I succeed in 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.510
 repair the capture card in the former evening 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.520
 horace play that at this point I don't know 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.340
 not even if I can do it in the one 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.739
 I hope you guys have unfortunately been there 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.690
 this problem I really don't know from 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.269
 what derives from that has always been about 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.860
 desk I'm 3ds guys is not me 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.530
 I carry it around as a freeze 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.640
 I was always here then if by a 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.310
 day to day and I decide not to 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.850
 unfortunately the fault is not of 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.340
 nobody 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.110
 so no guys i wanted to 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.850
 tell you this excuse me if my tone 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.750
 he is not very cheerful 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:34.830
 however we say that it is not a topic on 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.269
 to be happy this ok nothing 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.519

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.660

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.910

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.630
 I will try to satisfy you so much in 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.670

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.110
