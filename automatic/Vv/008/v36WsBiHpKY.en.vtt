 making for dotcom the eggplant is very 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.589
 versatile and allows us to prepare many 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.240
 recipes of different forms 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.820

 olive salt and pepper to taste 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.640
 We start by cutting the aubergines in 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.870
 1 centimeter thick slices 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.490
 remember that you do not need to remove the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.890
 peel in a large bowl 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.370
 we put plenty of water and a little 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.020
 salt to then submerge the slices 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.880
 let stand for an hour 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.670
 enough to take away the flavor 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.260
 bitter we remove each slice and dry 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.420
 with kitchen paper 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.379
 then cut the aubergines 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.379

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.820
 in a pan heat two tablespoons 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.160

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.160
 eggplants then let cool 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.570

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.810

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.890

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.250
 season with salt and pepper 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.560

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.990

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.570

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.750

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.070
