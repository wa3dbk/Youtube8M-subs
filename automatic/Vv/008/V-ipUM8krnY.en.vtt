form first which is the grace note that
comes<00:01:26.940> before<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.479> beat<00:01:31.310> because<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.610> an

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
comes before the beat because it's an

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.300 
comes before the beat because it's an
ornament<00:01:33.090> there<00:01:33.690> is<00:01:33.780> no<00:01:33.930> one<00:01:34.229> correct<00:01:34.590> way<00:01:35.009> to

ornament there is no one correct way to

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.180 
ornament there is no one correct way to
do<00:01:35.930> an<00:01:36.930> ornament<00:01:37.320> it's<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.619> question<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.979> taste

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
do an ornament it's a question of taste

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.950

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
but there are some conventions that you

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.889 
but there are some conventions that you
have<00:01:46.440> to<00:01:46.649> respect<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.130> little<00:01:47.250> bit<00:01:47.690> the<00:01:48.690> first

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
have to respect a little bit the first

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.310 
have to respect a little bit the first
question<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.320> if<00:01:49.440> it<00:01:49.560> comes<00:01:49.740> before<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.220> beat

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
question is if it comes before the beat

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.840 
question is if it comes before the beat
where<00:01:52.320> how<00:01:52.590> do<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.800> how<00:01:53.100> do<00:01:53.160> you<00:01:53.250> calculate

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
where how do you how do you calculate

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.359 
where how do you how do you calculate
that<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.270> terms<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.720> rhythm<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.740> answer<00:01:56.160> is

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
that in terms of rhythm so the answer is

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.950 
that in terms of rhythm so the answer is
we're<00:01:56.640> going<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.820> steal<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.479> little<00:01:57.720> bit<00:01:57.840> of

we're going to carve out the previous
note<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.490> not<00:02:02.640> going<00:02:02.910> to<00:02:03.030> last<00:02:03.210> for<00:02:03.420> its<00:02:03.539> full

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
note is not going to last for its full

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:12.500 
note is not going to last for its full
value<00:02:10.130> I<00:02:11.130> just<00:02:11.610> kind<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.820> left<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.269> a<00:02:12.300> little

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
value I just kind of left it a little

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.890 
value I just kind of left it a little
early<00:02:14.810> um<00:02:16.549> the<00:02:17.549> simplest<00:02:18.000> way<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.209> practice

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
early um the simplest way to practice

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:26.509 
early um the simplest way to practice
that<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.290> think<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:24.500> make<00:02:25.500> sure<00:02:25.709> you<00:02:25.860> say<00:02:26.070> one<00:02:26.340> on

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
that I think is make sure you say one on

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:39.920 
that I think is make sure you say one on
the<00:02:26.700> open<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:30.170> just<00:02:31.170> try<00:02:31.320> that<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.530> few<00:02:31.709> times<00:02:38.930> and

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
the open a just try that a few times and

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.590 
the open a just try that a few times and
you<00:02:40.049> will<00:02:40.680> kind<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.100> probably<00:02:41.549> be<00:02:42.329> able<00:02:42.450> to

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
you will kind of probably be able to

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.080 
you will kind of probably be able to
place<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:43.049> without<00:02:43.350> thinking<00:02:43.890> about<00:02:44.010> how<00:02:44.730> much

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
place it without thinking about how much

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.210 
place it without thinking about how much
of<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.480> previous<00:02:45.900> note<00:02:46.110> in<00:02:46.260> my<00:02:46.290> carving<00:02:46.890> out

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
of the previous note in my carving out

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.580 
of the previous note in my carving out
I<00:02:47.250> suspect<00:02:47.940> probably<00:02:48.090> in<00:02:48.540> technical<00:02:48.900> terms<00:02:49.110> if

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
I suspect probably in technical terms if

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.259 
I suspect probably in technical terms if
it's<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.040> short<00:02:50.310> note<00:02:50.489> you're<00:02:50.670> probably<00:02:50.970> going

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
it's a short note you're probably going

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.759 
it's a short note you're probably going
to<00:02:51.329> cut<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.660> in<00:02:51.720> half<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.230> if<00:02:52.320> it's<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.560> longer

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
to cut it in half and if it's a longer

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.590 
to cut it in half and if it's a longer
note<00:02:53.070> you<00:02:53.280> might<00:02:53.459> carve<00:02:53.820> out<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.000> quarter<00:02:54.390> or<00:02:54.540> an

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
note you might carve out a quarter or an

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.620 
note you might carve out a quarter or an
eighth<00:02:54.690> of<00:02:54.840> this<00:02:54.989> value<00:02:56.090> it's<00:02:57.090> not<00:02:57.329> always

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
eighth of this value it's not always

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.479 
eighth of this value it's not always
terribly<00:02:58.019> helpful<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.620> make<00:02:58.829> that<00:02:59.070> precise

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
terribly helpful to make that precise

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.600 
terribly helpful to make that precise
calculation<00:03:00.470> if<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.620> just<00:03:01.860> kind<00:03:02.070> of<00:03:02.160> do<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.459> by

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
calculation if you just kind of do it by

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.120 
calculation if you just kind of do it by
how<00:03:02.820> it<00:03:02.970> feels<00:03:03.239> and<00:03:03.570> how<00:03:03.660> it<00:03:03.810> sounds<00:03:04.170> making

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
how it feels and how it sounds making

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.800 
how it feels and how it sounds making
sure<00:03:05.430> that<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.940> actual<00:03:06.120> fact<00:03:06.570> of<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.780> matter

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
sure that the actual fact of the matter

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.199 
sure that the actual fact of the matter
is<00:03:07.019> correct<00:03:07.320> you're<00:03:07.560> probably<00:03:07.829> fine<00:03:08.130> now<00:03:08.850> it

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
is correct you're probably fine now it

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.330 
is correct you're probably fine now it
is<00:03:09.510> possible<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:10.200> also<00:03:10.350> put<00:03:10.799> so<00:03:10.950> this<00:03:11.100> is<00:03:11.220> the

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
is possible to also put so this is the

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.770 
is possible to also put so this is the
second<00:03:11.730> way<00:03:11.850> of<00:03:12.000> doing<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.239> grace<00:03:12.420> note<00:03:12.450> you

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
second way of doing a grace note you

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.050 
second way of doing a grace note you
could<00:03:12.930> also<00:03:13.109> put<00:03:13.440> that<00:03:13.590> grace<00:03:13.769> note<00:03:14.010> on<00:03:14.340> the

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
could also put that grace note on the

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.740 
could also put that grace note on the
beat<00:03:16.100> in<00:03:17.100> which<00:03:17.340> case<00:03:17.609> you're<00:03:17.820> delaying<00:03:18.359> the

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
beat in which case you're delaying the

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.920 
beat in which case you're delaying the
arrival<00:03:18.870> of<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.560> actual<00:03:19.920> note<00:03:20.129> and

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
arrival of the actual note and

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.589 
arrival of the actual note and
and<00:03:21.019> in<00:03:21.349> musical<00:03:21.799> terms<00:03:21.829> you<00:03:22.340> may<00:03:22.849> be<00:03:22.909> creating

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
and in musical terms you may be creating

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.270 
and in musical terms you may be creating
a<00:03:23.750> dissonance<00:03:24.260> because<00:03:24.500> of<00:03:24.920> course<00:03:25.129> the

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
a dissonance because of course the

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.130 
a dissonance because of course the
bassline<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:25.909> piano<00:03:26.209> or<00:03:26.540> if<00:03:26.870> you're<00:03:27.019> playing

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
bassline the piano or if you're playing

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.869 
bassline the piano or if you're playing
with<00:03:27.290> an<00:03:27.379> orchestra<00:03:27.469> the<00:03:28.250> bass<00:03:28.430> will<00:03:28.700> have

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
with an orchestra the bass will have

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.270 
with an orchestra the bass will have
moved<00:03:29.090> to<00:03:29.299> a<00:03:29.329> new<00:03:29.540> chord<00:03:29.900> and<00:03:30.170> by<00:03:30.769> playing

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
moved to a new chord and by playing

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.130 
moved to a new chord and by playing
grace<00:03:31.549> note<00:03:31.760> on<00:03:31.909> the<00:03:32.180> beat<00:03:32.359> you're<00:03:32.780> playing<00:03:33.049> a

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
grace note on the beat you're playing a

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.599 
grace note on the beat you're playing a
note<00:03:33.260> that<00:03:33.469> might<00:03:33.650> be<00:03:33.859> creating<00:03:34.219> a<00:03:34.280> little<00:03:34.489> bit

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
note that might be creating a little bit

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:35.890 
note that might be creating a little bit
of<00:03:34.700> a<00:03:34.760> dissonance<00:03:35.150> so<00:03:35.269> that's<00:03:35.420> considered<00:03:35.810> to

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
of a dissonance so that's considered to

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.449 
of a dissonance so that's considered to
be<00:03:36.019> a<00:03:36.049> little<00:03:36.260> bit<00:03:36.409> of<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.590> little<00:03:37.159> bit<00:03:37.310> of<00:03:37.340> a

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
be a little bit of a little bit of a

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.910 
be a little bit of a little bit of a
thrill<00:03:37.760> you<00:03:38.359> know<00:03:38.480> in<00:03:38.870> musical<00:03:39.409> terms<00:03:39.650> and

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
thrill you know in musical terms and

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.949 
thrill you know in musical terms and
then<00:03:40.670> when<00:03:40.849> your<00:03:41.030> actual<00:03:41.420> note<00:03:41.569> arrives<00:03:41.810> is

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
then when your actual note arrives is

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.500 
then when your actual note arrives is
kind<00:03:42.170> of<00:03:42.260> go<00:03:42.609> so<00:03:43.609> that's<00:03:43.849> the<00:03:44.000> musical

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
kind of go so that's the musical

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:51.759 
kind of go so that's the musical
intention<00:03:48.459> and<00:03:49.569> you<00:03:50.569> could<00:03:50.840> also<00:03:51.109> discuss<00:03:51.560> how

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
intention and you could also discuss how

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:57.420 
intention and you could also discuss how
short<00:03:52.280> or<00:03:52.459> long<00:03:52.760> that<00:03:53.090> grace<00:03:53.450> note<00:03:53.659> should<00:03:53.810> be

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.920 

all<00:03:58.430> right<00:03:58.579> but<00:03:59.090> in<00:03:59.180> that<00:03:59.299> case<00:03:59.480> if<00:03:59.659> it's<00:03:59.780> on

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
all right but in that case if it's on

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.300 
all right but in that case if it's on
the<00:04:00.049> beat<00:04:00.200> you<00:04:00.349> don't<00:04:00.530> need<00:04:00.739> to<00:04:00.859> carve<00:04:01.040> it<00:04:01.189> out

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
the beat you don't need to carve it out

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.129 
the beat you don't need to carve it out
of<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.519> previous<00:04:01.849> note<00:04:02.060> so<00:04:02.269> it's<00:04:02.450> it's<00:04:02.870> quite

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
of the previous note so it's it's quite

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.860 
of the previous note so it's it's quite
simple<00:04:03.470> I<00:04:04.099> have<00:04:04.489> to<00:04:04.639> say<00:04:04.790> it's<00:04:05.359> a<00:04:05.510> little<00:04:05.750> bit

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
simple I have to say it's a little bit

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.659 
simple I have to say it's a little bit
rare<00:04:06.049> to<00:04:06.230> be<00:04:06.319> doing<00:04:06.560> greats<00:04:06.919> notes<00:04:07.129> on<00:04:07.310> the

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669 
rare to be doing greats notes on the

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:09.819 
rare to be doing greats notes on the
beat<00:04:07.819> in<00:04:08.209> your<00:04:08.450> early<00:04:08.840> days<00:04:08.870> of<00:04:09.139> the<00:04:09.260> violin<00:04:09.590> so

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
beat in your early days of the violin so

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
um this one I've heard done both ways

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.589 
um this one I've heard done both ways
I've<00:04:31.430> heard<00:04:31.669> it<00:04:31.760> before<00:04:31.849> the<00:04:32.090> beat<00:04:32.240> I<00:04:32.330> liked<00:04:32.479> it

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:32.599 
I've heard it before the beat I liked it

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:34.960 
I've heard it before the beat I liked it
before<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:32.930> beat<00:04:33.250> oma<00:04:34.250> before<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.639> beat<00:04:34.789> kind

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
before the beat oma before the beat kind

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:47.070 
before the beat oma before the beat kind
of<00:04:35.090> girl<00:04:35.240> but<00:04:35.919> don't<00:04:36.919> slow<00:04:37.159> down<00:04:41.919> for<00:04:42.919> see<00:04:43.580> that

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.600 

so<00:04:48.080> your<00:04:48.380> note<00:04:48.530> this<00:04:48.800> is<00:04:49.010> a<00:04:49.039> note<00:04:49.340> with<00:04:49.490> a<00:04:49.520> dot

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
so your note this is a note with a dot

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.339 
so your note this is a note with a dot
on<00:04:49.820> it<00:04:50.150> so<00:04:50.330> we're<00:04:50.509> not<00:04:50.599> holding<00:04:50.780> it<00:04:51.020> anywhere

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:51.349 
on it so we're not holding it anywhere

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:52.689 
on it so we're not holding it anywhere
near<00:04:51.500> its<00:04:51.620> full<00:04:51.800> value<00:04:51.830> so<00:04:52.220> it's<00:04:52.340> pretty<00:04:52.550> easy

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
near its full value so it's pretty easy

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:56.200 
near its full value so it's pretty easy
to<00:04:52.849> put<00:04:52.970> that<00:04:53.150> Grayson<00:04:53.479> and<00:04:53.720> and<00:04:54.849> in<00:04:55.849> actual

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
Brahms in this is what you put two you

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:14.430 
Brahms in this is what you put two you
have<00:06:12.510> okay<00:06:13.510> we've<00:06:13.720> got<00:06:13.870> grace<00:06:14.050> notes<00:06:14.290> that

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
have okay we've got grace notes that

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.340 
have okay we've got grace notes that
come<00:06:14.590> after<00:06:14.980> a<00:06:15.010> note<00:06:15.270> and<00:06:16.270> if<00:06:16.900> you<00:06:16.990> look<00:06:17.140> at<00:06:17.260> it

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.350 
come after a note and if you look at it

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.660 
come after a note and if you look at it
on<00:06:17.410> the<00:06:17.470> page<00:06:17.710> really<00:06:18.040> the<00:06:18.220> only<00:06:18.370> reason<00:06:18.640> that

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:18.670 
on the page really the only reason that

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.780 
on the page really the only reason that
those<00:06:18.910> are<00:06:19.090> grace<00:06:19.360> notes<00:06:20.340> after<00:06:21.340> the<00:06:21.460> note<00:06:21.640> is

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:21.790 
those are grace notes after the note is

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.700 
those are grace notes after the note is
because<00:06:22.210> the<00:06:22.390> slur<00:06:22.780> goes<00:06:23.110> from<00:06:23.380> the<00:06:23.470> first

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
because the slur goes from the first

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.410 
because the slur goes from the first
note<00:06:23.920> to<00:06:24.190> the<00:06:24.460> grace<00:06:24.640> notes<00:06:24.910> and<00:06:25.150> then<00:06:25.390> you

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:25.420 
note to the grace notes and then you

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.130 
note to the grace notes and then you
have<00:06:25.630> a<00:06:25.660> new<00:06:25.960> bow<00:06:26.140> for<00:06:26.440> the<00:06:26.560> second<00:06:26.950> note<00:06:28.140> you

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140 
have a new bow for the second note you

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.510 
have a new bow for the second note you
see<00:06:29.260> what<00:06:29.380> I<00:06:29.410> mean<00:06:31.860> they<00:06:32.860> could<00:06:33.160> have<00:06:33.280> been

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
see what I mean they could have been

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.450 
see what I mean they could have been

they could have been grace notes of the
second<00:06:36.820> note<00:06:36.970> in<00:06:37.210> a<00:06:37.360> very<00:06:37.540> ordinary<00:06:37.810> way<00:06:38.140> down

second note in a very ordinary way down

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
except that sounds so different it was

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.970 
except that sounds so different it was
like<00:06:51.640> not<00:06:51.790> the<00:06:51.910> same<00:06:52.090> piece<00:06:52.240> at<00:06:52.390> all<00:06:52.510> the<00:06:52.980> in

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:53.980 
like not the same piece at all the in

this case that having that grace will

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.030 
this case that having that grace will
come<00:06:55.630> after<00:06:55.900> the<00:06:55.990> note<00:06:56.170> kind<00:06:56.530> of<00:06:56.680> gives<00:06:56.890> you<00:06:57.010> a

come after the note kind of gives you a

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:03.570 
come after the note kind of gives you a
really<00:06:57.190> unique<00:06:57.790> feeling<00:06:58.270> to<00:06:58.510> this<00:06:58.600> piece<00:07:02.580> it's

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580 
really unique feeling to this piece it's

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.440 
really unique feeling to this piece it's
a<00:07:03.610> little<00:07:03.880> bit<00:07:04.000> tricky<00:07:04.270> to<00:07:04.360> do<00:07:06.120> so<00:07:07.120> what<00:07:07.300> we're

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:07.450 
a little bit tricky to do so what we're

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.060 
a little bit tricky to do so what we're
doing<00:07:07.480> here<00:07:07.720> is<00:07:08.020> we're<00:07:08.200> carving<00:07:08.590> out<00:07:08.710> a<00:07:08.740> little

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.070 
doing here is we're carving out a little

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:14.690 
doing here is we're carving out a little
bit<00:07:09.250> of<00:07:09.340> time<00:07:09.580> from<00:07:10.030> the<00:07:10.450> first<00:07:11.050> original<00:07:11.350> note

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:14.700 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.040 

you've<00:07:15.700> got<00:07:15.910> to<00:07:16.030> get<00:07:16.120> to<00:07:16.240> that<00:07:16.330> second<00:07:16.720> note<00:07:16.810> on

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.050 
you've got to get to that second note on

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.600 
you've got to get to that second note on
time<00:07:17.410> or<00:07:17.650> that'll<00:07:18.010> sound<00:07:18.130> bad

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:18.610 
time or that'll sound bad

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.760 
time or that'll sound bad
so<00:07:19.480> don't<00:07:19.630> go

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:21.770 
so don't go

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.339 
so don't go
no<00:07:22.770> no<00:07:23.009> no<00:07:23.189> yeah<00:07:24.119> you're<00:07:24.779> probably<00:07:24.929> going<00:07:25.259> to

00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:25.349 
no no no yeah you're probably going to

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:27.559 
no no no yeah you're probably going to
divide<00:07:25.589> your<00:07:25.800> note<00:07:25.949> into<00:07:26.309> 1/2<00:07:26.580> or<00:07:26.819> 3/4<00:07:27.509> or

divide your note into 1/2 or 3/4 or
something<00:07:33.319> it<00:07:34.319> may<00:07:34.589> be<00:07:34.649> helpful<00:07:35.099> to<00:07:35.459> think<00:07:35.490> of

00:07:36.109 --> 00:07:36.119 
something it may be helpful to think of

00:07:36.119 --> 00:07:38.989 
something it may be helpful to think of
how<00:07:36.360> far<00:07:36.389> you<00:07:36.749> go<00:07:36.869> in<00:07:36.959> the<00:07:37.050> bow<00:07:37.199> and<00:07:37.919> you<00:07:38.819> might

00:07:38.989 --> 00:07:38.999 
how far you go in the bow and you might

00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:41.570 
how far you go in the bow and you might
say<00:07:39.240> okay<00:07:39.659> I've<00:07:39.839> got<00:07:40.139> this<00:07:40.349> much<00:07:40.589> bow<00:07:40.860> for<00:07:41.490> my

note<00:07:41.819> I'm<00:07:42.599> going<00:07:42.929> to<00:07:43.020> do<00:07:43.169> the<00:07:43.259> grace<00:07:43.469> note<00:07:43.709> when

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:43.889 
note I'm going to do the grace note when

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:45.739 
note I'm going to do the grace note when
I<00:07:43.919> get<00:07:44.159> here<00:07:44.399> so<00:07:44.550> I<00:07:44.580> start<00:07:44.849> here<00:07:44.909> when<00:07:45.539> I<00:07:45.569> get

00:07:45.739 --> 00:07:45.749 
I get here so I start here when I get

00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:47.269 
I get here so I start here when I get
here<00:07:46.050> I<00:07:46.080> do<00:07:46.199> the<00:07:46.349> grace<00:07:46.529> note<00:07:46.770> and<00:07:46.949> that's<00:07:47.099> the

00:07:47.269 --> 00:07:47.279 
here I do the grace note and that's the

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:53.689 
here I do the grace note and that's the
end<00:07:47.490> where<00:07:47.729> the<00:07:47.849> next<00:07:47.999> note<00:07:48.209> comes<00:07:48.449> so<00:07:52.459> see<00:07:53.459> so

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:53.699 
end where the next note comes so see so

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:55.309 
end where the next note comes so see so
you're<00:07:54.270> keeping<00:07:54.569> a<00:07:54.629> couple<00:07:54.869> inches<00:07:54.959> for<00:07:55.229> that

00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:55.319 
you're keeping a couple inches for that

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:57.920 
you're keeping a couple inches for that
so<00:07:55.889> that's<00:07:56.279> something<00:07:56.490> to<00:07:56.839> that's<00:07:57.839> a

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:57.930 
so that's something to that's a

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:58.999 
so that's something to that's a
different<00:07:58.169> way<00:07:58.229> of<00:07:58.259> looking<00:07:58.409> at<00:07:58.649> that<00:07:58.770> can<00:07:58.919> be

00:07:58.999 --> 00:07:59.009 
different way of looking at that can be

00:07:59.009 --> 00:08:02.029 
different way of looking at that can be
really<00:07:59.249> effective<00:07:59.339> so<00:08:00.770> don't<00:08:01.770> worry<00:08:01.949> about

00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:02.039 
really effective so don't worry about

00:08:02.039 --> 00:08:05.029 
really effective so don't worry about
race<00:08:02.399> notes<00:08:02.639> have<00:08:02.849> fun<00:08:03.059> with<00:08:03.240> them<00:08:03.419> and<00:08:04.039> see
