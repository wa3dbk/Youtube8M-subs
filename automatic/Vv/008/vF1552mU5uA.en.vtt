the aircraft is actually going to beat

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.400 
the aircraft is actually going to beat
the<00:00:31.830> initial<00:00:32.219> brochure<00:00:32.759> which<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.690> huge

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
the initial brochure which is a huge

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.110 
the initial brochure which is a huge
accomplishment<00:00:34.590> not<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.430> lot<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.790> new<00:00:35.969> aircraft

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
accomplishment not a lot of new aircraft

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.180 
accomplishment not a lot of new aircraft
designs<00:00:36.870> when<00:00:37.469> they<00:00:37.590> go<00:00:37.739> through<00:00:37.950> flight

designs when they go through flight

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.430 
designs when they go through flight
tests<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.700> actually<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.960> know<00:00:40.079> make<00:00:40.260> that

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
tests can actually you know make that

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.139 
tests can actually you know make that
happen<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.340> be<00:00:41.489> even<00:00:41.760> better<00:00:41.910> than

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
happen and to be even better than

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.080 
happen and to be even better than
brochure<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:43.190> tremendous<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.730> we're<00:00:44.910> better

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
brochure is tremendous so we're better

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.389 
brochure is tremendous so we're better
on<00:00:45.300> fuel<00:00:45.600> burn<00:00:45.870> we're<00:00:46.590> better<00:00:46.800> on-field

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
on fuel burn we're better on-field

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.360 
on fuel burn we're better on-field
performance<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.450> range<00:00:48.750> improvement<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.590> an

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
performance the range improvement is an

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.939

additional<00:00:50.879> 350<00:00:51.690> nautical<00:00:51.899> miles<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.590> we

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
additional 350 nautical miles and we

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.040 
additional 350 nautical miles and we

of<00:01:19.619> take<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> wait-and-see<00:01:20.070> approach<00:01:20.369> let's

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
of take a wait-and-see approach let's

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.940 
of take a wait-and-see approach let's
wait<00:01:21.119> till<00:01:21.299> it's<00:01:21.450> certified<00:01:21.750> let's<00:01:22.560> wait<00:01:22.770> till

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
wait till it's certified let's wait till

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.100 
wait till it's certified let's wait till
it's<00:01:23.100> into<00:01:23.310> service<00:01:23.729> we're<00:01:24.330> almost<00:01:24.509> there<00:01:24.720> and

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
it's into service we're almost there and

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.289 
it's into service we're almost there and
so<00:01:25.590> now<00:01:25.619> it's<00:01:26.040> all<00:01:26.220> about<00:01:26.250> making<00:01:26.820> sure<00:01:27.030> people

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
so now it's all about making sure people

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.640 
so now it's all about making sure people
understand<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.930> attributes<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.500> this

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
understand the attributes of this

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.410

making sure that we're answering those

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.469 
making sure that we're answering those
questions<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.579> doing<00:01:35.820> our<00:01:35.939> best<00:01:36.150> job<00:01:36.420> of

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
questions and doing our best job of

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.630 
questions and doing our best job of
showcasing<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:37.259> aircraft<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:38.250> air<00:01:38.460> show

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
showcasing this aircraft this air show

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.859 
showcasing this aircraft this air show
is<00:01:38.759> really<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.090> start<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.540> because<00:01:39.750> this

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
is really the start of it because this

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.870 
is really the start of it because this
is<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> first<00:01:40.140> time<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.650> people<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.670> very

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
is the first time that people in a very

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.490 
is the first time that people in a very
public<00:01:42.090> way<00:01:42.329> are<00:01:42.840> going<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.079> get<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> view<00:01:43.439> of

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
public way are going to get a view of

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.620 
public way are going to get a view of
this<00:01:43.680> plane<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.130> what<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.369> can<00:01:44.460> do<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.450> there

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
this plane and what it can do so there

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.840 
this plane and what it can do so there
you<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:46.020> Bombardier<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:47.070> understandably
