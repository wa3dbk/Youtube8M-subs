00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.509
 22nd of June 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:21.150
 Melitopol south of Ukraine looks like this 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:23.990
 Today, my fig is Ryazan flax 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.990
 cordon 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:40.570
 shoots that are old enough 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:40.570
 tied to the bottom wire and forms 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.840
 pretty neat wall 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.210
 looking through the fruits 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:14.330
 bushes are still young two years 3 next 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.729
 intense strong growth is not yet 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:21.640
 is observed 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:28.250
 This is my first attempt to say so 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:33.260
 growing figs learning to cordon did 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:39.800
 in order to be more convenient to harbor on 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:47.380
 winter this year peer symbol is wonderful here 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:47.380
 raft tie up like a wire 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.469
 high pipes should not be installed 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.660
 I will conduct further observations 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.860
 interesting in my 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:19.470
 thickly planted bushes 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:23.130
 4 bushes on this piece of land under each 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:27.860
 bush buried 5 liter eggplate 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:30.540
 offensive to watering 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:36.620
 let's follow growth together 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.620
 those bushes are interesting 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:54.269
 Bronzino and Crimean varieties grow here 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:03:01.049
 black is mason and here is my fat 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:02.870
 barrel and he should bear fruit already in 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:07.650
 I think this year 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:09.000
 fruits will ripen conveniently for the winter 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.610
 can clean the basement 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.660
 don't bother soup don't bother 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.660
 with shelter for the winter 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.230
 how much did he sell for clinging 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:35.110
 and the view of the cordon itself without leaves can be 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:39.720
 watch previous videos on my 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:42.720
 channel link is attached in the description 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.720
 good luck
