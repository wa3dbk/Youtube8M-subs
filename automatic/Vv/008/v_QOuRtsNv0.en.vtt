00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.719
 tonight if I feel my birthday and 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.160
 unfortunately we are the other day 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:17.039
 chasing a farmer but if targeted and 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.779
 what should i hear during 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.850
 workouts because he also tells her 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.439
 so you remember the game we have 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.230
 won in Milan 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.570
 what we can do now at home is 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.599
 difficult though our cheer if much 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:36.270
 hot and pg shovels we need 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:38.670
 who left for the future are a 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.590
 player who loves to live stories 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.140
 don't change many in your career 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.120
 teams I lived for many years in Udine 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.280
 lived many years in montegranaro e 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.480
 now I'd like to create a story 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.480
 important correction 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.190
 you are experiencing its best season six 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.500
 I agree I am definitely living from 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.190
 point of view as a player of one 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.770
 important season but I think above all 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.840
 from the point of view of character this is 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.869
 growing up I feel good in a group 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.180
 I am well tuned which I also achieved 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.539
 a maturity that allows you to have 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:26.649
 also a serenity in the ball field 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:28.149
 comes into the hands of antonutti is one 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.130
 real declaration of love 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.960
 what michele antonutti does his own 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.909
 team at reggio emilia who has it 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.409
 adopted Michael found the climate 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.659
 ideal becoming a point of 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.289
 reference for the comrades in the field and 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.830
 out 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:45.220
 the pleasure means that the companions 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:49.210
 stop trust me believe in me how 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:52.890
 person and definitely something that makes you 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.890
 give something extra when you play 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.049
 that something more is not just 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.880
 michele antonutti is the best 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.340
 scorer in the shooting from three of this 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.459
 league with a percentage that goes from 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.509
 60 to 77 percent in case of victory 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.239
 of the team 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.360
 how to become the best shooter for three 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:20.010
 points but mainly it takes 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.410
 training takes a lot of perseverance 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.380
 you have to train you have to try to 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.630
 find a rhythm with your body 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.800
 I believe very much in this belief that the 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:35.610
 shooting is a symbiosis of movements and 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.610
 technique 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.160
 here in your opinion just be good at 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.880
 shot to be indispensable to one 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.530
 team but i'm of the idea that the shot 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.350
 it must certainly be a quality 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.000
 important but not the main one 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.520
 call team play so i guess 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.950
 the passage to put in rhythm a 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.650
 companion to give assistance either 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.550
 something really important maybe 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.550
 more than shooting 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.599
 you have closed the first round well 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.220
 how you are organizing them by preparing to 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.010
 close this league 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.540
 there are those who play with the run off who does 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.780
 the race for salvation 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.430
 our philosophy is to play 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.420
 match per game think every 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.340
 week serenely in the short term there 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.950
 has brought us well so far allows us 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.930
 to work serenely without asking yourself 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.180
 of the pressures they can take away 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.340
 of the energies therefore we succeed in this 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.640
 case in Milan that will be the next tough one 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.640
 game
