00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
but I'm still gonna do the stream for a

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.390 
but I'm still gonna do the stream for a
little<00:00:24.480> while<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.019> I'm<00:00:25.590> not<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> harm<00:00:26.010> %<00:00:26.340> sure

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
little while and I'm not a harm % sure

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.730 
little while and I'm not a harm % sure
if<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.699> can<00:00:26.760> still<00:00:27.090> record<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.930> do<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.529> live

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
if I can still record and do the live

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.950 
if I can still record and do the live
stream<00:00:29.070> at<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.310> same<00:00:29.519> time<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.179> could

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
stream at the same time and that could

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.830 
stream at the same time and that could
be<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.109> problem<00:00:31.320> if<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.520> can't<00:00:33.000> do<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.630> I'll

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
be a problem if I can't do that so I'll

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.569 
be a problem if I can't do that so I'll
check<00:00:34.050> into<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.500> everything<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.399> more

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
check into that and everything but more

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.770 
check into that and everything but more
likely<00:00:35.790> going<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.000> be<00:00:36.120> doing<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.360> live<00:00:36.540> stream

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
likely going to be doing the live stream

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.479 
likely going to be doing the live stream
