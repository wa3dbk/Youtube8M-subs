you how you know so a technique that I
came<00:00:04.859> up<00:00:04.920> with<00:00:05.250> with<00:00:05.460> getting<00:00:05.759> out<00:00:05.879> I<00:00:06.089> had

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
came up with with getting out I had

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.540 
came up with with getting out I had
trouble<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.350> while<00:00:07.379> ago<00:00:07.890> where<00:00:08.160> I<00:00:08.189> was<00:00:08.280> trying

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
trouble a while ago where I was trying

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.000 
trouble a while ago where I was trying
to<00:00:08.580> get<00:00:08.730> up<00:00:08.820> from<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.420> chair<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:10.410> what<00:00:10.920> was

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
to get up from a chair and what was

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.890 
to get up from a chair and what was
happening<00:00:11.160> is<00:00:11.519> that<00:00:11.730> my<00:00:12.179> legs<00:00:12.389> were<00:00:12.540> coming

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
happening is that my legs were coming

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.940 
happening is that my legs were coming
out<00:00:12.960> like<00:00:13.080> this<00:00:13.139> so<00:00:13.380> as<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.650> was<00:00:13.769> leaning

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
out like this so as I was leaning

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:14.660 
out like this so as I was leaning
forward

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
forward

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.700 
forward
my<00:00:14.820> legs<00:00:15.089> were<00:00:15.240> doing<00:00:15.509> this<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.960> so<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.470> was

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
my legs were doing this and so I was

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.650 
my legs were doing this and so I was
never<00:00:16.949> able<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.369> kind<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.699> get<00:00:17.820> myself<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.480> up

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
never able to kind of get myself to up

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.750 
never able to kind of get myself to up
into<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.900> higher<00:00:19.109> position<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.830> so<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.369> found

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
into a higher position and so I found

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.589 
into a higher position and so I found
that<00:00:21.150> by<00:00:21.689> taking<00:00:21.900> just<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.350> regular<00:00:22.680> belt<00:00:22.980> and

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.080 

putting<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.720> on<00:00:27.840> just<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.199> first<00:00:28.410> loop<00:00:29.090> it

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
putting it on just the first loop it

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.880 
putting it on just the first loop it
restricted<00:00:31.369> the<00:00:32.840> my<00:00:33.840> legs<00:00:34.110> from<00:00:34.320> moving<00:00:34.530> apart

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
restricted the my legs from moving apart

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.910 
restricted the my legs from moving apart
from<00:00:35.040> one<00:00:35.219> another<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:36.590> what<00:00:37.590> I'm<00:00:37.649> gonna<00:00:37.739> do

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
from one another so what I'm gonna do

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.819 
from one another so what I'm gonna do
here<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.370> just<00:00:38.430> put<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.790> on<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.969> first<00:00:39.210> loop

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
here is I just put it on the first loop

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.910 
here is I just put it on the first loop
this<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:41.010> just<00:00:41.160> my<00:00:41.700> belt<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.649> I'll<00:00:43.739> put

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
this is just my belt and so I'll put

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.799 
this is just my belt and so I'll put
that<00:00:43.950> there<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.969> know<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.149> can<00:00:45.390> see<00:00:45.629> now

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.720 
that there so you know you can see now
my<00:00:46.140> legs<00:00:46.379> aren't<00:00:46.710> honestly<00:00:47.190> not<00:00:47.340> we're<00:00:47.640> not

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
gonna go anywhere so I didn't realize

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.180 
gonna go anywhere so I didn't realize

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
wanted to get up and I could do this as

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.910 
wanted to get up and I could do this as
well<00:00:54.780> without<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.140> belt<00:00:55.320> but<00:00:55.469> I'm<00:00:55.559> gonna<00:00:55.710> show

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
well without the belt but I'm gonna show

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.950 
well without the belt but I'm gonna show
you<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.460> effects<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.149> what<00:00:57.480> has<00:00:57.570> happened

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960

so<00:00:58.620> let<00:00:59.309> me<00:00:59.399> just<00:00:59.550> kind<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.760> turn<00:00:59.940> sideways

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
so let me just kind of turn sideways

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.380 
so let me just kind of turn sideways
here<00:01:01.039> so<00:01:02.039> without<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> belt<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:05.299> because<00:01:06.299> my

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
here so without a belt on because my

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.000 
here so without a belt on because my
muscles<00:01:06.510> are<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:06.869> weak<00:01:07.110> I'm<00:01:07.320> only<00:01:07.560> able<00:01:07.770> to

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
muscles are so weak I'm only able to

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.219 
muscles are so weak I'm only able to
bend<00:01:08.220> my<00:01:08.430> knees<00:01:08.610> maybe<00:01:08.909> like<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.299> much<00:01:09.360> so

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
bend my knees maybe like this much so

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.080 
bend my knees maybe like this much so
with<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.500> belt<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.920> obviously<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.580> restricts

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
with the belt on obviously it restricts

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.060 
with the belt on obviously it restricts
the<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.510> distance<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.960> which<00:01:13.080> my<00:01:13.229> legs<00:01:13.470> travel

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
the the distance of which my legs travel

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.710 
the the distance of which my legs travel
apart<00:01:14.520> from<00:01:14.670> one<00:01:14.790> another<00:01:14.820> when<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.270> bend<00:01:15.570> them

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
apart from one another when I bend them

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.289 
apart from one another when I bend them
so<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:16.680> literally<00:01:17.009> put<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.549> belt<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:18.060> and

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
so I can literally put this belt on and

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.100 
so I can literally put this belt on and
come<00:01:18.750> down<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.520> this<00:01:20.520> position<00:01:20.990> maybe<00:01:21.990> a

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
come down to this position maybe a

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.950 
come down to this position maybe a
little<00:01:22.290> bit<00:01:22.380> lower<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:23.479> then<00:01:24.479> I'm<00:01:24.630> able<00:01:24.810> to

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
little bit lower and then I'm able to

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.219 
little bit lower and then I'm able to
just<00:01:25.320> push<00:01:26.030> myself<00:01:27.030> back<00:01:27.960> up<00:01:29.450> okay<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:31.079> let's

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
just push myself back up okay so let's

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.210 
just push myself back up okay so let's
see<00:01:31.350> if<00:01:31.470> we<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.710> do<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.799> just<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.040> little<00:01:32.070> bit

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
see if we can do it just a little bit

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.039 
see if we can do it just a little bit
further<00:01:32.430> now<00:01:32.549> without<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:32.970> belt<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.810> I'm

can't<00:01:46.470> stand<00:01:46.710> straight<00:01:47.009> up<00:01:47.040> but<00:01:47.340> I've<00:01:47.490> at

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
can't stand straight up but I've at

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.780 
can't stand straight up but I've at
least<00:01:47.970> minimized<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.460> problem<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.579> being

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
least minimized the problem of being

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.580 
least minimized the problem of being
able<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.180> get<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.479> position<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:52.049> let<00:01:52.500> me

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
able to get to this position so let me

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.810 
able to get to this position so let me
just<00:01:52.770> put<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.979> belt<00:01:53.189> down<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.610> I'm<00:01:53.670> going<00:01:53.790> to

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
just put the belt down and I'm going to

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.440 
just put the belt down and I'm going to
show<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.030> now<00:01:54.829> what's<00:01:55.829> gonna<00:01:55.950> happen<00:01:56.070> if<00:01:56.610> when

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
show you now what's gonna happen if when

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.109 
show you now what's gonna happen if when
I<00:01:57.479> don't<00:01:57.719> have<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.020> belt<00:01:58.200> on<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:59.399> I'm<00:01:59.969> gonna

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
I don't have the belt on so I'm gonna

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.429 
I don't have the belt on so I'm gonna
bend<00:02:00.360> as<00:02:00.509> far<00:02:00.750> as<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:00.960> can<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.259> then<00:02:01.380> you're

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
bend as far as I can and then you're

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.929 
bend as far as I can and then you're
gonna<00:02:01.560> see<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:01.920> probably<00:02:02.100> just<00:02:02.340> drop<00:02:02.670> yet

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
gonna see it probably just drop yet

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.749 
gonna see it probably just drop yet
right<00:02:03.090> there<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:04.110> now<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:05.310> can<00:02:05.430> see<00:02:05.579> in<00:02:05.670> this

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
right there so now you can see in this

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.160 
right there so now you can see in this
position<00:02:06.149> here<00:02:06.329> where<00:02:06.719> my<00:02:06.810> legs<00:02:06.990> are

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
position here where my legs are

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.169 
position here where my legs are
positioned<00:02:07.649> but<00:02:08.099> not<00:02:08.280> real<00:02:08.520> tight<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.060> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
positioned but not real tight and so the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.669 
positioned but not real tight and so the
far<00:02:09.360> apart<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:09.690> if<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:09.959> wanted<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.319> push<00:02:10.470> myself
