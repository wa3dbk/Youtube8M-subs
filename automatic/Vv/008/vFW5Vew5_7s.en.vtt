picture is mad chiliad the little symbol

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.479 
picture is mad chiliad the little symbol
remember<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:54.899> top<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.230> was<00:00:55.289> like<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.680> no<00:00:56.250> it

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
remember that on top it was like a no it

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.250 
remember that on top it was like a no it
was<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.760> over<00:00:57.239> one<00:00:57.390> its<00:00:57.539> side<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.079> line

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
was like a over one its side of a line

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.049 
was like a over one its side of a line
through<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.399> keep<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.000> in

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
through it and just just keep that in

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.090 
through it and just just keep that in
mind<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.809> then<00:01:01.020> if<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.260> run<00:01:01.440> up<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.829> here

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
mind and then if you run up to here

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.650 
mind and then if you run up to here
where<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> view<00:01:02.579> point<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.030> right<00:01:03.300> at<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.449> top

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
where the view point is right at the top

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.740 
where the view point is right at the top
you'll<00:01:03.840> see<00:01:03.870> two<00:01:04.199> dirt<00:01:04.890> bikes<00:01:05.129> up<00:01:05.339> here

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
you'll see two dirt bikes up here

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.950 
you'll see two dirt bikes up here
underneath<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:07.080> actual<00:01:07.470> platinum<00:01:07.950> life<00:01:08.340> is

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
underneath this actual platinum life is

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.750 
underneath this actual platinum life is
that<00:01:09.960> same<00:01:10.380> symbol<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:10.920> was<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.460> top<00:01:11.640> of

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
that same symbol that was on the top of

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.300 
that same symbol that was on the top of
the<00:01:11.850> mountain<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.869> picture<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.830> I'm

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
the mountain on in the picture so I'm

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.700 
the mountain on in the picture so I'm
thinking<00:01:14.970> something<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.930> going<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.470> come<00:01:16.500> out

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
thinking something is going to come out

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.730 
thinking something is going to come out
of<00:01:16.830> here<00:01:17.250> obviously<00:01:17.970> I'm<00:01:18.780> not<00:01:18.990> too<00:01:19.200> sure<00:01:19.439> what

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
of here obviously I'm not too sure what

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.190 
of here obviously I'm not too sure what
but<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.159> from<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:20.970> diagram<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> wall<00:01:21.990> I'm

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
but it from that diagram on the wall I'm

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.679 
but it from that diagram on the wall I'm
sure<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.979> something<00:01:23.250> will<00:01:23.520> happen<00:01:24.119> on<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
sure that something will happen on the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.270 
sure that something will happen on the
top<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.110> mountain<00:01:25.500> where<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.830> symbol<00:01:26.189> is

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
top of the mountain where that symbol is

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.760 
top of the mountain where that symbol is

as<00:02:27.180> well<00:02:27.300> that<00:02:27.330> might<00:02:27.690> be<00:02:27.840> something<00:02:28.260> similar

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
as well that might be something similar

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.220 
as well that might be something similar
or<00:02:29.459> relative<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.300> I<00:02:30.480> don't<00:02:30.720> behave<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:31.080> see

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
or relative and I don't behave you see

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.350 
or relative and I don't behave you see
the<00:02:31.380> same<00:02:31.590> symbol<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.610> then<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.819> see<00:02:33.000> three

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
the same symbol and then you see three

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.840 
the same symbol and then you see three
lines<00:02:33.600> and<00:02:34.050> then<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.290> see<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.709> moon<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.520> I

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
lines and then you see the moon so I

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.270 
lines and then you see the moon so I
don't<00:02:36.330> know<00:02:36.390> what<00:02:36.569> this<00:02:36.660> is<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:37.110> think<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.130> might

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
don't know what this is I think it might

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.000 
don't know what this is I think it might
be<00:02:38.310> an<00:02:38.489> easter<00:02:38.790> egg<00:02:38.819> but<00:02:39.209> if<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.450> guys<00:02:39.600> have
