know it'd be nice to have Rob Boulder up
there<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.370> know<00:00:35.520> there's<00:00:35.910> multiple

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
there I know there's multiple

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.090 
there I know there's multiple
configurations<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.290> plants<00:00:37.620> for<00:00:37.710> Bob<00:00:37.860> Hope

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
configurations of plants for Bob Hope

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.729

but<00:00:39.030> what<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.510> went<00:00:39.780> did<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:39.989> bought<00:00:40.230> up<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.500> small

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
but what I went did I bought up a small

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.229 
but what I went did I bought up a small
piece<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.160> acutight<00:00:41.460> rail<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:41.850> think<00:00:42.149> this

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
piece of the acutight rail I think this

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.360 
piece of the acutight rail I think this
is<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.480> 90<00:00:42.809> size<00:00:43.050> it's<00:00:43.920> got<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.100> real<00:00:44.250> nice

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
is the 90 size it's got a real nice

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.709 
is the 90 size it's got a real nice
curve<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.910> back<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.390> fit<00:00:45.570> up<00:00:45.690> here

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
curve in the back and it fit up here

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.020 
curve in the back and it fit up here
well<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.950> I'm<00:00:47.070> gonna<00:00:47.219> mount<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.760> top

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
well so I'm gonna mount this to the top

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.750 
well so I'm gonna mount this to the top
and<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:48.899> way<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.079> can<00:00:49.320> use<00:00:49.500> any<00:00:50.010> accessory

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
and that way I can use any accessory

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.360 
and that way I can use any accessory
that<00:00:50.789> fits<00:00:51.149> off<00:00:51.329> on<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.600> ball<00:00:52.079> ram<00:00:52.469> ball<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:53.010> can

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
that fits off on a ball ram ball I can

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.490 
that fits off on a ball ram ball I can
put<00:00:53.640> up<00:00:53.670> here<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.170> doesn't<00:00:55.320> matter

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
put up here and it doesn't matter

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.049 
put up here and it doesn't matter
whether<00:00:55.680> it's<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> camera<00:00:56.129> mount<00:00:56.489> or<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.789> rod

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
whether it's a camera mount or a rod

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.760 
whether it's a camera mount or a rod
holder<00:00:57.510> or<00:00:57.660> whatever<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.050> can<00:00:58.199> swap<00:00:58.530> rod

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
holder or whatever I can swap rod

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.410 
holder or whatever I can swap rod
holders<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.280> them<00:00:59.399> out<00:00:59.520> so<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.760> can<00:00:59.940> use<00:01:00.090> up<00:01:00.239> from

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
holders in them out so I can use up from

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.360 
holders in them out so I can use up from
the<00:01:00.510> fly<00:01:00.750> rod

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the fly rod

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.740 
the fly rod
I<00:01:02.489> think<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.120> going<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.300> be<00:01:03.360> pretty<00:01:03.510> useful

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
I think it's going to be pretty useful

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.719 
I think it's going to be pretty useful
we'll<00:01:04.049> see<00:01:04.199> how<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.350> turns<00:01:04.619> out<00:01:05.129> one<00:01:05.460> thing<00:01:05.640> you

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
we'll see how it turns out one thing you

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:06.770 
we'll see how it turns out one thing you
need<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.940> realize<00:01:06.270> when<00:01:06.479> you're<00:01:06.600> drilling

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
need to realize when you're drilling

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.899 
need to realize when you're drilling
into<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> round<00:01:07.380> surface<00:01:07.710> always<00:01:08.400> use<00:01:08.729> some

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909

if<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.149> notice<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.630> was<00:02:09.660> tilted<00:02:10.019> a<00:02:10.289> little

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
if you notice it was tilted a little

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.690 
if you notice it was tilted a little
down<00:02:10.739> when<00:02:10.769> it<00:02:11.099> was<00:02:11.130> in<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.310> down<00:02:11.519> position

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
down when it was in the down position

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.180 
down when it was in the down position
that's<00:02:12.510> because<00:02:13.140> when<00:02:13.349> it<00:02:13.440> comes<00:02:13.650> up<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:13.890> got

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
that's because when it comes up you got

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.710 
that's because when it comes up you got
a<00:02:14.220> match<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.580> angle<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.030> wanted<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.450> straight

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
a match that angle I wanted it straight

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.600 
a match that angle I wanted it straight
up<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.019> down<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:16.650> this<00:02:16.950> turned<00:02:17.220> out<00:02:17.310> just

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
up and down so this turned out just

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.699 
up and down so this turned out just
perfect<00:02:18.030> another<00:02:18.840> modification<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.560> might

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
perfect another modification you might

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.780
