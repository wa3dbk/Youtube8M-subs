00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:18.170
 I entered the Grenoble football 38a 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.700
 reached during and then I stayed 4 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.450
 years to the 2011 bankruptcy 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:27.950
 then I did three years trainee 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.990
 no and here is a relationship a little 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.700
 mixed because because I was hoping 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.910
 I hope to have a little con 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.350
 I was hoping for my qualities I'm going 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.630
 stay at home is in reserve I 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.220
 some red bands but not what 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.440
 make a conviction of 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.030
 broad relative constraints but one is 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.380
 good echoes I know people who 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.170
 did last year with some 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.390
 especially not bad kills not the rain 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.980
 mali greater well a way of 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.930
 myself when we see the program of 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.780
 friendly matches are in preparation 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.540
 I think you m dry lakes either 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.670
 glad that the phone rings only the 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.260
 here another shot of the groups a real 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.040
 physical preparation then the matches that 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.850
 will serve to show just 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:13.310
 what I need is rather everyone 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.740
 who each to his goals and who will 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.810
 try to realize them and the positive 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.219
 vallier we are all together and that's 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.409
 sure 11 years of good performance 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:24.380
 in friendly matches all together we 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.030
 will be able to more power is it 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.220
 mutually somehow 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.170
 Here the defenses being many zac 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.020
 did a very good well we all go 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.820
 to draw from positive otherwise yeah I think 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.820
 that there is no reason that we arrive 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.460
 below what I see there is 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.600
 a lot of good players who are from 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.710
 different ages are different 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.840
 careers of experienced players 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.979
 department - who were injured who 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.530
 have crossed 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.110
 so we are all we all very very 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.369
 already hungry because otherwise what is it 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.710
 test at the stage you have to register for 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.930
 to have landi forum have to do things 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.550
 so if we already know that we really 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.190
 desire 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.890
 yeah I died of hunger is 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.710
 clear that i really really want in 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.300
 this situation that is not nice 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.640
 but this is part of life 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.610
 of a footballer so I hang on 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.950
 work and then I count everything 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.800
 to do for to show studies have 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.000
 showed that supper but hey that's 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.370
 also shows it on a ground in 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.010
 anyway the mountain bike stage and it gives the 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.900
 chance to show and evaluate yourself 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.600
 clubs in which we want to 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.910
 recruit 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.799
 I'm obviously doing this myself 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.320
 is not worth looking for too much is called 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.239
 researchers from a club that was in 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.250
 link 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.620
 my journey we have embarrassed him 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.840
 league 2 feels very good it's this 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.190
 who gives himself and the song 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.190
