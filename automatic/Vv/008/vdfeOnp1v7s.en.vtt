in the corner figure Kombat X and it's

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.749 
in the corner figure Kombat X and it's
going<00:05:05.159> to<00:05:05.219> be<00:05:05.340> a<00:05:05.370> double<00:05:05.610> Bank<00:05:06.000> off<00:05:06.270> the

going to be a double Bank off the

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.420 
going to be a double Bank off the
there's<00:05:08.759> like<00:05:08.909> a<00:05:08.939> a<00:05:09.229> three-part<00:05:10.229> cross<00:05:10.770> on

there's like a a three-part cross on

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.920 
there's like a a three-part cross on
those<00:05:11.879> i-beams<00:05:12.120> so<00:05:12.569> it's<00:05:12.659> going<00:05:12.750> to<00:05:12.810> bounce

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
those i-beams so it's going to bounce

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.170 
those i-beams so it's going to bounce
off<00:05:13.169> that<00:05:13.229> off<00:05:13.620> the<00:05:13.919> wall<00:05:14.099> roll<00:05:14.789> along<00:05:14.879> the<00:05:15.060> guy

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
off that off the wall roll along the guy

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.209

so<00:05:15.629> anyway<00:05:15.990> good<00:05:16.620> luck<00:05:16.650> with<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:16.919> SMD

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:17.219 
so anyway good luck with the SMD

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:18.800 
so anyway good luck with the SMD
