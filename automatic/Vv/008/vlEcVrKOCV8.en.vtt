00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 very good guys here we are in another 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.160
 gta 5 languages ​​online and in this case 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.690
 I bring you a new trick in the pole I'm going 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.950
 to teach how to put any 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.120
 street car be it a car 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.219
 sporty and makes a luxury car 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.929
 any street car in our 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.940
 garage completely free of charge 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.529
 ballistic so good for example if 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.480
 we found ourselves on the street a 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.010
 parked then with this trick we are going to 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.900
 I can take it and put it in our 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.029
 garage free of charge and in a very 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.980
 fast so it's a trick which 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.570
 they miss dollars with a like and very rich 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.390
 well before I started I wanted to tell you a 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.399
 pretty important fact of this video 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.719
 specifically and is that I think that 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.190
 to do this trick we need a 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.380
 pretty internet connection pretty 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.510
 good because to me this trick does not work out 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.370
 ford and measure edit now to see how 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.110
 you're going to upload a trick which is not 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.610
 it comes out to you when I before 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.960
 decide to upload this trick that 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.100
 true has come out to me whole but the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.690
 last step has been the only thing that did not 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.539
 has left because my internet connection the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.949
 real slobber because I have 10 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.719
 megas with movistar and I get to less than 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.520
 some say money I do not know how to fuck 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.780
 I can upload mental videos to eternity 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.399
 but good as I say I have a connection 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.750
 of shit and because I decided to do 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.129
 turn to upload this trick if I do not 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.180
 it comes out because there are subscribers that 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.559
 they have a pretty good connection 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.800
 Subscribers that more than subscribers 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.540
 they are friends 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.040
 Lan's trick had in my mouth and I've seen 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.660
 as if it works and take a car from 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.130
 the street and they put it in their separate garage 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.050
 I have also seen different videos of 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.970
 English youtube and such which in 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.370
 youtube also Spanish that have gone up 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.660
 this trick does in a day or so and yes that 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.280
 they also come out okay so I decided 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.660
 to upload this trick even though I do not 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.430
 come out I've been trying since yesterday 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.750
 and I said why the hell does not I get the 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.280
 trick and that is that I really stay 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.810
 super-start enters inside a 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.040
 games leave the game to the credit and 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.350
 what are the steps but if I stay 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.730
 very clear and in the end it does not work out 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.050
 this case yes it came out but in the 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.220
 Last ride did not disappear the car 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.750
 it's still super cool so good 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.370
 well let's start with the trick I'm going to 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.630
 to say the steps is worth it is that you are going to 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.490
 have everyone on screen minus the last 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.020
 well we have to do well then what 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.210
 first we have to take the car the 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.830
 which we want to put in our channel 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.390
 obviously so it takes the street not 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.070
 same car recall I think it was a 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.690
 charring is if I remember correctly so 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.130
 we take it and we go to the door of 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.270
 our garage and we just left it 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.590
 in the position that I proposed more or 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.180
 less good and close to the doors of the 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.860
 garage we leave them right there and 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.560
 we enter inside our garage and 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.200
 now we will have to take a car and 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.970
 this car which from our garage what 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.560
 let's lose that is going to be the car the 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.119
 which one we are going to replace with the car 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.620
 which is just outside or replace or 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.490
 how do you want to call it worth that car goes 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.080
 to be replaced by him 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.720
 outside so take a yellow car 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.280
 because you are going to lose it then we take 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.430
 the car and now we have to do the 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.420
 next procedure is worth enough 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.920
 fast and hard so to speak but 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.230
 I will surely get the hang 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.000
 we have to accelerate just when 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.350
 we accelerate we give the little arrow 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.790
 down the command cursors and 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.680
 you know the arrow work to change 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.000
 character and just when the 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.080
 option to switch characters while 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.550
 we are obviously accelerating while 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.720
 that the screen goes dark to 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.950
 leave the garage quickly 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.600
 we have to give it as I say the little arrow 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.010
 down to change character by 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.080
 example to maikel or clover and quickly 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.000
 drop and then we will appear a 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.980
 kind of that sign which we 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.240
 will put if we want to go to the campaign and not 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.890
 we have to do it before leaving the 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.000
 garage is ok and then we will give 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.440
 that there was not to produce a kind of 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.790
 ships in which we can drive by 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.050
 all the garage is worth this will ya 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.700
 had already time but then 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.500
 we know on this ship or so 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.510
 call it we have to give the start and 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.100
 join a random activity bar a 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.330
 activity that wins us os 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.250
 we unite and when we are sinking 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.620
 well, we still do not expect anything worthy and when 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.880
 we have joined because we give to 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.110
 back to go back to the same game 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.460
 It's worth here when my problem comes 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.840
 because my condition stretches a lot 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.340
 that if it goes to hell that if sometimes 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.530
 It does not even get me into the game if I'm 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.540
 I frustrate myself here in my room 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.890
 I start there to scream 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.960
 but it is a rage of 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.670
 explain to see when you see change of 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.650
 connection because mother of mine and now you will see 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.670
 that I get the perfect trick I 'm going 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.680
 to the garage to the haber and that are the ship 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.180
 dany characters to the garage lawyer and 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.400
 there should be my carbonize is 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.530
 to get on and accelerate now what 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.850
 we will have to do is this step 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.500
 I came out and skate should be 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.430
 our channeling is when we leave it and 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.140
 then the only thing that we will have to 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.590
 do is ride and accelerate and then 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.660
 the trick would play good in the game if 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.400
 would play then you will see how it starts 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.320
 to run with the character and he turned to 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.610
 garage not then then if that had 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.710
 made with a car can be ribs 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.120
 would be automatically mine since there would be 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.340
 accelerated with the car of the car the 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.630
 game I would return it to my garage and it will come out 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.460
 the kinematics that the car is 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.740
 leaving the garage and then that 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.090
 car would automatically be the same 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.410
 So, well, as I say, it's a 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.880
 trick that has not come to me but yes 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.770
 that seen the very same very same 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.780
 noses so to speak I've seen it to 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.460
 Two not three subscribers have done it to me 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.960
 in front of me so I can confirm 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.520
 that this trick works if you had a 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.110
 connection if we had the godmother connection 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.700
 I can not guarantee anything because I 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.780
 frustro too much really so 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.920
 put me basically everything is 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.240
 professional this video I will leave a 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.500
 favorite layman and he liked to subscribe 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.190
 to the channel if not all six and we see the 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.190
 next goodbye
