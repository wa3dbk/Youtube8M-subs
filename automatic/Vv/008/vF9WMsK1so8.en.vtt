00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.050 

gonna<00:03:17.310> take<00:03:17.550> one<00:03:17.880> of<00:03:17.970> our<00:03:18.060> matches<00:03:20.060> and

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
gonna take one of our matches and

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.680 
gonna take one of our matches and
measure<00:03:21.990> about<00:03:22.260> here<00:03:23.300> you<00:03:24.300> can<00:03:24.510> see<00:03:24.750> me<00:03:24.930> here

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
measure about here you can see me here

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.870 
measure about here you can see me here
dry<00:03:27.690> there<00:03:27.900> there<00:03:28.410> we<00:03:28.560> go<00:03:28.709> how's<00:03:29.190> that<00:03:29.220> okay

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
dry there there we go how's that okay

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.580 
dry there there we go how's that okay
and<00:03:30.360> then<00:03:31.069> I'm<00:03:32.069> gonna<00:03:32.250> cut<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:32.880> a<00:03:33.200> little<00:03:34.200> bit

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
and then I'm gonna cut it a little bit

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:43.820 
and then I'm gonna cut it a little bit
of<00:03:34.620> an<00:03:34.770> angle<00:03:35.040> here<00:03:36.620> just<00:03:37.620> like<00:03:37.800> that<00:03:42.830> working

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
of an angle here just like that working

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.560 
of an angle here just like that working
so<00:03:44.340> we<00:03:44.430> end<00:03:44.550> up<00:03:44.760> with<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:46.910> is<00:03:47.910> a<00:03:48.120> wedge-shaped

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
so we end up with it is a wedge-shaped

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.170 
so we end up with it is a wedge-shaped
there<00:03:49.880> and<00:03:50.880> down<00:03:51.840> into<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.500> hole<00:03:52.819> it<00:03:53.819> goes

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
there and down into the hole it goes

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.979 
there and down into the hole it goes
like<00:03:54.950> so<00:03:56.900> so<00:03:59.209> we'll<00:04:00.209> take<00:04:00.360> another<00:04:00.390> one<00:04:00.870> of<00:04:00.959> our

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
like so so we'll take another one of our

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:07.850 
like so so we'll take another one of our
matches<00:04:01.560> here<00:04:02.840> do<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.900> same<00:04:04.230> thing<00:04:06.800> this<00:04:07.800> time

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
matches here do the same thing this time
