00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
fit a much more better role than Seth

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.490 
fit a much more better role than Seth
Rollins<00:00:49.089> because<00:00:49.570> Seth<00:00:49.750> Rollins<00:00:49.960> is<00:00:50.290> like

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
Rollins because Seth Rollins is like

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.649 
Rollins because Seth Rollins is like
he's<00:00:51.070> an<00:00:51.190> incredible<00:00:51.699> perform<00:00:52.119> an<00:00:52.210> incredible

wrestler but of course having that heel
persona<00:00:54.760> I<00:00:55.210> think<00:00:55.510> Dean<00:00:56.290> Ambrose<00:00:56.650> would<00:00:56.799> have

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
persona I think Dean Ambrose would have

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:57.990 
persona I think Dean Ambrose would have
served<00:00:57.159> a<00:00:57.220> better<00:00:57.369> purpose<00:00:57.580> but<00:00:57.820> nonetheless

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
served a better purpose but nonetheless

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.660

winner of this match will be Seth
Rollins<00:01:07.600> of<00:01:07.930> course<00:01:08.170> because<00:01:08.470> number<00:01:08.770> one<00:01:08.799> the

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
him they're giving him a huge run so why

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.180 
him they're giving him a huge run so why
would<00:01:13.750> that<00:01:13.870> momentum<00:01:14.440> just<00:01:14.650> suddenly<00:01:14.800> die

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
would that momentum just suddenly die

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.130 
would that momentum just suddenly die
off<00:01:15.400> by<00:01:15.670> Dean<00:01:15.940> Ambrose<00:01:16.330> taking<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:16.810> victory

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
off by Dean Ambrose taking the victory

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.020 
off by Dean Ambrose taking the victory
because<00:01:17.290> if<00:01:17.680> Dean<00:01:18.190> Ambrose<00:01:18.610> takes<00:01:18.880> the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
because if Dean Ambrose takes the

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.670 
because if Dean Ambrose takes the
victory<00:01:19.150> where<00:01:19.660> does<00:01:19.810> Dean<00:01:19.990> Ambrose<00:01:20.320> go<00:01:20.440> from

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
victory where does Dean Ambrose go from

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.870 
victory where does Dean Ambrose go from
there<00:01:20.860> you<00:01:20.950> know<00:01:21.040> what<00:01:21.100> I<00:01:21.160> mean<00:01:21.190> where<00:01:21.760> does

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
there you know what I mean where does

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.280 
there you know what I mean where does
Seth<00:01:22.120> Rollins<00:01:22.210> go<00:01:22.720> from<00:01:22.900> there<00:01:23.020> of<00:01:23.110> course

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
Seth Rollins go from there of course

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.440 
Seth Rollins go from there of course
he'll<00:01:23.530> still<00:01:23.800> have<00:01:23.920> money<00:01:24.520> in<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:24.730> bank<00:01:24.880> but

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
he'll still have money in the bank but

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.000 
he'll still have money in the bank but
then<00:01:25.600> again<00:01:25.720> I<00:01:25.900> mean<00:01:26.170> going<00:01:26.380> into<00:01:26.530> this<00:01:26.740> match

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
then again I mean going into this match

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.620 
then again I mean going into this match
I<00:01:27.310> think<00:01:27.550> this<00:01:27.640> match<00:01:27.880> is<00:01:28.060> going<00:01:28.180> to<00:01:28.270> be<00:01:28.390> one<00:01:28.540> of

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
I think this match is going to be one of

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.360 
I think this match is going to be one of
the<00:01:28.690> best<00:01:28.840> matches<00:01:29.290> of<00:01:29.440> the<00:01:29.470> night<00:01:29.800> if<00:01:30.040> not

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
the best matches of the night if not

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.040 
the best matches of the night if not
probably<00:01:30.820> match<00:01:31.120> of<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.540> night<00:01:31.570> given<00:01:31.990> the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
probably match of the night given the

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.320 
probably match of the night given the
fact<00:01:32.260> that<00:01:32.380> both<00:01:33.040> Seth<00:01:33.460> Rollins<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:34.180> Dean

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
fact that both Seth Rollins and Dean

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.760 
fact that both Seth Rollins and Dean
Ambrose<00:01:34.750> are<00:01:34.930> just<00:01:35.080> absolutely<00:01:35.290> amazing

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
Ambrose are just absolutely amazing

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.680

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280

credible<00:01:42.790> purpose<00:01:43.150> and<00:01:43.630> especially<00:01:43.900> leading

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
credible purpose and especially leading

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.200 
credible purpose and especially leading
to<00:01:44.500> into<00:01:44.650> other<00:01:44.800> things<00:01:44.890> now<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.700> way<00:01:45.970> I<00:01:46.000> see

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
to into other things now the way I see

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.030 
to into other things now the way I see
this<00:01:46.630> going<00:01:46.840> about<00:01:47.140> I<00:01:47.200> feel<00:01:47.680> like<00:01:47.800> there's

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
this going about I feel like there's

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.560 
this going about I feel like there's
going<00:01:48.190> to<00:01:48.250> be<00:01:48.280> some<00:01:48.640> sort<00:01:48.850> of<00:01:48.970> interruption

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
going to be some sort of interruption

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.480 
going to be some sort of interruption
happening<00:01:49.990> that's<00:01:50.470> going<00:01:50.710> to<00:01:50.830> cost<00:01:51.100> Dean

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
happening that's going to cost Dean

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.430 
happening that's going to cost Dean
Ambrose<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:51.909> match<00:01:52.180> now<00:01:52.450> I<00:01:52.690> don't<00:01:53.170> want<00:01:53.380> to

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
Ambrose the match now I don't want to

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.510 
Ambrose the match now I don't want to
think<00:01:53.590> about<00:01:53.680> that<00:01:53.830> kind<00:01:54.159> of<00:01:54.190> stuff<00:01:54.250> because

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
think about that kind of stuff because

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.270 
think about that kind of stuff because
it<00:01:54.790> ruins<00:01:54.940> matches<00:01:55.510> but<00:01:55.720> in<00:01:56.130> essence<00:01:57.130> i<00:01:57.220> do

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
it ruins matches but in essence i do

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.920 
it ruins matches but in essence i do
believe<00:01:57.550> that<00:01:57.880> there<00:01:58.479> will<00:01:58.690> be<00:01:58.720> an

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
believe that there will be an

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.960 
believe that there will be an
interference<00:01:59.470> although<00:01:59.890> i<00:01:59.920> do<00:02:00.070> not<00:02:00.370> like<00:02:00.400> it<00:02:00.820> I

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
interference although i do not like it I

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.760 
interference although i do not like it I
mean<00:02:01.150> it<00:02:01.300> might<00:02:01.450> be<00:02:01.630> Kane<00:02:01.900> and<00:02:02.110> might<00:02:02.229> be<00:02:02.380> Randy

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
mean it might be Kane and might be Randy

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.590 
mean it might be Kane and might be Randy
organ<00:02:03.100> man<00:02:03.250> might<00:02:03.490> be<00:02:03.610> Triple<00:02:04.000> H<00:02:04.120> for<00:02:04.360> all<00:02:04.450> we

organ man might be Triple H for all we

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.660 
organ man might be Triple H for all we

there<00:02:07.060> might<00:02:07.210> be<00:02:07.270> an<00:02:07.479> interruption<00:02:07.690> which

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
there might be an interruption which

continue<00:04:19.730> I<00:04:19.760> don't<00:04:20.239> think<00:04:20.480> it<00:04:20.570> might<00:04:20.750> end<00:04:20.900> here

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
continue I don't think it might end here

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.530 
continue I don't think it might end here
because<00:04:22.010> I<00:04:22.040> do<00:04:22.190> believe<00:04:22.520> Dean<00:04:22.880> Ambrose<00:04:23.270> might

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
because I do believe Dean Ambrose might

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.090 
because I do believe Dean Ambrose might
go<00:04:23.660> on<00:04:23.780> ahead<00:04:23.900> and<00:04:24.170> keep<00:04:24.350> chasing<00:04:24.860> Seth

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
Rollins even though if there is an

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.850 
Rollins even though if there is an
interruption<00:04:26.810> he<00:04:27.020> might<00:04:27.170> chase<00:04:27.410> him<00:04:27.590> as<00:04:27.710> well

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860
