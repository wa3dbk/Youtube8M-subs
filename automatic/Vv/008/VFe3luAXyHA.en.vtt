00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.090
 Yes, in the old days cars have been lost for the past year, so rough 2 wheels 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.019
 Good driving first 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.249
 Jaguar doesn't come out and I'm Doo 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:15.449
 There was a slander that sank in the movie sea. 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.599
 From now on everyone throws away trash 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:19.900
 Recently administration 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.499
 Director Kishino 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:24.109
 I was trying not to go outside 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.239
 I think this kind of thing is also important 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.659
 f The car of winter car stands out 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:32.659
 Because this is numbered 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.740
 I wonder if this person is there 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.740
 This is not illegal dumping 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.360
 It is thrown away because there is nothing here 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.300
 is not it 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.300
 The last thing is 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.320
 How is this 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.770
 Illegal dumping reexamination 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.790
 We are completely 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.790
 It is chai 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.700
 This is completely 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.970
 The license plate was removed 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.970
 Someone probably tied a tire 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.020
 Well another car safety and environmental problems are said variously 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.810
 But one more problem with this car 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.509
 After all, with the cycle no longer needed 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.200
 The question of whether to be together 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.230
 And 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.070
 For that reason, the recycling law has recently been 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.090
 Because it was possible 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.810
 At the time of the preview meeting and its recycling 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.630
 The money used is also in the form of the original from the beginning 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.310
 Runn 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.860
 So you guys well that thing well 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.380
 Buying a car 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.550
 When disposing of a car 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.200
 How is the thing that I lost 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.450
 Even if it is processed without giving the environmental load of the policeman 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.750
 I am conscious 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.799
 Is it a thing 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.310
 Or costume 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.670
 I think it is important to finish using
