00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.710 
actually a really interesting little app

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.950 
actually a really interesting little app
it<00:00:16.710> claims<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.640> be<00:00:17.789> able<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.180> blow<00:00:18.359> out<00:00:18.510> candles

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
and whatnot the problem is that it

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.500 
and whatnot the problem is that it
starts<00:00:24.720> automatically

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
starts automatically

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.540

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
so what happens is a

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.770 
so what happens is a
I<00:00:37.710> would<00:00:38.399> like<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.579> start<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.969> nap<00:00:39.149> without<00:00:39.329> it

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
of this which is why you think you have

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.220 
of this which is why you think you have
this<00:00:43.829> handy<00:00:44.519> off<00:00:44.699> switch<00:00:45.180> right<00:00:45.210> there<00:00:45.539> except

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
this handy off switch right there except

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.139 
this handy off switch right there except
that<00:00:46.379> when<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.739> start<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.100> app<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.610> starts<00:00:48.030> at

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
that when you start the app it starts at

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.970 
that when you start the app it starts at
next

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.570 

let's<00:00:52.370> try

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.980 

um<00:00:56.580> you<00:00:57.000> can<00:00:57.120> see<00:00:57.270> there's<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> cool<00:00:57.750> little

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:57.990 
um you can see there's a cool little

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.350 
um you can see there's a cool little
turbine<00:00:58.380> engine<00:00:58.800> which<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.400> really<00:00:59.730> cool<00:01:00.120> i

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
turbine engine which is really cool i

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.960 
turbine engine which is really cool i
like<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> little<00:01:00.780> animation<00:01:01.320> on<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.970> the

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
like the little animation on that the

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.530 
like the little animation on that the
problem<00:01:03.450> being<00:01:03.830> the<00:01:04.830> cool<00:01:05.700> turbine<00:01:06.180> engine

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
problem being the cool turbine engine

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.360 
problem being the cool turbine engine
right<00:01:06.630> here<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.200> doesn't<00:01:07.680> blow<00:01:07.890> out<00:01:08.100> enough

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
right here it doesn't blow out enough

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.230 
right here it doesn't blow out enough
air<00:01:09.620> the<00:01:10.620> app<00:01:10.860> claims<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.550> be<00:01:11.580> able<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.120> blow

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
air the app claims to be able to blow

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.790 
air the app claims to be able to blow
out<00:01:12.450> candles<00:01:12.870> on<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> birthday<00:01:13.050> cake<00:01:13.380> that

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.840 
out candles on a birthday cake that
seems<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.220> be<00:01:14.310> there<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.460> little<00:01:14.610> saying

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
seems to be there a little saying

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.790 
seems to be there a little saying
there's<00:01:15.120> a<00:01:15.180> video<00:01:15.360> up<00:01:15.570> about<00:01:15.870> it<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.650> can

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
there's a video up about it and you can

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.530 
there's a video up about it and you can
see<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:16.980> on<00:01:17.280> our<00:01:17.310> way<00:01:17.550> on<00:01:17.790> our<00:01:17.970> site<00:01:18.210> we've

see that on our way on our site we've

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.660 
see that on our way on our site we've
linked<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:20.150> but<00:01:21.150> there<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.260> no<00:01:22.740> literally

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
linked to it but there is no literally

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.350 
linked to it but there is no literally
no<00:01:24.120> air<00:01:25.080> coming<00:01:25.380> out<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.620> there<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.360> well

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
no air coming out of there and well

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.230 
no air coming out of there and well
there's<00:01:28.170> not<00:01:28.350> no<00:01:28.650> air<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.250> minimal<00:01:29.790> air<00:01:30.000> and

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
there's not no air it's minimal air and

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.400 
there's not no air it's minimal air and
it's<00:01:30.510> not<00:01:30.690> enough<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.050> blow<00:01:31.170> out<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> candle

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
it's not enough to blow out a candle

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.410 
it's not enough to blow out a candle
without<00:01:31.860> melting<00:01:32.190> your<00:01:32.460> phone<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:34.979> i<00:01:35.420> wouldn't

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
without melting your phone so i wouldn't

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.210 
without melting your phone so i wouldn't
recommend<00:01:36.510> it<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.050> think<00:01:37.320> it's<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.560> waste<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.860> 99

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
recommend it I think it's a waste of 99

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.390 
recommend it I think it's a waste of 99
cents<00:01:38.610> but<00:01:39.330> if<00:01:40.050> you<00:01:40.229> want<00:01:40.440> you<00:01:41.100> make<00:01:41.280> the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
cents but if you want you make the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.120 
cents but if you want you make the
choice<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.510> reasons<00:01:42.900> being<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.440> wouldn't<00:01:43.950> buy

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
choice the reasons being I wouldn't buy

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.660 
choice the reasons being I wouldn't buy
it<00:01:44.160> is<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.600> there's<00:01:45.600> no<00:01:46.010> the<00:01:47.010> toggle<00:01:47.340> on<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.520> off

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
it is a there's no the toggle on and off

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.570 
it is a there's no the toggle on and off
switch<00:01:47.850> doesn't<00:01:48.510> really<00:01:48.780> matter<00:01:49.340> because<00:01:50.340> the

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
switch doesn't really matter because the

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.040 
switch doesn't really matter because the
minute<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.850> start<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.150> app<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.420> can't<00:01:51.630> you

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
minute you start the app you can't you

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.070 
minute you start the app you can't you
know<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.200> have<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.590> turn<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.860> off<00:01:52.950> right<00:01:53.130> away

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
know you have to turn it off right away

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.120 
know you have to turn it off right away
there's<00:01:55.080> not<00:01:55.229> enough<00:01:55.290> air<00:01:55.650> coming<00:01:55.920> out<00:01:56.070> of
