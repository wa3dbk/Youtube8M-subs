00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
received a loss for it so doing this

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.799 
received a loss for it so doing this
basically<00:00:58.980> just<00:00:59.280> avoids<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.910> but<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.480> still

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809

basically just avoids that but you still
get<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.020> message<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.739> as<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.980> can<00:01:02.100> see<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.520> load

before in my recent record I had lost
the<00:01:12.479> game<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.900> that's<00:01:13.049> where<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.350> didn't<00:01:13.680> work

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
the game and that's where it didn't work

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.130 
the game and that's where it didn't work
unfortunately<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:15.000> after<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.750> game<00:01:15.990> i

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
unfortunately but after that game i

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.450 
unfortunately but after that game i
probably<00:01:16.229> lost<00:01:16.500> about<00:01:16.650> three<00:01:17.070> more<00:01:17.250> games

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460
