00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.609 
on the front and this is used to knock
all<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.730> these<00:00:26.880> pages<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.720> spine<00:00:28.019> we<00:00:28.439> want

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
all of these pages to the spine we want

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:38.660 
all of these pages to the spine we want
to<00:00:28.680> knock<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.220> side<00:00:29.660> and<00:00:30.920> to<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:31.949> head

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.580 

and<00:00:39.180> I'm<00:00:39.390> going<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.600> lay<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.930> carefully<00:00:40.410> down

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
and I'm going to lay this carefully down

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.940 
and I'm going to lay this carefully down
here<00:00:40.920> for<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> moment<00:00:41.450> I've<00:00:42.450> got<00:00:42.780> some<00:00:43.590> lining

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
here for a moment I've got some lining

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.210 
here for a moment I've got some lining
paper<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:45.230> this<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.290> the<00:00:46.559> mole<00:00:46.770> I'm<00:00:47.010> going<00:00:47.160> to

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
paper and this is the mole I'm going to

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.650 
paper and this is the mole I'm going to
cut<00:00:47.400> them<00:00:47.579> all<00:00:47.760> because<00:00:48.150> I'm<00:00:48.300> going<00:00:48.449> to<00:00:48.510> do

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
cut them all because I'm going to do

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.590 
cut them all because I'm going to do
this<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.050> two<00:00:49.230> stages<00:00:49.850> and<00:00:50.850> I'm<00:00:51.210> going<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.449> cut

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
this in two stages and I'm going to cut

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.600 
this in two stages and I'm going to cut
one<00:00:51.629> piece<00:00:51.960> slightly<00:00:52.470> shorter<00:00:52.949> than<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
one piece slightly shorter than the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.729 
one piece slightly shorter than the
length<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.970> the<00:00:54.090> spine<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.620> little

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
length of the spine and just a little

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:08.200 
length of the spine and just a little
bit<00:00:55.980> wider

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.010 

knock<00:01:09.050> this<00:01:09.200> up<00:01:09.380> again<00:01:09.710> and<00:01:10.600> we'll<00:01:11.600> take<00:01:11.810> this

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
knock this up again and we'll take this

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:20.470 
knock this up again and we'll take this
to<00:01:12.350> a<00:01:12.380> nipping<00:01:12.950> press

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.380 

and<00:01:20.570> we'll<00:01:21.470> put<00:01:21.770> it<00:01:21.890> into<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.490> knitting<00:01:23.120> press

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
and we'll put it into the knitting press

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.350 
and we'll put it into the knitting press
I<00:01:23.980> want<00:01:24.980> to<00:01:25.070> set<00:01:25.250> it<00:01:25.370> into<00:01:25.580> the<00:01:25.670> press<00:01:25.940> so<00:01:26.180> that

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
I want to set it into the press so that

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.450 
I want to set it into the press so that
it<00:01:26.480> has<00:01:26.750> about<00:01:27.020> maybe<00:01:27.380> if<00:01:27.680> a<00:01:27.920> half<00:01:28.190> or<00:01:28.430> a

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
it has about maybe if a half or a

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.050 
it has about maybe if a half or a
quarter<00:01:28.700> inch<00:01:29.000> out<00:01:30.460> underneath<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.640> plate

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
quarter inch out underneath the plate

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:44.440 
quarter inch out underneath the plate
and<00:01:32.530> tightens<00:01:33.530> down<00:01:33.830> very<00:01:34.250> tight<00:01:43.330> now<00:01:44.330> I'll

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
and tightens down very tight now I'll

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.880 
and tightens down very tight now I'll
take<00:01:44.660> a<00:01:44.690> pair<00:01:44.990> of<00:01:45.020> dividers<00:01:45.200> I'm<00:01:45.620> going<00:01:45.830> to

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
take a pair of dividers I'm going to

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.860 
take a pair of dividers I'm going to
mark<00:01:46.100> this<00:01:46.250> off<00:01:46.460> because<00:01:46.790> I'm<00:01:47.090> going<00:01:47.300> to<00:01:47.390> saw

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
mark this off because I'm going to saw

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.310 
mark this off because I'm going to saw
in<00:01:48.080> some<00:01:48.350> cords<00:01:48.800> on<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.190> spine<00:01:49.930> so<00:01:50.930> I'm<00:01:51.170> just

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
in some cords on the spine so I'm just

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.430 
in some cords on the spine so I'm just
going<00:01:51.440> to<00:01:51.500> test<00:01:52.400> this<00:01:52.610> here<00:01:52.910> two<00:01:53.240> three<00:01:53.780> four

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
going to test this here two three four

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.330 
going to test this here two three four
five<00:01:55.250> six<00:01:56.210> that<00:01:56.840> should<00:01:57.050> probably<00:01:57.260> do<00:01:57.620> it<00:01:57.770> you

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
five six that should probably do it you

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.980 
five six that should probably do it you
can<00:01:58.490> have<00:01:58.640> like<00:01:58.820> four<00:01:59.120> or<00:01:59.360> six<00:01:59.600> chords

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
can have like four or six chords

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.160 
can have like four or six chords
depending<00:02:00.500> on<00:02:00.620> the<00:02:00.830> length<00:02:01.310> of<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.930> of<00:02:02.930> the

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
depending on the length of the of the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:11.470 
depending on the length of the of the
spine<00:02:03.470> so<00:02:08.020> I'm<00:02:09.020> going<00:02:09.740> to<00:02:09.920> just<00:02:10.130> mark<00:02:10.910> these<00:02:11.180> so

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
spine so I'm going to just mark these so

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.850 
spine so I'm going to just mark these so
that<00:02:11.510> they<00:02:11.810> have<00:02:12.020> like<00:02:12.200> an<00:02:12.320> even<00:02:12.680> thing

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
that they have like an even thing

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.320 
that they have like an even thing
because<00:02:13.130> if<00:02:13.280> they<00:02:13.400> should<00:02:13.460> show<00:02:13.910> up<00:02:14.090> in<00:02:14.240> the

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
because if they should show up in the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.730 
because if they should show up in the
inside<00:02:14.630> of<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.810> book<00:02:14.960> you'd<00:02:15.140> like<00:02:15.320> it<00:02:15.470> to<00:02:15.590> look

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
inside of the book you'd like it to look

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:28.420 
inside of the book you'd like it to look
regular<00:02:21.700> okay<00:02:26.230> now<00:02:27.230> I'll<00:02:27.380> take<00:02:27.410> a<00:02:27.590> hacksaw<00:02:27.920> and

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
regular okay now I'll take a hacksaw and

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.600 
regular okay now I'll take a hacksaw and
I'm<00:02:29.270> going<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.480> hold<00:02:29.630> this<00:02:29.810> vertically<00:02:30.350> and

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
I'm going to hold this vertically and

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.060 
I'm going to hold this vertically and
saw<00:02:31.610> in<00:02:31.880> a<00:02:32.090> groove<00:02:32.480> just<00:02:32.930> about<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.530> depth<00:02:33.890> of

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
saw in a groove just about the depth of

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.390 
saw in a groove just about the depth of
my<00:02:34.250> fingernail<00:02:34.760> maybe<00:02:35.000> of<00:02:35.240> a<00:02:35.450> millimeter<00:02:35.930> or

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
my fingernail maybe of a millimeter or

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:50.530 
my fingernail maybe of a millimeter or
sixteenth<00:02:37.400> of<00:02:37.520> an<00:02:37.640> inch<00:02:37.730> or<00:02:37.940> so<00:02:49.180> pull<00:02:50.180> this<00:02:50.300> up

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
sixteenth of an inch or so pull this up

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.060 
sixteenth of an inch or so pull this up
just<00:02:50.570> a<00:02:50.930> little<00:02:50.959> bit<00:02:51.350> here<00:02:51.620> so<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:51.860> have<00:02:52.010> some

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
just a little bit here so I have some

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:58.449 
just a little bit here so I have some
air

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.360 

and<00:02:58.900> I<00:02:59.900> test<00:03:00.200> it<00:03:00.319> with<00:03:00.439> my<00:03:00.560> fingernail<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.159> see

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
and I test it with my fingernail to see

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:52.149 
and I test it with my fingernail to see
how<00:03:01.489> deep<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:01.879> is<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:50.680> there<00:03:51.680> we<00:03:51.799> go

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 
how deep it is and there we go

the<00:04:00.560> back<00:04:00.889> and<00:04:01.219> try<00:04:01.579> to<00:04:01.609> raise<00:04:01.909> up<00:04:02.120> kind<00:04:02.449> of<00:04:02.599> a

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
the back and try to raise up kind of a

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.309 
the back and try to raise up kind of a
little<00:04:02.870> fringe<00:04:03.310> so<00:04:04.310> that<00:04:04.519> there<00:04:04.669> will<00:04:04.729> be<00:04:04.790> more

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
little fringe so that there will be more

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.500 
little fringe so that there will be more
rough<00:04:06.319> paper<00:04:06.590> for<00:04:06.979> the<00:04:07.069> glue<00:04:07.280> to<00:04:07.519> grab<00:04:08.150> on<00:04:08.359> to

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
rough paper for the glue to grab on to

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.479 
rough paper for the glue to grab on to
so<00:04:09.470> I'm<00:04:09.560> going<00:04:09.680> to<00:04:09.739> do<00:04:09.829> this<00:04:09.979> first<00:04:10.250> in<00:04:10.400> a

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
so I'm going to do this first in a

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.569 
so I'm going to do this first in a
diagonal<00:04:10.849> way<00:04:11.120> like<00:04:11.329> this<00:04:11.949> going<00:04:12.949> across<00:04:13.280> the

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
diagonal way like this going across the

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:32.710 
diagonal way like this going across the
whole<00:04:13.760> spine

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.990 

and<00:04:33.720> then<00:04:34.590> I<00:04:34.620> will<00:04:34.830> take<00:04:35.009> it<00:04:35.190> back<00:04:35.220> going<00:04:35.759> back

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
and then I will take it back going back

00:04:36.000 --> 00:05:12.630 
and then I will take it back going back
in<00:04:36.210> it<00:04:36.330> in<00:04:36.449> a<00:04:36.479> cross<00:04:36.780> way

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.010 

and<00:05:14.140> now<00:05:15.140> we're<00:05:15.290> ready<00:05:15.410> to<00:05:15.560> glue<00:05:15.860> up<00:05:16.150> so<00:05:17.150> what

like this this reinforces and gives
extra<00:05:59.510> strength<00:05:59.840> to<00:06:00.170> the<00:06:00.380> spine<00:06:01.220> and<00:06:01.550> if<00:06:02.450> the

strength<00:07:31.219> to<00:07:31.549> the<00:07:31.699> spy<00:07:35.289> but<00:07:36.289> before<00:07:36.619> I<00:07:36.649> do<00:07:36.769> that

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:36.889 
strength to the spy but before I do that

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:50.519 
strength to the spy but before I do that
touch<00:07:37.549> up<00:07:37.699> a<00:07:37.789> little<00:07:37.819> more<00:07:38.149> glue<00:07:40.419> or<00:07:41.419> PVA<00:07:41.959> and
