00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:06.230 
coming up to the hill again where we saw

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.080 
coming up to the hill again where we saw
not<00:00:07.230> too<00:00:07.379> long<00:00:07.529> ago<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:09.590> cop<00:00:10.590> running<00:00:11.130> constant

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
not too long ago a cop running constant

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.009 
not too long ago a cop running constant
on<00:00:12.269> ka-band

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:15.019 
on ka-band

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:16.990 
on ka-band
and<00:00:15.110> we're<00:00:15.800> going<00:00:15.920> to<00:00:15.980> run<00:00:16.730> up<00:00:16.820> this<00:00:16.940> hill

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
and we're going to run up this hill

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.900 
and we're going to run up this hill
again<00:00:17.510> and<00:00:17.810> see<00:00:18.470> how<00:00:18.590> both<00:00:18.800> the<00:00:19.100> passport<00:00:19.700> max

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
again and see how both the passport max

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.380 
again and see how both the passport max
and<00:00:20.119> d1<00:00:20.300> compare<00:00:21.050> on<00:00:21.200> this<00:00:21.410> I<00:00:22.029> know<00:00:23.029> this<00:00:23.240> is<00:00:23.360> a

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
and d1 compare on this I know this is a

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.990 
and d1 compare on this I know this is a
lot<00:00:23.689> of

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
lot of

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.310 
lot of
testing<00:00:25.810> for<00:00:26.400> constant<00:00:27.400> on<00:00:27.520> ka<00:00:28.230> against<00:00:29.230> the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
testing for constant on ka against the

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.620 
testing for constant on ka against the
two<00:00:29.530> but<00:00:29.830> I<00:00:30.070> think<00:00:30.730> people<00:00:30.850> were<00:00:31.150> really<00:00:31.390> kind

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
two but I think people were really kind

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.670 
two but I think people were really kind
of<00:00:31.750> asking<00:00:32.080> for<00:00:32.140> some

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
of asking for some

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.610 
of asking for some
comparison<00:00:34.489> side-by-side<00:00:35.050> comparisons

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.800 

so<00:00:39.130> rather<00:00:39.400> than<00:00:39.610> saying<00:00:39.880> this<00:00:40.030> is<00:00:40.210> where<00:00:40.390> the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:40.810 
so rather than saying this is where the

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.320 
so rather than saying this is where the
v1<00:00:41.140> has<00:00:41.380> been<00:00:42.310> picking<00:00:42.580> it<00:00:42.670> up<00:00:42.730> and<00:00:42.970> this<00:00:43.270> is

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
v1 has been picking it up and this is

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.450 
v1 has been picking it up and this is
where<00:00:43.540> the<00:00:43.660> passport<00:00:44.080> met<00:00:44.260> max<00:00:44.800> is<00:00:44.980> picking<00:00:45.310> up

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
where the passport met max is picking up

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.010 
where the passport met max is picking up
I'm<00:00:46.030> just<00:00:46.090> going<00:00:46.270> to<00:00:46.360> run<00:00:46.480> them<00:00:46.570> side<00:00:46.840> by<00:00:46.870> side

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
I'm just going to run them side by side

00:00:47.020 --> 00:01:23.890 
I'm just going to run them side by side
again<00:00:47.739> and<00:00:47.950> see<00:00:48.309> how<00:00:48.820> they<00:00:49.000> do

and see see where just where this guy is

00:01:31.730 --> 00:02:09.190 
and see see where just where this guy is
and<00:01:32.660> now<00:01:33.140> they<00:01:33.260> perform

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.410 

the<00:02:09.679> ones<00:02:09.890> getting<00:02:10.069> cave<00:02:10.490> and<00:02:10.910> that's<00:02:11.180> not

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
the ones getting cave and that's not

the ones getting cave and that's not
what<00:02:11.599> we're<00:02:11.720> looking<00:02:11.750> for<00:02:12.110> right<00:02:12.260> now

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
what we're looking for right now

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.210 
what we're looking for right now
passport<00:02:15.290> max<00:02:15.500> was<00:02:15.650> getting<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:15.950> as<00:02:16.040> well

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
passport max was getting it as well

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.699 
passport max was getting it as well
again<00:02:16.930> we've<00:02:17.930> been<00:02:17.959> up<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.230> down<00:02:18.319> this<00:02:18.530> road

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
again we've been up and down this road

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:27.370 
again we've been up and down this road
so<00:02:18.950> many<00:02:19.040> times<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:19.610> is<00:02:20.470> locked<00:02:21.470> out

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.110 

so<00:02:27.920> nothing<00:02:28.280> as<00:02:28.400> we<00:02:28.520> came<00:02:28.670> up<00:02:28.790> over<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.030> hill

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
so nothing as we came up over the hill

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.740 
so nothing as we came up over the hill
in<00:02:29.360> terms<00:02:29.420> of<00:02:29.720> this<00:02:29.840> cop<00:02:31.000> take<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.090> left<00:02:32.480> at<00:02:32.630> the

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
in terms of this cop take a left at the

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.520 
in terms of this cop take a left at the
University<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.380> see<00:02:33.590> if<00:02:33.650> he's<00:02:33.770> still<00:02:33.890> there

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
University and see if he's still there

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.730 
University and see if he's still there
it's<00:02:36.530> in<00:02:36.620> like<00:02:36.740> 525<00:02:37.400> right<00:02:37.640> now<00:02:37.820> it's<00:02:38.450> kind<00:02:38.660> of

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
it's in like 525 right now it's kind of

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.260 
it's in like 525 right now it's kind of
primetime<00:02:39.740> to<00:02:40.040> be<00:02:40.160> sitting<00:02:40.460> out<00:02:40.610> as<00:02:40.850> everybody

primetime to be sitting out as everybody

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.760 
primetime to be sitting out as everybody
leaves<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.630> University<00:02:42.170> so<00:02:42.410> I<00:02:42.440> would<00:02:42.650> be

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
leaves the University so I would be

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.860 
leaves the University so I would be
surprised<00:02:43.220> if<00:02:43.370> he's<00:02:43.520> not<00:02:43.670> still<00:02:43.970> there<00:02:44.120> here

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
surprised if he's not still there here

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.940 
surprised if he's not still there here
we<00:02:44.960> go

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.610 

passport<00:02:51.950> max<00:02:52.160> picked<00:02:52.550> it<00:02:52.760> up<00:02:53.170> about<00:02:54.170> a<00:02:54.230> second

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
passport max picked it up about a second

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.080 
passport max picked it up about a second
earlier<00:02:54.920> their<00:02:57.370> high<00:02:58.370> estimates<00:02:58.820> might<00:02:58.970> be

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
earlier their high estimates might be

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.160 
earlier their high estimates might be
off<00:02:59.210> and<00:02:59.420> I<00:02:59.510> will<00:02:59.690> sure<00:03:01.780> go<00:03:02.780> it<00:03:02.840> up<00:03:02.930> over<00:03:03.050> the

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
off and I will sure go it up over the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.800 
off and I will sure go it up over the
hill<00:03:03.320> and<00:03:04.160> I'm<00:03:05.060> gonna<00:03:05.180> put<00:03:05.300> this<00:03:05.390> down<00:03:05.570> real

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
hill and I'm gonna put this down real

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.940

see<00:03:32.010> what<00:03:32.130> this<00:03:32.220> is<00:03:32.310> about

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:49.620 

much<00:03:35.530> right<00:03:36.720> certainly<00:03:37.720> wasn't<00:03:37.900> speeding<00:03:38.200> so

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.960 

ease<00:03:50.410> off<00:03:50.650> both<00:03:51.340> of<00:03:51.460> them<00:03:51.550> are<00:03:51.610> still<00:03:51.760> picking

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
ease off both of them are still picking

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.220 
ease off both of them are still picking

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
interestingly passport max was a little

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.880 
interestingly passport max was a little
longer<00:04:00.430> on<00:04:00.580> that<00:04:00.700> from<00:04:01.330> the<00:04:01.360> rear
