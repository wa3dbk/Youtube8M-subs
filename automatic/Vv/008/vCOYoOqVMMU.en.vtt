00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
arkansas stone is still more fine than

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
even the fine india stone so when you're

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.750 
even the fine india stone so when you're
sharpening<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.410> knife<00:00:49.440> if<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.309> do<00:00:50.460> have<00:00:50.610> an

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
sharpening a knife if you do have an

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.330 
sharpening a knife if you do have an
india<00:00:51.059> stone<00:00:51.420> after<00:00:52.230> your<00:00:52.350> india<00:00:52.620> stone<00:00:52.859> you

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
india stone after your india stone you

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.119 
india stone after your india stone you
would<00:00:53.609> then<00:00:53.760> switch<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:55.079> your<00:00:55.559> arkansas

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
would then switch to your arkansas

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.760 
would then switch to your arkansas
stones<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.969> further<00:00:57.210> refine<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.840> edge<00:00:57.960> we

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
stones to further refine the edge we

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.189 
stones to further refine the edge we
often<00:00:59.070> get<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.250> question<00:00:59.690> which<00:01:00.690> stone<00:01:01.019> is

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
often get the question which stone is

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.770 
often get the question which stone is
more<00:01:01.410> fine<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.190> hard<00:01:02.430> translucent<00:01:03.210> or<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
more fine the hard translucent or the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.440 
more fine the hard translucent or the
hard<00:01:03.989> black<00:01:04.259> and<00:01:05.190> in<00:01:05.519> reality<00:01:05.820> they<00:01:06.420> are

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
hard black and in reality they are

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.139 
hard black and in reality they are
actually<00:01:07.080> both<00:01:07.259> very<00:01:07.860> similar<00:01:08.070> grits<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
actually both very similar grits the

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:10.880 
actually both very similar grits the
arkansas<00:01:09.570> stones<00:01:09.840> because<00:01:10.229> they<00:01:10.380> are<00:01:10.500> graded

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
arkansas stones because they are graded

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.700 
arkansas stones because they are graded
on<00:01:10.979> their<00:01:11.190> hardness<00:01:11.490> not<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.600> their<00:01:12.930> physical

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
on their hardness not on their physical

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.039 
on their hardness not on their physical
appearance<00:01:14.130> they<00:01:14.970> actually<00:01:15.509> are<00:01:15.600> very<00:01:15.780> very

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
appearance they actually are very very

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.969 
appearance they actually are very very
similar<00:01:16.290> in<00:01:16.439> grit<00:01:16.770> if<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.820> were<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.150> say<00:01:18.360> which

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
similar in grit if you were to say which

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.480 
similar in grit if you were to say which
average<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.159> graded<00:01:20.580> higher<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:21.600> black<00:01:21.900> is

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
average is graded higher that black is

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.490 
average is graded higher that black is
slightly<00:01:23.490> higher<00:01:24.000> but<00:01:24.299> because<00:01:25.259> they<00:01:25.409> are

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
slightly higher but because they are

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.710 
slightly higher but because they are
natural<00:01:25.950> stones<00:01:26.220> there<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.880> variation<00:01:27.509> so

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
natural stones there is variation so

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.690 
natural stones there is variation so
that<00:01:27.750> does<00:01:28.200> not<00:01:28.320> always<00:01:28.650> hold<00:01:28.860> true<00:01:28.950> in

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
that does not always hold true in

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.120 
that does not always hold true in
practice<00:01:30.360> when<00:01:31.020> i'm<00:01:31.140> using<00:01:31.170> either<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.890> these

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
practice when i'm using either of these

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.160 
practice when i'm using either of these
stones<00:01:32.460> they<00:01:32.909> are<00:01:33.060> both<00:01:33.210> very<00:01:33.450> fine<00:01:33.689> i<00:01:33.720> cannot

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
stones they are both very fine i cannot

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.649 
stones they are both very fine i cannot
tell<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> difference<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.070> knife<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.670> in

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
tell a difference on a knife so in

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.230 
tell a difference on a knife so in
practice<00:01:37.079> they<00:01:37.229> are<00:01:37.259> they<00:01:37.649> are<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.979> same<00:01:38.240> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
practice they are they are the same the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.880 
practice they are they are the same the
are<00:01:39.390> translucent<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:40.140> slightly<00:01:40.649> more

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
are translucent is slightly more

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.940 
are translucent is slightly more
expensive<00:01:40.950> because<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.299> more<00:01:42.930> more<00:01:43.680> rare

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
expensive because it is a more more rare

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.710 
expensive because it is a more more rare
rare<00:01:44.640> stone<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.240> quarry<00:01:46.220> so<00:01:47.299> the<00:01:48.299> hard<00:01:48.479> black

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
rare stone to quarry so the hard black

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.200 
rare stone to quarry so the hard black
is<00:01:48.960> may<00:01:49.500> be<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.649> better<00:01:49.860> value<00:01:50.100> but<00:01:50.460> there

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
is may be a better value but there

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.639 
is may be a better value but there
definitely<00:01:51.659> are<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.020> lot<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.200> people<00:01:52.409> out<00:01:52.619> there

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
definitely are a lot of people out there

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.190 
definitely are a lot of people out there
that<00:01:52.950> really<00:01:53.009> really<00:01:53.909> do<00:01:54.030> like<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.990> hard

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
that really really do like the the hard
