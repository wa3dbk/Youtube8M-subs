00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:02.810
 ship modeling competition 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.349
 Sport takes place in Sevastopol for three years 

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:07.089
 consecutive number of participants with each 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:09.069
 growing year 

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:11.749
 instead brakes on the sociological 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:12.659
 It was 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:14.929
 but god with attack on 2 square work together 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.060
 this year's competition 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.070
 55 athletes came out of 11 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.220
 cities of Russia and Ukraine 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.330
 they all compete on radio controlled 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.380
 race class models it is interesting 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.820
 it is very interesting 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.079
 win 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.890
 build models that hours on the stand 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.750
 but as if the result of movement 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.660
 labor activity 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.810
 of course we will set a particular July 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.510
 do with them 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.620
 there are very few young people in this sport 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.920
 Sevastopol president 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.590
 offices of the federation of shipbuilding 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.379
 sport sadly says 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.350
 that today it is more interesting for children to sit at 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.879
 computer and not create something 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.740
 do it yourself 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.030
 make this model 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.660
 it is much stronger 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.100
 such 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.600
 average daily weight gain 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.300
 st this all needs to be mastered 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.690
 average speed of each 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.110
 radio controlled model sixty 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.690
 kilometers an hour the fastest about this 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.690
 at speeds up to 80 kilometers 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.170
 From the side it seems that to manage such 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.120
 models are quite easy but 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.660
 athletes are recognized for 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.270
 to hone your skills 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.390
 so for 5 months 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.010
 the main problem of this sport 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.700
 lack of state 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.750
 financing 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.680
 circles of young technicians and being members 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.500
 which was interesting and honorable 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.810
 remained in the Soviet past in order 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.610
