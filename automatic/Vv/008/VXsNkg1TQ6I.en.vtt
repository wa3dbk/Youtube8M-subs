00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
because it is all right so like I said

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.200 
because it is all right so like I said
just<00:01:10.409> get<00:01:10.740> someone<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.070> spot<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.939> they're

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
just get someone to spot you and they're

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.520 
just get someone to spot you and they're
just<00:01:12.299> going<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.540> flip<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.869> over<00:01:12.900> when<00:01:13.380> you're

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
just going to flip you over when you're

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.020 
just going to flip you over when you're
having<00:01:13.740> trouble<00:01:14.009> doing<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.310> that's<00:01:14.820> another

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
having trouble doing it that's another

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.910 
having trouble doing it that's another
technique<00:01:15.450> though<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.470> got<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.680> have<00:01:16.770> both

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
technique though so you got to have both

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.539 
technique though so you got to have both
those<00:01:17.100> things<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.939> want<00:01:18.149> to<00:01:18.240> jump<00:01:18.479> up<00:01:18.770> ok<00:01:19.770> not

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
those things you want to jump up ok not

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.280 
those things you want to jump up ok not
back<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.240> don't<00:01:21.420> want<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.750> jump<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.140> look

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
back you don't want to jump and look

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.780 
back you don't want to jump and look
back<00:01:22.530> ok<00:01:22.920> because<00:01:23.100> then<00:01:23.490> you're<00:01:23.640> be

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
back ok because then you're be

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.090 
back ok because then you're be
eliminating<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> lot<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.049> your<00:01:25.140> air<00:01:25.320> you'll<00:01:26.009> be

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
eliminating a lot of your air you'll be

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.649 
eliminating a lot of your air you'll be
going<00:01:26.220> backwards<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.970> want<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.210> jump<00:01:27.360> up<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
going backwards you want to jump up and

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.539 
going backwards you want to jump up and
flip<00:01:27.869> around<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.229> land<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.860> relatively<00:01:29.430> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
flip around and land in relatively the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.340 
flip around and land in relatively the
same<00:01:29.670> spot<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.090> jumped<00:01:30.450> off<00:01:30.540> ok<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:33.350> another

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
same spot you jumped off ok and another

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.630 
same spot you jumped off ok and another
problem<00:01:34.710> they<00:01:34.770> have<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.219> they<00:01:35.520> don't

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
problem they have is they don't

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.550 
problem they have is they don't
coordinate<00:01:36.060> their<00:01:36.240> whole<00:01:36.390> body<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:37.110> backflip

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
coordinate their whole body the backflip

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.590 
coordinate their whole body the backflip
is<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.770> big<00:01:38.130> coordination<00:01:38.850> between<00:01:39.090> everything

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
is a big coordination between everything

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.499 
is a big coordination between everything
ok<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.530> jump<00:01:40.740> up<00:01:40.860> your<00:01:41.040> arms<00:01:41.399> get<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.729> up<00:01:41.880> you

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
ok you jump up your arms get you up you

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.719 
ok you jump up your arms get you up you
stall<00:01:42.869> your<00:01:43.259> legs<00:01:43.500> bring<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.890> around<00:01:44.009> you

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
stall your legs bring you around you

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.090 
stall your legs bring you around you
just<00:01:44.880> flip<00:01:45.329> around<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.899> land<00:01:46.110> ok<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.770> lot

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
just flip around and you land ok a lot

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.889 
just flip around and you land ok a lot
