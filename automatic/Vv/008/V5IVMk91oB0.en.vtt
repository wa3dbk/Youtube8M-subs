00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.840
 necrophos necrolite 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.970
 not the edge or as it is often called grandma 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.009
 is pretty good lane support 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.930
 with the basic attribute intellect i mean he 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.550
 is int or com ranged on 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.560
 the initial fishermen had a scant margin 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.200
 health is quite small muse and injury 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.920
 290 but there is a good increase 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.930
 to attributes 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.270
 to sits 2 with each level and rooted 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.040
 intelligence already two and a half from important 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.960
 advantages can be noted the usefulness of this 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.180
 character against hero with a large margin 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.800
 health and also a good new one 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.199
 can cure the whole team if she 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.480
 is near but of the main disadvantages 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.489
 it is his useless teamfight in this 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.320
 guide we will teach you to highlight strong 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.829
 the sides do not hull and make up for it 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.530
 flaws and so we start the first spell 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.690
 Necrophos is his main Nikhil dis pas 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.239
 les not shelter and create a wave around him 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.800
 death which deals damage to enemies 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.229
 heals allies on level one 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.630
 pumping have full 8 seconds is given and on 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.850
 the latter is only 5 mana expenses 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.850
 pretty much 125 considering that 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.270
 the beginning of the game ugly only 286 mana 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.490
 with the last level of pumping spend as much 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.320
 185 damage is magical that means if u 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.790
 the enemy is subject to protection from magic 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.060
 ability will not be on them 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.070
 affect the second spell of the necro 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.450
 it is a passivation that burns out the enemies of life in 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.100
 a radius of 1200 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.619
 percent of maximum 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.110
 health on the first level of pumping is 0 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.630
 6 percent of health and 4 were 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.619
 Ability and a half a good skill teaches 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.240
 you are not protected from him 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.310
 sadist is another passive of ours 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.799
 Bonus Forcing Hero 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.359
 accelerating the regeneration of health and mana 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.520
 for each killed creep 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:56.950
 and if we kill the hero then this bonus 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.509
 amplifies 10 times on the first level 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.700
 Regen Mana Abilities 2 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.609
 health + 1 and at the last level 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.479
 Mana regen is 10 a x p 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:06.429
 + 4 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:10.000
 persons passive ability at all 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:12.310
 6 seconds levels of the remote necrofos has 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.320
 magical damage and quite a hero 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.660
 stuns the enemy and then puts him 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.940
 damage and if the enemy has a full stock 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.040
 health is not damaged and what 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.680
 less enemy hp the harder for him 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.170
 bang spit our ulta improves with 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.090
 Aganim and here that grandma shows her 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.250
 force against tanks if pro 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.860
 say how much the enemy is missing 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.010
 health is so we and he will cause damage 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.379
 and even stronger but sang it costs as much as 500 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.930
 coins has a cooldown of 70 seconds 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.870
 another nice bun is that 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.390
 the enemy we have killed complains and cannot 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.250
 buy into the game 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.650
 skillbuild on the first level we recommend 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.780
 bleed without pause then our passive 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.569
 on the burning of health and forget about it 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.790
 up to level 12 we will do the third 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.220
 passive swing it on the fourth and 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.690
 finish on the tenth remember your 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.970
 the utility of your nukes 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.310
 so it should be zamate to the seventh 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.480
 level of but ultu take as it 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.879
 Arrivals at the beginning of the game we buy 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.670
 wards and unforgettable courier updates 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.769
 one tango and clarity in the middle of the game is 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.079
 closer to twenty five minutes we have to 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.180
 have lasso boots and gear so that we 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.489
 have become useful in team fights so-called 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.860
 killer well, it is desirable apanim scepter 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.660
 and by the end of the game you should be 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.430
 in addition to amanimu pipe 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.530
 if org has a lot of magic prokast 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.019
 either shiva to give more 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.920
 contribution to the timfayt but preferably you can 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.959
 award so he is not a crocus worth going 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.760
 on line along with how and utilities since 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.190
 we are line support and must help on 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.709
 the lines of this game necrophos went on 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.959
 peace with hardy is not the best carry but 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.420
 he had no other choice 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.519
 line would stand haapsalu as it should 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.680
 do a good support and put blood 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.510
 even before the game starts one ward no runes 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.419
 second ward left to order 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:05.109
 mider and here we will need tango and 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:07.030
 clarity to hold our line with 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.980
 such a hero like the world on like in this 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.250
 video was quite easy to pick up first 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.590
 blood 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.440
 one divine arrow and help deadpool 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.970
 himself and the king tavern itself thanks ward 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.579
 we can see the enemy miden 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.180
 which check rune here we have it as 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.400
 palms 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.860
 one more arrow it dies pools bye 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.480
 nonmoremore 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.350
 batch us the main thing is not to get lost in 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.300
 time to kill 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.100
 for actions of blade ult and not try 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.800
 lay at carry but unfortunately 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.199
 it will be rare for if not rabbits on 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.840
 ulta on sucker magnificent enemy then this kill 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:40.780
 there will be a grandmother even if everyone has songs 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.580
 all completely different heroes one more 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.710
 the rule is not to forget what is not blood 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.870
 together with his team is transformed and 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.790
 becomes irreplaceable for example here not 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.639
 the king did not lose his head and threw the ulta on 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.199
 yosef even being tax round but so 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:54.310
 as the range of application of ultimates Grandmother 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.040
 pretty big 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.889
 never again goes to the tavern in the game 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.800
 which now is 18 minutes, but a 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.060
 the king is not amanim and it's not scary 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.760
 Home to be for the team something more 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.860
 than cheese for one second here we went to 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.960
 poor is f and sent his bulls 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.820
 Well, then we went under the tower because 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.300
 mechanism and without pools give to the vein 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.460
 Regene 380 health units and this is very 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.510
 not bad with such a hero is not afraid to go 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.510
 even under the fountain 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.940
 and 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:32.719
 Well, here we are witnessing another murder 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:35.659
 their cary tanks already with aganim we see 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:37.430
 how much he is from him hp but how 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:39.379
 would be cool was not the Negro hero in dota 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.869
 important team interactions so 

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:42.919
 rest and bohemian arrow from peace 

00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:45.499
 transmits from f.u. 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:47.749
 heartfelt greetings and now you see already 

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:48.529
 late kneading here is not extremely 

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:52.869
 useless 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:52.869
 comments are unnecessary see for yourself 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.900
 in the afternoon 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.259
 Crocus is certainly no better than Tatars 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.690
 grandma had no choice since he was 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:11.979
 under minus armor slardar but timfayt 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.440
 as always decided everything 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:17.069
 and the timings you hill provided life 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.069
 our hero 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.370
 here was not the best blast but 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:26.680
 temporary arcane mechanism and pipe well 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.349
 a couple of ults provided us with salvation 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.930
 but just so we will not leave enemies and they 

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:33.940
 safely give the world anki doublerkil well 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.009

 felt the full force of our line 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:41.289
 support but our guide came to an end 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:44.139
 following our year you ensure yourself

 the game for them do not forget to fill 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.419
 minus and necrofos but not to forget him
