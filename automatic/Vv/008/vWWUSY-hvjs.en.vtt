00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.689 

in<00:00:22.000> the<00:00:22.330> part<00:00:22.689> 1<00:00:22.869> of<00:00:22.900> the<00:00:23.199> video<00:00:23.500> we<00:00:24.400> looked<00:00:24.609> at

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699 
in the part 1 of the video we looked at

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.600 
in the part 1 of the video we looked at
the<00:00:24.820> gearbox<00:00:25.300> we<00:00:26.199> realize<00:00:26.680> that<00:00:26.710> this<00:00:27.250> small

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.610 
the gearbox we realize that this small

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.540 
the gearbox we realize that this small
gear<00:00:28.029> have<00:00:28.330> been<00:00:28.480> stripped<00:00:28.840> off<00:00:29.220> okay<00:00:30.220> by<00:00:30.490> the

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
gear have been stripped off okay by the

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.750 
gear have been stripped off okay by the
motor<00:00:30.880> so<00:00:32.040> we're<00:00:33.040> getting<00:00:33.220> ready<00:00:33.370> to<00:00:33.460> put<00:00:33.640> it

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
motor so we're getting ready to put it

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.520 
motor so we're getting ready to put it
back<00:00:33.790> together<00:00:34.090> we've<00:00:34.510> cleaned<00:00:34.780> this<00:00:34.960> gearbox

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
back together we've cleaned this gearbox

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.920 
back together we've cleaned this gearbox
out<00:00:35.800> I<00:00:36.100> don't<00:00:36.760> put<00:00:36.910> a<00:00:36.940> lot<00:00:37.180> of<00:00:37.330> grease<00:00:37.540> on<00:00:37.900> that

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
out I don't put a lot of grease on that

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.829 
out I don't put a lot of grease on that
first<00:00:38.559> gear<00:00:38.890> it's<00:00:39.670> not<00:00:39.910> really<00:00:40.180> necessary

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:40.839 
first gear it's not really necessary

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:42.810 
first gear it's not really necessary
that's<00:00:41.739> kind<00:00:42.040> of<00:00:42.100> what<00:00:42.250> helps<00:00:42.519> make<00:00:42.670> them

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
that's kind of what helps make them

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.900 
that's kind of what helps make them
strip<00:00:43.180> I<00:00:43.360> think<00:00:44.010> okay<00:00:45.010> you<00:00:45.309> just<00:00:45.339> put<00:00:45.699> some<00:00:45.879> on

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
strip I think okay you just put some on

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.579 
strip I think okay you just put some on
there<00:00:46.269> and<00:00:46.420> I<00:00:46.510> breezed<00:00:46.780> him<00:00:46.989> up<00:00:47.140> here<00:00:47.320> time

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589 
there and I breezed him up here time

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:50.280 
there and I breezed him up here time
before<00:00:47.860> we<00:00:47.980> started<00:00:48.489> but<00:00:49.300> that's<00:00:49.660> the<00:00:49.839> idea

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
before we started but that's the idea

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.410 
before we started but that's the idea
and<00:00:50.500> there's<00:00:50.650> a<00:00:50.710> lot<00:00:50.920> of<00:00:50.949> times<00:00:51.300> there<00:00:52.300> will<00:00:52.360> be

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
and there's a lot of times there will be

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.570 
and there's a lot of times there will be
enough<00:00:52.720> grease<00:00:53.019> in<00:00:53.290> the<00:00:53.379> gearbox<00:00:53.619> to<00:00:54.129> get<00:00:54.430> it

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
enough grease in the gearbox to get it

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.539 
enough grease in the gearbox to get it
greased<00:00:54.879> again<00:00:55.650> once<00:00:56.650> you<00:00:56.769> get<00:00:56.949> it<00:00:57.070> cleaned<00:00:57.339> up

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:57.549 
greased again once you get it cleaned up

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:00.270 
greased again once you get it cleaned up
so<00:00:58.089> then<00:00:59.019> then<00:00:59.530> you<00:00:59.619> put<00:00:59.769> this<00:00:59.890> thing<00:01:00.100> back

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
so then then you put this thing back

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.390 
so then then you put this thing back
together<00:01:01.229> try<00:01:02.229> to<00:01:02.290> get<00:01:02.470> those<00:01:02.650> tabs<00:01:02.979> in<00:01:03.250> there

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
together try to get those tabs in there

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.690 
together try to get those tabs in there
if<00:01:03.489> you<00:01:03.580> can<00:01:04.439> they<00:01:05.439> help<00:01:05.710> hold<00:01:05.920> it<00:01:06.189> really<00:01:06.430> what

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
if you can they help hold it really what

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.250 
if you can they help hold it really what
holds<00:01:07.060> that<00:01:07.150> are<00:01:07.270> these<00:01:07.420> four<00:01:07.689> screws<00:01:07.990> that

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
holds that are these four screws that

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.520 
holds that are these four screws that
I'm<00:01:08.439> going<00:01:08.560> to<00:01:08.650> put<00:01:08.799> in<00:01:08.890> here<00:01:09.040> real<00:01:09.220> quick<00:01:09.490> and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.810 

yeah<00:01:14.530> it's<00:01:14.650> always<00:01:14.830> best<00:01:15.159> to<00:01:15.310> check<00:01:15.430> your

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
yeah it's always best to check your

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.950 
yeah it's always best to check your
gearbox<00:01:16.090> first

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
gearbox first

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.330 
gearbox first
I<00:01:17.110> mean<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:20.170> making<00:01:20.560> this<00:01:20.710> terrible<00:01:21.159> noise

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
I mean it's making this terrible noise

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.969 
I mean it's making this terrible noise
you<00:01:21.759> know<00:01:21.909> something's<00:01:22.360> broken<00:01:22.659> but<00:01:23.110> just<00:01:23.860> to

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
you know something's broken but just to

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.250 
you know something's broken but just to
go<00:01:24.130> buying<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:24.549> kitchen<00:01:25.090> gearbox<00:01:25.630> doesn't<00:01:26.140> make

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
go buying a kitchen gearbox doesn't make

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.250 
go buying a kitchen gearbox doesn't make
sense<00:01:26.620> when<00:01:26.950> when<00:01:27.820> for<00:01:28.210> very<00:01:28.960> little<00:01:29.140> money

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
sense when when for very little money

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.030 
sense when when for very little money
we're<00:01:30.010> going<00:01:30.130> to<00:01:30.250> put<00:01:30.400> this<00:01:31.500> put<00:01:32.500> this<00:01:32.560> small

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
we're going to put this put this small

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.560 
we're going to put this put this small
gear<00:01:33.400> in<00:01:33.580> here<00:01:33.910> we're<00:01:34.090> going<00:01:34.210> to<00:01:34.270> get<00:01:34.420> them

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
gear in here we're going to get them

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.450 
gear in here we're going to get them
fixed<00:01:34.780> up<00:01:35.050> just<00:01:35.320> as<00:01:35.500> good<00:01:35.680> as<00:01:35.830> new

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.940 

so<00:01:39.460> that's<00:01:39.700> that<00:01:40.080> I'm<00:01:41.080> gonna<00:01:41.320> get<00:01:41.500> this<00:01:41.650> grease

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
so that's that I'm gonna get this grease

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:50.120 
so that's that I'm gonna get this grease
out<00:01:42.190> of<00:01:42.250> the<00:01:42.310> way<00:01:46.320> put<00:01:47.320> our<00:01:47.470> motor<00:01:47.710> screws<00:01:48.490> in

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
out of the way put our motor screws in

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.460 
out of the way put our motor screws in
like<00:01:51.130> that<00:01:51.370> if<00:01:51.700> you<00:01:52.030> if<00:01:52.360> you<00:01:52.540> have<00:01:52.720> time<00:01:52.990> and

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
like that if you if you have time and

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.490 
like that if you if you have time and
have<00:01:54.340> it<00:01:54.580> it's<00:01:55.120> a<00:01:55.210> good<00:01:55.360> idea<00:01:55.420> to<00:01:55.750> put<00:01:56.020> some<00:01:56.050> a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
have it it's a good idea to put some a

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.280 
have it it's a good idea to put some a
little<00:01:57.190> bit<00:01:57.460> of<00:01:57.610> blue<00:01:57.820> loctite<00:01:58.120> on<00:01:58.659> that<00:01:58.900> it'll

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
little bit of blue loctite on that it'll

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.730 
little bit of blue loctite on that it'll
help<00:01:59.500> hold<00:01:59.800> that<00:01:59.890> motor<00:02:00.310> from<00:02:00.610> coming<00:02:01.030> loose

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
help hold that motor from coming loose

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.560 
help hold that motor from coming loose
now<00:02:02.740> we<00:02:02.800> use<00:02:03.280> two<00:02:03.520> screwed<00:02:03.820> two<00:02:04.180> holes<00:02:04.420> right

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
now we use two screwed two holes right

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.399 
now we use two screwed two holes right
here<00:02:05.850> we<00:02:06.850> put<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.120> motor<00:02:07.870> back<00:02:07.990> in<00:02:08.170> our

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:08.409 
here we put the motor back in our

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:11.430 
here we put the motor back in our
gearbox<00:02:09.539> kind<00:02:10.539> of<00:02:10.629> wig<00:02:10.840> look<00:02:11.080> because<00:02:11.230> it's

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
gearbox kind of wig look because it's

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.399 
gearbox kind of wig look because it's
got<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.739> intersect<00:02:12.250> with<00:02:12.430> that<00:02:12.610> first<00:02:12.879> gear

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:13.409 
got to intersect with that first gear

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:18.690 
got to intersect with that first gear
get<00:02:14.409> it<00:02:14.530> all<00:02:14.650> lined<00:02:14.950> up<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:17.230> hopefully<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:17.920> make

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
get it all lined up and hopefully I make

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.630 
get it all lined up and hopefully I make
contact<00:02:19.330> here<00:02:20.489> turn<00:02:21.489> into<00:02:21.760> that<00:02:21.940> way

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.110 

I've<00:02:26.640> got<00:02:26.849> this<00:02:27.060> preset<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.640> won't<00:02:29.640> over<00:02:29.880> tie

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
I've got this preset so I won't over tie

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:38.800 
I've got this preset so I won't over tie
them<00:02:35.989> goes<00:02:36.989> in<00:02:37.170> there<00:02:37.319> like<00:02:37.349> that

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
them goes in there like that

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.120 
them goes in there like that
you<00:02:39.810> can<00:02:39.989> always<00:02:40.110> check<00:02:40.440> them<00:02:40.620> with<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.739> regular

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
you can always check them with a regular

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.580 
you can always check them with a regular
screwdriver<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:42.000> make<00:02:42.900> sure<00:02:43.110> they're<00:02:43.319> tight

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
screwdriver to make sure they're tight

back on now they say these are one-time

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.250 
back on now they say these are one-time
use<00:03:43.260> but<00:03:44.070> if<00:03:44.220> you<00:03:44.370> want<00:03:44.579> to<00:03:44.730> try<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.480> salvage<00:03:45.900> it
