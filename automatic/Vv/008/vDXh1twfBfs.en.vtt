started<00:02:21.000> before<00:02:21.390> december<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.260> then<00:02:22.830> it<00:02:22.890> just

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
started before december and then it just

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.160 
started before december and then it just
drags<00:02:23.220> on<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:23.700> on<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.270> on<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:24.750> we<00:02:24.840> gotta<00:02:25.020> live

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
drags on and on and on and we gotta live

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.740

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
in rented accommodation for even longer

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.900 
in rented accommodation for even longer
I<00:02:28.110> just<00:02:28.920> wish<00:02:29.070> we<00:02:29.250> could<00:02:29.280> get<00:02:29.550> this<00:02:29.730> thing

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
I just wish we could get this thing

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:41.300 
I just wish we could get this thing
sorted<00:02:30.150> out<00:02:39.440> unfortunately<00:02:40.440> now<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:40.860> add<00:02:41.100> to

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
sorted out unfortunately now to add to

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.000 
sorted out unfortunately now to add to
everything<00:02:41.610> there's<00:02:42.480> now<00:02:42.720> lead<00:02:43.230> in<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.770> water

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
everything there's now lead in the water

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.490 
everything there's now lead in the water
supply<00:02:44.550> now<00:02:45.540> we<00:02:45.600> think<00:02:45.930> there's<00:02:46.050> some<00:02:46.230> sort<00:02:46.380> of

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
supply now we think there's some sort of

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.750 
supply now we think there's some sort of
water<00:02:46.709> pipe<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.190> runs<00:02:47.400> down<00:02:47.670> here<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:49.140> it

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
water pipe that runs down here and it

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.100 
water pipe that runs down here and it
has<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.790> lead<00:02:51.060> pipe<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:51.540> comes<00:02:51.630> from<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:51.989> to

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
has a lead pipe that comes from it to

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.960 
has a lead pipe that comes from it to
the<00:02:52.200> house<00:02:52.380> but<00:02:53.250> unfortunate<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:53.760> means

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
the house but unfortunate that means

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.750 
the house but unfortunate that means
that<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.180> water<00:02:54.420> supply<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.840> contaminated<00:02:55.760> so

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
that the water supply is contaminated so

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.680 
that the water supply is contaminated so
I<00:02:57.800> just<00:02:58.800> went<00:02:59.550> in<00:02:59.760> bought<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.150> property<00:03:00.330> yet

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
I just went in bought the property yet

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.479 
I just went in bought the property yet
and<00:03:00.870> I'm<00:03:00.959> now<00:03:01.110> digging<00:03:01.440> holes<00:03:01.770> in<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.040> trying

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
and I'm now digging holes in it trying

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.030 
and I'm now digging holes in it trying
to<00:03:02.670> find<00:03:02.880> out<00:03:03.060> where<00:03:03.420> this<00:03:03.600> big<00:03:03.930> old<00:03:04.200> cast-iron

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
to find out where this big old cast-iron

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.240 
to find out where this big old cast-iron
water<00:03:05.400> pipe<00:03:05.670> is<00:03:05.910> so<00:03:06.600> I<00:03:06.630> can<00:03:06.870> see<00:03:07.110> how<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.620> joins

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
water pipe is so I can see how it joins

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.620 
water pipe is so I can see how it joins
on<00:03:08.520> and<00:03:08.760> see<00:03:08.850> whether<00:03:08.970> I<00:03:09.030> didn't<00:03:09.180> get<00:03:09.270> a<00:03:09.300> quote

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
on and see whether I didn't get a quote

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.940 
on and see whether I didn't get a quote
to<00:03:09.840> get<00:03:09.989> this<00:03:10.140> sorted<00:03:10.610> so<00:03:11.610> I<00:03:12.440> just<00:03:13.440> wish<00:03:13.799> we

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
to get this sorted so I just wish we

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.080 
to get this sorted so I just wish we
could<00:03:13.980> get<00:03:14.220> on<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.610> build<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.910> house<00:03:15.090> the

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.110 

inside<00:03:21.090> has<00:03:21.690> long<00:03:21.959> since<00:03:22.170> seen<00:03:22.500> better<00:03:22.739> days

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
inside has long since seen better days

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.759 
inside has long since seen better days
so<00:03:24.380> it<00:03:25.380> sort<00:03:25.709> of<00:03:25.799> damp<00:03:26.720> and<00:03:27.720> not<00:03:28.410> really<00:03:28.590> been

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
so it sort of damp and not really been
