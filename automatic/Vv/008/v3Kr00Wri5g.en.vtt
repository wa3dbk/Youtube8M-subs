destroy the nest of Phoenix eggs and it

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.570 
destroy the nest of Phoenix eggs and it
is<00:04:53.070> here<00:04:53.670> I<00:04:53.820> feel<00:04:54.630> that<00:04:55.200> the<00:04:55.350> answer<00:04:55.890> is<00:04:55.920> truly

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
is here I feel that the answer is truly

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.020 
is here I feel that the answer is truly
transparent<00:04:57.200> spike<00:04:58.200> is<00:04:58.470> neither<00:04:59.130> the<00:04:59.580> product

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
transparent spike is neither the product

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.120 
transparent spike is neither the product
of<00:05:00.210> just<00:05:00.570> his<00:05:00.810> nature<00:05:01.140> or<00:05:01.530> just<00:05:01.920> his

of just his nature or just his

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.910 
of just his nature or just his
upbringing<00:05:02.400> he<00:05:03.180> is<00:05:03.330> a<00:05:03.510> hodgepodge<00:05:03.930> of<00:05:04.230> both

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
upbringing he is a hodgepodge of both

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.450 
upbringing he is a hodgepodge of both
mixed<00:05:05.460> together<00:05:05.730> into<00:05:06.240> a<00:05:06.270> stew<00:05:06.630> of<00:05:06.810> genetics

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.520 
experiences encounters and biology and
maybe<00:05:11.010> the<00:05:11.370> same<00:05:11.730> is<00:05:12.000> true<00:05:12.300> for<00:05:12.690> every<00:05:13.170> single

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
maybe the same is true for every single
