00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.540
 do a spoon 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.190
 when you come to knead it will be first 

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:45.330
 once a bit sticky 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.730
 but not desperate but 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.470
 just keep on kneading these not 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.340
 more sticks and the one more supple 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.340
 dough will receive 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.940

 let the dough go for 30 minutes 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.860
 to roll out you should a lot of flour 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.000
 on the work surface scatter around one 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.000
 to avoid sticking 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.180
 also the dough again and again with something 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.180
 dust the flour 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.409

 I am with ham 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.939
 then rolled the dough one we 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.210
 now divide the role into 16 equal sized ones 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.210
 pieces 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:56.670
