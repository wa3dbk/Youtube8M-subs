welcome to my youtube video on Kodak
Kodachrome<00:00:08.550> 40<00:00:09.059> sound<00:00:09.929> movie<00:00:10.410> film<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:10.980> this

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
Kodachrome 40 sound movie film and this

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.200 
Kodachrome 40 sound movie film and this
happens<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.940> be<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:13.040> 200-foot<00:00:14.150> super<00:00:15.150> a

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
happens to be the 200-foot super a

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.109 
happens to be the 200-foot super a
cartridge<00:00:15.630> size<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.789> one<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:17.970> big

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
cartridge size and one of the big

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.050 
cartridge size and one of the big
advantages<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.810> shooting<00:00:19.640> 200-foot<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.820> that

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
advantages of shooting 200-foot is that

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.400 
advantages of shooting 200-foot is that
you<00:00:21.180> can<00:00:21.680> take<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.740> lot<00:00:23.010> longer<00:00:23.960> scene<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.320> if

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
you can take a lot longer scene so if

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.439 
you can take a lot longer scene so if
you're<00:00:25.529> shooting<00:00:25.710> say<00:00:26.150> performance<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.300> can

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
you're shooting say performance you can

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.780 
you're shooting say performance you can
shoot<00:00:27.779> for<00:00:29.689> for<00:00:30.689> well<00:00:31.080> over<00:00:31.380> three<00:00:31.769> minutes<00:00:32.070> as

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
shoot for for well over three minutes as

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.850 
shoot for for well over three minutes as
opposed<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.270> using<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.840> silent<00:00:34.230> cartridge<00:00:34.620> or

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
opposed to using a silent cartridge or

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.729 
opposed to using a silent cartridge or
or<00:00:35.700> sound<00:00:36.030> cartridge<00:00:36.450> which<00:00:37.170> they<00:00:37.350> don't<00:00:37.530> make

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
or sound cartridge which they don't make

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.260 
or sound cartridge which they don't make
anymore<00:00:38.180> and<00:00:39.180> it's<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.079> lot<00:00:40.290> cheaper<00:00:40.320> to

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
anymore and it's a lot cheaper to

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.389 
anymore and it's a lot cheaper to
process<00:00:42.350> for<00:00:43.350> two<00:00:43.530> hundred<00:00:43.680> foot<00:00:43.950> than<00:00:44.190> as

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
process for two hundred foot than as

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.910 
process for two hundred foot than as
opposed<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.789> getting<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:45.629> smaller<00:00:46.289> 50<00:00:46.739> foot

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
opposed to getting for smaller 50 foot

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.459 
opposed to getting for smaller 50 foot
cartridges<00:00:47.460> process<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:49.020> cheaper<00:00:49.440> and

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
cartridges process so it's cheaper and

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.220 
cartridges process so it's cheaper and
the<00:00:49.800> other<00:00:50.219> advantage<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.050> since<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
the other advantage is that since the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.830 
the other advantage is that since the
film<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.730> sound<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.090> getting<00:00:54.239> recorded<00:00:54.420> on

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
film is the sound is getting recorded on

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.340 
film is the sound is getting recorded on
the<00:00:55.050> film<00:00:55.260> itself<00:00:55.410> it's<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.899> it's<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.989> lot<00:00:58.079> easier

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
the film itself it's a it's a lot easier

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.639 
the film itself it's a it's a lot easier
to<00:00:58.670> record<00:00:59.670> sound<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.329> sync<00:01:00.870> with<00:01:01.050> people's

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
to record sound in sync with people's

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.340 
to record sound in sync with people's
voices<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.879> way<00:01:03.090> also<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:04.080> don't<00:01:04.170> have

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
voices and that way also you don't have

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.859 
voices and that way also you don't have
to<00:01:04.470> buy<00:01:04.650> an<00:01:04.949> expensive<00:01:05.220> camera<00:01:05.729> with<00:01:06.390> crystal

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
to buy an expensive camera with crystal

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.480 
to buy an expensive camera with crystal
sync<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.700> record<00:01:08.700> Oh<00:01:08.820> alongside<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.510> external

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
sync to record Oh alongside a external

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.160 
sync to record Oh alongside a external
recorder<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.640> then<00:01:12.270> which<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.689> have<00:01:12.990> to

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
recorder and then which you have to

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.460 
recorder and then which you have to
again<00:01:13.890> then<00:01:14.310> take<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> sound<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.630> film<00:01:16.229> and

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
again then take the sound in film and

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.210 
again then take the sound in film and
combine<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.830> together<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.520> it'll<00:01:18.409> be<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.740> sync

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
combine it together so it'll be in sync

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.940 
combine it together so it'll be in sync
so<00:01:20.820> I'll<00:01:20.909> show<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.299> cartridge<00:01:24.950> that's

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
so I'll show you the cartridge that's

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.850 
so I'll show you the cartridge that's
the<00:01:26.310> cartridge<00:01:26.909> here<00:01:27.180> it's<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> 200

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
the cartridge here it's this is a 200

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.730 
the cartridge here it's this is a 200
foot<00:01:29.210> feet<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.299> film<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.869> top<00:01:31.079> part<00:01:31.320> here

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
foot feet of film in the top part here

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.370 
foot feet of film in the top part here
and<00:01:32.070> on<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.579> bottom<00:01:32.759> part<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.810> typical

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
and on the bottom part is the typical

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.140 
and on the bottom part is the typical
size<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.340> sound<00:01:36.500> movie<00:01:37.500> cartridge<00:01:37.950> which<00:01:38.939> is

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
size of a sound movie cartridge which is

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.679 
size of a sound movie cartridge which is
that<00:01:39.900> size<00:01:40.259> there<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.329> silent<00:01:42.329> cartridge<00:01:42.630> is

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
that size there and silent cartridge is

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.090 
that size there and silent cartridge is
a<00:01:42.750> little<00:01:42.960> bit<00:01:43.049> shorter<00:01:43.380> it'll<00:01:43.560> probably<00:01:43.770> both

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
a little bit shorter it'll probably both

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.240 
a little bit shorter it'll probably both
there<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:45.170> on<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.290> bottom<00:01:46.590> here<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.100> is

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
there and on the bottom here this is

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.399 
there and on the bottom here this is
where<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.640> sound<00:01:48.030> gets<00:01:48.329> recorded<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
where the sound gets recorded so the

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.770 
where the sound gets recorded so the
film<00:01:49.799> actually<00:01:50.430> goes<00:01:50.700> across<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.180> sound<00:01:51.420> head

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
film actually goes across the sound head

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.770 
film actually goes across the sound head
here<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.430> that's<00:01:53.430> where<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.790> film<00:01:54.119> here<00:01:54.509> gets

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
here and that's where the film here gets

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.940 
here and that's where the film here gets
exposed<00:01:56.090> now<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.149> only<00:01:57.420> problem<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.469> the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
exposed now the only problem is that the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.310 
exposed now the only problem is that the
sound<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.490> being<00:01:59.820> accorded<00:02:00.299> 18<00:02:00.689> frames<00:02:01.049> ahead

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
sound is being accorded 18 frames ahead

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.020 
sound is being accorded 18 frames ahead
of<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.649> picture<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.040> if<00:02:02.430> you're<00:02:02.579> cutting<00:02:02.820> on

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
of the picture so if you're cutting on

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.840 
of the picture so if you're cutting on
film<00:02:03.509> which<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.829> don't<00:02:05.100> recommend<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.700> do

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
film which I don't recommend to do

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.389 
film which I don't recommend to do
anymore<00:02:06.060> because<00:02:06.500> you<00:02:07.500> can<00:02:07.710> transfer<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.280> and

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
anymore because you can transfer it and

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.639 
anymore because you can transfer it and
use<00:02:08.729> an<00:02:08.910> online

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
use an online

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.460 
use an online
nonlinear<00:02:10.519> editing<00:02:10.849> program<00:02:11.329> and<00:02:11.510> the

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
nonlinear editing program and the

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.869 
nonlinear editing program and the
advantage<00:02:12.890> of<00:02:13.010> doing<00:02:13.159> it<00:02:13.370> that<00:02:13.400> way<00:02:13.549> is<00:02:13.730> that

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
advantage of doing it that way is that

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.569 
advantage of doing it that way is that
you<00:02:14.689> won't<00:02:14.870> scratch<00:02:15.349> the<00:02:15.409> film<00:02:15.860> which<00:02:16.159> is<00:02:16.189> the

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
you won't scratch the film which is the

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:17.860 
you won't scratch the film which is the
problem<00:02:16.849> of<00:02:17.090> running<00:02:17.569> it<00:02:17.659> through<00:02:17.689> a

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
problem of running it through a

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.350 
problem of running it through a

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
of syncing things up and things like

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.729 
of syncing things up and things like
that<00:02:34.730> because<00:02:35.090> this<00:02:35.239> film<00:02:35.629> is<00:02:35.959> being<00:02:36.409> recorded
