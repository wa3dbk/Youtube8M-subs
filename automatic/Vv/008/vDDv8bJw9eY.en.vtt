00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.980
 a first pc standing here 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.140
 hello and welcome it once 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.570
 not a typical one this time 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.029
 unpacked and touched video but 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.339
 so to speak of this of our new 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.859
 styling guide 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:31.740
 we have an obvious one here 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.040
 relatively loud middle class pc stand 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.820
 as you me typical system player 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.309
 oriented and by no means to one 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.239
 low volume in optimized and 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.629
 this calculator 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.750
 We want to do that quietly soon 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.820
 Find out what is there for 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.489
 possibilities where are, of course 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.660
 limits set by the used 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:00.210
 components and then just before looking 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.570
 us also the computer from the same time 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.570
 close to 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.880
 yes, as a housing we have a riley here 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:37.450
 pcv 700 stand that I say nice now 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.490
 All aluminum model very compact for 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.229
 an atx housing through a whole 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.170
 intelligent components arrangement in the 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.990
 Interior but it has many open 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.149
 And then let them in and out 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:57.810
 were equally equipped with fans 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:02:00.220
 leave the factory to the outside 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.640
 then we see the side part decrease 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.959
 the various bike brothers fall right there 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.179
 of course, especially here the boxed 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:10.209
 cooler on the desperate tries that 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.790
 big amd fx processor on reasonable 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.700
 to maintain temperature 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.530
 and yes there is something overstrained 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.780
 Of course we have the four here 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:25.780
 cabinet fan 220 ceiling 120 at the 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.030
 rear wall and still 41 here in front 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.549
 also the air deal 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.120
 Apart from the factory and apart from him 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.160
 behind 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.390
 he should still bling a bit 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.290
 care and bling in the interior 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.359
 illuminate 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:42.190
 but the fans are of course too 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.380
 full speed but very signal too 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.150
 hear 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.940
 the graphics cards fans that are too 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.450
 two pieces on this direct cu cooler 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.000
 from asus also partially turn something 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.200
 higher than you would like it then 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.269
 will also try that quietly too 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.670
 and even if you get that 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.609
 big wheelbenders stay off 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.950
 in detail optimizations open 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:09.579
 the net here is actively cooled and 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.430
 is white yes now fans are quiet too 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.319
 Of course, it was still much higher 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.299
 put a classic hard drive in it 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.900
 which also one or the other 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:22.900
 The noise of itself is the first 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.730
 the initial situation we want, of course 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.140
 also a knife with 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:34.900
 Just look at the gold power here 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.830
 sl 400 our sound level meter that 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.340
 Whole leaves so nice 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.340
 light 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.579
 yes we are leveling slightly above the 45 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.610
 decibel one 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:53.150
 that's one really 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.769
 disturbing volume just when 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.420
 you do not just kind of go with it 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.700
 headphones plays but productive 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.349
 just want to work on the mind 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:05.900
 we'll see how far he is 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.120
 we can reduce what measures we take 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.069
 take that then there is the next 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.319
 to see video 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:16.389
 I will line up the individual ones 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.389
 introduce measures in detail
