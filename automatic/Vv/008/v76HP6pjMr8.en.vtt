hey guys it's the final part of

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.369 
hey guys it's the final part of
replacing<00:00:05.069> those<00:00:05.540> brake<00:00:06.540> pads<00:00:06.810> in<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.109> Kia

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
was going to shoot another short video

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.390 
was going to shoot another short video
about<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.080> most<00:00:16.289> crucial<00:00:16.740> part<00:00:17.039> probably

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
about the most crucial part probably

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.740 
about the most crucial part probably
with<00:00:17.730> this<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.330> whole<00:00:18.539> process<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:20.750> making

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
with this the whole process is making

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.590 
with this the whole process is making
sure<00:00:21.869> your<00:00:21.990> brakes<00:00:22.260> work<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.640> caliper<00:00:23.970> has

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
sure your brakes work so the caliper has

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.060 
sure your brakes work so the caliper has
been<00:00:24.810> put<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.140> place<00:00:25.380> we<00:00:25.650> will<00:00:25.769> place<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
been put in place we will place the

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.980 
been put in place we will place the
brake<00:00:26.519> pads<00:00:27.500> two<00:00:28.500> quick<00:00:28.800> notes<00:00:29.750> after<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.840> put

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
brake pads two quick notes after you put

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.160 
brake pads two quick notes after you put
the<00:00:31.080> caliper<00:00:31.470> back<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.800> place<00:00:32.070> if<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:33.300> look

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
the caliper back in place if you look

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.090 
the caliper back in place if you look
between<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.460> rotor<00:00:35.760> which<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.360> disc<00:00:36.660> and

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
between the rotor which is that disc and

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.130 
between the rotor which is that disc and
the<00:00:38.100> brake<00:00:38.370> pads<00:00:38.670> there<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.570> little<00:00:39.840> gap

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
the brake pads there is a little gap

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.090 
the brake pads there is a little gap
okay<00:00:41.629> now<00:00:42.629> if<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.960> turn<00:00:43.140> your<00:00:43.260> car<00:00:43.590> if<00:00:44.070> you

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
okay now if you turn your car if you

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.170 
okay now if you turn your car if you
turn<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.460> engine<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:46.969> you<00:00:47.969> know<00:00:48.120> you

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
turn the engine on and you know you

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.000 
turn the engine on and you know you
desire<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.050> wish<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.440> just<00:00:49.920> start<00:00:50.399> driving

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
desire you wish to just start driving

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.060 
desire you wish to just start driving
the<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.699> pressure<00:00:54.030> had<00:00:54.390> been<00:00:55.070> decompressed

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
the the pressure had been decompressed

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.779 
the the pressure had been decompressed
okay<00:00:56.850> there<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.949> brake<00:00:59.190> pads<00:00:59.460> are<00:00:59.640> not

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
okay there is a the brake pads are not

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.319 
okay there is a the brake pads are not
close<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.660> rotor<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.800> if<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.280> drop<00:01:03.090> out<00:01:03.239> of

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
close to the rotor so if you drop out of

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.479 
close to the rotor so if you drop out of
the<00:01:03.480> garage<00:01:03.660> you're<00:01:04.290> gonna<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:05.220> brake<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the garage you're gonna the brake the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.109 
the garage you're gonna the brake the
brakes<00:01:05.970> on<00:01:06.150> will<00:01:06.479> not<00:01:06.890> hold<00:01:07.890> okay<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
brakes on will not hold okay the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.850 
brakes on will not hold okay the
calipers<00:01:09.540> are<00:01:09.689> not<00:01:09.780> close<00:01:10.049> enough<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.619> to

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
calipers are not close enough to the to

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.580 
calipers are not close enough to the to
the<00:01:10.979> rotor<00:01:11.510> there<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.600> not<00:01:12.750> enough<00:01:12.990> pressure

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
the rotor there is not enough pressure

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.039 
the rotor there is not enough pressure
because<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.159> pushed<00:01:14.460> back<00:01:14.760> with<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.720> old

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
because you pushed back with that old

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.429 
because you pushed back with that old
brake<00:01:16.710> pad<00:01:16.979> those<00:01:17.580> two<00:01:17.790> Pistons<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.900> make<00:01:19.080> room

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
brake pad those two Pistons to make room

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.609 
brake pad those two Pistons to make room
to<00:01:20.400> fit<00:01:20.670> back<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.330> now<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.409> bring

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
to fit back on now you have to bring

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.100 
to fit back on now you have to bring
those<00:01:22.799> two<00:01:23.040> Pistons<00:01:23.580> back<00:01:23.820> close<00:01:24.330> enough<00:01:24.810> to

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
those two Pistons back close enough to

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.200 
those two Pistons back close enough to
the<00:01:25.229> caliper<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:28.009> back<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.250> rotor<00:01:29.520> so

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
the caliper and back to the rotor so

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.469 
the caliper and back to the rotor so
that<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.840> moment<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.320> hit<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.590> brake

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
that the the moment you hit the brake

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.420 
that the the moment you hit the brake
pedal<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.720> car<00:01:33.990> will<00:01:34.170> stop<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
pedal the car will stop so this is the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.140 
pedal the car will stop so this is the
final<00:01:35.640> Testament<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.329> do<00:01:37.549> you<00:01:38.549> see<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.909> light

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
so take a quick look at how far the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.899 
so take a quick look at how far the
brake<00:01:43.649> pedal<00:01:44.390> which<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.720> how<00:01:46.380> far<00:01:47.869> I<00:01:48.869> can

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
brake pedal which is this how far I can

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.160 
brake pedal which is this how far I can
press<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:50.939> with<00:01:51.390> until<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.500> stops<00:01:53.750> it<00:01:54.750> goes<00:01:54.960> all

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
press it with until it stops it goes all

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.850 
press it with until it stops it goes all
the<00:01:55.200> way<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.560> floor

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
the way to the floor

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.730 
the way to the floor
now<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.579> gotta<00:01:56.880> keep<00:01:57.200> pumping<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.710> pumping

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
now you gotta keep pumping and pumping

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.030 
now you gotta keep pumping and pumping
until<00:02:01.399> see<00:02:02.399> now<00:02:02.579> it's<00:02:02.759> hard<00:02:03.439> now<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.469> can't<00:02:04.860> push

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
went all the way to the floor so you

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.339 
went all the way to the floor so you
feel<00:02:09.209> like<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.450> said<00:02:09.629> if<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.780> turn<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.080> engine
