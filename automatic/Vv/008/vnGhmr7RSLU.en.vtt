to<00:01:45.259> side<00:01:45.590> you<00:01:46.369> can<00:01:46.520> keep<00:01:46.670> that<00:01:46.700> on<00:01:47.030> I'm<00:01:47.210> just

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
to side you can keep that on I'm just

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.580 
to side you can keep that on I'm just
going<00:01:47.450> to<00:01:47.479> leave<00:01:47.630> it<00:01:47.659> on<00:01:47.780> and<00:01:48.229> I'm<00:01:48.380> gonna<00:01:48.470> hit

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
going to leave it on and I'm gonna hit

going to leave it on and I'm gonna hit
the<00:01:48.649> home<00:01:48.890> button<00:01:49.240> so<00:01:50.240> there<00:01:50.390> we<00:01:50.509> go<00:01:50.540> it

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
the home button so there we go it

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.210 
the home button so there we go it
doesn't<00:01:50.899> even<00:01:51.200> really<00:01:51.380> take<00:01:51.680> a<00:01:51.710> refresh

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
doesn't even really take a refresh

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.639 
doesn't even really take a refresh
actually<00:01:52.840> so<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:53.930> need<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:54.290> start<00:01:54.530> moving

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
actually so you need to start moving

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.100 
actually so you need to start moving
your<00:01:54.799> icons<00:01:55.220> in<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:55.490> dock<00:01:55.670> and<00:01:55.970> you<00:01:56.450> can<00:01:56.600> see<00:01:56.840> I

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
them in there and it doesn't really look

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.420 
them in there and it doesn't really look
good<00:02:11.900> actually<00:02:12.770> that's<00:02:12.950> more<00:02:13.129> than<00:02:13.190> 10<00:02:13.370> icons

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
good actually that's more than 10 icons

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.320 
good actually that's more than 10 icons
embassy<00:02:16.430> once<00:02:16.760> you<00:02:16.910> act

bad<00:02:17.510> in<00:02:17.660> these<00:02:17.750> icons<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.500> can<00:02:18.530> stroll<00:02:18.890> from

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
bad in these icons you can stroll from

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.950 
bad in these icons you can stroll from
side<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.340> side<00:02:19.370> but<00:02:19.760> as<00:02:19.940> you<00:02:20.180> see<00:02:20.420> like<00:02:20.780> when

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
side to side but as you see like when

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.220 
side to side but as you see like when
