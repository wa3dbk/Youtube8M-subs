00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
I've tried this video a few times my

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.450 
I've tried this video a few times my
phone<00:01:18.270> here<00:01:18.630> which<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.650> normally<00:01:19.710> do<00:01:20.100> not<00:01:20.130> film

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
phone here which I normally do not film

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.460 
phone here which I normally do not film
on<00:01:20.610> does<00:01:20.790> not<00:01:20.970> focus<00:01:21.210> well<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:21.990> lighting

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
on does not focus well in this lighting

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.200 
on does not focus well in this lighting
unfortunately<00:01:24.860> just<00:01:25.860> gives<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.250> an<00:01:26.340> idea<00:01:26.670> so

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.580 

it's<00:01:30.210> funny<00:01:30.420> because<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.750> have<00:01:30.930> actually<00:01:31.200> not

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
it's funny because I have actually not

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.890 
it's funny because I have actually not
bought<00:01:31.920> as<00:01:32.100> much<00:01:32.220> gold<00:01:32.490> recently<00:01:32.939> simply

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
bought as much gold recently simply

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.890 
bought as much gold recently simply
because<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:35.210> silver<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.299> gold<00:01:36.420> ratio<00:01:36.780> has

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
because the silver and gold ratio has

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.560 
because the silver and gold ratio has
been<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.290> skewed<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.340> silver<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:39.000> cheap<00:01:39.360> I

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
been so skewed the silver is so cheap I

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.050 
been so skewed the silver is so cheap I
think<00:01:39.840> compared<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.380> gold<00:01:40.860> at<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.130> moment<00:01:41.400> but

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
think compared to gold at the moment but

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.580 
think compared to gold at the moment but
when<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.240> get<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.360> coupon<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:44.630> you<00:01:45.630> coupons

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
when you get a coupon that you coupons

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.020 
when you get a coupon that you coupons
for<00:01:46.890> bullion<00:01:47.070> which<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.490> just<00:01:47.700> sounds<00:01:47.909> crazy

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
for bullion which is just sounds crazy

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.850 
for bullion which is just sounds crazy
but<00:01:48.360> when<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.869> get<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.990> coupon<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.649> allows

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
but when you get a coupon that allows

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.539 
but when you get a coupon that allows
you<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.040> buy<00:01:50.220> gold<00:01:50.250> under<00:01:50.820> spots<00:01:52.159> why<00:01:53.159> not<00:01:53.369> take

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
you to buy gold under spots why not take

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.780 
you to buy gold under spots why not take
advantage<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:54.409> this<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:56.159> pretty<00:01:56.610> little

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
advantage so this this pretty little

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.630 
advantage so this this pretty little
coin<00:01:57.240> here<00:01:57.680> ended<00:01:58.680> up<00:01:58.799> being<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.280> little<00:01:59.399> less

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
coin here ended up being a little less

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.319 
coin here ended up being a little less
than<00:01:59.820> $300<00:02:00.540> when<00:02:00.960> all<00:02:01.079> was<00:02:01.229> said<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.469> done<00:02:01.619> and
