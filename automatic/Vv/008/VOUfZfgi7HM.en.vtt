00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.060
 a history that came from agriculture 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.400
 small-scale family today it can 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.170
 buy house to buy a car 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.360
 can live a dignified life for the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.810
 his family, he considers whether a person 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.799
 and this should be done if the 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.490
 that gave this opportunity to 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.640
 for there my name is darci broth Fornari 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.119
 personnel trained in animal husbandry 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.180
 state university of maringá paraná 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.170
 during the doctorate it happens final 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.990
 doctorate degree 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.869
 I participated in an aquabrasil project. 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.110
 a national project coordinated by the 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.550
 embrapa this project was aimed at and 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.740
 several areas of research and improvement 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.840
 the central problem 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.960
 regret is here in the district of progress 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.060
 from the north and smile is theirs fish 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.440
 fish farming in Brazil is an activity 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.520
 too young 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.510
 cnaa in the node we have national in scope 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.060
 national 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.110
 then there is a structure still 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.510
 consolidated market 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.760
 industrialization and the refrigerator is the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.970
 Most important step out of the duel 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.710
 between production and consumption 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.210
 the small producer did not 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.400
 large producer to invest in fish farming 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.110
 and then they have nowhere to sell the fish. 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.980
 the refrigerator comes here giving 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.660
 security of this possibility and of the 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.660
 total product outflow 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.360
 Brazil consumes more than two million 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.340
 tons of fish a year and produces a 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.310
 slightly more than one million tonnes in 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.650
 between extractivism and culture 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.110
 Brazil today imports the most of 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.150
 900 thousand tons of fish today 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.790
 we have a big fish deficit 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.580
 no country so therefore potential 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.440
 like Brazil we have 13 percent 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.020
 of the world's drinking water 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.510
 we have an extremely hot climate 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.760
 favorable but it is a 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.740
 favor the production of grains which the 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.960
 of fish nutrition and the government has 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.120
 given a tremendous force that we have 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.650
 laws today and we have work we 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.500
 we always try to work with the 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.600
 sustainability without harming the environment 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.690
 but environmental agencies do not have 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.000
 he has plastered and bureaucratized each 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.860
 the legalization of fish farming 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.290
 then it would be a hindrance 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.770
 and this challenge he was he was 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:53.460
 exceeded and was overcome with the 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:56.610
 Government to claim our n s 10 years 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:04:00.120
 the largest fish producer in Brazil and 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:03.450
 and meet the great national demand for 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.610
 account all features and not in 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.660
 no other state would have this condition 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.030
 so I feel fulfilled 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.670
 professionally performed 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.110
 on the personal side also really the bush 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.110
 thick the state brought me a lot of joy
