sooner<00:01:32.400> than<00:01:32.790> normal<00:01:33.240> after<00:01:33.630> reloading<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.920> do

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
sooner than normal after reloading to do

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.710 
sooner than normal after reloading to do
this<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.369> reload<00:01:35.670> like<00:01:35.880> normal<00:01:36.240> but<00:01:36.420> as<00:01:36.570> soon

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
this you reload like normal but as soon

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.880 
this you reload like normal but as soon
as<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.930> see<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.200> bullets<00:01:37.470> appear<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.799> your

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
gun on the bottom right you quickly tap

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.469 
gun on the bottom right you quickly tap
Y<00:01:40.110> or<00:01:40.409> triangle<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.159> ps3<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.150> tap<00:01:42.329> it

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
Y or triangle on the ps3 and you tap it

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.780 
Y or triangle on the ps3 and you tap it
twice<00:01:42.770> this<00:01:43.770> will<00:01:43.950> start<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.189> switch<00:01:44.460> your<00:01:44.640> gun

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
twice this will start to switch your gun

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.550 
twice this will start to switch your gun
and<00:01:45.000> then<00:01:45.090> quickly<00:01:45.329> switch<00:01:45.630> back<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.110> since

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
and then quickly switch back and since

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.840 
and then quickly switch back and since
the<00:01:46.680> game<00:01:46.799> reads<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.399> now<00:01:47.549> have<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.790> full

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
the game reads that you now have a full

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.999 
the game reads that you now have a full
magazine<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.869> doesn't<00:01:49.229> need<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.530> complete<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
magazine it doesn't need to complete the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.830 
magazine it doesn't need to complete the
rest<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.430> reload<00:01:50.790> animation<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.540> you

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
rest of that reload animation and you

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.050 
rest of that reload animation and you
can<00:01:51.960> start<00:01:52.229> shooting<00:01:52.409> right<00:01:52.590> away<00:01:52.880> so<00:01:53.880> here's

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
can start shooting right away so here's

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.240 
can start shooting right away so here's
a<00:01:54.119> comparison<00:01:54.420> with<00:01:54.750> an<00:01:54.840> SMG<00:01:55.170> as<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.950> can<00:01:56.100> see

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
a comparison with an SMG as you can see

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.130 
a comparison with an SMG as you can see
with<00:01:56.549> reload<00:01:56.909> cancelling<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.479> was<00:01:57.630> about<00:01:57.780> three

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
with reload cancelling I was about three

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.380 
with reload cancelling I was about three
bullets<00:01:58.500> faster<00:01:58.950> which<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.880> fast<00:02:00.090> killing

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
bullets faster which in a fast killing

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.240 
bullets faster which in a fast killing
game<00:02:00.540> like<00:02:00.719> Call<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.930> Duty<00:02:01.259> that's<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.770> huge

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
game like Call of Duty that's a huge

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.550 
game like Call of Duty that's a huge
huge<00:02:02.610> difference<00:02:03.049> so<00:02:04.049> now<00:02:04.170> I'm<00:02:04.259> going<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.409> show

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
huge difference so now I'm going to show

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.050 
huge difference so now I'm going to show
you<00:02:04.649> why<00:02:04.860> why<00:02:05.070> reload<00:02:05.460> cancelling<00:02:05.820> with<00:02:05.909> a

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
you why why reload cancelling with a

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.819 
you why why reload cancelling with a
shotgun<00:02:06.360> because<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.290> difference<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.710> even

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
shotgun because the difference is even

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.429 
shotgun because the difference is even
more<00:02:07.979> pronounced

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:12.439 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:15.080 

the<00:02:13.439> ÿÿ<00:02:13.799> trick<00:02:14.099> also<00:02:14.340> allows<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:14.849> to<00:02:14.939> have<00:02:15.030> a

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
the ÿÿ trick also allows you to have a

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.300 
the ÿÿ trick also allows you to have a
gun<00:02:15.269> ready<00:02:15.689> faster<00:02:16.260> after<00:02:16.439> picking<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:17.010> up<00:02:17.069> off

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
gun ready faster after picking it up off

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.819 
gun ready faster after picking it up off
the<00:02:17.340> ground<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:18.480> do<00:02:18.629> this<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:18.989> hold<00:02:19.200> X<00:02:19.470> or

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
the ground to do this you hold X or

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.800 
the ground to do this you hold X or
square<00:02:20.250> on<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.430> ps3<00:02:20.909> to<00:02:21.060> pick<00:02:21.209> up<00:02:21.329> the<00:02:21.420> gun<00:02:21.599> and

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
square on the ps3 to pick up the gun and

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.420 
square on the ps3 to pick up the gun and
as<00:02:22.260> soon<00:02:22.470> as<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.680> hear<00:02:22.799> the<00:02:22.860> sound<00:02:23.129> of<00:02:23.280> your

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
as soon as you hear the sound of your

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.250 
as soon as you hear the sound of your
character<00:02:23.760> picking<00:02:24.030> up<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.239> gun<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.959> double

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
character picking up the gun you double

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.890 
character picking up the gun you double
tap<00:02:25.379> Y<00:02:25.680> or<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:26.010> triangle<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.760> just<00:02:27.599> like<00:02:27.720> that

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
tap Y or a triangle and just like that

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.300 
tap Y or a triangle and just like that
your<00:02:28.079> gun<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.349> now<00:02:28.470> ready<00:02:28.709> to<00:02:28.769> fire<00:02:29.040> and

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
your gun is now ready to fire and

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.770 
your gun is now ready to fire and
there's<00:02:29.430> no<00:02:29.640> need<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:29.879> chamber<00:02:30.329> that<00:02:30.510> first

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
there's no need to chamber that first

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.500 
there's no need to chamber that first
round<00:02:31.010> in<00:02:32.010> addition<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.549> y<00:02:32.700> y<00:02:32.909> there's<00:02:33.269> another

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
round in addition to y y there's another

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.300 
round in addition to y y there's another
method<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:34.049> reload<00:02:34.349> cancelling<00:02:34.799> and<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.190> is

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
method of reload cancelling and that is

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.610 
method of reload cancelling and that is
sprint<00:02:35.640> cancelling<00:02:36.120> with<00:02:36.359> sprint<00:02:37.170> cancelling

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
sprint cancelling with sprint cancelling

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.960 
sprint cancelling with sprint cancelling
you<00:02:37.709> start<00:02:37.950> sprinting<00:02:38.220> as<00:02:38.519> soon<00:02:38.760> as<00:02:38.909> the

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
you start sprinting as soon as the

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.339 
you start sprinting as soon as the
bullets<00:02:39.239> appear<00:02:39.450> in<00:02:39.540> your<00:02:39.659> gun<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:39.959> once

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
bullets appear in your gun and once

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.869 
bullets appear in your gun and once
again<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.739> reload<00:02:41.010> animation<00:02:41.519> will<00:02:41.849> be

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
again the reload animation will be

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.580 
again the reload animation will be
canceled<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.569> they<00:02:42.780> don't<00:02:42.989> need<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.230> complete

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
canceled and they don't need to complete

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.280 
canceled and they don't need to complete
it<00:02:43.709> this<00:02:44.519> method<00:02:44.879> isn't<00:02:45.090> quite<00:02:45.480> as<00:02:45.690> fast<00:02:46.019> as

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
it this method isn't quite as fast as

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.330 
it this method isn't quite as fast as
the<00:02:46.590> while<00:02:46.739> I'm<00:02:46.950> at<00:02:47.159> it

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
the while I'm at it

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.009 
the while I'm at it
but<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.879> is<00:02:48.000> great<00:02:48.269> if<00:02:48.450> you're<00:02:48.569> a<00:02:48.599> rusher<00:02:48.989> and

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
but it is great if you're a rusher and

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.119 
but it is great if you're a rusher and
you<00:02:49.200> just<00:02:49.379> want<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.560> be<00:02:49.680> on<00:02:49.829> the<00:02:49.980> move

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
you just want to be on the move

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.410 
you just want to be on the move
constantly<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:50.849> don't<00:02:51.030> want<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.269> wait

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
constantly and you don't want to wait

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.449 
constantly and you don't want to wait
around<00:02:51.569> for<00:02:51.840> that<00:02:52.049> full<00:02:52.440> reload<00:02:52.799> animation<00:02:53.340> to

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
around for that full reload animation to

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.670 
around for that full reload animation to
happen<00:02:53.870> alright<00:02:54.870> so<00:02:55.049> the<00:02:55.139> last<00:02:55.290> tip<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.650> I

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
happen alright so the last tip that I

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.289 
happen alright so the last tip that I
want<00:02:55.799> to<00:02:55.920> cover<00:02:56.069> is<00:02:56.340> how<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:56.549> not<00:02:56.849> waste<00:02:57.060> time

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
want to cover is how to not waste time

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.869 
want to cover is how to not waste time
getting<00:02:57.569> over<00:02:57.810> obstacles<00:02:58.099> this<00:02:59.099> is<00:02:59.280> really

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
getting over obstacles this is really

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.849 
getting over obstacles this is really
simple<00:03:00.120> but<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.510> rarely<00:03:00.840> see<00:03:01.200> people<00:03:01.230> doing<00:03:01.739> it
