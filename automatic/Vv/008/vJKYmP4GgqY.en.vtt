00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
region of your base is like right here

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.560 
region of your base is like right here
and<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.740> makes<00:01:07.950> managing<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.490> drops<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.150> easy

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
base the hidden base that once found

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.490 
base the hidden base that once found
dies<00:05:52.560> immediately<00:05:53.930> what's<00:05:54.930> the<00:05:55.050> counter<00:05:55.350> to<00:05:55.470> a

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
dies immediately what's the counter to a

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.170 
dies immediately what's the counter to a
hidden<00:05:55.740> base<00:05:55.920> in<00:05:56.130> your<00:05:56.220> base<00:05:56.400> well<00:05:56.880> the<00:05:56.940> best

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
hidden base in your base well the best

hidden base in your base well the best
counter<00:05:57.480> is<00:05:57.600> to<00:05:57.750> attack<00:05:58.110> at<00:05:58.350> any<00:05:58.410> point<00:05:59.120> so<00:06:00.120> it

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
counter is to attack at any point so it

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.520 
counter is to attack at any point so it
looks<00:06:00.330> like<00:06:00.420> me<00:06:00.600> stuck<00:06:00.870> hiding<00:06:01.080> he<00:06:01.380> could

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
looks like me stuck hiding he could

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.230 
looks like me stuck hiding he could
expand<00:06:02.070> here<00:06:02.310> if<00:06:02.460> we<00:06:02.550> wants<00:06:02.820> you<00:06:02.910> could<00:06:03.060> set<00:06:03.210> up

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
expand here if we wants you could set up

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.870 
expand here if we wants you could set up
another<00:06:03.570> base<00:06:04.490> but<00:06:05.490> it<00:06:05.580> does<00:06:05.700> look<00:06:05.820> like

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 
another base but it does look like

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.550 
another base but it does look like
Nate's<00:06:06.240> this<00:06:06.540> doesn't<00:06:06.870> really<00:06:06.990> have<00:06:07.230> anything
