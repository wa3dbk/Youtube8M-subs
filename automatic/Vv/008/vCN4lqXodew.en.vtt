00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
very young and then I just kind of

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.569 
very young and then I just kind of
stopped<00:00:37.140> caring<00:00:37.590> about<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:38.100> for<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.309> long<00:00:38.520> time

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579

and this the first time I kind of give
it<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.739> about<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:41.129> for<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> while<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.730> it

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
it a about it for a while so it

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.490 
it a about it for a while so it
should<00:00:42.210> be<00:00:42.239> interesting<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.899> see<00:00:43.170> how<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.350> goes

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500

Lambert<00:01:46.290> combination<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.009> don't<00:01:47.520> really<00:01:47.790> like

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
Lambert combination I don't really like

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.940 
Lambert combination I don't really like
it<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:48.360> kind<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.630> like<00:01:48.750> having<00:01:48.990> two<00:01:49.320> big<00:01:49.710> it's

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
it it's kind of like having two big it's

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.920 
it it's kind of like having two big it's
like<00:01:50.310> having<00:01:50.610> two<00:01:50.790> andy<00:01:51.210> carroll's<00:01:51.659> on<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
like having two andy carroll's on the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.569 
like having two andy carroll's on the
pitch<00:01:52.110> at<00:01:52.320> once<00:01:52.530> if<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.860> will<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.399> know<00:01:53.520> two

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
pitch at once if you will you know two

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.850 
pitch at once if you will you know two
of<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.939> very<00:01:54.180> similar<00:01:54.780> style<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.409> players<00:01:55.619> and

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
of the very similar style of players and

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.039 
of the very similar style of players and
it<00:01:56.640> just<00:01:56.850> doesn't<00:01:57.180> really<00:01:57.360> work<00:01:57.630> as<00:01:57.810> well

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
it just doesn't really work as well

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.209 
it just doesn't really work as well
that's<00:01:58.259> why<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.409> really<00:01:58.680> like<00:01:58.829> having<00:01:59.009> the

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
that's why I really like having the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.219 
that's why I really like having the
combination<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.909> my<00:02:00.119> Yuka<00:02:00.479> someone<00:02:01.020> who<00:02:01.079> can
