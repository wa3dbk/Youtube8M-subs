it's<00:00:16.379> their<00:00:16.529> Marshall<00:00:17.039> Blues<00:00:17.279> breaker<00:00:17.640> kit<00:00:18.060> I

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
it's their Marshall Blues breaker kit I

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.480 
it's their Marshall Blues breaker kit I
wanted<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.350> do<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.680> because<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:20.130> gives<00:00:20.310> me<00:00:20.460> a

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
wanted to do that because it gives me a

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.160 
wanted to do that because it gives me a
little<00:00:20.670> bit<00:00:20.789> different<00:00:21.300> type<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.510> overdrive<00:00:22.109> a

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
little bit different type of overdrive a

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.480 
little bit different type of overdrive a
little<00:00:22.380> bit<00:00:22.470> different<00:00:22.769> circuit<00:00:23.160> then<00:00:23.310> that's

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
little bit different circuit then that's

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.480 
little bit different circuit then that's

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
then the tube screamer circuit and I'm

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.099 
then the tube screamer circuit and I'm
