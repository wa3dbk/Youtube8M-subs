00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
all right for pattern number three gonna

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.680 
all right for pattern number three gonna
use<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.080> same<00:00:07.380> chord<00:00:08.160> changes<00:00:08.639> we're<00:00:09.540> gonna

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
use the same chord changes we're gonna

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.350 
use the same chord changes we're gonna
move<00:00:09.930> from<00:00:10.200> G<00:00:11.300> one<00:00:12.300> bar<00:00:12.510> of<00:00:12.540> G<00:00:12.780> 1<00:00:12.990> bar<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.260> F<00:00:13.620> and

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
move from G one bar of G 1 bar of F and

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.460 
move from G one bar of G 1 bar of F and
two<00:00:15.360> bars<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.780> C<00:00:17.360> the<00:00:18.360> rhythmic<00:00:18.810> feel<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.230> going

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
two bars of C the rhythmic feel is going

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.930 
two bars of C the rhythmic feel is going
to<00:00:19.560> be<00:00:20.270> pretty<00:00:21.270> much<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.449> same<00:00:21.600> as<00:00:22.789> at<00:00:23.789> the

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:23.940 
to be pretty much the same as at the

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.710 
to be pretty much the same as at the

transition from chord to chord as far as
the<00:00:57.149> notes<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.809> used<00:00:58.050> those<00:00:58.440> are<00:00:58.590> going

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the notes that we used those are going

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.440 
the notes that we used those are going
to<00:00:58.770> be<00:00:58.890> different<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.879> time<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.329> this

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
to be different this time in this

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.249 
to be different this time in this
pattern<00:01:00.660> we're<00:01:00.840> going<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.050> use<00:01:01.699> the<00:01:02.699> one<00:01:03.259> which

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
pattern we're going to use the one which

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.910 
pattern we're going to use the one which
is<00:01:04.289> in<00:01:04.890> G<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:06.210> one's<00:01:06.420> going<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.630> be<00:01:06.720> G<00:01:06.930> then<00:01:07.740> use

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
is in G the one's going to be G then use

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.529 
is in G the one's going to be G then use
the<00:01:08.130> octave<00:01:08.610> or<00:01:09.140> eight<00:01:10.970> which<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.300> higher

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
the octave or eight which is this higher

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.350 
the octave or eight which is this higher
G<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.950> D<00:01:13.979> string<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:15.890> we're<00:01:16.890> going<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.100> use

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
G on the D string and we're going to use

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.279 
G on the D string and we're going to use
F<00:01:18.530> which<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.709> flat<00:01:19.979> seven<00:01:20.899> and<00:01:21.899> we're<00:01:22.140> also

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
F which is the flat seven and we're also

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:24.770 
F which is the flat seven and we're also
going<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.590> use<00:01:22.800> D<00:01:23.220> which<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> five<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.660> it's

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
going to use D which is a five so it's

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.830 
going to use D which is a five so it's
going<00:01:24.899> to<00:01:25.020> look<00:01:25.140> like<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.740> shape

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.440 

which<00:01:29.840> you<00:01:30.020> might<00:01:30.230> hear<00:01:30.590> that<00:01:31.160> in<00:01:31.460> a<00:01:31.790> number<00:01:32.270> of

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
which you might hear that in a number of

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.640 
which you might hear that in a number of
different<00:01:32.870> types<00:01:33.140> of<00:01:33.410> music<00:01:35.170> so<00:01:36.170> it's<00:01:36.320> kind<00:01:36.560> of

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
different types of music so it's kind of

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.010 
different types of music so it's kind of
a<00:01:36.800> common<00:01:37.520> base<00:01:38.530> shape<00:01:40.480> when<00:01:41.480> we<00:01:41.540> get<00:01:41.690> to<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.900> F

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
a common base shape when we get to the F

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.940 
a common base shape when we get to the F
chord<00:01:42.430> we're<00:01:43.430> going<00:01:43.460> to<00:01:43.640> be<00:01:43.790> using<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:45.740> root

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
chord we're going to be using the root

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.510 
chord we're going to be using the root
again<00:01:46.600> I'm<00:01:47.600> gonna<00:01:47.720> use<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.230> octave<00:01:49.070> the

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
again I'm gonna use the octave the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.610 
again I'm gonna use the octave the
eighth<00:01:49.670> which<00:01:50.000> is<00:01:50.180> this<00:01:50.330> higher<00:01:50.570> F<00:01:50.810> we're

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
eighth which is this higher F we're

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.910 
eighth which is this higher F we're
gonna<00:01:51.800> use<00:01:52.130> also<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:53.570> flat<00:01:53.840> 7<00:01:54.260> again<00:01:54.350> which<00:01:54.800> an

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
gonna use also the flat 7 again which an

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.190 
gonna use also the flat 7 again which an
F<00:01:55.100> that's<00:01:55.310> gonna<00:01:55.640> be<00:01:55.910> e<00:01:56.180> flat<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:57.730> then<00:01:59.200> with

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
F that's gonna be e flat and then with

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.580 
F that's gonna be e flat and then with
the<00:02:00.320> triplet<00:02:00.800> figure<00:02:01.300> 2<00:02:02.300> in<00:02:03.290> order<00:02:03.470> to

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
the triplet figure 2 in order to

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.640 
the triplet figure 2 in order to
transition<00:02:04.130> to<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.760> C<00:02:05.330> chord<00:02:05.690> we're<00:02:06.530> gonna

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
transition to the C chord we're gonna

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.150 
transition to the C chord we're gonna
play<00:02:06.920> a<00:02:06.950> chromatic<00:02:08.410> triplet<00:02:09.410> figure<00:02:09.770> it

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
play a chromatic triplet figure it

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.830 
play a chromatic triplet figure it
starts<00:02:10.520> on<00:02:10.640> a<00:02:10.880> I<00:02:11.150> use<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.660> open<00:02:11.990> a<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:13.700> then<00:02:14.660> it

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
starts on a I use the open a and then it

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.410 
starts on a I use the open a and then it
goes<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.320> B<00:02:16.310> flat<00:02:16.930> which<00:02:17.930> is<00:02:17.960> the<00:02:18.140> 4<00:02:19.300> then<00:02:20.300> we're

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
goes to B flat which is the 4 then we're

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.400 
goes to B flat which is the 4 then we're
gonna<00:02:20.570> use<00:02:20.870> a<00:02:21.200> B<00:02:22.000> which<00:02:23.000> is<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.270> flat<00:02:23.540> 5<00:02:23.870> and

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
gonna use a B which is the flat 5 and

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.890 
gonna use a B which is the flat 5 and
then<00:02:25.070> you<00:02:25.640> know<00:02:25.730> eventually<00:02:25.820> moving<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.660> C

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
then you know eventually moving to the C

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.200 
then you know eventually moving to the C
which<00:02:27.230> is<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.590> first<00:02:27.830> note<00:02:28.100> of<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.940> next

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
which is the first note of the next

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.650 
which is the first note of the next
chord<00:02:29.770> ok<00:02:30.770> so<00:02:30.830> that<00:02:31.160> that<00:02:31.520> patterns<00:02:32.450> gonna

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
chord ok so that that patterns gonna

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.250 
chord ok so that that patterns gonna
just<00:02:32.840> walk<00:02:33.020> up<00:02:33.260> chromatically<00:02:33.709> from<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:38.260> you

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
just walk up chromatically from a you

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.840 
just walk up chromatically from a you
know<00:02:39.290> to<00:02:39.770> B<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.250> C<00:02:40.660> so<00:02:41.660> it<00:02:41.780> leads<00:02:41.959> nicely<00:02:42.140> to<00:02:42.560> the

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
know to B to C so it leads nicely to the

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.690 
know to B to C so it leads nicely to the
to<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:43.970> next<00:02:44.120> chord<00:02:45.010> so<00:02:46.010> in<00:02:46.130> that<00:02:46.250> next<00:02:46.430> chord

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
to the next chord so in that next chord

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.190 
to the next chord so in that next chord
C<00:02:47.800> we're<00:02:48.800> again<00:02:49.100> gonna<00:02:49.340> be<00:02:49.520> using<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:50.060> root<00:02:50.900> C

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
C we're again gonna be using the root C

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.650 
C we're again gonna be using the root C
come<00:02:51.950> use<00:02:52.160> an<00:02:52.250> octave<00:02:52.670> C<00:02:53.739> ain't<00:02:55.390> gonna<00:02:56.390> use<00:02:56.510> the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
come use an octave C ain't gonna use the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:03.360 
come use an octave C ain't gonna use the
flat<00:02:56.870> 7<00:02:57.410> B<00:02:57.590> flat<00:02:58.870> and<00:03:01.690> then<00:03:02.690> we're<00:03:02.900> going<00:03:03.140> to

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
flat 7 B flat and then we're going to

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.699 
flat 7 B flat and then we're going to
use<00:03:04.370> a<00:03:04.720> triplet<00:03:05.720> rhythm<00:03:06.430> which<00:03:07.430> uses<00:03:07.880> C<00:03:08.680> B<00:03:09.680> flat

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
use a triplet rhythm which uses C B flat

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.910 
use a triplet rhythm which uses C B flat
and<00:03:10.450> G<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.780> 5<00:03:13.450> okay<00:03:14.450> and<00:03:14.720> in<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.290> last<00:03:15.470> bar<00:03:15.800> if

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
and G the 5 okay and in the last bar if

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.430 
and G the 5 okay and in the last bar if
we're<00:03:16.070> gonna<00:03:16.220> do<00:03:16.370> basically<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.850> same<00:03:16.970> thing

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
we're gonna do basically the same thing

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.560 
we're gonna do basically the same thing
you<00:03:18.440> see<00:03:18.800> an<00:03:19.610> octave<00:03:20.239> C<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:22.160> 7th<00:03:22.610> B<00:03:22.880> flat<00:03:23.239> and

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
you see an octave C the 7th B flat and

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.780 
you see an octave C the 7th B flat and
then<00:03:23.630> we're<00:03:24.530> going<00:03:24.709> to<00:03:24.800> transition<00:03:25.310> back<00:03:25.730> to

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
then we're going to transition back to

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.240 
then we're going to transition back to
the<00:03:26.450> top<00:03:26.870> of<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.110> phrase<00:03:27.410> with<00:03:27.920> another

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
the top of the phrase with another

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.140 
the top of the phrase with another
chromatic<00:03:28.760> figure<00:03:29.120> that<00:03:29.780> starts<00:03:30.530> on<00:03:30.680> C<00:03:31.150> then

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
chromatic figure that starts on C then

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.820 
chromatic figure that starts on C then
goes<00:03:32.750> to<00:03:32.780> D<00:03:33.110> flat

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
goes to D flat

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.699 
goes to D flat
in<00:03:35.520> 2d

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
in 2d

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.039 
in 2d
which<00:03:38.219> leads<00:03:38.489> nicely<00:03:38.670> back<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.299> G<00:03:40.099> okay

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
which leads nicely back to the G okay

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.819 
which leads nicely back to the G okay
so<00:03:43.049> let's<00:03:43.230> try<00:03:43.469> the<00:03:43.530> whole<00:03:43.799> pattern<00:03:44.159> slowly
