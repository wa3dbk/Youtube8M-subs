00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
device and how dangerous the situation

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.290 
device and how dangerous the situation
was<00:02:15.950> now<00:02:16.459> I've<00:02:16.610> suggested<00:02:16.760> if<00:02:17.120> you<00:02:17.209> were

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
was now I've suggested if you were

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.210 
was now I've suggested if you were
holding<00:02:17.450> on<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.870> that<00:02:18.020> and<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.920> scuttling

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
holding on to that and the scuttling

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.850 
holding on to that and the scuttling
charge<00:02:19.459> operated<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:21.140> experience<00:02:21.650> of<00:02:21.770> that

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
charge operated the experience of that

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.380 
charge operated the experience of that
would<00:02:22.070> be<00:02:22.220> probably<00:02:22.640> similar<00:02:22.850> of<00:02:23.090> trying<00:02:23.330> to

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
would be probably similar of trying to
