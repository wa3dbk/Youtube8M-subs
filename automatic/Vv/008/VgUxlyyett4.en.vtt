collection<00:02:26.249> that<00:02:26.400> are<00:02:26.430> long<00:02:26.700> accumulated<00:02:27.480> I

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
collection that are long accumulated I

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.929 
collection that are long accumulated I
would<00:02:28.079> say<00:02:28.260> all<00:02:28.469> of<00:02:28.499> them<00:02:28.769> except<00:02:29.400> for<00:02:29.609> the<00:02:29.730> gas

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
would say all of them except for the gas

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.530 
would say all of them except for the gas
masks<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.870> was<00:02:31.019> way<00:02:31.200> before<00:02:31.379> me<00:02:32.359> he<00:02:33.359> was<00:02:33.510> very

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
masks that was way before me he was very

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.209 
masks that was way before me he was very
curious<00:02:33.900> about<00:02:34.079> people<00:02:34.829> about<00:02:35.159> different

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
cultures and so in collecting what's

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.670 
cultures and so in collecting what's
important<00:02:39.299> is<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.840> collect<00:02:40.139> objects

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
important is that you collect objects

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.410 
important is that you collect objects
that<00:02:40.859> were<00:02:41.099> actually<00:02:41.489> used<00:02:41.700> in<00:02:41.879> the<00:02:41.969> culture

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
that were actually used in the culture

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.080 
that were actually used in the culture
that<00:02:42.629> was<00:02:43.019> very<00:02:43.260> important<00:02:43.769> for<00:02:43.920> among<00:02:44.250> these

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
that was very important for among these

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.309 
that was very important for among these
masks<00:02:45.420> for<00:02:45.599> example<00:02:45.900> which<00:02:46.019> were<00:02:46.139> quite

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
masks for example which were quite

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.470 
masks for example which were quite
extraordinary<00:02:46.680> these<00:02:47.010> are<00:02:47.189> Chinese<00:02:48.000> death

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
extraordinary these are Chinese death

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.809 
extraordinary these are Chinese death
masks<00:02:49.019> and<00:02:49.200> they're<00:02:49.769> in<00:02:49.950> actually<00:02:50.430> in<00:02:50.519> bronze

masks and they're in actually in bronze

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.119 
masks and they're in actually in bronze
but<00:02:51.090> they're<00:02:51.239> so<00:02:51.569> old<00:02:51.870> that<00:02:52.230> they're<00:02:52.709> almost

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
but they're so old that they're almost

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:54.979

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.400 

well<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:18.330> was<00:03:18.510> really<00:03:18.720> difficult<00:03:18.989> because

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
well it was really difficult because

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.920 
well it was really difficult because
there<00:03:19.739> are<00:03:19.800> so<00:03:20.069> many<00:03:20.130> records<00:03:20.550> but<00:03:21.030> one<00:03:21.630> part

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
there are so many records but one part

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.930 
there are so many records but one part
it<00:03:22.140> was<00:03:22.380> a<00:03:22.410> part<00:03:23.099> of<00:03:23.220> this<00:03:23.340> collection<00:03:23.670> I<00:03:23.910> have

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
it was a part of this collection I have

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.410 
it was a part of this collection I have
that<00:03:24.330> is<00:03:24.560> covers<00:03:25.560> with<00:03:25.800> in<00:03:26.459> a<00:03:26.610> way<00:03:26.790> related<00:03:27.239> to

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420
