to<00:00:30.750> be<00:00:30.869> like<00:00:31.109> more<00:00:31.560> like<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.769> it's<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.309> horse

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
to be like more like a it's a horse

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.150 
to be like more like a it's a horse
trail<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.420> horses<00:00:34.290> are<00:00:34.380> loud<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.800> entire

trail that horses are loud on the entire

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.430 
trail that horses are loud on the entire
thing<00:00:35.489> unlike<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.030> 80<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:37.110> they<00:00:37.200> have<00:00:37.320> to

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
thing unlike the 80 so they have to

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.830 
thing unlike the 80 so they have to
grade<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.739> differently<00:00:38.250> if<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.480> thought<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
grade it differently if you thought the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.290 
grade it differently if you thought the
18<00:00:40.200> was<00:00:40.350> hard<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.160> you'll<00:00:41.309> think<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.640> PCT<00:00:42.149> is

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
18 was hard and you'll think the PCT is

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.360 
18 was hard and you'll think the PCT is
easy<00:00:42.629> because<00:00:43.379> you're<00:00:43.920> not<00:00:44.100> climbing

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
easy because you're not climbing

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.860 
easy because you're not climbing
straight<00:00:44.820> up<00:00:45.000> mountains<00:00:45.390> or<00:00:45.510> anything<00:00:45.840> like

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
straight up mountains or anything like

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.860 
straight up mountains or anything like
that<00:00:46.020> it's<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.649> gradual<00:00:47.250> gradual<00:00:48.090> inclines<00:00:48.629> out

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that it's a gradual gradual inclines out

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.720 
that it's a gradual gradual inclines out
there<00:00:49.079> it's<00:00:49.230> really<00:00:49.530> nice<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.739> can<00:00:50.100> cover<00:00:50.340> a

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
there it's really nice you can cover a

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.080 
there it's really nice you can cover a
lot<00:00:50.910> more<00:00:51.149> miles<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.870> day<00:00:52.250> on<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.399> 80<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.789> was

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.820 
to 35 plus depending on the terrain most
people<00:01:09.720> out<00:01:09.840> there<00:01:09.990> going<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.409> lot<00:01:10.560> lighter

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
people out there going a lot lighter

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.740 
people out there going a lot lighter
weight<00:01:11.130> out<00:01:11.340> there<00:01:11.549> too<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:12.420> don't<00:01:12.570> have<00:01:12.689> to

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
weight out there too you don't have to

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.630 
weight out there too you don't have to
worry<00:01:12.930> as<00:01:13.049> much<00:01:13.140> about<00:01:13.320> rain<00:01:13.860> gear<00:01:14.159> out<00:01:14.369> there

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
worry as much about rain gear out there

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.630 
worry as much about rain gear out there
because<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.060> never<00:01:15.210> really<00:01:15.479> rains<00:01:16.640> pretty

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640
