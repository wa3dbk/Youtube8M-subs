00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.720
 How are you 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:28.749
 I am also 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:31.990
 It became inferior 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.730
 It's here 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.730
 Continued 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.020
 Both are open victory 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.240
 I took over 3 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.240
 I made my dream come true 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.760
 Instead of that 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.330
 Titanium with your favorite people 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.330
 I swore for months 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.580
 It is born 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.340
 I would definitely like it more than before 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.340
 I have not been talking for a long time 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.290
 But I ran away 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.510
 I have been watching for a long time 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.010
 It has become magnificent 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.150
 We established in the same month 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.510
 I heard on the ground near the city 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.440
 every day 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.440
 Someday I just got hold 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.460
 The event was impossible 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.800
 job hunting 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.710
 I did my best 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.600
 After all there is also delivery 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.780
 I was seized 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.900
 I finally decided on it recently 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.540
 Small office representative 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.210
 recycle shop 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.940
 There is only a place there 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.060
 Why is it in this city 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.060
 I can not go to the second 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.190
 last year 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.990
 I was talking about this 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.310
 It seemed like how 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.310
 How it was 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.869
 One battle before the break 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.209
 That is an explanation 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.209
 Not know 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.049
 All the while 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.509
 It is the owner of the whole country 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:26.579
 I've been in the same place all the time 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.579
 Further 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:34.649
 I deviate to the O My News side 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:37.649
 From passerby 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.889
 I think it is better 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:45.399
 Profitability lineup 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:46.439
 Expected 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:47.769
 Answered it 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.689
 It should have been obtained this time 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.689
 What does this mean to various patients and previous patients? 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:02.809
 Outlook to ask questions 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:04.469
 From Tokyo 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:07.469
 It is a big difference for me 

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:11.799
 How do I do it 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.799
 The station affected at full power 

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:37.839
 Because my boss or senior 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:04.729
 Afghan southern cup 

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:14.639
 Brazil representative
