00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Hello everyone and welcome to the channel 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.730
 cut youtube that james the day of 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.040
 Today I'm going to give you some tips for 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.050
 improve the performance of your computer 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.150
 be it the one in the office the one in the house the 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.900
 gamer or whatever you want and the 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.940
 first tip 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.130
 is going to be a tip that will cause controversy 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.830
 and everyone is going to tell me that 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.600
 We knew how to update your hardware and good 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.130
 clear update the hardware is going to 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.840
 improve performance whether that 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.090
 we update hard drives card 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.160
 video processor ram memory and so on 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.960
 always update your good hardware you 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.620
 will give extra performance to your 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.710
 computer the second tip is the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.680
 cleaning of the test components in the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.820
 case of video cards are reached 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.280
 to fill with dust lint and always 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.379
 good you have to have a certain care and 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.969
 maintenance of the components and not 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.449
 nothing else that also the filters of 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.239
 powder from our cabinet 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:01:00.329
 heatsink all heatsinks 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.129
 processor the aluminum is important 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.290
 have them clean because what happens if not 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.659
 we have them clean, good, we start 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.700
 generate a little heat the equipment and 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.759
 when the machine heats up the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.040
 low performance because for the same 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.320
 type to compensate for that extra heat 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.800
 good has to lower the performance of 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.720
 equipment not to overheat and the 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.520
 following tip applies to all those 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.060
 who use a mechanical hard drive as their 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.130
 main hard disk and especially for 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.890
 that is, they have filled it more than once 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.979
 you fill it, you delete files, you return it 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.899
 to fill in again to delete files and is 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.159
 defragment the hard drive and good that 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.659
 it's extra to mention the hard drive 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.210
 practically defragment the disk 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.520
 hard is to make the hard drive to like 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.440
 of the files as they go usually 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.560
 when we are filling the hard drive or 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.590
 mechanic and we put different files 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.520
 good when we delete one and put another 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.619
 and all that space 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.630
 usually what the computer does is 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.909
 put the files in different 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.780
 sectors then sometimes to find 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.909
 a file or two rather two files 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.619
 in the same category, the album 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.780
 hard have to do a more search 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.209
 wide and this greatly reduces the 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.280
 team performance and the next you 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.470
 it has a lot to do with maintenance 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.280
 of the operating system and is to review the 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.099
 virus if we have viruses and 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.660
 clean them and also spyware and everything 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.760
 the malware that we have this sometimes 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.670
 cause the performance of our 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.310
 equipment diminish pretty and good that's 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.870
 something that practically has to be done 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.310
 you must constantly have a lot 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.650
 beware that internet pages of 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.170
 we entered and good to do a scan with the 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.900
 antivirus or with the anti malware that 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.970
 we have installed because it will give us a 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.440
 benefit that is going to be that ours 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.420
 doctor will not be clean and will not 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.910
 have files running in second 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.280
 flat that are useless processes the 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.000
 next tip has to do a bit with 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.500
 the previous one and it applies a lot to 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.690
 branded computers and is to eliminate 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.010
 all those 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.770
 unusable for example if we buy 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.900
 all a computer hp dell come with 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.670
 background processes that are 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.650
 practically unusable that in 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.260
 actually we will not occupy as per 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.290
 example the technical support assistant 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:22.370
 from hp or dell 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.439
 the hp closer and things like that 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.150
 and countless programs that come 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:28.459
 preinstalled me what always 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.379
 I recommend is to uninstall all these 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.530
 programs can do it to me by entering 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:36.859
 control panel and uninstall these 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.569
 same processes on your own and the 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.579
 next tip is for those who 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.939
 they also use mechanical hard drive and it's 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:46.790
 have well accommodated and archived all 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:48.469
 your files if they have good photos 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.239
 try to have all the photos in one 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:51.950
 same folder all the videos in one 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.799
 same folder all the music in one 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.260
 same folder and if the performance of your 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:59.150
 team is very slow also remove all 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.530
 those files that are on the desktop 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.870
 the fewer files they have in the 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.689
 desktop is faster the computer 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.659
 and well these were some tips for 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:10.159
 increase the performance of your team 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:11.720
 I hope you liked this video if 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:13.609

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.079
 liked thumbs down remember
