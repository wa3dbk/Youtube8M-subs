00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
overall it's worth it especially for the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.270 
overall it's worth it especially for the

out<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.100> comics<00:01:29.430> for<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.640> long<00:01:29.850> time<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.509> I

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
out of the comics for a long time so I

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.870 
out of the comics for a long time so I
kind<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:30.990> missed<00:01:31.170> out<00:01:31.320> on<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.770> point<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:32.759> time

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
kind of missed out on this point in time

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.460 
kind of missed out on this point in time
I<00:01:33.090> guess<00:01:33.270> but<00:01:34.229> uh<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:35.390> up<00:01:36.390> until<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.750> got<00:01:37.290> this

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
I guess but uh I up until I got this

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.510 
I guess but uh I up until I got this
figure<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.829> read<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.130> back<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
figure and read the back of the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.060 
figure and read the back of the
packaging<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.470> thought<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:40.680> was<00:01:40.860> actually

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
packaging I thought this was actually

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.859 
packaging I thought this was actually
magneto<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.180> I've<00:01:42.299> heard<00:01:42.450> other<00:01:42.600> people<00:01:42.630> talk

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
magneto and I've heard other people talk

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.249 
magneto and I've heard other people talk
about<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.619> was<00:01:43.649> magneto<00:01:44.600> but<00:01:45.600> if

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
about it that it was magneto but if

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.230 
about it that it was magneto but if
that's<00:01:46.470> what<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.130> think<00:01:47.369> then<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.759> think

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
that's what you think then I think

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.670 
that's what you think then I think
you're<00:01:48.390> wrong<00:01:48.540> because<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.049> package<00:01:49.380> it

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
you're wrong because on the package it

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.120 
you're wrong because on the package it
says<00:01:50.520> otherwise<00:01:51.320> but<00:01:52.320> if<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.740> couldn't<00:01:52.979> read

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
says otherwise but if you couldn't read

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.389 
says otherwise but if you couldn't read
it<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.460> earlier<00:01:53.850> when<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.740> had<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:55.920> there<00:01:56.159> if

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
it it earlier when I had it on there if

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.760 
it it earlier when I had it on there if
you<00:01:56.490> can<00:01:56.670> pause<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.719> read<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:57.930> then<00:01:58.290> I'd

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
you can pause it and read it then I'd

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.399 
you can pause it and read it then I'd
suggest<00:01:59.100> looking<00:01:59.880> it<00:01:59.969> up<00:02:00.090> on<00:02:00.409> Wikipedia

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
suggest looking it up on Wikipedia

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.520 
suggest looking it up on Wikipedia
because<00:02:02.040> soon<00:02:02.939> kinda<00:02:03.149> interesting<00:02:03.570> would

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
because soon kinda interesting would

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.780 
because soon kinda interesting would
have<00:02:04.619> been<00:02:04.710> nice<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:04.950> read<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.640> book

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
seemed like a little bit of would have

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.750 
seemed like a little bit of would have
been<00:02:07.200> kind<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.469> cool<00:02:08.569> but<00:02:09.569> uh<00:02:10.489> does<00:02:11.489> kind<00:02:11.730> of

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
been kind of cool but uh does kind of

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.090 
been kind of cool but uh does kind of
look<00:02:11.879> like<00:02:11.940> Magneto<00:02:12.450> though

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
look like Magneto though

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.800 
look like Magneto though

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
a little bit anyways onto the figure

this<00:04:08.120> was<00:04:08.330> probably<00:04:08.510> a<00:04:08.750> previous<00:04:09.140> mold<00:04:10.600> but

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
this was probably a previous mold but

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.890 
this was probably a previous mold but
double<00:04:12.170> jointed<00:04:12.440> knees<00:04:12.760> and<00:04:13.760> swivel<00:04:14.450> at<00:04:14.600> the
