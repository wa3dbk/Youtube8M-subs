00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
hear this alright first test the RAM for

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.320 
hear this alright first test the RAM for
the<00:01:35.300> system<00:01:35.660> and<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.259> RAM<00:01:36.440> past<00:01:37.060> so<00:01:38.060> it's<00:01:38.180> hit

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
the system and the RAM past so it's hit

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.620 
the system and the RAM past so it's hit
a<00:01:38.540> to<00:01:38.600> go<00:01:38.810> to<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:38.960> next<00:01:39.140> step<00:01:40.390> screen<00:01:41.390> test

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
a to go to the next step screen test

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.600 
a to go to the next step screen test
there's<00:01:42.619> different<00:01:42.979> patterns<00:01:43.280> that<00:01:43.490> will

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
there's different patterns that will
