I<00:00:00.390> think<00:00:00.719> today<00:00:01.620> I'm<00:00:01.860> I'm<00:00:02.399> going<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.760> show<00:00:02.970> you

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
I think today I'm I'm going to show you

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.900 
I think today I'm I'm going to show you
that<00:00:03.389> it's<00:00:03.570> possible<00:00:03.629> for<00:00:04.220> one<00:00:05.220> piece<00:00:05.730> of

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
that it's possible for one piece of

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.259 
that it's possible for one piece of
paper<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.990> cut<00:00:07.589> another<00:00:08.040> piece<00:00:08.160> of<00:00:08.370> paper<00:00:08.670> so

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
paper to cut another piece of paper so

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.120 
paper to cut another piece of paper so
here<00:00:09.420> we<00:00:09.510> go<00:00:09.660> I've<00:00:09.809> got<00:00:09.990> two<00:00:10.170> pieces<00:00:10.500> of<00:00:10.679> a4

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
here we go I've got two pieces of a4

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.190 
here we go I've got two pieces of a4
paper<00:00:11.160> so<00:00:11.670> just<00:00:11.880> put<00:00:12.059> one<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.450> one<00:00:12.599> side<00:00:12.870> at<00:00:13.110> the

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
paper so just put one to one side at the

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.470 
paper so just put one to one side at the
moment<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:14.099> hopefully<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:14.759> can<00:00:14.910> see<00:00:15.179> there

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
moment and hopefully you can see there

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.689 
moment and hopefully you can see there
on<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:16.529> one<00:00:16.830> sheet<00:00:17.250> I've<00:00:18.090> drawn<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:19.699> line

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
on that one sheet I've drawn a line

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.790 
on that one sheet I've drawn a line
that's<00:00:21.539> probably<00:00:21.900> just<00:00:22.140> one<00:00:22.529> or<00:00:22.619> two

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
that's probably just one or two

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.650 
that's probably just one or two
millimeters<00:00:23.070> from<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.939> edge<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.300> parallel

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
millimeters from the edge of parallel

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.230 
millimeters from the edge of parallel
line<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.199> that's<00:00:26.099> going<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.369> be<00:00:26.430> my<00:00:26.580> guide<00:00:26.789> for

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
line and that's going to be my guide for

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.950 
line and that's going to be my guide for
for<00:00:27.779> making<00:00:28.109> this<00:00:29.099> little<00:00:29.789> card<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.689> paper

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
for making this little card a paper

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.900 
for making this little card a paper
cutter<00:00:31.260> that's<00:00:31.949> what<00:00:32.189> I'm<00:00:32.279> going<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.520> do<00:00:32.700> is

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
cutter that's what I'm going to do is

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.780 
cutter that's what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:00:33.059> going<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.300> push<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.960> edge<00:00:34.200> over<00:00:35.130> fold<00:00:35.670> it

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
I'm going to push this edge over fold it

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.530 
I'm going to push this edge over fold it
over<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.180> line<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.050> up<00:00:37.520> with<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.579> line<00:00:39.270> that

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
over and line it up with that line that

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.990 
over and line it up with that line that
I've<00:00:39.660> drawn<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.850> fold<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.000> away<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:44.000> yeah

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
I've drawn and fold that away and yeah

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.680 
I've drawn and fold that away and yeah
and<00:00:46.190> take<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.340> edge<00:00:47.489> again<00:00:47.820> fold<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.510> over

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
and take that edge again fold it over

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.510 
and take that edge again fold it over
and<00:00:49.250> line<00:00:50.250> up<00:00:50.489> again<00:00:51.620> with<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.829> line<00:00:53.340> that

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
and line up again with that line that

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.439 
and line up again with that line that
I've<00:00:53.640> drawn<00:00:54.949> and<00:00:55.949> we'll<00:00:56.070> turn<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.399> over<00:00:56.489> I'll

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
I've drawn and we'll turn it over I'll

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.029 
I've drawn and we'll turn it over I'll
put<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> line<00:00:57.840> drawn<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.320> other<00:00:58.440> side<00:00:58.710> a

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
put a line drawn on the other side a

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.560 
put a line drawn on the other side a
couple<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.579> mills<00:00:59.760> same<00:00:59.969> distance<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.510> a

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
couple of mills same distance in a

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.889 
couple of mills same distance in a
couple<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.899> millimeters<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:02.239> we'll<00:01:03.239> turn

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
couple of millimeters in and we'll turn

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.070 
couple of millimeters in and we'll turn
that<00:01:03.960> over<00:01:04.439> again<00:01:06.080> and<00:01:07.080> line<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.619> up<00:01:09.020> with<00:01:10.020> that

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
that over again and line it up with that

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.010 
that over again and line it up with that
one<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.710> what<00:01:10.830> we've<00:01:10.950> created<00:01:11.189> there<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:12.020> all

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
one so what we've created there is all

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.510 
one so what we've created there is all
that<00:01:13.049> folding<00:01:13.409> we've<00:01:13.710> got<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> handle<00:01:14.310> there

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
that folding we've got a handle there

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.520 
that folding we've got a handle there
and<00:01:14.820> we<00:01:15.270> left<00:01:15.450> with<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> little<00:01:15.900> bit<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.080> paper<00:01:16.409> a

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
and we left with a little bit of paper a

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.530 
and we left with a little bit of paper a
little<00:01:16.650> bit<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.920> sharp<00:01:17.159> paper<00:01:17.460> or<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.330> little

little bit of sharp paper or a little

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.609 
little bit of sharp paper or a little
bit<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.869> edge<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.229> paper

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
bit of the edge of the paper

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.940 
bit of the edge of the paper
sticking<00:01:20.400> out<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.200> you've<00:01:22.200> got<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.439> be<00:01:22.500> careful

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
over that edge of that paper because say

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.480 
over that edge of that paper because say
you<00:01:27.570> could<00:01:27.900> cut<00:01:28.140> yourself<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.890> hurt<00:01:29.070> yourself

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
paper cut in the past you'll know how

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.910 
paper cut in the past you'll know how
much<00:01:32.970> they<00:01:33.240> heard<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:33.750> be<00:01:33.900> very<00:01:34.079> careful<00:01:34.500> at

well
you<00:01:53.549> just<00:01:53.880> run<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.979> backwards<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.159> forwards

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.120 

yep

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.650 

careful<00:02:03.760> you<00:02:03.850> run<00:02:03.970> that<00:02:04.090> backwards<00:02:04.510> and

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
careful you run that backwards and

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.720 
careful you run that backwards and
forwards<00:02:04.960> on<00:02:05.050> the<00:02:05.140> piece<00:02:05.350> of<00:02:05.380> paper<00:02:05.980> and<00:02:06.610> you

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
forwards on the piece of paper and you

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.060 
forwards on the piece of paper and you
might<00:02:06.940> be<00:02:07.090> able<00:02:07.300> to<00:02:07.390> see<00:02:07.600> there<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.950> we've

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
might be able to see there that we've

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.760 
might be able to see there that we've
made<00:02:09.310> a<00:02:09.340> tiny<00:02:09.759> cut<00:02:10.180> on<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.200> edge<00:02:11.350> of<00:02:11.590> that

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
made a tiny cut on the edge of that

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.550 
made a tiny cut on the edge of that
paper<00:02:12.070> so<00:02:12.690> we'll<00:02:13.690> have<00:02:13.840> a<00:02:13.870> go<00:02:14.050> I<00:02:14.080> keep<00:02:14.380> going

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
paper so we'll have a go I keep going

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.010 
paper so we'll have a go I keep going
about<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:15.430> spot<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:16.540> we're<00:02:16.720> running

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
about that spot and we're running

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.210 
about that spot and we're running
backwards<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.590> forwards

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
backwards and forwards

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.510 
backwards and forwards
I<00:02:22.650> guess<00:02:23.650> we're<00:02:23.860> making<00:02:24.130> some<00:02:24.280> great<00:02:24.400> progress

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
I guess we're making some great progress

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.190 
I guess we're making some great progress
now<00:02:25.890> here<00:02:26.890> we<00:02:27.010> go<00:02:27.160> we've<00:02:27.340> made<00:02:27.520> a<00:02:27.550> big<00:02:27.900> big<00:02:28.900> cut

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
now here we go we've made a big big cut

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.120 
now here we go we've made a big big cut
there<00:02:29.640> into<00:02:30.640> into<00:02:31.060> this<00:02:31.150> piece<00:02:31.330> of<00:02:31.450> paper<00:02:35.130> and

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
there into into this piece of paper and

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.560 
there into into this piece of paper and
I<00:02:36.220> keep<00:02:36.400> going<00:02:36.610> again<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.470> we're<00:02:39.360> chewing<00:02:40.360> the

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
I keep going again and we're chewing the

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.710 
I keep going again and we're chewing the
way<00:02:40.690> out<00:02:40.840> up<00:02:40.959> there<00:02:41.280> there<00:02:42.280> we<00:02:42.400> go<00:02:42.580> we've<00:02:43.420> made

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
way out up there there we go we've made

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.690 
way out up there there we go we've made
a<00:02:43.750> big<00:02:44.050> cut<00:02:44.350> in<00:02:44.560> that<00:02:44.830> piece<00:02:45.070> of<00:02:45.220> paper<00:02:45.340> so

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
a big cut in that piece of paper so

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.900 
a big cut in that piece of paper so
therefore<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:47.110> is<00:02:47.290> possible<00:02:47.490> to<00:02:48.490> use<00:02:48.520> one

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
therefore it is possible to use one

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.500 
therefore it is possible to use one
piece<00:02:49.150> of<00:02:49.330> paper<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:51.400> cut<00:02:51.610> another<00:02:52.390> piece

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
piece of paper to to cut another piece

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.930 
piece of paper to to cut another piece
of<00:02:52.690> paper
