the first place she needed to be that

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.940 
the first place she needed to be that
kind<00:04:14.299> of<00:04:14.420> counterbalance<00:04:14.810> so<00:04:15.530> that<00:04:15.709> people

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
kind of counterbalance so that people

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.800
