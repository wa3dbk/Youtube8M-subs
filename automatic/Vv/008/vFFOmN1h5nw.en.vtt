00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:09.410
 Today, I'll tell you how you like your ipad 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.410
 Turning into a mac could be a lot of fun 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.350
 yes as already mentioned it should be around 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.990
 the ipad and i want to show you how he does 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.990
 just let the ipad look like 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.960
 like it's a mac you need for it 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.850
 following tricks or apps first 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.399
 Of course you need the dreamboard 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.760
 that's really important because 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.550
 we will install four teams right away 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.430
 not for winter sports but for 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.890
 dreamboard what is the good thing about report 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.360
 you do not always have to bring ries 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.379
 and yes you can just go in and 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.020
 go out and switch between films yes 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.360
 after the installation of dreamboard 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:01.859
 there is a little icon here and 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:06.240
 right after that we invite ourselves 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.799
 shut it down and I'll show 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.630
 Just do it all again 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.439
 means I open dreamboard for that 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.450
 the whole thing is expat age the 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.180

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.340

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.180
 I'm not sure right now 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:38.790
 So the first time takes of course 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:41.520
 a little longer ok so here you can see me 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:46.229
