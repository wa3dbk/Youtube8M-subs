00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.280 
today I'm going to show you how to
replace<00:00:02.399> a<00:00:02.520> ram<00:00:02.820> in<00:00:02.850> a<00:00:03.240> laptop<00:00:03.689> computer<00:00:03.870> just

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
replace a ram in a laptop computer just

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.769 
replace a ram in a laptop computer just
like<00:00:04.500> this<00:00:04.650> one<00:00:04.859> in<00:00:05.700> general<00:00:05.910> laptops<00:00:06.480> aren't

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
like this one in general laptops aren't

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.450 
like this one in general laptops aren't
exactly<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.259> same<00:00:07.500> some<00:00:08.010> of<00:00:08.069> them<00:00:08.189> can<00:00:08.370> be

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
exactly the same some of them can be

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.790 
exactly the same some of them can be
incredibly<00:00:08.849> different<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.389> different<00:00:09.769> so<00:00:10.769> I

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
incredibly different and different so I

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.320 
incredibly different and different so I
would<00:00:10.980> recommend<00:00:11.130> getting<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.880> service

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
would recommend getting a service

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.720 
would recommend getting a service
manuals<00:00:12.840> per<00:00:13.110> your<00:00:13.290> specific<00:00:13.769> laptop<00:00:14.190> so<00:00:14.700> you

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
manuals per your specific laptop so you

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.730 
manuals per your specific laptop so you
know<00:00:14.880> exactly<00:00:15.210> what<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.660> do<00:00:15.780> but<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.500> video

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
know exactly what to do but this video

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.710 
know exactly what to do but this video
is<00:00:16.830> going<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:16.980> show<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.190> on<00:00:17.460> average<00:00:18.000> what<00:00:18.510> Ram

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
is going to show you on average what Ram

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.269 
is going to show you on average what Ram
looks<00:00:18.990> like<00:00:19.260> how<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.590> get<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:19.980> out<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.130> the

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
looks like how to get it out of the

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.679 
looks like how to get it out of the
laptop<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.789> how<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:20.939> put<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.240> into<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.510> laptop

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
laptop and how to put it into a laptop

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.750 
laptop and how to put it into a laptop
so<00:00:22.939> yours<00:00:23.939> might<00:00:24.000> not<00:00:24.180> be<00:00:24.390> exactly<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.840> same

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
so yours might not be exactly the same

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.920 
so yours might not be exactly the same
exactly<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.880> same<00:00:27.090> but<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.510> general<00:00:27.840> idea

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
exactly the same but the general idea

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.669 
exactly the same but the general idea
should<00:00:28.380> be<00:00:28.439> very<00:00:28.980> very<00:00:29.250> similar<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:30.560> with<00:00:31.560> this

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
should be very very similar so with this

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.979 
should be very very similar so with this
type<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.980> laptop<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> Inspiron<00:00:33.329> 17<00:00:33.840> are

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
type of laptop this is a Inspiron 17 are

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.580 
type of laptop this is a Inspiron 17 are
a<00:00:34.410> special<00:00:35.130> edition<00:00:36.140> you<00:00:37.140> can<00:00:37.170> see<00:00:37.440> that

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
a special edition you can see that

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.580 
a special edition you can see that
there's<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.829> big<00:00:38.160> flap<00:00:38.489> on<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.820> bottom<00:00:39.300> and

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
there's a big flap on the bottom and

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.860 
there's a big flap on the bottom and
this<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.649> where<00:00:41.370> my<00:00:41.550> ram<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.120> actually<00:00:42.570> under

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
this is where my ram is actually under

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.330 
this is where my ram is actually under
and<00:00:43.050> others<00:00:43.620> they're<00:00:43.800> going<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.950> have<00:00:44.070> several

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
and others they're going to have several

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.459 
and others they're going to have several
little<00:00:45.030> flaps<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.629> usually<00:00:46.200> should<00:00:46.320> have<00:00:46.440> a

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
little flaps and usually should have a

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.930 
little flaps and usually should have a
picture<00:00:46.829> next<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.280> saying<00:00:47.430> what's<00:00:47.670> under

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
picture next to it saying what's under

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.930 
picture next to it saying what's under
it<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.649> in<00:00:49.649> some<00:00:49.829> cases<00:00:50.010> there's<00:00:50.280> no<00:00:50.489> flaps<00:00:50.760> at

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
it and in some cases there's no flaps at

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.549 
it and in some cases there's no flaps at
all<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.719> have<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.899> take<00:00:52.020> out<00:00:52.170> all<00:00:52.379> the

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
all and you have to take out all the

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.930 
all and you have to take out all the
bottom<00:00:52.800> screws<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.309> then<00:00:53.430> flip<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.699> over<00:00:53.820> and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
bottom screws and then flip it over and

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.000 
bottom screws and then flip it over and
take<00:00:54.210> out<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.449> keyboard<00:00:54.840> that's<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.530> huge<00:00:55.770> mess

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
take out the keyboard that's a huge mess

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.040 
take out the keyboard that's a huge mess
then<00:00:56.670> you'll<00:00:56.910> definitely<00:00:57.149> need<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.690> service

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
then you'll definitely need a service

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.479 
then you'll definitely need a service
manual<00:00:58.260> for<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.739> know<00:00:58.859> which<00:00:59.070> screws<00:00:59.340> you

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
manual for that to know which screws you

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.150 
manual for that to know which screws you
have<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.730> take<00:00:59.879> out<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.300> all<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.469> but<00:01:01.469> most

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
have to take out and all that but most

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.280 
have to take out and all that but most
laptops<00:01:02.489> nowadays<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> flap<00:01:04.049> on<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
laptops nowadays have a flap on the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.550 
laptops nowadays have a flap on the
bottom<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:04.949> easy<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.400> take<00:01:05.549> out<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.850> RAM

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
bottom so it's easy to take out the RAM

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.730 
bottom so it's easy to take out the RAM
so<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:08.520> general<00:01:08.909> when<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.720> have<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.439> laptop

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
so in general when you have the laptop

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.630 
so in general when you have the laptop
flipped<00:01:10.979> over<00:01:11.100> you're<00:01:11.280> going<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.430> need<00:01:11.580> to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
flipped over you're going to need to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.370 
flipped over you're going to need to
take<00:01:11.729> out<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.210> screws<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> correct<00:01:13.110> flap

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
take out the screws on the correct flap

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.340 
take out the screws on the correct flap
in<00:01:13.770> my<00:01:14.010> case<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.909> flap<00:01:15.119> when<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.170> take

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
in my case is this flap when you take

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.660 
in my case is this flap when you take
them<00:01:16.500> out<00:01:16.560> we'll<00:01:16.710> be<00:01:16.740> very<00:01:16.979> careful<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.549> use

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
them out we'll be very careful to use

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.080 
them out we'll be very careful to use
the<00:01:17.790> right<00:01:17.939> size<00:01:18.180> bit<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:19.580> actually<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:20.909> as

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
the right size bit and actually so as

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.210 
the right size bit and actually so as
I'm<00:01:21.509> getting<00:01:21.780> hitting<00:01:21.990> myself<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.439> take<00:01:23.070> out

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
I'm getting hitting myself to take out

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.190 
I'm getting hitting myself to take out
the<00:01:23.369> lap<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.759> hard<00:01:23.939> drive<00:01:24.119> first<00:01:24.390> turn<00:01:25.110> on

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
the lap of the hard drive first turn on

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.350 
the lap of the hard drive first turn on
hard<00:01:25.470> drive<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.830> battery<00:01:26.130> first<00:01:26.400> remove<00:01:27.240> all

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
hard drive the battery first remove all

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.300 
hard drive the battery first remove all
external<00:01:27.780> power<00:01:28.049> shut<00:01:28.409> down<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.680> laptop<00:01:29.100> and

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
external power shut down the laptop and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.020 
external power shut down the laptop and
take<00:01:29.820> out<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.090> battery<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.720> when<00:01:31.170> you're

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
take out the battery so that when you're

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.340 
take out the battery so that when you're
taking<00:01:33.030> out<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.360> RAM<00:01:33.479> nothing<00:01:33.869> happens

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
taking out the RAM nothing happens

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.130 
taking out the RAM nothing happens
basically<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.790> just<00:01:36.420> remember<00:01:36.750> from<00:01:37.020> all

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
basically so just remember from all

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.760 
basically so just remember from all
power<00:01:37.500> sources<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.400> then<00:01:38.970> also<00:01:39.680> there's<00:01:40.680> a

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
power sources and then also there's a

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.770 
power sources and then also there's a
concern<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.240> electrostatic<00:01:42.240> discharge<00:01:42.630> from

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
concern of electrostatic discharge from

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.940 
concern of electrostatic discharge from
your<00:01:42.899> hands<00:01:43.049> which<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.259> basically<00:01:43.680> static

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
your hands which is basically static

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.350 
your hands which is basically static
shock<00:01:44.280> like<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.700> can<00:01:44.850> think<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.119> when<00:01:45.240> you

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
shock like you can think of when you

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.090 
shock like you can think of when you
shock<00:01:45.990> somebody<00:01:46.229> after<00:01:46.560> running<00:01:46.740> out<00:01:46.890> after

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
shock somebody after running out after

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.069 
shock somebody after running out after
like<00:01:47.490> rubbing<00:01:47.790> your<00:01:47.850> feet<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> carpet<00:01:48.630> that

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
like rubbing your feet on a carpet that

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.660 
like rubbing your feet on a carpet that
can<00:01:49.290> damage<00:01:49.439> electrical<00:01:50.100> components<00:01:50.520> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
can damage electrical components the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.210 
can damage electrical components the
components<00:01:50.700> very<00:01:51.390> easily<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:52.159> usually<00:01:53.159> you

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
components very easily so usually you

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.499 
components very easily so usually you
should<00:01:53.369> touch<00:01:53.579> something<00:01:53.820> metal<00:01:54.210> before<00:01:54.329> you

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
should touch something metal before you

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.240 
should touch something metal before you
do<00:01:54.600> anything<00:01:54.840> with<00:01:55.049> computers<00:01:55.530> or<00:01:55.740> usually

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
do anything with computers or usually

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.800 
do anything with computers or usually
get<00:01:56.369> an<00:01:56.460> electrostatic

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
get an electrostatic

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.560 
get an electrostatic
band<00:01:58.469> for<00:01:58.619> your<00:01:58.740> arm<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:59.219> lot<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.090> people<00:02:00.299> swear

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
band for your arm a lot of people swear

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.389 
band for your arm a lot of people swear
by<00:02:00.600> those<00:02:00.930> I've<00:02:01.409> never<00:02:01.710> used<00:02:01.890> one<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.340> I've

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
by those I've never used one and I've

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.249 
by those I've never used one and I've
never<00:02:02.579> had<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.820> problem<00:02:03.090> but<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.960> could<00:02:04.110> be<00:02:04.229> the

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
never had a problem but you could be the

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.889 
never had a problem but you could be the
first<00:02:04.469> half<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.579> problem<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.149> I've<00:02:06.630> seen

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
first half of a problem that I've seen

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.809 
first half of a problem that I've seen
and<00:02:07.170> then<00:02:08.160> you're<00:02:08.280> going<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.429> try<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.670> plane

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
and then you're going to try and plane

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.070 
and then you're going to try and plane
it<00:02:08.940> on<00:02:09.030> me<00:02:09.149> I'm<00:02:09.390> going<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.599> tell<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.929> I

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
it on me I'm going to tell you that I

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.100 
it on me I'm going to tell you that I
warned<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.220> would<00:02:11.730> recommend<00:02:11.879> an<00:02:12.330> ESD

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
warned you so I would recommend an ESD

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.800 
warned you so I would recommend an ESD
strap<00:02:13.170> if<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:13.709> feel<00:02:14.129> uncomfortable<00:02:14.459> but<00:02:14.910> I've

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
strap if you feel uncomfortable but I've

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.369 
strap if you feel uncomfortable but I've
never<00:02:16.080> used<00:02:16.260> one<00:02:16.379> I've<00:02:16.800> been<00:02:16.920> okay<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:18.140> okay<00:02:19.140> so

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
never used one I've been okay so okay so

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:20.780 
never used one I've been okay so okay so
now<00:02:19.650> we<00:02:19.709> can<00:02:19.860> actually<00:02:20.160> start<00:02:20.400> getting<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.760> a

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
now we can actually start getting to a

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.150 
now we can actually start getting to a
ramp<00:02:21.530> you're<00:02:22.530> going<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.739> need<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:22.920> take<00:02:23.010> out

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
ramp you're going to need to take out

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.650 
ramp you're going to need to take out
the<00:02:23.280> screws<00:02:23.550> for<00:02:23.790> your<00:02:23.910> correct<00:02:24.150> flap<00:02:24.420> and

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
the screws for your correct flap and

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.170 
the screws for your correct flap and
don't<00:02:25.440> just<00:02:25.739> like<00:02:25.980> start<00:02:26.489> railing<00:02:26.849> on<00:02:26.940> them

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
don't just like start railing on them

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.790 
don't just like start railing on them
because<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.870> can<00:02:28.050> strip<00:02:28.349> the<00:02:28.379> screws<00:02:28.770> very

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
because you can strip the screws very

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.440 
because you can strip the screws very
easily<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.670> at<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:29.940> point<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.269> have<00:02:30.360> to

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
easily and at that point you have to

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.000 
easily and at that point you have to
drill<00:02:30.750> them<00:02:30.870> out<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.170> get<00:02:31.319> the<00:02:31.410> flap<00:02:31.620> out<00:02:31.800> and

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
drill them out to get the flap out and

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.130 
drill them out to get the flap out and
that's<00:02:32.580> just<00:02:32.910> giant<00:02:33.209> mess<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.510> that's<00:02:33.840> easier

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
that's just giant mess and that's easier

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.360 
that's just giant mess and that's easier
just<00:02:34.379> bring<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.680> your<00:02:34.860> local<00:02:35.040> computer

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
just bring it to your local computer

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.059 
just bring it to your local computer
shop<00:02:35.790> so<00:02:36.480> be<00:02:36.629> very<00:02:36.780> careful<00:02:37.050> use<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.590> bit<00:02:37.860> that

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
shop so be very careful use a bit that

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.540 
shop so be very careful use a bit that
fits<00:02:38.310> into<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.120> screw<00:02:40.080> very<00:02:40.260> well<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.650> then

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
fits into the screw very well and then

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.759 
fits into the screw very well and then
apply<00:02:41.849> quite<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.239> bit<00:02:42.420> of<00:02:42.540> direct<00:02:43.200> downward

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
apply quite a bit of direct downward

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.350 
apply quite a bit of direct downward
force<00:02:44.069> while<00:02:44.340> you're<00:02:44.459> doing<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.670> not<00:02:45.209> enough

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
force while you're doing it not enough

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.210 
force while you're doing it not enough
to<00:02:45.420> like<00:02:45.629> break<00:02:46.290> anything<00:02:46.590> but<00:02:46.920> enough<00:02:47.099> to

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
to like break anything but enough to

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.520 
to like break anything but enough to
really<00:02:47.400> give<00:02:47.849> it<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:47.970> firm<00:02:48.209> hold<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.690> then<00:02:49.290> turn

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
really give it a firm hold and then turn

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.839 
really give it a firm hold and then turn
it<00:02:49.560> slowly<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.190> make<00:02:50.310> sure<00:02:50.459> that<00:02:50.580> you're<00:02:50.730> not

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
it slowly and make sure that you're not

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.059 
it slowly and make sure that you're not
like<00:02:51.030> skipping<00:02:51.750> out<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.110> bolt<00:02:52.319> out<00:02:52.500> of

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
like skipping out of the bolt out of

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.250 
like skipping out of the bolt out of
like<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.489> threads<00:02:53.790> on<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:55.019> can<00:02:55.140> see

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
like the threads on it so you can see

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.910 
like the threads on it so you can see
that<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.440> can<00:02:56.000> turning<00:02:57.000> in<00:02:57.090> it's<00:02:57.269> pretty<00:02:57.420> easy

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
that I can turning in it's pretty easy

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.979 
that I can turning in it's pretty easy
and<00:02:58.920> when<00:02:59.849> you<00:02:59.940> put<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.180> back<00:03:00.239> in<00:03:00.300> don't<00:03:00.690> screw

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
and when you put it back in don't screw

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.509 
and when you put it back in don't screw
it<00:03:01.019> down<00:03:01.170> like<00:03:01.470> super<00:03:01.800> tight<00:03:02.010> because<00:03:02.340> then

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
it down like super tight because then

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:03.979 
it down like super tight because then
you'll<00:03:02.670> strip<00:03:02.909> it<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.150> next<00:03:03.360> time<00:03:03.510> taking<00:03:03.870> it

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
you'll strip it the next time taking it

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.720 
you'll strip it the next time taking it
out<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.319> you<00:03:04.680> can<00:03:04.800> strip<00:03:05.069> it<00:03:05.159> putting<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.580> in

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
out and you can strip it putting it in

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.930 
out and you can strip it putting it in
so<00:03:06.390> just<00:03:06.870> tighten<00:03:07.769> it<00:03:07.950> firmly<00:03:08.190> but<00:03:08.489> not<00:03:08.550> like

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
so just tighten it firmly but not like

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.089 
so just tighten it firmly but not like
you<00:03:09.330> don't<00:03:09.480> have<00:03:09.569> to<00:03:09.690> really<00:03:10.080> rail<00:03:10.800> it<00:03:10.980> in

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
you don't have to really rail it in

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.369 
you don't have to really rail it in
there<00:03:11.310> so<00:03:12.239> I<00:03:12.300> have<00:03:12.510> both<00:03:12.629> of<00:03:12.690> these<00:03:12.900> unscrewed

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
there so I have both of these unscrewed

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.100 
there so I have both of these unscrewed
now<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.769> an<00:03:14.580> East<00:03:14.849> flap<00:03:15.330> after<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:15.840> unscrew

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
now and an East flap after you unscrew

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.190 
now and an East flap after you unscrew
it<00:03:16.260> should<00:03:16.470> come<00:03:16.620> out<00:03:16.709> easily<00:03:16.890> so<00:03:17.640> if<00:03:17.849> you<00:03:18.239> have

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
it should come out easily so if you have

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.540 
it should come out easily so if you have
you<00:03:19.590> think<00:03:19.800> you've<00:03:19.920> unscrewed<00:03:20.310> all<00:03:20.400> the

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
you think you've unscrewed all the

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.369 
you think you've unscrewed all the
screws<00:03:20.819> and<00:03:21.060> you're<00:03:21.300> trying<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:21.870> yank<00:03:22.080> it<00:03:22.230> out

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
screws and you're trying to yank it out

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:23.570 
screws and you're trying to yank it out
and<00:03:22.560> it's<00:03:22.800> coming<00:03:23.069> out<00:03:23.129> really<00:03:23.310> hard

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
and it's coming out really hard

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.240 
and it's coming out really hard
double-check<00:03:24.540> because<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.470> lot<00:03:25.709> of<00:03:25.830> lot<00:03:26.220> of

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
double-check because a lot of lot of

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.890 
double-check because a lot of lot of
times<00:03:26.370> there's<00:03:26.730> like<00:03:26.879> hidden<00:03:27.180> screw<00:03:27.510> or<00:03:27.659> screw

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
times there's like hidden screw or screw

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.009 
times there's like hidden screw or screw
that<00:03:28.049> you<00:03:28.110> just<00:03:28.260> notice<00:03:28.739> so<00:03:29.569> be<00:03:30.569> very<00:03:30.720> mindful

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
that you just notice so be very mindful

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.570 
that you just notice so be very mindful
of<00:03:31.230> that<00:03:31.349> and<00:03:31.709> that's<00:03:32.069> why<00:03:32.190> it's<00:03:32.310> good<00:03:32.459> to<00:03:32.519> have

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
of that and that's why it's good to have

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.949 
of that and that's why it's good to have
a<00:03:32.670> service<00:03:33.030> manual<00:03:33.209> because<00:03:33.599> it<00:03:33.720> will<00:03:33.810> tell

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
a service manual because it will tell

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.360 
a service manual because it will tell
you<00:03:34.049> exactly<00:03:34.440> which<00:03:34.650> screws<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.099> need<00:03:35.250> to

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
you exactly which screws you need to

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.850 
you exactly which screws you need to
take<00:03:35.519> out<00:03:35.670> for<00:03:35.970> that<00:03:36.150> flap<00:03:36.390> so<00:03:37.200> now<00:03:37.409> that<00:03:37.470> I

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
take out for that flap so now that I

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.470 
take out for that flap so now that I
have<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.159> screws<00:03:38.430> out<00:03:38.610> like<00:03:39.330> they're

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
have the screws out like they're

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.300 
have the screws out like they're
actually<00:03:39.780> part<00:03:39.959> of<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.200> plastic<00:03:40.379> like<00:03:40.890> they

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
actually part of the plastic like they

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.619 
actually part of the plastic like they
stay<00:03:41.519> in<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.760> plastic<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.150> don't<00:03:42.299> take<00:03:42.510> them

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
stay in the plastic you don't take them

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.259 
stay in the plastic you don't take them
out<00:03:42.810> so<00:03:43.319> if<00:03:43.409> it's<00:03:43.590> staying<00:03:43.890> in<00:03:44.069> there<00:03:44.280> you

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
out so if it's staying in there you

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.580 
out so if it's staying in there you
don't<00:03:45.390> necessarily<00:03:45.659> need<00:03:46.080> to<00:03:46.230> take<00:03:46.379> it<00:03:46.500> out

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
don't necessarily need to take it out

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.229 
don't necessarily need to take it out
like<00:03:46.769> if<00:03:46.890> you<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.310> could<00:03:47.519> break<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:47.940> try<00:03:48.150> and

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
like if you it could break it try and

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.440 
like if you it could break it try and
yank<00:03:48.420> it<00:03:48.510> out<00:03:48.720> so<00:03:49.400> just<00:03:50.400> leave<00:03:50.940> it<00:03:51.060> in<00:03:51.120> there<00:03:51.299> if

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
yank it out so just leave it in there if

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.670 
yank it out so just leave it in there if
it<00:03:51.540> feels<00:03:51.690> like<00:03:51.840> it's<00:03:52.049> supposed<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.379> stay<00:03:52.590> in

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
it feels like it's supposed to stay in

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.050 
it feels like it's supposed to stay in
there<00:03:52.830> and<00:03:53.189> you<00:03:53.280> can<00:03:53.400> see<00:03:53.519> that<00:03:53.640> it's<00:03:53.819> supposed

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
there and you can see that it's supposed

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.390 
there and you can see that it's supposed
to<00:03:54.209> stay<00:03:55.200> in<00:03:55.319> there<00:03:55.470> like<00:03:55.650> one<00:03:55.980> of<00:03:56.099> the<00:03:56.159> screws

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
to stay in there like one of the screws

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.280 
to stay in there like one of the screws
is<00:03:56.489> over<00:03:56.670> here<00:03:56.879> and<00:03:57.090> has<00:03:57.480> a<00:03:57.510> special<00:03:57.780> piece

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
is over here and has a special piece

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.970 
is over here and has a special piece
that<00:03:58.319> makes<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:58.799> stay<00:03:59.040> with<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.489> top<00:03:59.939> so<00:04:00.980> now

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
that makes it stay with the top so now

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.679 
that makes it stay with the top so now
that<00:04:02.040> that's<00:04:02.280> off<00:04:02.549> what<00:04:03.330> you're<00:04:03.480> going<00:04:03.629> to

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:03.689 
that that's off what you're going to

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:05.869 
that that's off what you're going to
want<00:04:03.810> to<00:04:03.840> look<00:04:03.989> for<00:04:04.230> is<00:04:04.409> the<00:04:04.890> ring<00:04:05.069> and<00:04:05.370> this<00:04:05.819> is

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
want to look for is the ring and this is

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.270 
want to look for is the ring and this is
my<00:04:06.150> RAM<00:04:06.450> in<00:04:06.659> general<00:04:07.560> laptop<00:04:07.980> our<00:04:08.129> end<00:04:08.220> is

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
my RAM in general laptop our end is

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.130 
my RAM in general laptop our end is
going<00:04:08.430> to<00:04:08.489> look<00:04:08.670> very<00:04:09.150> very<00:04:09.269> similar<00:04:09.510> to<00:04:09.989> this

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
going to look very very similar to this

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.039 
going to look very very similar to this
I've<00:04:10.530> seen<00:04:10.860> a<00:04:10.890> few<00:04:11.189> oddballs<00:04:11.700> but<00:04:12.030> this<00:04:12.900> is

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
I've seen a few oddballs but this is

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.759 
I've seen a few oddballs but this is
generally<00:04:13.290> how<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.739> looks<00:04:14.450> so<00:04:15.450> this<00:04:15.989> is<00:04:16.109> ddr3

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
generally how it looks so this is ddr3

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.740 
generally how it looks so this is ddr3
RAM<00:04:16.979> and<00:04:17.250> you<00:04:17.940> can<00:04:18.060> see<00:04:18.180> that<00:04:18.329> it<00:04:18.419> has<00:04:18.449> this

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
RAM and you can see that it has this

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.509 
RAM and you can see that it has this
little<00:04:18.930> slot<00:04:19.259> right<00:04:19.290> here<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:19.769> that<00:04:20.100> tells

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
little slot right here and that tells

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.979 
little slot right here and that tells
what<00:04:20.639> type<00:04:21.030> of<00:04:21.060> RAM<00:04:21.389> it<00:04:21.509> is<00:04:21.599> so<00:04:21.720> you<00:04:21.780> can<00:04:21.900> look

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
what type of RAM it is so you can look

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.689 
what type of RAM it is so you can look
up<00:04:22.109> a<00:04:22.199> picture<00:04:22.500> online<00:04:22.650> to<00:04:22.979> see<00:04:23.130> what<00:04:23.370> type<00:04:23.550> of

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
up a picture online to see what type of

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.640 
up a picture online to see what type of
RAM<00:04:23.880> you<00:04:24.090> have<00:04:24.240> but<00:04:24.690> also<00:04:24.870> should<00:04:25.169> be<00:04:25.259> printed

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
RAM you have but also should be printed

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.550 
RAM you have but also should be printed
on<00:04:25.770> this<00:04:25.889> label<00:04:26.220> here<00:04:26.430> and<00:04:27.050> how<00:04:28.050> I<00:04:28.080> just<00:04:28.199> took

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
on this label here and how I just took

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.260 
on this label here and how I just took
this<00:04:28.740> out<00:04:29.240> is<00:04:31.460> I'll<00:04:32.460> try<00:04:32.759> and<00:04:32.910> zoom<00:04:33.060> in<00:04:33.240> a

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
this out is I'll try and zoom in a

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.520 
this out is I'll try and zoom in a
little<00:04:33.479> bit<00:04:33.690> here<00:04:33.840> because<00:04:33.960> this<00:04:34.199> is<00:04:34.380> the

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
little bit here because this is the

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:43.640 
little bit here because this is the
important<00:04:34.860> part<00:04:41.569> there's<00:04:42.569> these<00:04:42.870> two<00:04:42.930> like

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
important part there's these two like

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.890 
important part there's these two like
pieces<00:04:44.310> of<00:04:44.460> metal<00:04:44.669> on<00:04:44.819> the<00:04:44.910> side<00:04:45.120> and<00:04:45.419> to<00:04:45.750> get

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
pieces of metal on the side and to get

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.200 
pieces of metal on the side and to get
the<00:04:45.990> RAM<00:04:46.169> out<00:04:46.349> you<00:04:46.710> pull<00:04:46.949> those<00:04:47.130> outwards<00:04:47.639> very

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
the RAM out you pull those outwards very

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.640 
the RAM out you pull those outwards very
easily<00:04:48.660> because<00:04:49.199> they're<00:04:49.380> barely

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
easily because they're barely

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.860 
easily because they're barely
overlapping<00:04:50.310> on<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.729> rim<00:04:51.270> but<00:04:51.479> a<00:04:51.509> little<00:04:51.720> bit

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
overlapping on the rim but a little bit

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.480 
overlapping on the rim but a little bit
that's<00:04:52.020> what's<00:04:52.229> holding<00:04:52.380> in<00:04:52.620> place<00:04:52.830> so<00:04:53.430> you

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
that's what's holding in place so you

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.010 
that's what's holding in place so you
pull<00:04:53.699> those<00:04:53.789> outwards<00:04:54.240> and<00:04:54.449> you'll<00:04:54.780> see<00:04:54.900> that

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
pull those outwards and you'll see that

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.290 
pull those outwards and you'll see that
the<00:04:55.169> RAM<00:04:55.349> just<00:04:55.650> popped<00:04:55.889> up<00:04:56.099> like<00:04:56.280> now<00:04:57.150> it's

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
the RAM just popped up like now it's

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.029 
the RAM just popped up like now it's
like<00:04:57.360> flexible<00:04:57.900> in<00:04:58.020> there<00:04:58.169> and<00:04:58.349> it's<00:04:58.770> in<00:04:58.919> the

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
like flexible in there and it's in the

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:00.469 
like flexible in there and it's in the
slot<00:04:59.250> down<00:04:59.460> here<00:04:59.759> so<00:04:59.940> now<00:05:00.060> you<00:05:00.120> pull<00:05:00.360> it

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
slot down here so now you pull it

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.399 
slot down here so now you pull it
straight<00:05:00.750> out<00:05:01.169> and<00:05:02.099> it'll<00:05:02.580> pop<00:05:02.729> right<00:05:02.940> out<00:05:03.120> and

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:03.409 
straight out and it'll pop right out and

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:06.950 
straight out and it'll pop right out and
there's<00:05:04.409> usually<00:05:04.590> two<00:05:04.979> sticks<00:05:05.310> or<00:05:06.240> in<00:05:06.750> some

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
there's usually two sticks or in some

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.779 
there's usually two sticks or in some
cases<00:05:07.169> even<00:05:07.349> four<00:05:07.710> but<00:05:08.220> usually<00:05:08.550> there's<00:05:08.699> only

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
cases even four but usually there's only

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.600 
cases even four but usually there's only
two<00:05:09.090> overlapping<00:05:09.780> and<00:05:10.110> you<00:05:11.009> need<00:05:11.190> to<00:05:11.280> take<00:05:11.460> out

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
two overlapping and you need to take out

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.890 
two overlapping and you need to take out
this<00:05:11.819> one<00:05:12.030> before<00:05:12.240> you<00:05:12.449> get<00:05:12.599> to<00:05:12.720> the<00:05:12.780> one

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
this one before you get to the one

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.809 
this one before you get to the one
beneath<00:05:13.229> it<00:05:13.440> and<00:05:13.590> then<00:05:14.159> you<00:05:14.280> do<00:05:14.400> the<00:05:14.520> exact

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:14.819 
beneath it and then you do the exact

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:16.370 
beneath it and then you do the exact
same<00:05:14.849> thing<00:05:15.210> for<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.449> one<00:05:15.569> below<00:05:15.810> it<00:05:15.960> or<00:05:16.289> you

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
same thing for the one below it or you

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.779 
same thing for the one below it or you
push<00:05:16.560> those<00:05:16.740> little<00:05:17.009> metal<00:05:17.220> prongs<00:05:17.460> to<00:05:17.639> the

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
push those little metal prongs to the

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.279 
push those little metal prongs to the
side<00:05:18.000> and<00:05:18.449> you<00:05:18.539> can<00:05:18.659> see<00:05:18.780> it<00:05:18.870> just<00:05:18.900> popped<00:05:19.169> up

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
side and you can see it just popped up

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.499 
side and you can see it just popped up
not<00:05:19.590> too<00:05:19.740> floppy<00:05:19.889> and<00:05:20.220> now<00:05:20.940> I<00:05:20.970> can<00:05:21.270> pull<00:05:21.479> it

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:21.509 
not too floppy and now I can pull it

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:24.890 
not too floppy and now I can pull it
straight<00:05:21.720> out<00:05:21.930> now<00:05:22.889> to<00:05:22.949> put<00:05:23.159> the<00:05:23.250> RAM<00:05:23.690> new<00:05:24.690> RAM

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
straight out now to put the RAM new RAM

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.390 
straight out now to put the RAM new RAM
in<00:05:25.110> like<00:05:25.349> if<00:05:25.440> you're<00:05:25.560> replacing<00:05:25.949> it<00:05:26.039> or<00:05:26.190> just

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
in like if you're replacing it or just

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.060 
in like if you're replacing it or just
put<00:05:26.580> ramen<00:05:26.820> in<00:05:27.120> general<00:05:27.479> you<00:05:28.020> line<00:05:28.320> up<00:05:28.500> this

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
put ramen in general you line up this

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.209 
put ramen in general you line up this
slot<00:05:29.520> this<00:05:29.789> is<00:05:29.969> very<00:05:30.150> important<00:05:30.979> you<00:05:31.979> line<00:05:32.190> up

slot this is very important you line up

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:34.790 
slot this is very important you line up
this<00:05:32.550> slot<00:05:32.940> with<00:05:33.479> the<00:05:33.509> slot<00:05:33.870> that's<00:05:34.139> in<00:05:34.320> the

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
this slot with the slot that's in the

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.640 
this slot with the slot that's in the
end<00:05:35.789> slot<00:05:36.719> itself<00:05:37.050> you're<00:05:37.259> going<00:05:37.380> to<00:05:37.440> need<00:05:37.560> to

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
end slot itself you're going to need to

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.230 
end slot itself you're going to need to
look<00:05:37.800> like<00:05:38.039> where<00:05:38.219> there's<00:05:38.400> a<00:05:38.580> bunch<00:05:39.090> of

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
look like where there's a bunch of

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.550 
look like where there's a bunch of
little<00:05:39.360> metal<00:05:39.570> pins<00:05:39.870> and<00:05:40.110> then<00:05:40.199> all<00:05:40.289> sudden

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
little metal pins and then all sudden

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.230 
little metal pins and then all sudden
they<00:05:40.650> stop<00:05:40.919> and<00:05:41.159> there's<00:05:41.280> a<00:05:41.340> like<00:05:41.729> a<00:05:41.759> mark<00:05:42.060> and

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
they stop and there's a like a mark and

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.570 
they stop and there's a like a mark and
then<00:05:42.750> there's<00:05:42.930> more<00:05:43.139> pins<00:05:43.380> if<00:05:43.590> you<00:05:44.310> try<00:05:44.520> and

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
then there's more pins if you try and

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.219 
then there's more pins if you try and
shove<00:05:44.969> this<00:05:45.120> Ram<00:05:45.360> in<00:05:45.539> the<00:05:45.659> wrong<00:05:45.810> way<00:05:45.990> you're

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
shove this Ram in the wrong way you're

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:47.390 
shove this Ram in the wrong way you're
going<00:05:46.380> to<00:05:46.440> break<00:05:46.590> something<00:05:46.650> and<00:05:47.130> possibly

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
going to break something and possibly

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.760 
going to break something and possibly
fry<00:05:47.729> your<00:05:47.909> laptop<00:05:48.330> so<00:05:48.630> be<00:05:49.110> very<00:05:49.289> mindful<00:05:49.530> of

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
fry your laptop so be very mindful of

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.779 
fry your laptop so be very mindful of
that<00:05:50.270> so<00:05:51.270> my<00:05:52.050> little<00:05:52.469> slot<00:05:52.830> is<00:05:53.009> right<00:05:53.190> here<00:05:53.520> and

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
that so my little slot is right here and

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:55.249 
that so my little slot is right here and
that's<00:05:54.180> what<00:05:54.330> I'm<00:05:54.419> lining<00:05:54.690> up<00:05:54.840> the<00:05:55.020> slot<00:05:55.229> on

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:55.259 
that's what I'm lining up the slot on

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:57.620 
that's what I'm lining up the slot on
the<00:05:55.440> RAM<00:05:55.650> with<00:05:55.860> and<00:05:56.639> I'm<00:05:57.210> going<00:05:57.360> to<00:05:57.389> do<00:05:57.509> the

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
the RAM with and I'm going to do the

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.110 
the RAM with and I'm going to do the
bottom<00:05:57.780> one<00:05:58.050> first<00:05:58.400> so<00:05:59.400> I<00:05:59.430> slide<00:05:59.759> it<00:05:59.940> straight

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
bottom one first so I slide it straight

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.670 
bottom one first so I slide it straight
in<00:06:00.449> just<00:06:00.750> the<00:06:00.900> same<00:06:01.050> way<00:06:01.110> it<00:06:01.319> took<00:06:01.469> it<00:06:01.590> out

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
in just the same way it took it out

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.950 
in just the same way it took it out
slide<00:06:02.580> it<00:06:02.610> straight<00:06:02.940> in<00:06:03.060> and<00:06:03.240> then<00:06:03.690> you<00:06:03.810> just

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
slide it straight in and then you just

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.140 
slide it straight in and then you just
push<00:06:04.139> it<00:06:04.169> down<00:06:04.440> on<00:06:05.130> the<00:06:05.250> back<00:06:05.400> until<00:06:05.669> you<00:06:06.000> hear

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
push it down on the back until you hear

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.360 
push it down on the back until you hear
it<00:06:06.180> click<00:06:06.500> you<00:06:07.500> just<00:06:07.710> hear<00:06:07.860> it<00:06:07.919> heard<00:06:08.130> it<00:06:08.250> click

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
it click you just hear it heard it click

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.980 
it click you just hear it heard it click
in<00:06:08.550> there<00:06:08.729> so<00:06:09.419> I'm<00:06:09.479> going<00:06:09.630> to<00:06:09.659> put<00:06:09.810> in<00:06:09.900> the

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
in there so I'm going to put in the

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.029 
in there so I'm going to put in the
second<00:06:10.289> stick<00:06:11.840> so<00:06:12.840> I<00:06:12.870> pushed<00:06:13.169> it<00:06:13.319> in<00:06:13.440> like

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 
second stick so I pushed it in like

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:16.580 
second stick so I pushed it in like
again<00:06:14.580> I<00:06:14.610> lined<00:06:14.969> up<00:06:15.090> that<00:06:15.300> little<00:06:16.139> hole<00:06:16.380> there

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
again I lined up that little hole there

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:22.010 
again I lined up that little hole there
with<00:06:16.800> the<00:06:17.240> hole<00:06:18.240> in<00:06:18.509> the<00:06:18.750> slot<00:06:20.659> and<00:06:21.659> then<00:06:21.930> I

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
with the hole in the slot and then I

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.330 
with the hole in the slot and then I
push<00:06:22.199> straight<00:06:22.469> down<00:06:22.500> and<00:06:22.889> you<00:06:22.979> can<00:06:23.159> hear<00:06:23.310> a

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
push straight down and you can hear a

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.180 
push straight down and you can hear a
click<00:06:23.550> and<00:06:23.990> there<00:06:24.990> you<00:06:25.080> go<00:06:25.169> that's<00:06:25.650> all<00:06:26.069> there

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
click and there you go that's all there

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.279 
click and there you go that's all there
is<00:06:26.219> to<00:06:26.520> to<00:06:26.729> changing<00:06:27.300> out<00:06:27.389> the<00:06:27.509> RAM<00:06:27.659> now<00:06:28.229> you

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:28.289 
is to to changing out the RAM now you

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:30.150 
is to to changing out the RAM now you
can<00:06:28.500> just<00:06:28.589> put<00:06:28.830> the<00:06:28.919> cover<00:06:29.099> back<00:06:29.219> on<00:06:29.550> and

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 
can just put the cover back on and

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.640 
can just put the cover back on and
like<00:06:30.370> I<00:06:30.460> said<00:06:30.640> don't<00:06:31.200> don't<00:06:32.200> screw<00:06:32.470> these

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650 
like I said don't don't screw these

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.800 
like I said don't don't screw these
screws<00:06:32.950> down<00:06:33.160> too<00:06:33.370> tight<00:06:33.580> like<00:06:33.910> just<00:06:34.180> see<00:06:34.780> I

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
screws down too tight like just see I

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.300 
screws down too tight like just see I
have<00:06:34.930> a<00:06:34.990> ratcheting<00:06:35.470> screwdriver<00:06:35.590> here<00:06:36.160> which

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
have a ratcheting screwdriver here which

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.010 
have a ratcheting screwdriver here which
I<00:06:36.400> would<00:06:36.520> highly<00:06:36.640> recommend<00:06:36.820> keeps<00:06:37.750> you<00:06:37.870> from

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
I would highly recommend keeps you from

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.720 
I would highly recommend keeps you from
screwing<00:06:38.440> it<00:06:38.530> down<00:06:38.560> way<00:06:38.800> too<00:06:38.860> tight<00:06:39.190> so<00:06:39.670> you

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:39.730 
screwing it down way too tight so you

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.930 
screwing it down way too tight so you
can<00:06:39.820> see<00:06:39.940> after<00:06:40.150> I<00:06:40.180> get<00:06:40.270> to<00:06:40.480> a<00:06:40.510> certain<00:06:40.660> point

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
can see after I get to a certain point

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.550 
can see after I get to a certain point
you<00:06:42.940> can<00:06:43.090> hear<00:06:43.240> it<00:06:43.300> ratcheting<00:06:43.750> and<00:06:43.900> it's<00:06:44.290> not

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 
you can hear it ratcheting and it's not

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.690 
you can hear it ratcheting and it's not
going<00:06:44.680> to<00:06:44.770> let<00:06:44.890> me<00:06:44.980> tighten<00:06:45.190> it<00:06:45.370> down<00:06:45.400> any

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:45.700 
going to let me tighten it down any

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.760 
going to let me tighten it down any
further<00:06:45.970> which<00:06:46.330> is<00:06:46.390> good<00:06:46.720> because<00:06:46.930> now<00:06:47.740> I

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
further which is good because now I

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.270 
further which is good because now I
can't<00:06:48.100> over<00:06:48.400> tighten<00:06:48.700> and<00:06:48.850> then<00:06:49.530> but<00:06:50.530> now<00:06:51.220> you

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 
can't over tighten and then but now you

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.190 
can't over tighten and then but now you
can<00:06:51.490> just<00:06:51.640> turn<00:06:51.760> your<00:06:51.940> laptop<00:06:52.090> back<00:06:52.540> on<00:06:52.720> it

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:53.200 
can just turn your laptop back on it

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.960 
can just turn your laptop back on it
will<00:06:53.350> recognize<00:06:53.620> the<00:06:53.950> new<00:06:54.220> RAM<00:06:54.400> by<00:06:54.580> default

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:54.970 
will recognize the new RAM by default

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.840 
will recognize the new RAM by default
and<00:06:55.380> you're<00:06:56.380> good<00:06:56.500> to<00:06:56.530> go<00:06:56.650> if<00:06:56.980> you<00:06:57.370> hear<00:06:57.700> any

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:57.850 
and you're good to go if you hear any

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.640 
and you're good to go if you hear any
weird<00:06:58.390> beepings<00:06:58.900> or<00:06:59.110> something<00:06:59.410> and<00:06:59.500> it's<00:06:59.590> not

00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.650 
weird beepings or something and it's not

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.950 
weird beepings or something and it's not
turning<00:07:00.010> on<00:07:00.190> after<00:07:00.640> you<00:07:00.700> replace<00:07:00.910> Ram<00:07:01.270> then

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
turning on after you replace Ram then

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.150 
turning on after you replace Ram then
double-check<00:07:02.470> that<00:07:02.500> you<00:07:02.680> put<00:07:02.860> it<00:07:02.920> into<00:07:03.070> the

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160 
double-check that you put it into the

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.700 
double-check that you put it into the
slot<00:07:03.370> all<00:07:03.700> the<00:07:03.940> way<00:07:04.060> and<00:07:04.330> then<00:07:04.990> try<00:07:05.290> taking<00:07:05.650> out

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:05.710 
slot all the way and then try taking out

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.530 
slot all the way and then try taking out
one<00:07:05.950> Ram<00:07:06.190> stick<00:07:06.490> and<00:07:06.670> trying<00:07:06.880> the<00:07:07.030> other<00:07:07.180> or

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:07.540 
one Ram stick and trying the other or

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.720 
one Ram stick and trying the other or
something<00:07:08.260> like<00:07:08.350> that<00:07:08.410> because<00:07:08.710> usually<00:07:09.310> if<00:07:09.640> a

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:09.730 
something like that because usually if a

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.790 
something like that because usually if a
laptop<00:07:10.090> beeps<00:07:10.420> after<00:07:10.720> you've<00:07:11.260> just<00:07:11.500> changed

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 
laptop beeps after you've just changed

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.320 
laptop beeps after you've just changed
Ram<00:07:12.010> and<00:07:12.220> you're<00:07:12.310> trying<00:07:12.610> to<00:07:12.670> put<00:07:12.820> it<00:07:12.940> up<00:07:13.060> it

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.330 
Ram and you're trying to put it up it

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.790 
Ram and you're trying to put it up it
means<00:07:13.780> that<00:07:13.990> there's<00:07:14.140> something<00:07:14.350> wrong<00:07:14.590> with

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 
means that there's something wrong with

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.130 
means that there's something wrong with
the<00:07:14.890> RAM<00:07:15.070> stick<00:07:15.370> that<00:07:15.490> you<00:07:15.610> put<00:07:15.820> in<00:07:16.050> so<00:07:17.050> it

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:17.140 
the RAM stick that you put in so it

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.050 
the RAM stick that you put in so it
could<00:07:17.290> be<00:07:17.320> the<00:07:17.470> wrong<00:07:17.590> speed<00:07:17.950> or<00:07:18.220> a<00:07:18.250> bad<00:07:18.670> stick

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:19.060 
could be the wrong speed or a bad stick

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.280 
could be the wrong speed or a bad stick
so<00:07:19.750> in<00:07:20.140> general<00:07:20.860> if<00:07:21.640> you<00:07:22.240> hear<00:07:22.690> that<00:07:22.840> then<00:07:23.080> try

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:23.290 
so in general if you hear that then try

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:24.600 
so in general if you hear that then try
putting<00:07:23.500> your<00:07:23.560> old<00:07:23.740> stuff<00:07:23.980> back<00:07:24.190> in<00:07:24.370> and<00:07:24.520> make

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:24.610 
putting your old stuff back in and make

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.190 
putting your old stuff back in and make
sure<00:07:24.730> it<00:07:24.850> works<00:07:25.060> that<00:07:25.270> way<00:07:25.390> and<00:07:25.570> then<00:07:25.990> you<00:07:26.020> can

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:26.200 
sure it works that way and then you can

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.690 
sure it works that way and then you can
kind<00:07:26.440> of<00:07:26.500> think<00:07:26.560> that<00:07:26.830> the<00:07:26.950> new<00:07:27.100> sticks<00:07:27.490> are

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:27.700 
kind of think that the new sticks are

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.130 
kind of think that the new sticks are
bad<00:07:27.850> which<00:07:28.210> is<00:07:28.240> actually<00:07:28.990> surprisingly

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:29.140 
bad which is actually surprisingly

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.170 
bad which is actually surprisingly
common<00:07:29.920> depending<00:07:30.310> on<00:07:30.400> what<00:07:30.640> brand<00:07:30.880> you<00:07:30.970> get

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:31.180 
common depending on what brand you get

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.470 
common depending on what brand you get
so<00:07:31.710> that's<00:07:32.710> generally<00:07:33.520> how<00:07:33.550> to<00:07:33.730> replace<00:07:34.210> RAM

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:34.480 
so that's generally how to replace RAM

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.810 
so that's generally how to replace RAM
in<00:07:34.660> a<00:07:34.720> computer<00:07:35.080> or<00:07:35.500> mostly<00:07:36.100> in<00:07:36.220> a<00:07:36.280> laptop<00:07:36.430> but

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:36.820 
in a computer or mostly in a laptop but

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.430 
in a computer or mostly in a laptop but
a<00:07:36.970> desktop<00:07:37.540> works<00:07:37.750> pretty<00:07:38.020> much<00:07:38.140> the<00:07:38.290> same

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:38.440 
a desktop works pretty much the same

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.350 
a desktop works pretty much the same
except<00:07:38.980> that<00:07:39.040> slots<00:07:39.520> are<00:07:39.670> a<00:07:39.700> lot<00:07:39.880> bigger<00:07:40.030> and

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:40.360 
except that slots are a lot bigger and

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.520 
except that slots are a lot bigger and
they're<00:07:40.480> sideways<00:07:40.930> so<00:07:41.340> there<00:07:42.340> you<00:07:42.430> go
