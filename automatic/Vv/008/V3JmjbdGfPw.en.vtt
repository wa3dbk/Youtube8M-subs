00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.769
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:17.160
 our constant companions computer and 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.590
 Naturally, smartphones can do the same 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.500
 be with whom you have any notes 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.060
 write on the go information 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.800
 maybe record a talk too 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.380
 and something but now and then you have to 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.199
 times an e-mail answer or something and 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.510
 then of course you can do that with these 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.899
 good and easy electronic companion 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.600
 fast if you have a few 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.980
 More things writing becomes longer 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.649
 That's a bit difficult here 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.899
 somewhere on it to dance on 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.640
 the touchscreen and the letters too 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.039
 meet and correct and then 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.309
 insert and back and forth so one 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.739
 keyboard for a lot to ask me 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.780
 still prefer today but have the 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.590
 No keyboard just such a screen 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.680
 keyboard 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.979
 I have found each one since they can 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.650
 see that no keyboard 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:10.610
 Maybe you think you can 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:15.330
 unfold and what comes out of it 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.189
 a correct keyboard the width 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.330
 the keyboard is the way of 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.790
 General keys is 26 inches tall 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.770
 not really great people but watch them 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.040
 Here you will find my pranks here 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.579
 on it the keys without especially to 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.850
 so disturb this keyboard I connect 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.340
 to offer my computer 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.229
 quite simply that is a bluetooth 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.600

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.549
 Button pressed and I say mine 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.009
 calculator or smartphone or whatever 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.470
 always or cloud computer or similar 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.659
 Part of what bluetooth can I would 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.689
 times to who in the moment and reports 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.310
 then said there is the keyboard so and so 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.680
 Tap on that password 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.079
 what he suggests in and that's it 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.329
 already so the two are connected like that 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.130

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.170

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.619
 friends 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.599
 At the moment I have the shift button 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.190
 I get used to it first 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:27.489
 I jumped to the beginning 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:30.519
 back to the end so and so goes 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:33.250
 Pretty good as she is 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.200
 can recognize and with that I have 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.340
 my text on the go fast and 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.810
 Simply written 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:44.829
 this keyboard weighs 176 grams and to 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.230
 Not fit in the pants pocket though 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.450
 looks a bit bulky but well made at 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.260
 one falls more to the other less 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.260
 and shot
