00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
interior and exterior actually so what

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.690

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
does jump out it and we'll proceed to

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.960 
does jump out it and we'll proceed to
the<00:04:18.180> other<00:04:18.420> ship<00:04:18.720> much<00:04:19.680> smaller<00:04:20.160> ship<00:04:20.580> i<00:04:20.730> think

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
the other ship much smaller ship i think

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.080 
the other ship much smaller ship i think
that<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:22.070> ship<00:04:23.070> model<00:04:23.430> should<00:04:23.760> say<00:04:24.060> here<00:04:24.920> this

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
that the ship model should say here this

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.650 
that the ship model should say here this
is<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.120> 300<00:04:28.020> Sue's<00:04:28.290> us<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:28.800> other<00:04:28.920> one<00:04:29.660> now

is the 300 Sue's us the other one now
this<00:04:31.050> is<00:04:31.200> probably<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.620> isn't<00:04:32.490> it<00:04:32.550> I<00:04:32.820> don't

beautiful<00:04:52.860> I<00:04:53.570> don't<00:04:54.570> think<00:04:54.600> I<00:04:54.780> can<00:04:54.960> enter<00:04:55.260> it

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
beautiful I don't think I can enter it

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.020 
beautiful I don't think I can enter it
though<00:04:55.500> it's<00:04:55.800> so<00:04:56.070> small<00:04:56.460> they<00:04:56.760> probably

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
though it's so small they probably

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.210 
though it's so small they probably
haven't<00:04:57.270> done<00:04:57.480> the<00:04:57.630> interior<00:04:58.110> or<00:04:58.830> we<00:04:58.950> can<00:04:59.100> look

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
haven't done the interior or we can look

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.000 
haven't done the interior or we can look
at<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.430> details<00:04:59.850> here<00:05:00.620> we<00:05:01.620> can<00:05:01.740> look<00:05:01.830> at<00:05:01.919> the

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
at the details here we can look at the

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.710 
at the details here we can look at the
details<00:05:03.500> ya<00:05:04.610> think<00:05:05.610> that's<00:05:05.700> weapons<00:05:06.270> that's

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
details ya think that's weapons that's

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.140 
details ya think that's weapons that's
probably<00:05:06.900> weapon<00:05:07.320> systems<00:05:07.710> not<00:05:08.160> either<00:05:08.880> that

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
probably weapon systems not either that

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.060 
probably weapon systems not either that
or<00:05:09.180> it's<00:05:09.390> wheel<00:05:10.020> system<00:05:10.350> knows<00:05:10.650> probably

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
or it's wheel system knows probably

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.360 
or it's wheel system knows probably
wheel<00:05:11.340> systems<00:05:11.810> I'm<00:05:12.810> completely<00:05:13.590> honest<00:05:14.070> I

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
wheel systems I'm completely honest I

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.970 
wheel systems I'm completely honest I
thought<00:05:14.880> I<00:05:15.000> can't<00:05:15.270> see<00:05:15.450> myself<00:05:15.630> actually<00:05:16.169> you

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.380 
guys can probably tell better than me
here<00:05:19.440> by<00:05:19.590> how<00:05:19.919> the<00:05:19.980> back<00:05:20.280> we<00:05:20.460> can<00:05:20.669> see<00:05:20.700> engines

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
here by how the back we can see engines

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.000 
here by how the back we can see engines
one<00:05:24.390> hour<00:05:24.600> each<00:05:24.780> site<00:05:25.230> or<00:05:25.500> there's<00:05:25.740> activity

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
one hour each site or there's activity

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.000 
one hour each site or there's activity
so<00:05:26.430> as<00:05:26.610> to<00:05:26.880> each<00:05:27.360> side<00:05:27.630> so<00:05:28.230> I<00:05:28.260> would<00:05:28.680> suspect

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
so as to each side so I would suspect

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.950 
so as to each side so I would suspect
that<00:05:29.850> this<00:05:30.630> is<00:05:30.810> some<00:05:31.020> form<00:05:31.260> of<00:05:31.640> fast<00:05:32.640> reader<00:05:33.419> I

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
that this is some form of fast reader I

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.510 
that this is some form of fast reader I
mean<00:05:34.140> if<00:05:34.290> it's<00:05:34.500> this<00:05:34.680> more<00:05:34.980> it's<00:05:35.190> no<00:05:35.340> guarantee

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
mean if it's this more it's no guarantee

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.880 
mean if it's this more it's no guarantee
when<00:05:36.030> it's<00:05:36.180> actually<00:05:36.360> rendered<00:05:36.930> properly<00:05:37.320> and

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
when it's actually rendered properly and

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.920 
when it's actually rendered properly and
has<00:05:38.190> interior<00:05:38.520> those<00:05:38.850> too<00:05:39.060> small<00:05:39.330> I'm

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
has interior those too small I'm

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.010 
has interior those too small I'm
suspecting<00:05:40.590> that<00:05:40.650> is<00:05:40.860> some<00:05:41.130> form<00:05:41.370> of<00:05:42.020> fast

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
suspecting that is some form of fast

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.330 
suspecting that is some form of fast
skimmer<00:05:43.590> Raider<00:05:44.130> thingy<00:05:44.760> you<00:05:45.120> know<00:05:45.240> he<00:05:45.540> run

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
skimmer Raider thingy you know he run

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.630 
skimmer Raider thingy you know he run
maybe<00:05:47.340> steal<00:05:47.640> people's<00:05:48.060> loops<00:05:48.330> with<00:05:48.660> it<00:05:48.840> I

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
maybe steal people's loops with it I

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.400 
maybe steal people's loops with it I
don't<00:05:50.640> know<00:05:50.790> actually<00:05:51.090> but<00:05:51.780> I<00:05:52.020> think<00:05:52.350> that

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
don't know actually but I think that

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.470 
don't know actually but I think that
both<00:05:52.860> of<00:05:52.890> these<00:05:53.130> ships<00:05:53.550> seem<00:05:53.880> to<00:05:54.000> be<00:05:54.120> built<00:05:54.390> to

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:54.480 
both of these ships seem to be built to

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.650 
both of these ships seem to be built to
speed<00:05:55.700> yeah<00:05:56.700> we<00:05:56.850> could<00:05:57.000> take<00:05:57.180> a<00:05:57.210> bit<00:05:57.450> of<00:05:57.510> a

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
speed yeah we could take a bit of a

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.030 
speed yeah we could take a bit of a
different<00:05:57.960> look<00:05:58.080> here<00:05:58.380> of<00:05:59.280> the<00:06:00.470> interior<00:06:01.470> not

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 
different look here of the interior not

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.480 
different look here of the interior not
much<00:06:02.220> to<00:06:02.400> look<00:06:02.430> over<00:06:02.790> here<00:06:03.530> sadly

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
much to look over here sadly

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.300 
much to look over here sadly
but<00:06:06.120> I<00:06:06.150> think<00:06:06.810> they've<00:06:06.960> done<00:06:07.139> a<00:06:07.440> fantastic<00:06:07.770> job

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
but I think they've done a fantastic job

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.670 
but I think they've done a fantastic job
a<00:06:08.759> really<00:06:09.180> great<00:06:09.389> job<00:06:09.449> so<00:06:09.870> far<00:06:09.900> from<00:06:10.319> being<00:06:10.440> pre

a really great job so far from being pre

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.820
