00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.400 

all<00:02:59.150> right<00:02:59.300> right<00:02:59.540> now<00:02:59.660> we<00:02:59.720> don't<00:02:59.989> have<00:03:00.200> any

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
more description so we'll save this and

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:25.089 
more description so we'll save this and
use<00:03:09.410> it

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.320 

we'll<00:03:26.099> check<00:03:26.280> that<00:03:26.340> on<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.760> front<00:03:26.940> end<00:03:27.180> as

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
we'll check that on the front end as

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.990 
we'll check that on the front end as
well<00:03:27.540> reload<00:03:31.250> notice<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.400> carriage<00:03:32.700> return

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
well reload notice the carriage return

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.150 
well reload notice the carriage return
does<00:03:33.239> not<00:03:33.390> have<00:03:33.660> an<00:03:33.780> effect<00:03:34.080> in<00:03:34.170> HTML<00:03:34.319> by

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
does not have an effect in HTML by

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.540 
does not have an effect in HTML by
itself<00:03:35.660> so<00:03:36.660> five<00:03:37.020> regular<00:03:37.260> sliders<00:03:37.950> I<00:03:38.190> want<00:03:38.489> to

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
itself so five regular sliders I want to

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.400 
itself so five regular sliders I want to
clean<00:03:38.760> that<00:03:38.970> up<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.360> then<00:03:39.600> put<00:03:39.810> a<00:03:39.840> return<00:03:40.410> here

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
clean that up and then put a return here

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.960 
clean that up and then put a return here
so<00:03:43.410> we'll<00:03:43.560> just<00:03:43.680> put<00:03:43.860> a<00:03:43.920> break<00:03:44.160> tag<00:03:44.459> in<00:03:44.670> here

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
so we'll just put a break tag in here

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.420 
so we'll just put a break tag in here
and<00:03:46.069> five<00:03:47.069> regular<00:03:47.250> sliders<00:03:49.040> five<00:03:50.040> regular

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
and five regular sliders five regular

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.040 
and five regular sliders five regular
sliders<00:03:51.239> maybe<00:03:51.630> we<00:03:51.840> don't<00:03:51.989> need<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:54.050> repeat

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
sliders maybe we don't need to repeat

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:07.920 
sliders maybe we don't need to repeat
that

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.980 

but<00:04:08.930> maybe<00:04:09.140> we<00:04:09.410> do<00:04:09.560> put<00:04:09.830> this<00:04:10.070> above<00:04:13.870> with<00:04:14.870> the

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
but maybe we do put this above with the

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:38.260 
but maybe we do put this above with the
break<00:04:15.260> tag<00:04:16.030> like<00:04:17.030> so

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.780 

there<00:04:39.270> we<00:04:39.510> go

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
there we go

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.180 
there we go
now<00:04:41.790> the<00:04:41.850> image<00:04:42.510> itself<00:04:42.960> we<00:04:43.620> should<00:04:43.890> try<00:04:44.130> to

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
now the image itself we should try to

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.990 
now the image itself we should try to
find<00:04:44.460> a<00:04:44.580> better<00:04:44.730> image<00:04:45.120> and<00:04:46.370> if<00:04:47.370> we<00:04:47.490> view<00:04:47.700> image

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
find a better image and if we view image

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.880 
find a better image and if we view image
here<00:04:48.390> it'll<00:04:48.810> tell<00:04:49.050> us<00:04:49.110> what<00:04:49.380> size<00:04:49.620> we're

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
here it'll tell us what size we're

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.790
