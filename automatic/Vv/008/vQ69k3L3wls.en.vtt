00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello my ladies and gentlemen heartily 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.569
 welcome to the biscuit 490 universe news 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.150
 the very first we do 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.219
 of course, is going on theoretically 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.570
 are even the second because we 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.040
 have last week sunday already that 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.549
 first video with the announcement high 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.920
 voted 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.820
 that was almost the first news but no matter 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.460
 On the one hand, it is about looking back today 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.090
 on the previous week so what 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.349
 happened at robert blatt and ezb 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.730
 and then we clarify a few more 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.219
 things because the project is still in 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.630
 child shoes and change 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.399
 accordingly again one 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.600
 just a little bit only and 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.370
 we'll go over that again 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.739
 of course also on the 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.350
 Points you gave us this week 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.430
 so we start directly with that 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.410
 Review of the euro at my show 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.910
 actually not much special there was 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.280
 a few matches but that was special 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.010
 John Cena Wiesner had amazon 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.989
 contender match with john cena 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.230
 won and right after the victory 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.260
 came privately yes in the ec brakes at home 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.330
 is over and grabbed 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.210
 Of course, we have john cena there 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.040
 everyone wondered what did they have now 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.729
 and then there was also directly at bet 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.560
 petal in the main event 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.130
 a back match so no rhythm like 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:24.420
 Can you call that a runner 's 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:30.750
 fejde then only once gave by john 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:34.619
 cena vs luca de nicola di luca and 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.840
 eric rohmer I already have that 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.930
 Longer lost miserably 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.490
 Eighth match, however, have theirs 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:47.460
 Crowns or dad and John Cena then eric 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.689
 bohn attacked and struck something 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.860
 well, as we have heard, actually 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.450
 bug was of course firmly in us 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.899
 the storyline was integrated accordingly 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.040
 it went on then in the main event 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.630
 on the other hand, he even had ready 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.500
 remember it has nothing 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.630
 brought 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.270
 Luca actually prevailed 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.520
 also on ezb also rob van dam 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.619
 has against in an extreme rules match 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.459
 the officiating 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.090
 evita logical champion chris jersey 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.940
 won 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.040
 yes that was the highlights of 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.540
 from the shows more than just one 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.819
 smaller so that you looking back on again 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.379
 be in the running and we heart is the 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.940
 last week explains the whole 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.799
 shots that you saw over the week 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.379
 We also had a week ago 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.170
 a bit first and collect and 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.120
 Let us do it all again 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.860
 So that's what happened in retrospect 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.090
 that still knows relatively little but that 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.220
 is also because it is simply the 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.480
 first week was so much much 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.730
 since just can not happen yet 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.010
 yes not because yes it was easy for him 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.010
 the beginning so to the points 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.769
 we were suggested that one points 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.409
 get and score with these then 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.760
 can buy something and that's just what 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:58.879
 Let's just do it this way 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.709
 Immediately, therefore, does not immediately get the 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.569
 first week counted already with the 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.400
 winner of bet sheet so who two 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.430
 matches or even three matches wins 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.019
 or the wrestler as much profit the 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.400
 gets a point on his 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.620
 attributed to the point account 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.569
 and who wins the ratings so you 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.030
 Yes our chance and who the 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.560
 week dominates the gets as well 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.739
 a point that means one can maximally 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.060
 reach two points in a week and 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.819
 You can then score with these points 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.859
 what exactly what do we buy 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.150
 even not so much to one hundred percent 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.980
 But in any case, you will be 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.530
 Wrestlers can buy with these 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.190
 score a wrestler will be two points 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.950
 costs 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.569
 that means I could now for 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.250
 example, to buy a wrestler I have 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.470
 namely both in bed remains recovered 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.220
 as well as the ratings and thus 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.799
 Let's get to the ratings exactly 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.280
 the ratings are relatively close 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:54.829
 failed as was really tight 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.340
 He had 33 ratings and came 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:00.530
 total to a mean of 401 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:05.900
 score points must be the same 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:08.919
 say because ezb had only 20 ratings 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:14.359
 But overall came on a rating of 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:18.049
 406 score just 0.05 more points 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:19.370
 but so with HTC has won and David 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.570
 get another point what you yes 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.229
 actually already know because he has 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.229
 already announced 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.100
 so I could now so pure 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.510
 theoretically buy a wrestler if that 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.540
 already happened 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.190
 you will see that on friday we come 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.080
 also to other things we 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.960
 want to address 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.340
 it was suggested that we us 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.000
 had this match every week 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.919
 English posed at the match expiration 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.050
 We will chat now and then 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.810
 only at pay per views do that 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.460
 means at the normal shows is the 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.620
 solid as that means in any case 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.190
 then we play that is the match 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.900
 The people are beautiful again as it stands 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.600
 no matter in any case play more now 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.060
 at a normal show on normal and 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:09.919
 at the pay per use on epic 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:12.590
 exactly and me were two applications 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:15.199
 almost made me several times 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.669
 said i should please jeff hardy 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:18.620
 exchange because the shit looks like 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:24.289
 and I did that now too 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:26.030
 from now on there are new jeff hardy thw and 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.490
 I would also like to ask if I am 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.070
 retro kane can get into the team instead of the 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.380
 normal kane and I have that too now 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.030
 released last week 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.669
 I thought I go the wish too 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:42.169
 After retro cain is now in the roster 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:44.060
 the right can is out just like us 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:47.360
 have so far always only one match per 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:50.599
 show played or shown and always only 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.639
 the main event was exactly and us then 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:55.099
 said that his shit and have you 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:57.020
 actually also quite because yes there are 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:59.750
 likewise matches as sting went undertaker 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.800
 fallen under the table and have that 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.440
 we also viewed 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.210
 That's why we just try it 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.590
 a bit like many matches 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.789
 again show the problem 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.410
 Of course, that too must be everything 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:10.940
 be recorded and more matches 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.830
 Of course it will take longer and we will 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.310
 unfortunately have other things too 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.110
 do 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.750
 do this week in our free time 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:20.449
 we'll see it at every show 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.340
 we show robert sheet as well as sth 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:23.720
 three matches at blatt shows me that 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.210
 So the whole show because that's just 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.310
 but there are three matches at jw too 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.380
 three matches we show the others 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.510
 both are just simulated and so 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.289
 We would then be happy about your feedback 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.629
 happy how it continues 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:38.159
 but somehow still change and we see 

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:39.719
 yes then even how it works now 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:40.680
 with the recording the same amount of time 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:44.069
 need again 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:47.580
 and yes I would say that was it then 

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:51.119
 this is already synonymous with the xc90 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:53.300
 universe news for today sunday and 

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:55.259
 Tomorrow there will be the next episode 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:58.069
 is exactly where 

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:58.069
 See you
