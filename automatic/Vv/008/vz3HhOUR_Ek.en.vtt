00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.790
 that something with a come you could carey that 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.930
 then about america today my first 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:30.070
 America was two times last year 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.260
 year ago 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.290
 no, years ago and let go 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.210
 so my parents and my sister went to 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:42.080
 America and while so a whole 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:44.090
 round about the risks 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.830
 called so i started in new york we are 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.610
 stayed there for a few days and so did 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.870
 we send a hundred cars cars to me 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.850
 all the way to man you drove 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.470
 and there finally have three 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.000
 weeks redone in order to be a 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.310
 a small town are big cities 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.340
 so the stopover but there were a few 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.610
 things you just do well anyway 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.310
 typical physical pre- 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:10.340
 american as to for example we do 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.840
 the arrived to john f kennedy leigh wat 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.090
 The rocks are always very busy 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.190
 littered with people if not sent 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.540
 still nice and an airport considering that 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.890
 anyway in us more people really us 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.420
 normal and 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.970
 I ended up staying at our hotel 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.530
 not even a good one arrived 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:29.000
 hotel what the fines would be 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:31.070
 all given with no the fear of flying 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.620
 hurt a lot of blabla with whom we all do that 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.030
 divide number from shot to the why not 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.190
 so very happy with it 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.530
 no, ever and then that same day 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.710
 is there the argument 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.730
 next to us someone was killed 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.500
 so yes that was also normal 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.210
 disturbing and so naturally something 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.740
 American of mine in the Netherlands have that 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.710
 never experienced anything like me before 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.210
 so that is that you are in america 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.460
 You immediately sew someone in shot 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.380
 their own apartment complex next to you 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.129
 so that stuff will be weird 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:03.300
 later on that around or may 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:04.949
 also that there is only one whole church 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.589
 was burnt down so until then my 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:13.769
 We put our fingers on it and so was whole 

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:15.430
 very weird that he was all in it 

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:16.900
 panic and so on 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.880
 was very cool to see and 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.800
 just whole culture in america is just 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.640
 so different it is 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.560
 I think America is from the sickest 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.170
 of course numbero has arrived and me 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.420
 find one of the coolest countries beer is 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:33.220
 one I wanted to meet Rotterdam 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.680
 are therefore ready for knowledge 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.870
 go people japan or mine to the west 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.900
 coast side again or I could the 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.590
 sandwich cola player bla bla and yes 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.970
 hence 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:47.740
 thinks about yourself and forward for such 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.210
 super fat to him that I deal with 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.070
 an american too 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.110
 and for all people who are not yet 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:55.330
 want to or have not been to America 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.730
 I really want to go to America 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.650
 keep your back to many and go ours 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.120
 back to the risks of that I think 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.140
 just super with miami 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.760
 Sure, as a nice girl, it will come 

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:10.480
 life 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.930
 what me from america not about and yes that 

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.580
 Walking is also good weather itself 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.320
 and it also took us once in a while 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:23.140
 little help you let your 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:25.780
 and then it appeared that either means you 

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:29.590
 bed night so when when i got my bed 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:32.290
 exo also little effect on us watching another 

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.700
 whole bed was strewn with summer nipples 

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.650
 then my little black creatures like that 

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.590
