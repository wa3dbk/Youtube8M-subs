00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.910
 Goodland peace near Dusseldorf here 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.740
 reid champion jean bemelmans explained how 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.660
 short turns and backhand turns 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.120
 be developed in a meaningful way 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.940
 in his opinion misunderstood lessons 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.039
 like the step pirouette is this 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.990
 step on there is the first one 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.180
 real meeting here and there you have to 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.800
 yes there is dangerous because you have to 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.019
 yes to pay attention to the tactical step 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.510
 you have to have the permeability 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.189
 that must be diligent yes so there 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.059
 is already several points together 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.290
 and that's why it's a thing often 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.170
 not so full of the riders 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.969
 Thighs are obedient and taken 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.350
 meeting readiness in the step 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.899
 are the car for the short turn around 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.079
 the 14-year-old region has regrets 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.489
 experience in sidings and then 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.270
 you try a bit shoulder 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.219
 Entering so you can just do this 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.230
 this closer to the thigh 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.199
 react that works first 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.609
 yes the basic principle is always when 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.739
 I can with the right thigh 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.630
 must the missing yes move to the left 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.640
 if I come with the left thigh 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.470
 the feature court has to be enough and 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.010
 this principle left soft right 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.650
 give way 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.600
 that must be a bit first 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.920
 Beemelmanns uses it for this 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.740
 the circle 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.380
 here alternately shoulder come in 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.460
 and ravel ridden 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.409
 So she keeps her shoulder outside just fine 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.360
 and then she goes back to the shoulder 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:36.110
 mr a left leg of good like to loose 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.590
 let a little play on the left 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:43.560
 exactly and now she is back who 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.869
 helps the shoulder outside well so stop the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.460
 shoulder off 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.610
 The connection will be on the long side 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.329
 out of the shoulder in the short turn 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.530
 developed for this is the field with 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.030
 easier longitudinal bend in the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.920
 directionToMove asked the 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.649
 forelegs step forward sidewards 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.070
 and cross the back legs in the 4 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.220
 Step the pace with up and down now 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.050
 Travers asked on the long side 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.020
 clearly more clearly create and why 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.320
 Now you come around there 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.190
 so come rom rome and now the backhand 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.780
 advance clean room who should in connection 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.830
 be initiated with it the shoulder 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.830
 does not break out 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.770
 The horse has solved his task well 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.500
 and may now in the stall with the 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.690
 six year old mare of rubin cortes like that 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.940
 has to be worked on step transitions 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.910
 An important requirement for short 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.340
 returns always looks for a tournament a10 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.410
 for the piaffe 10 for the middle section 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.240
 I seldom experience 10 for that 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.160
 gathered and that's something 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.420
 which I miss because the dak assembled 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.910
 steps do not look that well 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.730
 that's the way it is and I think that's it 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.550
 scary important that I have a good one 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.340
 gathered step can hold so so 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.350
 it stays great on the circle 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.480
 and then again nice apron 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.610
 down to the middle step and to 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.420
 strong step go here with the 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.830
 hands shows her the way so exactly 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.410
 let longer 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.450
 go up and down the hips 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.760
 do not push them out of the front 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:30.050
 Thighs from the hip try one 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:32.370
 long step towards soja greater prima 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.130
 so and if that with the assembled 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.170
 step works well then you take that 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.520
 right thigh ran and now first 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:45.900
 Topic shoulder in on the circle 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:48.080
 red not so hurry so good so 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:54.450
 drive on anyway 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:56.100
 and just as great and now it makes 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.780
 in the shoulder, you enter 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.090
 a little bit of piano always brings it 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.150
 behind a bit in the train holds the 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:08.550
 shoulder open so the neck is such a 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:10.380
 a little bit up right, that's right 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.209
 if that works out and then 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.650
 go back to the middle step so now 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.500
 you in front of the middle and leaves the field 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.620
 so must it be so exact 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.570
 hand follow the rider is now from the 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.640
 Medium step to the assembled step 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.950
 pass over 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:29.370
 the connection he can just return a 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.880
 leighton moves shorter so he stays that way 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:36.810
 do not slow down in the rhythm like that 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:42.480
 continue and now come rom met 34 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:46.790
 keep it smaller, continue the same now 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:52.200
 Continue straight ahead and straight ahead 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:54.180
 put off so great now seal 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.660
 record where to the revier the backhand 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.070
 in it 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.750
 and now with the backhand to 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.690
 hoofbeat with the backhand must 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:05.580
 continue to strike like this and now 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.200
 go straight medium step so 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.490
 to let 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.970
 that's for the backhand 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:16.050
 closed are required 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:18.840
 Knock super so yes step again and 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:22.710
 again so happy 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:26.400
 its good to knock bigger and so now 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:28.350
 from where you go a little step 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.810
 forward and then gesture in the 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.010
 behindhand, yes, for the first time 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.830
 small step forward and you think 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:37.140
 always a little three we will see you soon 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:41.220
 the backhand inside the back must 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.690
 first serve so good 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.910
 and let stand 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:48.090
 so close now in 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:51.120
 All rest well left again 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:54.930
 get it again in such a way again 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:57.750
 again yes so so and now leave 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.870
 so and now praise it so now 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.720
 let stand so that was nice that was 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.970
 it was always the same tact 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.050
 yes, has not slowed down 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.360
 remained diligent 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.340
 that was just too big in the end and the 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.220
 Hinterhand reaches the envelope 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.960
 And finally, the preliminary conclusion 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.480
 for the short turn around is a lot 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.330
 fine tuning asked whom do you want 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:26.030
 extra tip for a better sense of space 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.030
 sometimes train without a saddle
