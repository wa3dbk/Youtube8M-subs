videos<00:01:12.270> when<00:01:12.450> we<00:01:12.479> finding<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.080> they<00:01:13.650> can<00:01:13.830> get

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
videos when we finding this they can get

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.700 
videos when we finding this they can get
extraordinarily<00:01:14.490> loud<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.470> just<00:01:16.470> scared

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
extraordinarily loud that just scared

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.289 
extraordinarily loud that just scared
the<00:01:16.770> living<00:01:17.189> crap<00:01:17.220> out<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.640> me<00:01:17.820> these<00:01:17.970> were<00:01:18.119> so

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
the living crap out of me these were so

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.660 
the living crap out of me these were so
loud<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:19.229> they<00:01:19.439> didn't<00:01:19.680> blow<00:01:19.830> either<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.490> just

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
loud and they didn't blow either it just

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.170 
loud and they didn't blow either it just
really<00:01:21.240> good<00:01:21.390> speakers<00:01:22.850> yeah<00:01:23.850> that's<00:01:24.060> it

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
really good speakers yeah that's it

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.240 
really good speakers yeah that's it

set<00:01:26.900> really<00:01:27.900> nice<00:01:28.080> just<00:01:28.439> dusty<00:01:31.460> really<00:01:32.460> see

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
set really nice just dusty really see

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.270 
set really nice just dusty really see
with<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.000> set<00:01:33.270> though<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:34.770> picture<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.250> a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
with the set though the picture is a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.670 
with the set though the picture is a
tiny<00:01:35.759> bit<00:01:36.000> dim<00:01:36.360> compared<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.140> other<00:01:37.320> since

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
tiny bit dim compared to the other since

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.830 
tiny bit dim compared to the other since
I<00:01:37.829> haven't<00:01:38.040> right<00:01:38.310> here<00:01:40.460> there<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.579> see<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.840> it

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
I haven't right here there you see a it

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.060 
I haven't right here there you see a it
kind<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.140> past<00:01:43.350> all<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.649> other<00:01:43.680> stuff<00:01:44.040> you

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
kind of past all the other stuff you

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.870 
kind of past all the other stuff you
could<00:01:44.280> see<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> 200<00:01:45.000> volts<00:01:45.770> 560<00:01:46.770> micro<00:01:47.460> farad

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
could see a 200 volts 560 micro farad

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.499 
could see a 200 volts 560 micro farad
capacitor<00:01:49.310> bank<00:01:50.310> they're<00:01:50.520> pretty<00:01:51.299> high

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
capacitor bank they're pretty high

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.649 
capacitor bank they're pretty high
voltage<00:01:52.100> but<00:01:53.100> still<00:01:53.729> not<00:01:53.970> as<00:01:54.119> high<00:01:54.270> volts<00:01:54.570> is

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
voltage but still not as high volts is

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.719 
voltage but still not as high volts is
as<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.930> anima<00:01:55.229> connection<00:01:55.680> was<00:01:56.369> they<00:01:56.520> reach

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
as the anima connection was they reach

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.310 
as the anima connection was they reach
all<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.030> way<00:01:57.060> up<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.600> 30-something

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
all the way up to like 30-something

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.459 
all the way up to like 30-something
thousand<00:01:59.040> volts<00:01:59.340> so<00:02:00.060> don't<00:02:00.570> really<00:02:01.259> touch

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
thousand volts so don't really touch

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.660 
thousand volts so don't really touch
anything<00:02:01.770> unless<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.250> know<00:02:02.369> what<00:02:02.549> you're

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
anything unless you know what you're

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.310 
anything unless you know what you're
doing<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.420> see<00:02:03.600> I'm<00:02:03.719> not<00:02:03.869> touching<00:02:04.259> anything

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
doing you see I'm not touching anything

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.020 
doing you see I'm not touching anything
on<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:04.770> pointing

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
on this pointing

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.870 
on this pointing
and<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.480> signature<00:02:07.190> Trinitron<00:02:08.190> feature<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.850> a

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
and a signature Trinitron feature is a

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.260 
and a signature Trinitron feature is a
really<00:02:09.840> long<00:02:10.370> tube<00:02:11.370> neck<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:12.030> could<00:02:12.150> actually

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
really long tube neck you could actually

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.260 
really long tube neck you could actually
see<00:02:12.600> the<00:02:12.690> electron<00:02:13.080> gun<00:02:13.260> in<00:02:13.410> there<00:02:14.060> maybe<00:02:15.060> not

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
see the electron gun in there maybe not

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.230 
see the electron gun in there maybe not
in<00:02:15.420> camera<00:02:15.780> but<00:02:15.870> yes<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:17.010> Trinitron<00:02:17.640> electron

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
in camera but yes the Trinitron electron

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.330 
in camera but yes the Trinitron electron
guns<00:02:18.540> are<00:02:18.810> longer<00:02:19.440> so<00:02:19.710> that<00:02:19.740> requires<00:02:20.220> a

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
guns are longer so that requires a

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.150 
guns are longer so that requires a
longer<00:02:20.550> neck<00:02:20.940> compared<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.690> other<00:02:21.870> sets<00:02:22.230> it's

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
longer neck compared to other sets it's

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.540 
longer neck compared to other sets it's
a<00:02:23.190> really<00:02:23.370> good<00:02:23.520> set<00:02:24.140> so<00:02:25.140> yeah<00:02:26.070> it's<00:02:26.250> one<00:02:26.400> of<00:02:26.490> my

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
a really good set so yeah it's one of my

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.860 
a really good set so yeah it's one of my
favorite<00:02:27.090> designs<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:29.220> yeah<00:02:29.750> thanks<00:02:30.750> for

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
favorite designs so yeah thanks for

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.170 
favorite designs so yeah thanks for
watching
