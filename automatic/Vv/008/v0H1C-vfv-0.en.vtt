well no waist joint or anything like
that<00:02:58.520> but<00:02:58.910> then<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.150> hips<00:02:59.360> can<00:02:59.570> move<00:02:59.780> in<00:02:59.959> and

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
that but then the hips can move in and

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.930 
that but then the hips can move in and
out<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:00.530> they<00:03:00.740> rotate<00:03:01.190> as<00:03:01.340> well<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.730> then<00:03:01.820> the

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
out and they rotate as well and then the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.940 
out and they rotate as well and then the
tail<00:03:02.150> actually<00:03:02.360> rotates<00:03:02.930> side<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.290> side<00:03:03.470> and

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
tail actually rotates side to side and

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.160 
tail actually rotates side to side and
that<00:03:04.100> has<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.310> hinge<00:03:04.610> to<00:03:04.850> Salgado<00:03:05.300> juicers<00:03:05.840> so

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
that has a hinge to Salgado juicers so

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.199 
that has a hinge to Salgado juicers so
who<00:03:06.470> might<00:03:07.280> oh<00:03:07.550> ma<00:03:07.820> wombo<00:03:08.360> yeah<00:03:10.060> this<00:03:11.060> is<00:03:11.180> a

cool Java figure man how can you not
have<00:03:12.950> fun<00:03:13.160> with<00:03:13.310> this<00:03:13.459> I<00:03:13.640> like<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.420> paint

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.600 
have fun with this I like the paint
overall<00:03:15.260> but<00:03:15.470> I<00:03:15.500> think<00:03:15.890> it<00:03:16.190> should<00:03:16.430> have<00:03:16.550> been

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
overall but I think it should have been

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.190 
overall but I think it should have been
a<00:03:16.670> little<00:03:16.880> bit<00:03:17.090> darker<00:03:17.600> there<00:03:17.780> is<00:03:17.900> a<00:03:17.930> lot<00:03:18.170> of

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
a little bit darker there is a lot of

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.199 
a little bit darker there is a lot of
shading<00:03:18.709> in<00:03:18.830> it<00:03:18.980> that<00:03:19.220> makes<00:03:19.430> me<00:03:19.580> happy<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.000> I

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
shading in it that makes me happy and I

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.400 
shading in it that makes me happy and I
like<00:03:20.330> how<00:03:20.540> we<00:03:20.600> have<00:03:20.690> some<00:03:20.990> of<00:03:21.050> the<00:03:21.110> saliva

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
like how we have some of the saliva

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.870 
like how we have some of the saliva
dripping<00:03:21.709> right<00:03:21.890> over<00:03:22.100> there<00:03:22.250> that<00:03:22.280> I<00:03:22.459> split

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
dripping right over there that I split

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.490 
dripping right over there that I split
there<00:03:23.030> painting<00:03:23.209> pretty<00:03:23.540> well<00:03:23.780> I<00:03:24.019> like<00:03:24.350> the

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
sculpt this top half is made out of a

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.790 
sculpt this top half is made out of a
soft<00:03:26.510> rubbery<00:03:26.900> material<00:03:26.930> of<00:03:27.410> course<00:03:27.620> so<00:03:27.709> you

soft rubbery material of course so you

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.870 
soft rubbery material of course so you
could<00:03:27.980> you<00:03:28.070> know<00:03:28.190> move<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.459> mouth<00:03:28.610> up<00:03:28.790> and

down there's no real paint detail inside
the<00:03:31.430> mouth<00:03:31.640> that<00:03:31.910> would<00:03:32.030> have<00:03:32.150> been<00:03:32.239> nice<00:03:32.420> to

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
again I really like the sculpted line

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.650 
again I really like the sculpted line
work<00:03:55.070> on<00:03:55.250> this<00:03:55.430> and<00:03:55.610> the<00:03:55.670> green<00:03:55.910> is<00:03:56.090> not<00:03:56.269> solid

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
work on this and the green is not solid

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.199 
work on this and the green is not solid
there's<00:03:57.019> no<00:03:57.140> real<00:03:57.410> spots<00:03:58.400> or<00:03:58.640> anything<00:03:58.910> where

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
there's no real spots or anything where

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.000 
there's no real spots or anything where
it's<00:03:59.360> just<00:03:59.450> one<00:03:59.720> solid<00:03:59.989> color<00:04:00.380> there's<00:04:00.739> just

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
it's just one solid color there's just

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.400 
it's just one solid color there's just
fading<00:04:01.580> of<00:04:01.760> different<00:04:02.090> colors<00:04:02.420> going<00:04:02.630> in<00:04:03.230> and

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
fading of different colors going in and

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.720 
fading of different colors going in and
out<00:04:03.470> throughout<00:04:03.709> the<00:04:03.769> whole<00:04:03.920> thing<00:04:04.130> just

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
out throughout the whole thing just

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.070 
out throughout the whole thing just
looking<00:04:04.910> at<00:04:05.000> the<00:04:05.090> tail<00:04:05.269> like<00:04:05.480> this<00:04:05.660> over<00:04:05.900> here

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
looking at the tail like this over here

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.390 
looking at the tail like this over here
you<00:04:06.140> can<00:04:06.290> see<00:04:06.440> there's<00:04:06.620> just<00:04:06.680> shading<00:04:07.130> going

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
you can see there's just shading going

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.220 
you can see there's just shading going
through<00:04:07.760> in<00:04:07.850> and<00:04:08.000> out<00:04:08.120> I<00:04:08.360> really<00:04:08.840> like<00:04:08.870> that<00:04:09.170> a

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
through in and out I really like that a

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.750 
through in and out I really like that a
lot<00:04:09.530> kind<00:04:09.890> of<00:04:09.920> funny<00:04:10.130> but<00:04:10.280> yeah<00:04:10.400> I<00:04:10.430> even<00:04:10.670> look

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
lot kind of funny but yeah I even look

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.040 
lot kind of funny but yeah I even look
at<00:04:10.850> the<00:04:10.940> bottom<00:04:11.180> of<00:04:11.269> a<00:04:11.330> tube<00:04:11.510> and<00:04:11.780> then<00:04:11.900> this

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
at the bottom of a tube and then this

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.699 
at the bottom of a tube and then this
figure<00:04:12.350> is<00:04:12.470> very<00:04:12.709> hollow<00:04:14.019> he<00:04:15.019> rotates<00:04:15.470> right

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
figure is very hollow he rotates right

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.400 
figure is very hollow he rotates right
here<00:04:16.010> at<00:04:16.250> his<00:04:16.549> gut<00:04:17.180> I<00:04:17.390> guess<00:04:17.810> then<00:04:18.200> you<00:04:18.229> can

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
here at his gut I guess then you can

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.080 
here at his gut I guess then you can

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
also move the arms in and out at the

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.820 
also move the arms in and out at the
shoulders<00:04:20.510> and<00:04:20.690> then<00:04:20.780> they<00:04:20.900> rotate<00:04:21.350> down<00:04:21.380> and

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
shoulders and then they rotate down and

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.190 
shoulders and then they rotate down and
up<00:04:22.070> and<00:04:22.340> then<00:04:22.430> he<00:04:22.580> has<00:04:22.790> an<00:04:23.030> elbow<00:04:23.360> Bend<00:04:23.720> so<00:04:24.020> it's

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
up and then he has an elbow Bend so it's

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.900 
up and then he has an elbow Bend so it's
not<00:04:24.320> quite<00:04:24.530> 90<00:04:24.860> degrees<00:04:25.190> but<00:04:25.430> he<00:04:25.490> can't<00:04:25.669> bend

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
not quite 90 degrees but he can't bend

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.870 
not quite 90 degrees but he can't bend
at<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.090> elbow<00:04:26.450> he<00:04:26.600> can<00:04:26.750> flex<00:04:27.050> yeah<00:04:27.320> it's<00:04:27.530> my

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
at the elbow he can flex yeah it's my

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.730 
at the elbow he can flex yeah it's my
and<00:04:29.090> then<00:04:29.420> he<00:04:29.510> rotates<00:04:29.900> side<00:04:30.110> to<00:04:30.230> side<00:04:30.410> and<00:04:30.680> he

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
and then he rotates side to side and he

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.960 
and then he rotates side to side and he
has<00:04:30.830> wrists<00:04:31.070> that<00:04:31.130> move<00:04:31.340> side<00:04:31.520> to<00:04:31.550> side<00:04:31.670> and

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
has wrists that move side to side and

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.850 
has wrists that move side to side and
they<00:04:32.090> hinge<00:04:32.360> up<00:04:32.600> and<00:04:32.840> down<00:04:33.080> I<00:04:33.290> guess<00:04:33.530> you<00:04:33.740> could

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
they hinge up and down I guess you could

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.590 
they hinge up and down I guess you could
count<00:04:34.070> the<00:04:34.160> articulated<00:04:34.700> jaw<00:04:34.880> from<00:04:35.120> moving<00:04:35.450> up

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600
