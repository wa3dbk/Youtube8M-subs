00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
and then eventually we will start

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.700 
and then eventually we will start
building<00:01:23.690> it<00:01:24.020> together<00:01:24.200> for<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.160> next<00:01:25.370> race

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
wheels we have Dunlop here

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.610 
wheels we have Dunlop here
that's<00:01:29.510> prepping<00:01:29.870> the<00:01:29.960> wheels<00:01:30.170> right<00:01:30.410> now

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
that's prepping the wheels right now

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.980 
that's prepping the wheels right now
getting<00:01:31.280> ready<00:01:31.460> for<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.730> next<00:01:31.910> race<00:01:32.120> so<00:01:32.840> when

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
getting ready for the next race so when

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.590 
getting ready for the next race so when
we<00:01:33.110> get<00:01:33.230> the<00:01:33.380> bike<00:01:33.590> all<00:01:33.860> apart<00:01:34.400> this<00:01:35.390> is

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
we get the bike all apart this is

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.510 
we get the bike all apart this is
actually<00:01:36.020> just<00:01:36.260> a<00:01:36.410> frame<00:01:36.650> this<00:01:36.890> is<00:01:37.040> how<00:01:37.220> far

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
actually just a frame this is how far

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.390 
actually just a frame this is how far
that<00:01:37.940> we<00:01:38.180> bring<00:01:38.390> it<00:01:38.510> down<00:01:38.540> to<00:01:38.960> and<00:01:39.400> obviously

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
that we bring it down to and obviously

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.030 
that we bring it down to and obviously
we<00:01:40.760> look<00:01:40.910> at<00:01:41.150> any<00:01:41.390> damage<00:01:42.020> of<00:01:42.230> the<00:01:42.380> frame<00:01:42.710> from

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
we look at any damage of the frame from

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.980 
we look at any damage of the frame from
the<00:01:43.159> race<00:01:43.340> and<00:01:43.760> then<00:01:44.300> we<00:01:44.420> go<00:01:44.570> from<00:01:44.720> there<00:01:44.810> and

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
the race and then we go from there and

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.860 
the race and then we go from there and
then<00:01:45.409> we<00:01:45.590> actually<00:01:45.740> scream<00:01:46.520> it<00:01:46.720> clean<00:01:47.720> it

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
then we actually scream it clean it

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.230 
then we actually scream it clean it
scrub<00:01:48.290> it<00:01:48.470> make<00:01:48.680> it<00:01:48.830> look<00:01:49.010> clean<00:01:49.190> new<00:01:49.760> brand

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
scrub it make it look clean new brand

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.870 
scrub it make it look clean new brand
new<00:01:50.420> and<00:01:50.690> then<00:01:50.900> assemble<00:01:51.710> all<00:01:52.190> the<00:01:52.430> parts<00:01:52.790> back

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
new and then assemble all the parts back

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.140 
new and then assemble all the parts back
on<00:01:53.240> to<00:01:53.480> it<00:01:53.600> again<00:01:53.840> we<00:01:54.470> clean<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:54.980> expect<00:01:55.550> every

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
on to it again we clean and expect every

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.480 
on to it again we clean and expect every
bolt<00:01:56.390> that<00:01:56.540> comes<00:01:56.570> off<00:01:56.900> the<00:01:57.020> bike<00:01:57.229> we<00:01:58.010> scrub<00:01:58.340> it

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
bolt that comes off the bike we scrub it

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.890 
bolt that comes off the bike we scrub it
we<00:01:58.729> look<00:01:58.909> at<00:01:59.090> it<00:01:59.300> make<00:01:59.510> sure<00:01:59.540> there's<00:01:59.780> no

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
we look at it make sure there's no

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.890 
we look at it make sure there's no
damage<00:02:00.110> any<00:02:01.010> rock<00:02:01.250> damage<00:02:01.760> or<00:02:02.090> anything<00:02:02.659> of

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
damage any rock damage or anything of

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.570 
damage any rock damage or anything of
that<00:02:02.990> aspect<00:02:03.440> and<00:02:03.680> then<00:02:04.190> we

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
that aspect and then we

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.790 
that aspect and then we
neatly<00:02:04.940> lay<00:02:05.240> everything<00:02:05.630> out<00:02:05.990> in<00:02:06.260> a<00:02:06.440> certain

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
neatly lay everything out in a certain

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.280 
neatly lay everything out in a certain
order<00:02:07.040> so<00:02:07.820> when<00:02:08.000> we<00:02:08.150> go<00:02:08.330> to<00:02:08.390> build<00:02:08.720> it's<00:02:09.080> that

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
order so when we go to build it's that

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.880 
order so when we go to build it's that
much<00:02:09.500> easier<00:02:09.740> to<00:02:10.190> to<00:02:11.120> assemble<00:02:11.570> so<00:02:12.170> obviously

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
much easier to to assemble so obviously

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.540 
much easier to to assemble so obviously
we<00:02:13.220> have<00:02:13.250> our<00:02:14.410> our<00:02:15.410> chassis<00:02:15.830> bolts<00:02:16.100> up<00:02:16.250> here

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
we have our our chassis bolts up here
