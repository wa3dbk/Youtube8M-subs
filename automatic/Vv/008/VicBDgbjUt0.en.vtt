00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
it's actually pretty simple so go into

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.350 
it's actually pretty simple so go into
your<00:00:46.440> server<00:00:46.770> your<00:00:47.520> server<00:00:47.760> build<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.180> one

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
your server your server build this one

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.260 
your server your server build this one
is<00:00:48.710> if<00:00:49.710> you're<00:00:50.010> up<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:50.940> one's<00:00:51.180> a

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
is if you're up on it this one's a

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.760 
is if you're up on it this one's a
little<00:00:51.390> bit<00:00:51.570> out<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.719> date<00:00:51.870> but<00:00:52.260> that's<00:00:52.530> fine

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
little bit out of date but that's fine

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.200 
little bit out of date but that's fine
it<00:00:52.920> still<00:00:53.160> works<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.520> same<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.000> go<00:00:54.120> to

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
it still works the same so you go to

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.790 
it still works the same so you go to
plugins<00:00:54.570> then<00:00:55.230> you're<00:00:55.320> gonna<00:00:55.410> find<00:00:55.620> your

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
plugins then you're gonna find your

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.160 
plugins then you're gonna find your
essentials<00:00:56.629> then<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.690> got<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.899> find<00:00:58.050> your

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.200 
all your other group should inherit from
and<00:01:40.020> now<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.740> will<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:41.100> give<00:01:41.280> your<00:01:41.820> users

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
and now that will just give your users

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.929 
and now that will just give your users
access<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.500> warp<00:01:43.740> command<00:01:44.250> but<00:01:44.790> it's

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
access to the the warp command but it's

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.020 
access to the the warp command but it's
not<00:01:45.090> going<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.979> specify<00:01:46.979> which<00:01:47.250> warps<00:01:47.850> they

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.060 
not going to specify which warps they
can<00:01:48.360> warp<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.500> could<00:01:49.619> give<00:01:49.770> them<00:01:49.860> that

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070
