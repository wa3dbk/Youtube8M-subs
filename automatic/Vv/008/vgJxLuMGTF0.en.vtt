00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:46.359 
I had said in the other video I kind of

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:49.060 
I had said in the other video I kind of
bypassed<00:00:47.359> part<00:00:47.839> of<00:00:47.989> the<00:00:48.079> game<00:00:48.289> on<00:00:48.499> accidents

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
that did some benchmarking and for some

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:51.910 
that did some benchmarking and for some
reason<00:00:50.719> to<00:00:51.079> brings<00:00:51.260> you<00:00:51.379> to<00:00:51.530> the<00:00:51.620> end<00:00:51.739> of<00:00:51.859> the

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
reason to brings you to the end of the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.090 
reason to brings you to the end of the
game<00:00:51.949> and<00:00:52.370> it<00:00:53.269> I<00:00:53.539> didn't<00:00:54.350> get<00:00:54.409> the<00:00:54.559> play<00:00:54.769> out<00:00:54.980> of

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
game and it I didn't get the play out of

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.899 
game and it I didn't get the play out of
the<00:00:55.159> game<00:00:55.309> so<00:00:57.100> let's<00:00:58.100> just<00:00:58.309> make<00:00:58.429> sure<00:00:58.489> this<00:00:58.760> is

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
the game so let's just make sure this is

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:18.540 
the game so let's just make sure this is
working<00:00:59.120> properly

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.520 

it's<00:01:19.090> kind<00:01:19.210> of<00:01:19.300> weird<00:01:19.510> it's<00:01:19.660> kind<00:01:19.930> of<00:01:20.020> weird<00:01:20.410> on

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
it's kind of weird it's kind of weird on

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.070 
it's kind of weird it's kind of weird on
the<00:01:20.560> frames<00:01:20.920> there<00:01:21.160> for<00:01:21.370> a<00:01:21.400> second<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.960> it's

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
the frames there for a second so it's

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.330 
the frames there for a second so it's
kind<00:01:26.260> of<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.440> same<00:01:26.590> spot<00:01:26.860> i<00:01:26.890> was<00:01:27.100> any<00:01:27.250> other

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
kind of the same spot i was any other

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:47.700 
kind of the same spot i was any other
day

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.430 

it's<00:01:48.310> a<00:01:48.340> great<00:01:48.580> game

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.380 

this<00:01:51.950> game<00:01:52.160> definitely<00:01:52.370> does<00:01:52.730> not<00:01:52.760> look<00:01:52.970> as

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
this game definitely does not look as

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.520 
this game definitely does not look as
good<00:01:55.300> at<00:01:56.890> 1920<00:01:57.890> x<00:01:58.010> 1080<00:01:58.660> or<00:01:59.660> get<00:01:59.870> major<00:02:00.110> frame

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
good at 1920 x 1080 or get major frame

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.510 
good at 1920 x 1080 or get major frame
rate<00:02:00.850> adjustments<00:02:02.590> I'm<00:02:03.590> gonna<00:02:03.800> think<00:02:04.100> that<00:02:04.310> is

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
rate adjustments I'm gonna think that is

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.050 
rate adjustments I'm gonna think that is
still<00:02:05.000> I<00:02:05.980> still<00:02:06.980> amazed<00:02:07.610> that<00:02:07.700> they<00:02:07.850> haven't

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
still I still amazed that they haven't

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.210 
still I still amazed that they haven't
come<00:02:08.119> out<00:02:08.240> with<00:02:08.360> new<00:02:08.479> drivers<00:02:08.869> yet<00:02:09.110> I<00:02:09.380> mean<00:02:10.070> we

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
come out with new drivers yet I mean we

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.360 
come out with new drivers yet I mean we
got<00:02:10.399> one<00:02:10.670> driver<00:02:10.910> since<00:02:11.360> this<00:02:11.510> card<00:02:11.810> came<00:02:12.050> out

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
got one driver since this card came out

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.230 
got one driver since this card came out
but<00:02:13.370> not<00:02:13.490> a<00:02:13.550> while<00:02:13.820> now<00:02:15.700> kind<00:02:16.700> of<00:02:16.730> pisses<00:02:17.060> me

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
but not a while now kind of pisses me

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:27.990 
but not a while now kind of pisses me
off<00:02:18.970> what<00:02:19.970> is<00:02:20.600> what<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:20.930> is

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.930 

I'm<00:03:02.330> a<00:03:02.390> weird<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.810> fluctuation

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:23.620
