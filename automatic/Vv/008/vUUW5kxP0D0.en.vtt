00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
does go towards that side however it

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.160 
does go towards that side however it
does<00:00:20.160> fall<00:00:20.340> into<00:00:20.520> my<00:00:20.609> eyes<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.850> lot<00:00:21.119> when<00:00:22.050> I'm

I blow dry sideways until it is
completely<00:00:26.310> dry<00:00:26.630> so<00:00:27.630> here's<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.529> quick<00:00:28.710> way

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
completely dry so here's the quick way

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.220 
completely dry so here's the quick way
it's<00:00:29.070> really<00:00:29.220> quick<00:00:29.810> generally<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:30.840> like<00:00:31.109> to

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
it's really quick generally I like to

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.170 
it's really quick generally I like to
think<00:00:31.439> about<00:00:31.470> doing<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.219> sections<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.000> like

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
think about doing it in sections so like

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.250 
think about doing it in sections so like
the<00:00:33.300> bottom<00:00:33.660> layer<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.489> then<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.579> top<00:00:35.790> layer

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
the bottom layer and then the top layer

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.569 
the bottom layer and then the top layer
so<00:00:37.260> I'd<00:00:37.649> start<00:00:38.070> out<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.340> bottom<00:00:38.670> layer<00:00:40.579> pull

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
so I'd start out the bottom layer pull

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.069 
so I'd start out the bottom layer pull
it<00:00:41.730> up<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:43.160> slightly<00:00:44.160> bend<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.360> then<00:00:45.420> use

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
it up and slightly bend it and then use

00:00:46.079 --> 00:01:01.270 
it up and slightly bend it and then use
my<00:00:46.110> hands<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.590> mold<00:00:46.890> my<00:00:47.070> bangs

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.039 

that's<00:01:02.280> basically<00:01:02.640> how<00:01:02.760> i<00:01:02.940> stream<00:01:03.360> my<00:01:03.390> bangs

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
that's basically how i stream my bangs

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.109 
that's basically how i stream my bangs
depending<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.530> how<00:01:04.710> curly<00:01:05.159> Obama<00:01:05.460> thinks<00:01:05.940> just

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
depending on how curly Obama thinks just

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.550

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
depends on how much I curl my

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.680 
depends on how much I curl my
straightener<00:01:07.979> inwards<00:01:08.460> another<00:01:09.180> method<00:01:09.600> I

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
straightener inwards another method I

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.100
