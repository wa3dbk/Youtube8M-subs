00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.110
 hello friends of learning 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.630
 Beauty dotcom Today I'll teach 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.510
 make this color with highlight I hope 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.420
 what they like 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.389
 let's start making a rectangle 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.660
 at the top from the crown 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.450
 up to the front we make some lines 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.450
 horizontal and we are taking the hair 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.720
 that we want to discolor the mixture that 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:31.230
 I did it was dye + 20 peroxide 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.710
 volumes because the lines do not 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.199
 I want so clear later I did it 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.720
 the diagnosis to the hair and threw me 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:43.559
 as a result the hair has a 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:47.010
 height 6 has an orange pigmentation 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.470
 and has a centimeter of root this what 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.210
 we have to do to know what the 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.519
 procedure that we are going to follow 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.299
 depending on the desire tone of our 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:59.580
 client the desire tone is a height 6 

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:04.600
 So we're going to work on a tone about 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:08.170
 tone but with less orange pigmentation 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:13.450
 the mix that we are going to make then is 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:18.340
 a tube of 6 natural plus a tube of 7 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.730
 natural + 2 centimeters of hue 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.730
 blue 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:27.020
 this is this mixture we are going to work with 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:29.510
 peroxide of 20 volumes remember that 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.090
 the blue tone neutralizes the orange tone 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.700
 so that is going to help us eliminate 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.690
 a little bit the orange hue that 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.690
 presents in the hair 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.310
 We are finishing up assembly 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.140
 in the upper part 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.080
 remember we take hair in the form of 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.250
 zigzag so that the wicks are not visible 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.250
 too thick 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.540
 now let's draw some lines of 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.050
 very thin hair diagonally 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.050
 on the sides 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.410
 we go to the other side and do the 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.830
 same very thin lines of 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.830
 hair 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.299
 we finished the paper assembly 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.060
 aluminum we only did it in the part 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.140
 superior and laterals this will bring 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.170
 light to color 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.620
 We will leave these tables to a 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.739
 height 8 the tone desire is let's do 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.230
 the color application the application is 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.720
 directly so we're going to 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.599
 apply the dye from the root to the 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.690
 tip and we'll start with the part 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:23.260
 superior being very careful with the 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.260
 aluminum 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.780
 then apply to the sides and by 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.640
 last we apply the back 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.870
 remember what we are going to do in 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:56.510
 direct from root to ends because the color 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.790
 it's a tone on tone and the mix was 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.909
 made with 20 volume peroxide 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.319
 then we will not have any risk 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:08.260
 that the root gets lighter too 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.540
 the high the rayitos are also with 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.019
 the color before was done with 20 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.269
 volumes there is no risk of it happening or 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.269
 that are clarified a lot in the rays the 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.250
 discoloration 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.039
 anyways whenever we apply 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.979
 a decolorizer on the hair 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:28.229
 we must always be alert and 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.150
 go opening the foil and looking 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.150
 the height at which the 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.770
 we want to arrive so that it does not happen to us 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.770
 and so get what we want 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.690
 we are going to leave a time of exposure of 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:09.500
 35 minutes , let's do it and I'll show you 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.500
 the result
