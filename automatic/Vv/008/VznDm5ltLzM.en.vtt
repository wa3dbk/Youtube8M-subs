00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.130
 during the chorus 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.140
 before initiatives or good he does in 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:21.779
 that part the goods we touch in the sixth 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.779
 or the seventh and the sixth is 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.450
 and what we do say two sharp 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.450
 less 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.470
 and here you can choose what to play 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.780
 it depends what version they are doing touching 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.610
 mass 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.610
 more arpeggio touching it 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.980
 with a strum all just happen 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.440
 Time company nutrients can choose 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.660
 randomly in its normal version 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.030
 the version they want but basically 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.020
 is that 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.020
 and it goes do sharp minor 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.310
 by sustained fa 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.129
 so it's worth 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.910
 and at the least 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.320
 we are basically in line let's go 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.250
 release the 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.250
 and the third string 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.700
 when we release we emphasize this 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.150
 part in the third rope so that it goes up 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.150
 in the change 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.700
 after the youngest we go again 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.700
 to do sharp minor 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.000
 we return to fa 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.100
 and when the part to find 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.729
 it's not today we're going to the 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.729
 the biggest 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:49.820
 and we went down we went down a sun I had it 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.820
 we repeat again we go to the 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.960
 let's talk again 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.360
 and it returns me the smaller sharp we're going to 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.080
 the same note we had seen before 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.080
 A) Yes 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.899
 and we finish again as we finalize 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.650
 how it ends let's go before we go again 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.650
 all that part 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.909
 the 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.380
 yes 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.140
 and we finished in me 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.140
 and little and he alone
