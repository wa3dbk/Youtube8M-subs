00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.820
 Honda Dio 110 comfortable fast specification 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.500
 of 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:16.190
 I will introduce you a few tips 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.190
 First of all, that power silent muffler 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.450
 this 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.020
 Mochi 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.500
 To have breakfast 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.500
 Say this 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:33.840
 I thought it was stuffed inside 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:36.960
 I actually put something that has a certain meaning 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.129
 So the current specification is 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.129
 For example Well this kind of feeling 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:47.050
 What 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:51.400
 This is a medium to low speed specification 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:56.080
 Somewhat not- so-so-called baffles 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.980
 It is not for the purpose of reducing odo, but for producing torque. 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.420
 About this positive 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.420
 I have this to see 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:10.240
 I put what I cut in aluminum 

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:12.290
 I do not have a little gone relation to the friend I'd have is another one type real in 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.250
 Well like this 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.250
 Yeah it is 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:24.590
 So this is 9 inside that 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.590
 Further incense a 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.600
 I am a person who always works 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:36.040
 It is actually this length's 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:42.490
 This stuffing can be easily done 5 but it is a baffle 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:45.100
 There are two other types of purpose in this, one is medium and low speed type 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.030
 This will be the medium or low speed type in 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.690
 The earlier high speed type 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.940
 It is such a thing 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:57.560
 Such as the 8 funnel to the back and forth 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:03.610
 I have something to wear 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:06.430
 If you guys bought this muffler, I would like you to take it a little 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.700
 If you think 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.970
 5 easy to do this 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.140
 I can do it 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.690
 The size of the system without this 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.060
 20 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.060
 Is it about 5 well 5.5? 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.540
 Great Tengu 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.989
 There I No. 2 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.989
 Measure well 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.410
 10 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.290
 This is it 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.630
 It is about after rolling over, the inside diameter is good 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.840
 In a 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.530
 Zu' in the smallest of the site of ana 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.530
 Is 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:01.440
 This is 2016 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:04.140
 XVI in practice this is not cry Maybe just a good feeling 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.500
 16 centimeters of ground a 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.500
 Color 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:17.360
 I think that the best tone and put shaving 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:20.080
 I can not put out the sound for a while now, but I 'm going to pull this out 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.770
 After all registration of torque and soup stock 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.770
 I will run short 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:31.670
 Specifically, it feels like I won't be able to advance a little while ago when the accelerator is twisted 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.510
 Type of fast 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.010
 It's just a bit earlier 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:43.010
 If you put this 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:47.450
 Intermediate, which surely put something of this low and medium low-speed type and pulled out completely unexpected it is around the middle 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:53.100
 It is a point, but in fact the highest speed comes out best 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:58.110
 Yeah example get what caught or that this baffle this over 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:02.460
 It's about 100 f af you get it 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:05.640
 It is about 1076 in flat ground 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.870
 In this state, I say something like 104 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.549
 It doesn't change much, though 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:15.420
 It is and still overall difference will the way, pull out fast day 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:19.310
 After all it is late to the maximum speed 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:22.120
 Because this usage has a displacement of 110 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.540
 Maybe 125 and Kano Boaappukitto 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:31.190
 Perhaps Well, with respect to the case that has received the 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:35.990
 I'd say even if Well completely remove gone to the high-speed type, even nice to reverse now 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:39.560
 However, it is certain that this is still absolutely fine 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:44.700
 If everyone seems to be wearing a muffler between bamboos 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:46.780
 Well maybe even if this pipe diameter matches the address and other bikes 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:54.900
 Because there Oh 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:54.900
 Will also be a little quiet there if perhaps fairly teaching becomes I think so sound try to put 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.509
 In the
