clear your SUVs I notice select to do it
in<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.849> video<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.360> I<00:00:12.900> thought<00:00:13.799> there's<00:00:14.009> some

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
in the video and I thought there's some

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.430 
in the video and I thought there's some
really<00:00:14.219> good<00:00:14.370> application<00:00:14.969> for<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.350> so<00:00:16.350> we're

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
really good application for it so we're

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.599 
really good application for it so we're
going<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.619> pretend<00:00:16.830> this<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.100> my<00:00:17.130> main<00:00:17.400> base

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
going to pretend this is my main base

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.640 
going to pretend this is my main base
here<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.480> my<00:00:18.600> ramp<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:19.080> has<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.230> bunker

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
here this is my ramp that has a bunker

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.990 
here this is my ramp that has a bunker
as<00:00:19.770> part<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.160> wall<00:00:20.279> off<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.880> my

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
as part of the wall off and this is my

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.790 
as part of the wall off and this is my
natural<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:21.990> when<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.230> have<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.470> bunker<00:00:22.710> as

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
natural so when you have the bunker as

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.320 
natural so when you have the bunker as
part<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.160> wall<00:00:23.340> off<00:00:23.519> there's<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.910> kind<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.269> a

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
part of the wall off there's a kind of a

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.589 
part of the wall off there's a kind of a
trick<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.660> can<00:00:24.779> do<00:00:25.820> so<00:00:26.820> just<00:00:26.939> say<00:00:27.119> Ling's<00:00:27.359> come

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
trick you can do so just say Ling's come

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.589 
trick you can do so just say Ling's come
plug-in<00:00:27.990> on<00:00:28.140> your<00:00:28.320> natural<00:00:28.650> base<00:00:28.859> here<00:00:29.220> and

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
plug-in on your natural base here and

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.120 
plug-in on your natural base here and
then<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.750> see<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.619> try<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.830> get

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
then you see that and you try to get

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.040 
then you see that and you try to get

please yes P is the high ground the arm
is<00:00:34.170> on<00:00:34.290> position<00:00:34.800> or<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.100> can't<00:00:35.309> handle<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.730> or

you can see that they well I got trapped
under<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.740> wings<00:01:34.890> but<00:01:41.240> they're<00:01:42.240> able<00:01:42.390> to

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
under the wings but they're able to

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.210 
under the wings but they're able to
flood<00:01:42.840> right<00:01:43.050> through<00:01:45.170> now<00:01:46.170> if<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.440> often<00:01:46.770> use

your main are you natural there's a way

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.780 
your main are you natural there's a way
to<00:01:51.630> speed<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.140> up<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:53.430> way<00:01:53.550> I<00:01:53.580> suggest

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
to speed this up and the way I suggest

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.970 
to speed this up and the way I suggest
you<00:01:54.090> do<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:56.210> is<00:01:57.380> make<00:01:58.380> sure<00:01:58.410> your<00:01:58.680> bunkers

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
you do this is make sure your bunkers

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.410 
you do this is make sure your bunkers
never<00:01:59.190> full<00:02:00.260> so<00:02:01.260> even<00:02:01.650> if<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.800> have<00:02:01.890> three<00:02:02.010> it

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
never full so even if you have three it

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.760 
never full so even if you have three it
Marines<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.750> this<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.020> fine<00:02:06.530> this<00:02:07.530> allows

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
Marines in it this is fine this allows

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.320 
Marines in it this is fine this allows
you<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:07.950> do<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.429> lot<00:02:08.670> quicker<00:02:08.850> all<00:02:09.240> you

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
you to do this a lot quicker all you

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.510 
you to do this a lot quicker all you
have<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.510> do<00:02:09.630> is<00:02:10.070> when<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:11.160> Ling's<00:02:11.340> and

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
have to do is when the Ling's and

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.660 
have to do is when the Ling's and
Bailey's<00:02:11.760> come<00:02:11.880> rolling<00:02:12.150> in<00:02:13.670> just

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
Bailey's come rolling in just

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.400 
Bailey's come rolling in just
right-click<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.180> bunker<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.260> rally

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
right-click the bunker so the rally

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:25.570 
right-click the bunker so the rally
point<00:02:16.500> out<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.100> hold<00:02:17.250> down<00:02:17.400> team

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.760 

the<00:02:26.580> difference<00:02:26.880> is<00:02:27.080> if<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.260> bunker<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:28.620> full

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
the difference is if the bunker is full

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.320 
the difference is if the bunker is full
and<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:28.980> right-click<00:02:29.160> your<00:02:29.460> SUVs<00:02:29.880> on<00:02:30.120> this

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
and you right-click your SUVs on this

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.600 
and you right-click your SUVs on this
bunker<00:02:31.110> they<00:02:31.350> won't<00:02:31.530> know<00:02:31.710> to<00:02:31.770> load<00:02:32.100> inside<00:02:32.460> of

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
bunker they won't know to load inside of

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.280 
bunker they won't know to load inside of
it<00:02:32.760> that's<00:02:33.120> just<00:02:33.360> actually<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.720> space<00:02:34.020> so<00:02:34.230> as

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
it that's just actually a space so as

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.430 
it that's just actually a space so as
long<00:02:34.410> as<00:02:34.500> there's<00:02:34.680> one<00:02:34.710> space<00:02:35.100> you<00:02:35.280> can<00:02:35.400> do<00:02:35.520> it

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.240 

so<00:02:40.440> I'm<00:02:40.500> gonna<00:02:40.590> show<00:02:40.740> you<00:02:40.800> that<00:02:40.950> one<00:02:41.070> more<00:02:41.190> time

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
so I'm gonna show you that one more time

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:48.020 
so I'm gonna show you that one more time
if<00:02:41.730> if<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.630> bunker<00:02:42.930> is<00:02:42.990> full<00:02:46.850> right-click<00:02:47.850> the

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
if if the bunker is full right-click the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.390 
if if the bunker is full right-click the
bunker<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:48.600> go<00:02:49.440> like<00:02:49.560> this<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:49.890> hold<00:02:50.070> down<00:02:50.160> D

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
bunker I go like this and hold down D

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.280 
bunker I go like this and hold down D
these<00:02:51.000> SUVs<00:02:51.360> don't<00:02:51.750> know<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:51.959> go<00:02:52.200> in<00:02:52.380> yet<00:02:54.290> maybe

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
these SUVs don't know to go in yet maybe

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.510 
these SUVs don't know to go in yet maybe
shift<00:02:55.680> actually<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:57.890> guess<00:02:58.890> then<00:02:59.100> shook<00:02:59.310> like<00:02:59.459> a

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
shift actually I guess then shook like a

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.570 
shift actually I guess then shook like a
bunch

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
bunch

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.500 
bunch
hold<00:03:02.330> it<00:03:02.450> down<00:03:02.540> D<00:03:03.880> now<00:03:04.880> they<00:03:05.060> still<00:03:05.210> don't<00:03:05.330> know

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
hold it down D now they still don't know

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.720 
hold it down D now they still don't know
so<00:03:06.410> you<00:03:06.440> need<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.740> space<00:03:07.040> available<00:03:07.430> so<00:03:07.580> as<00:03:07.640> long

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
so you need a space available so as long

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.160 
so you need a space available so as long
as<00:03:07.790> there's<00:03:08.000> at<00:03:08.090> least<00:03:08.150> one<00:03:08.450> space<00:03:08.690> available

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
as there's at least one space available

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.480 
as there's at least one space available
more<00:03:11.470> when<00:03:12.470> you're<00:03:12.560> fleeing<00:03:12.770> s<00:03:13.010> visas

more when you're fleeing s visas
right-click<00:03:14.060> them<00:03:14.210> on<00:03:14.330> the<00:03:14.420> bunker<00:03:14.830> set<00:03:15.830> there

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
right-click them on the bunker set there

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.460 
right-click them on the bunker set there
I<00:03:16.040> went<00:03:16.310> inside<00:03:16.460> your<00:03:16.730> base<00:03:16.850> hold<00:03:17.390> down<00:03:17.570> to<00:03:17.750> eat

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470

in to speed so I'll a second gotta run

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.670 
in to speed so I'll a second gotta run
over<00:04:04.870> here<00:04:06.450> hold<00:04:07.450> down<00:04:07.540> the<00:04:07.810> D<00:04:07.840> button

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.649 

and<00:04:11.010> everything's<00:04:11.670> handing<00:04:11.939> away<00:04:12.030> safely<00:04:12.450> and

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 
and everything's handing away safely and

and everything's handing away safely and
they<00:04:12.720> even<00:04:13.019> put<00:04:13.110> these<00:04:13.319> guys<00:04:13.470> I'll<00:04:13.680> repair

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.770 

this<00:04:28.310> works<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.640> same<00:04:28.790> if<00:04:29.000> you<00:04:29.120> use<00:04:29.390> a<00:04:29.480> bunker

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
this works the same if you use a bunker

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.210 
this works the same if you use a bunker
as<00:04:29.840> five<00:04:30.020> your<00:04:30.200> ramp<00:04:30.350> but<00:04:30.560> it's<00:04:30.680> your<00:04:30.860> natural

as five your ramp but it's your natural

as five your ramp but it's your natural
base<00:04:31.670> sometimes<00:04:32.240> people<00:04:32.570> do<00:04:32.720> that<00:04:32.840> the

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
base sometimes people do that the

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.670 
base sometimes people do that the

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
natural outside of their natural I mean

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.660 
natural outside of their natural I mean
you<00:04:36.680> me<00:04:36.800> the<00:04:36.890> same<00:04:37.040> thing<00:04:37.190> to<00:04:37.280> flood<00:04:37.490> these

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
you me the same thing to flood these

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.300 
you me the same thing to flood these
SUVs<00:04:38.030> and<00:04:38.360> I<00:04:38.510> think<00:04:38.890> this<00:04:39.890> is<00:04:40.040> more<00:04:40.190> the

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
SUVs and I think this is more the

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.470 
SUVs and I think this is more the
scenario<00:04:40.610> I<00:04:40.670> think<00:04:40.730> what<00:04:41.030> makes<00:04:41.150> a<00:04:41.240> lot<00:04:41.450> more

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
scenario I think what makes a lot more

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:48.720 
scenario I think what makes a lot more
