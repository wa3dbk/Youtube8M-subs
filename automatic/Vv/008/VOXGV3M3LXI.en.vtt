00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.220
 iomega sanac hayes i hope you 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.869
 listen well it's going quiet 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.580
 we find ourselves today for a 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.099
 new video on call of duty black 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.540
 ops 2 of the good black ops them both guys 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.040
 to put you in front of you I think 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.390
 that there really is nothing better being 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.610
 given that a lot of you are 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.750
 disappointed su by call of duty kid and that's 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.489
 for that reason that today bah 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.290
 listen I propose black ops 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.550
 fingers hoping that this gameplay you 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.230
 please be aware that it is not a 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.120
 exceptional gameplay it's just a 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.070
 small nuclear double in support so 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.420
 certainly it is really a very beautiful 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.100
 gameplay to see in any case I 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.449
 think you'll like it and besides 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.680
 you will see that at certain times 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.480
 bah listen I 'm going to have a little bit 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.219
 to make a little bit of an excuse 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.420
 me to make kills because that 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.920
 I'm going to put them 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.660
 still a beautiful spanking you go 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.980
 see in any case I hope this 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.690
 gameplay you would like to know 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.620
 that my class will be displayed on the screen for 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.160
 all the people who will be 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.470
 interested 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.270
 to reproduce the same type of 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.800
 gameplay with the same class and then 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.090
 here are the guys so listen in this 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.070
 video I'm just going to make you 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.689
 from a small piece of information 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.460
 know that this information is according 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.020
 me important enough and that's by the way 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.670
 for that you may have noticed 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.259
 the introduction of several channels 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.939
 at the beginning of the video 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.649
 I try my luck because here I am 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.000
 still think of having a good gameplay to 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.409
 to put you under the eyes is also 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.420
 a good subject for comment and who can 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.680
 to interest a lot of the community call 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.240
 of duty you have to know that this 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.340
 information is simply 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.350
 the appearance of a 3rd studio of 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.820
 development of video games and more 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.070
 especially of call of duty 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.259
 so it is true that this year 2014 we 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.810
 all expected to see an opus produced 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.000
 developed somehow from a by 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.140
 treyarch as usual at last from the 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.180
 least I wanted to say that before 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.520
 expected a game be developed by 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.829
 treyarch either by infinity ward it takes 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.270
 know that this year 2014 will be a 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.640
 year in a way that will welcome 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.380
 a new development studio for 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.880
 a new call of duty finally new in 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.310
 somehow since it is true that the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.780
 name was not necessarily announced finally 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.550
 it was announced but I do not know if 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.980
 it's info or intox and modern 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.090
 in phase 4 along the game you have to know 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.000
 that the new development studio 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.950
 is called sledgehammer games so that's 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.349
 a studio that has already worked for call 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.330
 of duty modern warfare 3 due precisely to 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.190
 choice of their name who finally has the world 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.600
 their opus names that will be modern in 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.370
 phase iv so that I do not know how I 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.620
 told you if it's intoxicating or 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.660
 the actual info but in any case I 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.280
 can you make sure I think it's okay 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.870
 really be a very good call of duty 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.790
 since call of duty modern 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.470
 warfare 3 had been really good 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.270
 achieved at the multiplayer level there 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.670
 must know that sledge hammer games 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.830
 was based on modern warfare 3 on 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.450
 multiplayer is also on the mode 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.010
 survival so I think they have when 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.270
 even well worked on me 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.280
 personally I was really very 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.050
 satisfied with multiplayer mode and 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.640
 survival of call of duty modern warfare 3 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.130
 of which there is no reason that call of 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.600
 duty modern warfare four baths either 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.100
 not good and besides I really think 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.300
 that it can be a very good thing to 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.250
 add a studio simply 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.959
 since well that's it can bring back a 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.670
 little bit of renewal in the series 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.100
 of call of duty since that's every 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.810
 development studio to his style of 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.459
 gameplay that is that I ben voila 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.320
 think that to one him bah you see 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.420
 simply if it's a game produced 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.010
 by treyarch or not by infinity 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.340
 ward is precisely the fact of adding 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.290
 a new development studio for 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.450
 a little bit so brought a little bit of 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.190
 renewal to the opuses of call of duty which 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.959
 I think I really need it since 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.370
 here I think that right now here is 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.080
 on the call of duty we have a little bit 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.160
 go around we saw a little bit of everything 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.989
 and I think this studio of 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.730
 development not a little bit brought back from 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.140
 renewal is also there is a very 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.910
 big point stressed I think 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.980
 personally it's going to be a point 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.989
 one of the most important to welcome a 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.730
 third development studio it's going 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.890
 simply be the time to create 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.180
 develop a new game given 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.070
 that before bah listen we only had 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.450
 two development studios he had 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.910
 only a name once after the 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.730
 release of the game to create develop and 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.440
 improve their opus which will be theirs 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.239
 next and even saw that now we 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.430
 will have three children we will have three studios 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.050
 excuse me from game development they 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.980
 just have two years to well 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.019
 work their game 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.420
 so be it at the level of 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.010
 the graphics connection concerns and 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.360
 I think it can really 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.430
 to be very good to have a third 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.930
 studio at the time they will have 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.729
 to create and improve and develop 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.770
 their game so that's really for me 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.930
 really a very big point taken by 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.910
 precisely the addition of a studio 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.740
 development is also seen that it's going 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.720
 to be a modern in phase 4 at least and 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.370
 it is suspected that this is a call of 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.590
 Duty Modern Warfare four maybe 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.670
 it will simply be an opus is so 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.770
 a mode a hell that will be resumed 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.180
 at the level of graphics etc at the level of 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.660
 movements finally brief at the level of 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.940
 gameplay 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.830
 maybe it will be really taken over and 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.150
 based on old call of duty modern 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.740
 warfare that I think it's really 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.540
 a thing that will please a lot of 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.330
 people if it's set up since 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.860
 here is a code 4 mw of mw3 not least 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.480
 I really had rare returns 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.640
 negatives on these games there is precisely 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.560
 I think so modern in phase iv is 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:03.100
 in a way a mix of call of duty 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.480
 modern warfare 1 code 4 mw 2 and mw3 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.770
 I think it can really be a 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.690
 very good thing after you have to know 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.250
 that it will not really be based on 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.290
 call of duty kid then so maybe 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.790
 that it will make us want to all 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.380
 play to call of duty me personally 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.730
 must know that I lost a little bit 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.590
 quickly played it to call of duty duo 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.320
 last opus which was call of duty 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.420
 ghost then afterwards remains to know if that 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.070
 remains games will be based in the future 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.410
 only on the modes one hell 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.690
 infinity ward on the call of duty ghost 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.760
 or so treyarch on the blackhawks of 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.230
 anyway I think treyarch will be 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.060
 always based on the blacks off but 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.920
 does infinity ward and sledgehammer 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.930
 games have again associated 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.760
 maybe for a future opus that we do not 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.440
 know nothing and also guys before 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.060
 you let go I think we really do 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.370
 well also years still has the 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.230
 point out that fashion lovers 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.490
 zombies will be really disappointed duo 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.500
 next chip that will not welcome 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.970
 surely no zombie fashion given 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.040
 that normally ben here he was expecting 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.660
 all to have a black ops is so to have 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.730
 a new zombie fashion well innovate and 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.840
 cetera they will have to wait for it again 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.850
 is the most and that I find a little bit 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.620
 pity considering that zombie mode 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.110
 had taken a lot of scale at the 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.180
 this is simply appreciation 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.620
 of the community I think a lot of 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.490
 loved people bursting into zombies 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.530
 with his paws and there he will have to 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.760
 wait a year more to really play 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.350
 actually in zombie mode then 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.450
 maybe just like in the old 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.230
 call of duty and old opus dig 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.700
 finish wars 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.680
 there may be some operations 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.900
 special either of the survival month or so 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.280
 yet another innovation similar to the 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.100
 zombie mode in special operations mode 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.300
 or so in the survival mode this the future 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.160
 also can tell us 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.870
 and then here are the guys so listen I 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.550
 have finished for the video I hope in 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.200
 all the cases that you will have liked if
