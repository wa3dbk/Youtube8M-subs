00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:12.809
 preview this time speedcuber ultimate 44 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.590
 and yes I will show you quickly 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:20.580
 also very much better at this help what 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.640
 So, almost not at all and something out 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.130
 has and what does not 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.400
 let's start right now I'll start with 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.780
 What it has to live long live 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.020
 Not so good, anyway 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:44.360
 Do not turn off and are so right 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.360
 go then yes the ride division is the same 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:01:01.710
 keep it normal then yes was with me 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.750
 early on it felt like before 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.229
 and I'm not sure if that's the case 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:12.450
 was 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:15.350
 he turns it right is also 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:20.360
 not too expensive i came to kubi 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:24.049
 I will post the link below 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.820
 with those can be very good 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:30.840
 speedcubern 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:33.350
 and then we'll go with that 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.350
 to compare 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:42.680
 he is big take her 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:49.420
 the colors are similar balance 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.540
 just another one a bit 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.300
 They do not do that bad to each other 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:00.610
 therefore, there is no running for the other one 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:02.190
 stuck and then the Briton sees 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:11.020
 bit out 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:19.500
 That's because of the mechanics always when you are 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:26.470
 I am that is the part of that now 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:29.890
 that is the part of the see 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.380
 actually exactly the same with that 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.230
 So I'm not allowed to china, I know 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:44.860
 not a dice is this part 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:49.270
 a bit wider and that has to be different 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.850
 a bit, but not even that 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:03:00.160
 See if I can still keep it kiwis 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:03:03.300
 That's why this wound looks from the inside 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.300
 cone as always 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:20.450
 that then I will, that's it 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.450
 sometimes fast together 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:51.110
 yes that would have been I am very 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:51.110
 Satisfied with this a bit of exercise
