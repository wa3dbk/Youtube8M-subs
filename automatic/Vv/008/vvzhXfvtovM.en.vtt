00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
shouldn't have to worry about these

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.429 
shouldn't have to worry about these
about<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.789> zerglings<00:00:30.029> too<00:00:30.990> much<00:00:31.170> anymore

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
about the zerglings too much anymore

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.799 
about the zerglings too much anymore
unless<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:32.099> mean<00:00:32.579> player<00:00:33.180> one<00:00:33.360> just<00:00:33.540> comes<00:00:33.660> in

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
unless I mean player one just comes in

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.229 
unless I mean player one just comes in
here<00:00:33.960> with<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.110> massive<00:00:34.500> amount<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.340> banelings

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
here with a massive amount of banelings

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.000 
here with a massive amount of banelings
which<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.600> don't<00:00:36.780> see<00:00:36.960> him<00:00:37.079> doing<00:00:37.260> any<00:00:37.739> time

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
which I don't see him doing any time

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.750 
which I don't see him doing any time
soon<00:00:38.340> as<00:00:38.520> he<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.879> he<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.329> behind<00:00:39.629> on<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.899> tech

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
soon as he is he is behind on the tech

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.180 
soon as he is he is behind on the tech
so<00:00:41.870> we've<00:00:42.870> got<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> spire<00:00:43.440> coming<00:00:43.800> out<00:00:43.920> which<00:00:44.160> is

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
so we've got a spire coming out which is

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.090 
so we've got a spire coming out which is
the<00:00:44.520> correct<00:00:45.120> move<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.930> do<00:00:46.110> especially<00:00:46.620> if

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
the correct move to do especially if

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.380 
the correct move to do especially if
your<00:00:47.250> opponent<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:49.190> you<00:00:50.190> know

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
your opponent is going a you know

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.939 
your opponent is going a you know
banelings<00:00:51.390> are<00:00:51.660> going<00:00:51.870> over<00:00:52.079> here<00:00:52.289> because

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
banelings are going over here because

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.619 
banelings are going over here because
they<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.399> know<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.610> course<00:00:53.789> can<00:00:54.090> attack<00:00:54.360> air

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
they you know of course can attack air

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.639 
they you know of course can attack air
and<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.949> here<00:00:56.309> comes<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:57.230> here<00:00:58.230> comes<00:00:58.440> a

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
and so here comes the here comes a

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.709 
and so here comes the here comes a
couple<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> player<00:00:59.820> ones<00:01:00.090> banelings<00:01:00.539> over

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
couple of a player ones banelings over

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.540 
couple of a player ones banelings over
here<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.020> about<00:01:01.109> six<00:01:01.559> or<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:01.859> circlings<00:01:02.340> and

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
here it's about six or so circlings and

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.009 
here it's about six or so circlings and
that's<00:01:02.670> just<00:01:02.879> not<00:01:03.180> going<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.420> be<00:01:03.600> that's<00:01:03.780> just

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
that's just not going to be that's just

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.870 
that's just not going to be that's just
not<00:01:04.170> going<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.350> cut<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.559> here<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.430> with<00:01:05.700> this

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
not going to cut it here and with this

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.570 
not going to cut it here and with this
one<00:01:06.080> I'm<00:01:07.080> plugging<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.920> get<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.220> little<00:01:08.369> bit

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
one I'm plugging to get it a little bit

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.640 
one I'm plugging to get it a little bit
a<00:01:08.760> little<00:01:08.790> bit<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> time<00:01:09.780> over<00:01:10.020> here<00:01:10.229> not

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
a little bit of a time over here not

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.520 
a little bit of a time over here not
really<00:01:10.890> do<00:01:11.040> too<00:01:11.220> much<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.990> took<00:01:12.990> out<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.200> lot<00:01:13.409> of

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
really do too much and took out a lot of

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.340 
really do too much and took out a lot of
those<00:01:14.150> those<00:01:15.150> or<00:01:15.330> Ling's<00:01:15.540> took<00:01:15.780> out<00:01:15.930> maybe<00:01:16.080> one

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
those those or Ling's took out maybe one

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.469 
those those or Ling's took out maybe one
or<00:01:16.470> two<00:01:16.500> drones<00:01:16.950> but<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:18.060> was<00:01:18.180> really<00:01:18.450> a

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
or two drones but that was really a

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.130 
or two drones but that was really a
lackluster<00:01:19.369> harassment<00:01:20.369> there<00:01:20.960> so<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
lackluster harassment there so the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.010 
lackluster harassment there so the
layers<00:01:22.350> up<00:01:22.680> but<00:01:23.549> he<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.850> very<00:01:23.939> far<00:01:24.420> behind<00:01:24.570> here

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
layers up but he is very far behind here

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.289 
layers up but he is very far behind here
and<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.320> think<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.040> as<00:01:26.189> soon<00:01:26.369> as<00:01:26.549> them<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
and I think that as soon as them the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.420 
and I think that as soon as them the
spire<00:01:27.720> pops<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.470> at<00:01:28.650> player<00:01:28.890> one<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.159> going

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
spire pops that at player one is going

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.219 
spire pops that at player one is going
to<00:01:29.520> be<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.970> world<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.450> trouble<00:01:30.509> because<00:01:31.110> he

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
to be in a world of trouble because he

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.410 
to be in a world of trouble because he
has<00:01:31.439> not<00:01:31.650> scouted<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.790> he<00:01:32.909> doesn't<00:01:33.329> know

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
has not scouted so he doesn't know

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.630 
has not scouted so he doesn't know
what's<00:01:33.630> going<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.409> he<00:01:35.159> probably<00:01:35.340> thinks

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
what's going on and he probably thinks

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.819 
what's going on and he probably thinks
that<00:01:35.880> he's<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.210> lot<00:01:36.540> farther<00:01:37.110> ahead<00:01:37.409> than<00:01:37.590> he

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
that he's a lot farther ahead than he

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.210 
that he's a lot farther ahead than he
really<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.180> so<00:01:39.180> I'm<00:01:39.390> that's<00:01:39.600> going<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.990> be

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
really is so I'm that's going to be

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.620 
really is so I'm that's going to be
unfortunate<00:01:41.220> because<00:01:41.490> I'm<00:01:41.909> he's<00:01:42.090> he's<00:01:42.479> got

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
unfortunate because I'm he's he's got

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.210 
unfortunate because I'm he's he's got
the<00:01:42.750> same<00:01:42.930> idea<00:01:43.229> he's<00:01:43.380> got<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.530> spire<00:01:43.829> over<00:01:44.070> here

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
the same idea he's got a spire over here

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.389 
the same idea he's got a spire over here
but<00:01:44.369> he<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.689> day<00:01:45.689> late<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.079> dollar<00:01:46.110> short

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
but he is a day late and a dollar short

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.539 
but he is a day late and a dollar short
as<00:01:47.399> soon<00:01:47.579> as<00:01:47.670> these<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:49.159> as<00:01:50.159> soon<00:01:50.340> as<00:01:50.460> these

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
as soon as these a as soon as these

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.310 
as soon as these a as soon as these
mules<00:01:50.820> come<00:01:51.180> into<00:01:51.360> play<00:01:51.540> then<00:01:51.840> it's<00:01:52.140> pretty

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
mules come into play then it's pretty

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.209 
mules come into play then it's pretty
much<00:01:52.409> Gigi<00:01:53.840> so<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.200> guess<00:01:55.740> we'll<00:01:55.950> see<00:01:56.100> what

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
much Gigi so I guess we'll see what

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.069 
much Gigi so I guess we'll see what
happens<00:01:56.340> here<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.969> he's<00:01:57.570> going<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.750> get<00:01:57.930> these

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
happens here and he's going to get these

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.810 
happens here and he's going to get these
I'm<00:01:58.350> euless<00:01:58.710> out<00:01:58.890> before<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.280> spar<00:01:59.549> even

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
I'm euless out before the spar even

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.109 
I'm euless out before the spar even
finishes<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.630> he<00:02:01.380> was<00:02:01.500> just<00:02:01.740> pushing<00:02:02.430> out<00:02:02.759> all

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
finishes and he was just pushing out all

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.510 
finishes and he was just pushing out all
these<00:02:03.780> muta<00:02:04.140> lists<00:02:04.380> over<00:02:04.590> here<00:02:04.829> so<00:02:05.340> what<00:02:05.430> he

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
these muta lists over here so what he

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.270 
these muta lists over here so what he
needs<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.790> do<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.000> while<00:02:06.450> he's<00:02:07.170> got<00:02:07.380> about<00:02:07.649> eight

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
needs to do a while he's got about eight

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.880 
needs to do a while he's got about eight
or<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.700> eight<00:02:09.000> or<00:02:09.149> nine<00:02:09.300> noodle

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
or so eight or nine noodle

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.490 
or so eight or nine noodle
xxxx<00:02:10.069> and<00:02:10.600> yeah<00:02:11.600> he<00:02:11.750> needs<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:12.020> push<00:02:12.170> our<00:02:12.319> right

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
xxxx and yeah he needs to push our right

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.900 
xxxx and yeah he needs to push our right
now<00:02:12.650> and<00:02:12.710> that's<00:02:12.800> exactly<00:02:13.010> what<00:02:13.430> he's<00:02:13.550> doing

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
now and that's exactly what he's doing

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.930 
now and that's exactly what he's doing
and<00:02:14.060> that's<00:02:14.990> going<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.410> pretty<00:02:16.190> much<00:02:16.370> seal<00:02:16.760> the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
and that's going to pretty much seal the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.630 
and that's going to pretty much seal the
deal<00:02:17.150> here<00:02:17.450> for<00:02:17.660> player<00:02:17.840> 1<00:02:18.080> I<00:02:18.110> think<00:02:18.640> because

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
deal here for player 1 I think because

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.190 
deal here for player 1 I think because
he's<00:02:19.880> going<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.120> see<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.540> what<00:02:20.810> do<00:02:20.870> you<00:02:20.930> Scott

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
he's going to see the what do you Scott

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.020 
he's going to see the what do you Scott
and<00:02:21.620> he's<00:02:21.980> not<00:02:22.160> going<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.370> have<00:02:22.490> anything<00:02:22.790> to

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
and he's not going to have anything to

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.180 
and he's not going to have anything to
respond<00:02:23.420> with<00:02:23.540> that<00:02:23.709> what<00:02:24.709> he<00:02:24.770> needs<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.040> do

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
respond with that what he needs to do

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.190 
respond with that what he needs to do
right<00:02:25.220> now<00:02:25.550> is<00:02:25.580> make<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:25.970> make<00:02:26.570> as<00:02:26.690> many<00:02:26.810> queens

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
right now is make a make as many queens

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.720 
right now is make a make as many queens
as<00:02:27.380> you<00:02:27.500> can<00:02:27.709> because<00:02:27.890> that<00:02:28.100> is<00:02:28.280> his<00:02:28.459> only

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
as you can because that is his only

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.320 
as you can because that is his only
chance<00:02:29.120> of<00:02:29.360> survival<00:02:29.540> right<00:02:30.020> now<00:02:31.270> it<00:02:32.270> looks

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
chance of survival right now it looks

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.850 
chance of survival right now it looks
like<00:02:32.540> I'm<00:02:32.870> he's<00:02:33.050> just<00:02:33.230> going<00:02:33.350> to<00:02:33.410> go<00:02:33.560> ahead<00:02:33.680> and

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
like I'm he's just going to go ahead and

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.190 
like I'm he's just going to go ahead and
try<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.250> supply<00:02:34.760> block<00:02:35.060> him<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:35.810> he<00:02:35.959> does

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
try and supply block him and he does

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.010 
try and supply block him and he does
supply<00:02:36.590> block<00:02:36.830> him<00:02:37.070> so<00:02:37.220> he<00:02:37.400> is<00:02:37.550> not<00:02:37.790> able<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.330> do

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
supply block him so he is not able to do

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.870 
supply block him so he is not able to do
anything<00:02:39.470> he's<00:02:39.830> not<00:02:39.890> able<00:02:40.069> to<00:02:40.220> make<00:02:40.310> any<00:02:40.610> more

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
anything he's not able to make any more

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.870 
anything he's not able to make any more
muta<00:02:41.180> lists<00:02:41.510> or<00:02:41.690> anything<00:02:42.170> like<00:02:42.200> that<00:02:42.350> so

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
muta lists or anything like that so

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.479 
muta lists or anything like that so
player<00:02:43.880> 1<00:02:44.180> is<00:02:44.209> a<00:02:44.830> really<00:02:45.830> on<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.040> ropes<00:02:46.280> right

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
player 1 is a really on the ropes right

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.300 
player 1 is a really on the ropes right
now<00:02:46.640> I<00:02:46.880> don't<00:02:47.360> see<00:02:47.780> a<00:02:48.110> way<00:02:48.590> that<00:02:48.800> he's<00:02:48.950> going<00:02:49.190> to

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
now I don't see a way that he's going to

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.210 
now I don't see a way that he's going to
be<00:02:49.730> able<00:02:49.880> to<00:02:50.150> actually<00:02:50.870> do<00:02:51.620> anything<00:02:51.650> against

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
be able to actually do anything against

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.620 
be able to actually do anything against
that<00:02:52.400> he's<00:02:52.519> building<00:02:52.850> an<00:02:52.940> evolution<00:02:53.420> chamber

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
that he's building an evolution chamber

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.300 
that he's building an evolution chamber
probably<00:02:54.590> going<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:54.769> try<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:54.980> build<00:02:55.190> some

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
probably going to try and build some

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.790 
probably going to try and build some
spore<00:02:56.180> crawlers<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.780> combat<00:02:57.380> against<00:02:57.620> this

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
spore crawlers to combat against this

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.490 
spore crawlers to combat against this
but<00:02:58.070> that's<00:02:58.250> just<00:02:58.400> not<00:02:58.519> going<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.790> be<00:02:58.880> enough

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
but that's just not going to be enough

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.380 
but that's just not going to be enough
so<00:03:00.500> he's<00:03:00.830> got<00:03:01.010> a<00:03:01.040> couple<00:03:01.100> of<00:03:01.489> a<00:03:01.670> couple<00:03:02.209> of<00:03:02.269> his

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
so he's got a couple of a couple of his

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.509 
so he's got a couple of a couple of his
own<00:03:02.510> mules<00:03:02.750> coming<00:03:03.200> out<00:03:03.320> over<00:03:03.530> here<00:03:03.739> and<00:03:04.370> he's

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
own mules coming out over here and he's

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.720 
own mules coming out over here and he's
uh<00:03:04.550> making<00:03:05.300> as<00:03:05.570> many<00:03:05.720> more<00:03:06.110> as<00:03:06.170> he<00:03:06.290> can<00:03:06.620> but<00:03:07.310> I

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
uh making as many more as he can but I

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:08.860 
uh making as many more as he can but I
just<00:03:07.910> don't<00:03:08.030> think<00:03:08.150> that's<00:03:08.390> going<00:03:08.570> on<00:03:08.690> that's

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
just don't think that's going on that's

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.210 
just don't think that's going on that's
going<00:03:08.989> to<00:03:09.140> do<00:03:09.260> anything<00:03:09.590> for<00:03:09.800> me<00:03:10.010> it's<00:03:10.130> just

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
going to do anything for me it's just

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.430 
going to do anything for me it's just
kind<00:03:10.459> of<00:03:10.489> keep<00:03:10.670> on<00:03:10.850> taking<00:03:11.570> out<00:03:11.870> his<00:03:11.989> Overlord

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
kind of keep on taking out his Overlord

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.590 
kind of keep on taking out his Overlord
which<00:03:12.680> is<00:03:12.830> the<00:03:12.980> right<00:03:13.310> thing<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.730> do<00:03:13.910> it's

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
which is the right thing to do it's

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.680 
which is the right thing to do it's
going<00:03:14.660> to<00:03:14.780> supply<00:03:15.049> block<00:03:15.440> him<00:03:16.180> he's<00:03:17.180> got<00:03:17.360> more

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
going to supply block him he's got more

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.870 
going to supply block him he's got more
and<00:03:17.840> more<00:03:17.900> mule<00:03:18.200> is<00:03:18.350> coming<00:03:18.739> in<00:03:18.920> player<00:03:19.579> was

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
and more mule is coming in player was
