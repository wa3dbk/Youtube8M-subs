00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 
take a look at the wave pattern is

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.390 
take a look at the wave pattern is
solved<00:00:46.280> but<00:00:46.510> her<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:48.410> pattern<00:00:48.830> itself<00:00:49.160> is

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
solved but her the pattern itself is

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.780 
solved but her the pattern itself is
pretty<00:00:49.610> tight<00:00:50.000> and<00:00:50.360> we're<00:00:51.140> going<00:00:51.320> to<00:00:51.380> look<00:00:51.530> at

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
pretty tight and we're going to look at

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.760 
pretty tight and we're going to look at
how<00:00:52.790> the<00:00:52.850> amino<00:00:53.270> acid<00:00:53.840> we're<00:00:54.050> loosing<00:00:54.290> it<00:00:54.590> up

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
how the amino acid we're loosing it up

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.600 
how the amino acid we're loosing it up
and<00:00:55.780> so<00:00:56.780> far<00:00:56.810> the<00:00:57.200> conditioner<00:00:57.890> that<00:00:58.190> we<00:00:58.340> use

so we're going to look back and see how

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.330 
so we're going to look back and see how
it<00:01:17.450> will<00:01:17.660> is<00:01:17.780> long<00:01:17.990> wait<00:01:18.230> to<00:01:18.380> hear<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:18.950> which

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
it will is long wait to hear and which

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.400 
it will is long wait to hear and which
will<00:01:19.700> do<00:01:19.940> with<00:01:20.330> them<00:01:22.780> and<00:01:23.780> if<00:01:23.990> our<00:01:24.110> other

treatment even though the hair is not

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.120 
treatment even though the hair is not
quite<00:01:26.810> as<00:01:27.020> long<00:01:27.200> will<00:01:27.500> still<00:01:27.770> make<00:01:27.950> our

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
quite as long will still make our

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.220 
quite as long will still make our
sections<00:01:28.700> to<00:01:28.970> make<00:01:29.150> sure<00:01:29.360> we<00:01:29.510> have<00:01:29.690> control

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
sections to make sure we have control

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.750 
sections to make sure we have control
and<00:01:31.390> consistency<00:01:33.340> throughout<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.550> whole

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.550 

and<00:01:42.520> we<00:01:42.820> do<00:01:43.030> know<00:01:43.240> that<00:01:43.270> amino<00:01:43.780> acid<00:01:44.260> is<00:01:44.530> a

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
and we do know that amino acid is a

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.950 
and we do know that amino acid is a
protein<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:48.250> we<00:01:48.430> must<00:01:48.670> always<00:01:48.940> balance<00:01:49.750> our

protein<00:01:50.530> with<00:01:51.040> moisture<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.880> we'll<00:01:55.229> part<00:01:56.229> off

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
protein with moisture and we'll part off

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.109

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
nearest the scalp to the end and we'll

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.900 
nearest the scalp to the end and we'll
take<00:02:10.360> small<00:02:10.690> small<00:02:11.440> sections<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:15.370> this<00:02:15.760> is

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
take small small sections and this is
