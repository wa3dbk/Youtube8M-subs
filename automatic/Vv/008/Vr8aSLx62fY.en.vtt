00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
pretty average as you can see you get a

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.500 
pretty average as you can see you get a
bit<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.680> gold<00:00:49.950> find<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.430> bit<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.610> magic<00:00:50.820> find<00:00:51.210> on

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
bit of gold find a bit of magic find on

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.959

every<00:00:52.050> chess<00:00:52.829> piece<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.340> get<00:00:53.579> but<00:00:53.879> you

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
every chess piece that you get but you

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.939 
every chess piece that you get but you

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
could get a sockets in it which I don't

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.330 
could get a sockets in it which I don't
think<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.219> can<00:00:57.050> get<00:00:58.050> anymore<00:00:58.320> but<00:00:58.949> then<00:00:59.129> if

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
think you can get anymore but then if

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.090 
think you can get anymore but then if
you<00:00:59.430> look<00:00:59.579> at<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.699> upgraded<00:01:00.270> gold<00:01:00.480> skin<00:01:01.100> it's

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
worth stupid amount more and the reason

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.890 
worth stupid amount more and the reason
why<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.670> get<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> hundred<00:01:06.090> percent<00:01:06.270> extra

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
why is you get a hundred percent extra

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
by day it so it's that five million now

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.030 
by day it so it's that five million now
it<00:01:17.700> was<00:01:17.970> at<00:01:18.119> three<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.479> half<00:01:18.509> but<00:01:19.229> people

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
it was at three and a half but people

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.800 
it was at three and a half but people
are<00:01:20.130> buying<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.460> I'm<00:01:20.640> like<00:01:20.670> crazy<00:01:21.799> and

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
are buying this I'm like crazy and

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.240 
are buying this I'm like crazy and
because<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.860> level<00:01:26.040> 52<00:01:26.520> IM<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.590> it<00:01:28.590> drops

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
worth looking at obviously check the

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.240 
worth looking at obviously check the
price<00:03:58.420> as<00:03:58.600> yourselves<00:03:58.930> dependent<00:03:59.859> on<00:04:00.040> when

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
price as yourselves dependent on when

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.789 
price as yourselves dependent on when
you're<00:04:00.400> on<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:01.780> then<00:04:02.019> if<00:04:02.109> you<00:04:02.170> look<00:04:02.319> at<00:04:02.440> a<00:04:02.470> dex

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
you're on and then if you look at a dex

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.300 
you're on and then if you look at a dex
one<00:04:02.980> Maya<00:04:03.639> profit<00:04:04.060> x1<00:04:04.540> you're<00:04:05.200> looking<00:04:05.470> at<00:04:05.560> 4.4

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
one Maya profit x1 you're looking at 4.4

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.220 
one Maya profit x1 you're looking at 4.4
that's<00:04:06.670> dropped<00:04:07.030> dramatically<00:04:07.630> it<00:04:07.840> was<00:04:08.049> at

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
that's dropped dramatically it was at

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.780 
that's dropped dramatically it was at
about<00:04:08.290> eight<00:04:08.560> or<00:04:08.590> nine<00:04:08.769> mil<00:04:09.160> a<00:04:09.190> couple<00:04:09.549> of<00:04:09.639> days

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
about eight or nine mil a couple of days

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.690 
about eight or nine mil a couple of days
ago<00:04:09.819> so<00:04:10.660> that's<00:04:11.079> a<00:04:11.230> kind<00:04:11.769> of<00:04:11.889> dodgy<00:04:12.130> market

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
ago so that's a kind of dodgy market

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.930 
ago so that's a kind of dodgy market
right<00:04:12.940> now<00:04:12.970> but<00:04:13.620> it's<00:04:14.620> still<00:04:14.799> possible<00:04:15.459> to

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
right now but it's still possible to

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.529 
right now but it's still possible to
make<00:04:16.209> some<00:04:16.359> money<00:04:16.889> and<00:04:17.889> then<00:04:18.160> you<00:04:18.760> look<00:04:18.910> at<00:04:19.150> the

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
make some money and then you look at the

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.479 
make some money and then you look at the
new<00:04:19.959> visage<00:04:20.320> is<00:04:20.350> with<00:04:20.709> sockets<00:04:21.100> so<00:04:21.310> you've<00:04:21.459> got

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
new visage is with sockets so you've got

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.469 
new visage is with sockets so you've got
that<00:04:21.750> effect<00:04:22.750> and<00:04:22.990> you've<00:04:23.620> got<00:04:23.710> socket<00:04:24.130> in

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
that effect and you've got socket in

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.149 
that effect and you've got socket in
sits<00:04:25.479> sockets<00:04:25.900> a<00:04:25.990> good<00:04:26.169> in<00:04:26.349> visage<00:04:26.680> because

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:27.159 
sits sockets a good in visage because

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.510 
sits sockets a good in visage because
obviously

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520
