 hello and welcome for this second tutorial 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.379
 minecraft today I'm going to you 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.849
 explain how thanks in multi for the 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.960
 version 1 for the minecraft 8.1 then 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.870
 firstly, you will have to register 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.990
 on a site it's mike rann minecraft 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.130
 point fr 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.340
 so I would put you well in the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.340
 description 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.119
 so to be the English site 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.270
 services in French by no you have 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.280
 these little icons 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.170
 so you will have to register in 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.170
 no users you put your 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.809
 exact nickname to uppercase much what 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.379
 you use to connect to 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.110
 minecraft then into passwords that 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.160
 you want and in email address you 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.629
 put a valid email address 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.690
 since it will be necessary to validate 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.780
 registration you sign up 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.670
 validate the registration and we left 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.670
 so I connect you 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.190
 here 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.420
 so from this page you have 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.300
 of them clauds so it will have to have 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.390
 downloaded your skin before you 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:24.650
 can download a cape too then 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.479
 you let yourself be cochet skins and you 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.090
 must leave your ski file so 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.060
 dropped open five captain skins 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.620
 america it's in hd since the mode 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.640
 lets look at what he had 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.640
 you click on backlot 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.979
 so here I am going to enjoy it for 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:48.580
 put my cape 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:48.580
 so I check cap and I choose my cape 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:56.930
 then you have to install happy 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.729
 so I would put you to read megaupload 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.890
 in the description you make a click 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:05.570
 right with software like those come 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:10.190
 for idra to open and leave you the 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.709
 window here then you go into the 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:17.390
 start menu makes you run 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:19.459
 you type % to bogota percent you 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.700
 so go for minecraft to files 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.709
 bill and you open it like the other 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.330
 had you open the minecraft file 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:32.630
 divers like others with seventies 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:35.750
 where he will then have in mode or 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.510
 select all class files and 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:42.880
 you drag them directly into 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:46.510
 your but kraft foods evoked on wii 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.060
 you close everything so I skipped a 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.870
 step back to your mike 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.030
 rogers sorry and here sometimes it happens 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.040
 that there is a fish a meta folder 1 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.390
 this one makes you right click and you 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.540
 delete otherwise you will have a black screen 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:10.140
 that's it and then you go into your 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:16.090
 minecraft so technically it works 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:21.130
 I 'm sure multiplayer like what 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:24.390
 it works very well online I do not 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.390
 I'm registering 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:38.760
 here and we can already see that my arm 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:43.200
 has changed and that I have my this king is 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:46.280
 so there we will not see but I have my 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.280
 cloak in the back in german 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:59.069
 here I have my cape in the back 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.540
 so I wish you a good game and I 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.930
