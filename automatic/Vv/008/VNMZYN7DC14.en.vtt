xbox but I never played it really so I

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.049 
xbox but I never played it really so I

just decided to put up some gameplay so

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.709 
just decided to put up some gameplay so
this<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.510> just<00:00:39.719> one<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.050> first<00:00:40.200> missions

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
this is just one of the first missions

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.110 
this is just one of the first missions
so<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.780> won't<00:00:43.050> see<00:00:43.290> like<00:00:43.879> you'll<00:00:44.879> see<00:00:45.090> a

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
so you won't see like you'll see a

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.410 
so you won't see like you'll see a
little<00:00:45.329> bit<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.690> fighting<00:00:46.879> not<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.149> much

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
little bit of fighting not that much

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.029

all<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.270> good<00:01:12.510> stuff<00:01:13.460> I<00:01:15.170> decided<00:01:16.170> what<00:01:16.890> I'm

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
all that good stuff I decided what I'm

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.630 
all that good stuff I decided what I'm
going<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.220> try<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.549> do<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:18.180> put<00:01:18.840> up<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.229> video

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
going to try and do is put up a video

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.890 
going to try and do is put up a video
one<00:01:20.640> video<00:01:20.850> day<00:01:22.040> which<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.400> know<00:01:23.670> for<00:01:24.150> just

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
one video day which I know for just

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.679 
one video day which I know for just
starting<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.439> was<00:01:25.619> kind<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.009> over<00:01:27.000> accessing<00:01:27.540> it

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
starting I was kind of over accessing it

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.899 
starting I was kind of over accessing it
but<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:29.220> think<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.470> I'll<00:01:31.470> just<00:01:31.770> keep<00:01:32.070> making

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
but I think that I'll just keep making

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.440 
but I think that I'll just keep making
videos<00:01:32.939> until<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.930> find<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.439> one<00:01:34.650> video<00:01:34.890> that

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
videos until I find that one video that

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.260 
videos until I find that one video that
gets<00:01:36.450> me<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.720> lot<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.110> views<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.799> I'll<00:01:38.790> just<00:01:39.030> keep

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
gets me a lot of views so I'll just keep

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.200 
gets me a lot of views so I'll just keep
doing<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.840> doing<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.369> so<00:01:41.369> one<00:01:41.610> video<00:01:41.909> day

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
doing that doing that so one video day

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.410
