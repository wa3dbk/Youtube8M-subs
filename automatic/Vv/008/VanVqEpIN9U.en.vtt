mags<00:00:12.090> we're<00:00:12.750> also<00:00:12.870> using<00:00:13.139> dead<00:00:13.380> silence<00:00:13.920> which

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
mags we're also using dead silence which

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.849 
mags we're also using dead silence which
is<00:00:14.400> not<00:00:14.670> very<00:00:14.940> good<00:00:15.089> perk<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.480> black<00:00:15.660> ops<00:00:15.900> 2<00:00:15.990> but

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
is not very good perk in black ops 2 but

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.380 
is not very good perk in black ops 2 but
I'm<00:00:17.039> using<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.430> because<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.760> think<00:00:17.910> that's<00:00:18.150> what

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390
