because you know we all tend to when

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.609 
because you know we all tend to when
we're<00:01:35.939> going<00:01:36.119> through<00:01:36.270> something<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:37.110> think

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
we're going through something we think

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.940 
we're going through something we think
it's<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.950> end<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.430> world<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:39.030> think<00:01:39.329> that

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
it's the end of the world we think that

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.450 
it's the end of the world we think that
God<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.159> not<00:01:41.340> listening<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.090> us<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.750> think<00:01:43.049> that

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
God is not listening to us we think that

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.910 
God is not listening to us we think that
we're<00:01:44.460> not<00:01:44.700> worthy<00:01:45.570> enough<00:01:45.930> for<00:01:46.409> God<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.619> do

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
we're not worthy enough for God to do

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.700 
we're not worthy enough for God to do
anything<00:01:47.250> for<00:01:47.670> us<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:48.210> if<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.990> just<00:01:49.229> asked
