00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:13.130 
the video hmm
and<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.409> came<00:02:10.560> with<00:02:10.619> other<00:02:11.430> drill<00:02:12.390> bits<00:02:12.629> too<00:02:12.989> if

and I think if I'm not mistaken with

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.880 
and I think if I'm not mistaken with
shipping<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.430> handling<00:02:20.849> it<00:02:21.000> was<00:02:21.090> about<00:02:21.269> like

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
shipping and handling it was about like

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.479 
shipping and handling it was about like
42<00:02:22.890> dollars<00:02:23.959> off<00:02:24.959> of<00:02:25.349> Amazon<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:25.980> if<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.310> can

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
about this first of all I was really

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.259 
about this first of all I was really
really<00:02:37.859> skeptical<00:02:38.250> about<00:02:38.579> buying<00:02:38.849> it<00:02:39.060> because

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
really skeptical about buying it because

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.690 
really skeptical about buying it because
I'm<00:02:40.140> always<00:02:40.439> skeptical<00:02:40.799> about<00:02:41.250> buying<00:02:41.489> things

I'm always skeptical about buying things
off<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:41.909> internet<00:02:41.970> because<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.780> just<00:02:43.019> never

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
off the internet because you just never

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.490 
off the internet because you just never
know<00:02:43.379> but<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.400> searched<00:02:44.700> Amazon<00:02:45.359> like<00:02:45.930> at<00:02:46.319> least

supposed to hold a pen like this but I

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.849 
supposed to hold a pen like this but I

don't know I like it because you can get

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.559 
don't know I like it because you can get
right<00:03:20.129> into<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.489> corners<00:03:20.699> and<00:03:21.209> you<00:03:21.269> can
