00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
four months but they just were a little

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.450 
four months but they just were a little
too<00:00:32.540> big<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.900> mean<00:00:34.170> like<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.590> three<00:00:35.160> finger

back over there if you can see there's a
little<00:02:00.959> loop<00:02:01.350> right<00:02:01.560> here<00:02:01.619> we<00:02:01.889> want<00:02:02.069> to<00:02:02.159> save

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
little loop right here we want to save

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.209 
little loop right here we want to save
this<00:02:02.729> loop<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.719> you're<00:02:03.899> going<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.079> need<00:02:04.409> some

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
this loop so you're going to need some

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.760 
this loop so you're going to need some
standard<00:02:05.759> Flyers<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.299> hold<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.959> with<00:02:07.229> let's

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
standard Flyers to hold that with let's

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.169 
standard Flyers to hold that with let's
get<00:02:08.520> real

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
get real

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.170 
get real
here<00:02:12.920> standard<00:02:13.920> pliers<00:02:14.219> to<00:02:14.370> hold<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:14.939> with

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
here standard pliers to hold that with

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.309 
here standard pliers to hold that with
and<00:02:15.540> some<00:02:15.780> needle<00:02:16.109> nose<00:02:16.140> pliers<00:02:16.769> to<00:02:17.989> open<00:02:18.989> that

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
and some needle nose pliers to open that

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.009 
and some needle nose pliers to open that
up<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:21.200> then<00:02:22.200> just<00:02:22.439> take<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:22.920> off<00:02:23.900> there<00:02:24.900> we

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
up and then just take this off there we

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.839 
up and then just take this off there we
go<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.680> know<00:02:25.799> what<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.310> we<00:02:26.430> don't<00:02:26.549> lose<00:02:26.790> a

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
go and you know what so we don't lose a

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.490 
go and you know what so we don't lose a
little<00:02:27.120> ring<00:02:27.420> while<00:02:27.810> we're<00:02:27.930> working<00:02:28.049> on<00:02:28.349> it

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
little ring while we're working on it

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.039 
little ring while we're working on it
i'm<00:02:28.620> going<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.799> close<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.250> back<00:02:29.370> up<00:02:29.870> there<00:02:30.870> we

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
i'm going to close it back up there we

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.949 
i'm going to close it back up there we
go<00:02:31.230> it's<00:02:31.680> as<00:02:31.829> simple<00:02:31.889> as<00:02:32.310> that<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:33.480> this<00:02:33.659> might

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
go it's as simple as that and this might

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.830 
go it's as simple as that and this might
could<00:02:34.200> be<00:02:34.379> salvaged<00:02:34.920> i<00:02:35.129> don't<00:02:35.340> know<00:02:35.840> depends

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
could be salvaged i don't know depends

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.039 
could be salvaged i don't know depends

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
wearable pink and this is going to be

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.699 
wearable pink and this is going to be
converted<00:03:21.780> into<00:03:21.930> sort<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.349> a<00:03:22.470> lipstick<00:03:22.949> now

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709

converted into sort of a lipstick now
other<00:03:25.760> bullet<00:03:26.760> shapes<00:03:27.120> might<00:03:27.569> almost<00:03:27.900> look

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
other bullet shapes might almost look

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.770 
other bullet shapes might almost look
better<00:03:28.829> as<00:03:29.189> a<00:03:29.269> lipstick<00:03:30.269> you<00:03:30.419> know<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.629> ones

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
better as a lipstick you know the ones

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.869 
better as a lipstick you know the ones
that<00:03:30.930> are<00:03:31.019> real<00:03:31.229> rounded<00:03:31.859> at<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.069> top<00:03:32.370> the

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
that are real rounded at the top the

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.599 
that are real rounded at the top the
bullets<00:03:33.180> that<00:03:33.239> are<00:03:33.359> real<00:03:33.540> rounded<00:03:33.930> at<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.109> top

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
bullets that are real rounded at the top

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:36.920 
bullets that are real rounded at the top
those<00:03:35.609> actually<00:03:36.120> might<00:03:36.299> even<00:03:36.449> look<00:03:36.629> better

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
those actually might even look better

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:43.580 
those actually might even look better
than<00:03:37.169> this<00:03:37.409> one<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:39.470> if<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.799> was<00:03:41.129> plastic<00:03:42.590> you

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
than this one and if it was plastic you

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.949 
than this one and if it was plastic you
wouldn't<00:03:44.180> sand<00:03:45.180> it<00:03:45.449> you<00:03:45.659> would<00:03:45.780> probably

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
wouldn't sand it you would probably

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.520 
wouldn't sand it you would probably
prime<00:03:46.949> it<00:03:47.220> with<00:03:47.400> a<00:03:47.430> base<00:03:47.849> which<00:03:48.780> if<00:03:49.199> you

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
prime it with a base which if you

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.050 
prime it with a base which if you
watched<00:03:49.769> my<00:03:49.949> last<00:03:50.040> things<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.669> gongs<00:03:50.849> you

know<00:03:51.209> I<00:03:51.239> was<00:03:51.509> having<00:03:51.750> base<00:03:51.959> issues<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:52.949> didn't

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
know I was having base issues I didn't

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.429

and<00:04:24.340> skip<00:04:24.639> the<00:04:24.759> sanding<00:04:25.210> so<00:04:27.060> now<00:04:28.060> that<00:04:28.240> we've

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
and skip the sanding so now that we've

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.140 
and skip the sanding so now that we've
sanded<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:28.990> tip<00:04:29.229> end<00:04:29.409> of<00:04:29.710> it<00:04:29.860> I'm<00:04:30.669> going<00:04:30.909> to
