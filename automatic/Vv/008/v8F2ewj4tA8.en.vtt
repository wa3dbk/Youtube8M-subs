this this glitch on the mobs spawn about
every<00:03:15.900> 8<00:03:16.169> seconds<00:03:16.680> I<00:03:16.799> believe<00:03:17.069> or<00:03:17.190> seven

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
every 8 seconds I believe or seven

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.000 
every 8 seconds I believe or seven
seconds<00:03:18.049> not<00:03:19.049> too<00:03:19.260> bad<00:03:19.440> not<00:03:19.470> too<00:03:19.680> bad<00:03:19.829> but

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
seconds not too bad not too bad but

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.860 
seconds not too bad not too bad but
definitely<00:03:21.000> not<00:03:21.150> better<00:03:21.359> than<00:03:21.569> the<00:03:21.630> last

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
definitely not better than the last

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.569 
definitely not better than the last
glitch<00:03:22.109> but<00:03:22.380> again<00:03:22.950> this<00:03:23.069> is<00:03:23.130> probably<00:03:23.430> our

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
glitch but again this is probably our

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.940 
glitch but again this is probably our
only<00:03:23.669> last<00:03:24.630> hope<00:03:24.900> if<00:03:25.079> you<00:03:25.230> guys<00:03:25.349> really<00:03:25.620> really

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
only last hope if you guys really really

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.210 
only last hope if you guys really really
want<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.160> farm<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.609> grams<00:03:26.940> but<00:03:27.209> you<00:03:27.419> know<00:03:28.220> this

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
want to farm and grams but you know this

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.030 
want to farm and grams but you know this
glitch<00:03:29.489> I<00:03:29.700> guess<00:03:30.239> it's<00:03:30.419> okay<00:03:30.750> but<00:03:31.019> again<00:03:31.829> it's

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
glitch I guess it's okay but again it's

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.159 
glitch I guess it's okay but again it's
always<00:03:32.340> better<00:03:32.549> than<00:03:32.760> playing<00:03:33.660> crucible<00:03:34.139> or

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
always better than playing crucible or

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:35.839 
always better than playing crucible or
something<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:34.799> farm<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.250> grooms<00:03:35.489> that<00:03:35.700> way

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
something and farm and grooms that way

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.000 
something and farm and grooms that way
but<00:03:35.910> again<00:03:36.720> it<00:03:36.900> is<00:03:37.079> kind<00:03:37.349> of<00:03:37.410> boring<00:03:37.680> but<00:03:37.919> if

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
but again it is kind of boring but if

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.259 
but again it is kind of boring but if
you<00:03:38.099> were<00:03:38.190> one<00:03:38.340> of<00:03:38.370> those<00:03:38.519> people<00:03:38.579> that<00:03:38.910> loved

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
you were one of those people that loved

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.879 
you were one of those people that loved
farming<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:39.840> grams<00:03:40.019> and<00:03:40.230> you<00:03:40.620> know<00:03:40.739> this

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
farming and grams and you know this

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.949 
farming and grams and you know this
glitch<00:03:41.099> will<00:03:41.370> be<00:03:41.519> helpful<00:03:42.060> for<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:42.299> so<00:03:42.510> I<00:03:42.720> do

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
glitch will be helpful for you so I do

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.500 
glitch will be helpful for you so I do
end<00:03:43.349> up<00:03:43.500> picking<00:03:43.769> up<00:03:43.980> a<00:03:44.129> legendary<00:03:44.849> Engram<00:03:45.299> in

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
end up picking up a legendary Engram in

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.539 
end up picking up a legendary Engram in
a<00:03:45.629> matter<00:03:45.780> of<00:03:45.870> three<00:03:46.290> minutes<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:46.829> if<00:03:47.129> you<00:03:47.400> guys

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
a matter of three minutes so if you guys

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.520 
a matter of three minutes so if you guys
think<00:03:47.819> that<00:03:48.239> this<00:03:48.449> glitch<00:03:48.690> is<00:03:48.840> like<00:03:49.199> slower

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
think that this glitch is like slower

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.949 
think that this glitch is like slower
it's<00:03:49.829> not<00:03:50.069> guys<00:03:50.430> it's<00:03:50.699> just<00:03:51.000> it<00:03:51.599> just<00:03:51.720> takes

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
it's not guys it's just it just takes

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.420 
it's not guys it's just it just takes
them<00:03:52.139> longer<00:03:52.169> to<00:03:52.500> spawn<00:03:52.859> I<00:03:52.889> guess<00:03:53.160> it<00:03:53.370> is

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
them longer to spawn I guess it is

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.490 
them longer to spawn I guess it is
slower<00:03:54.090> in<00:03:54.299> a<00:03:54.359> way<00:03:54.510> but<00:03:54.569> it's<00:03:54.870> like<00:03:55.019> it's<00:03:55.199> not

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
slower in a way but it's like it's not

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.439 
slower in a way but it's like it's not
slower<00:03:55.769> and<00:03:55.949> dropping<00:03:56.280> Ingram<00:03:56.579> so<00:03:56.790> I've<00:03:57.120> heard

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
slower and dropping Ingram so I've heard

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.530 
slower and dropping Ingram so I've heard
from<00:03:58.190> previous<00:03:59.190> Cuba<00:03:59.519> saying<00:04:00.269> that<00:04:00.419> this
