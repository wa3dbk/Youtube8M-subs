this is I think both begins are on this
disc<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:35.930> then<00:03:36.590> this<00:03:36.769> disc<00:03:37.070> down<00:03:37.340> here<00:03:37.760> is<00:03:37.970> the

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
disc and then this disc down here is the

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.599 
disc and then this disc down here is the
soundtrack<00:03:38.780> so<00:03:39.709> we<00:03:39.799> have<00:03:39.920> the<00:03:40.010> game<00:03:40.400> in<00:03:40.549> the

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
soundtrack so we have the game in the

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.400 
soundtrack so we have the game in the
soundtrack<00:03:40.910> as<00:03:41.239> well<00:03:41.510> and<00:03:41.989> it<00:03:42.140> looks<00:03:42.290> like

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410
