00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.120
 and hello to all my dear friends subscribers 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.320
 channel with you x-team and now I will give you 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:19.470
 talk about how not to repair weapons 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.710
 Warface more accurately repair but they will 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.300
 do it for you 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:29.460
 Of course, most likely many about it 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:32.009
 know but I didn't know about it and said me 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.309
 all of a sudden I didn't even think about 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.070
 this mending the weapon mending and somehow not 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.690
 will appear clicked fix all 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.850
 used for Chechnya everything is like this 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.820
 then he pressed to repair everything 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.440
 used and then me only a friend 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.770
 reported that the weapons themselves can 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:56.690
 repair yourself and how to do it 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.050
 make it very easy to go into the settings 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.860
 we go 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:07.350
 the game and here it is written here this is another 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:11.150
 full auto repair 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.580
 Well, as a delivery, put a tick 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.430
 click save and accept 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.530
 after that after each game you will 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.960
 here's a sign 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:27.330
 tables so small here with how with 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.460
 report something like that 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:35.310
 warbaks spent on repairing weapons 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:38.070
 Here is such a handy thing who I did not know 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.130
 I think it will be very useful as I 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.700
 personally hesitated to repair the weapon manually 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.479
 and after that I'm just glad you know 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.490
 I enjoy the game and more than ever 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:55.800
 since you do not need to go forever in the warehouse 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.360
 and mending weapons pressing there is not easy 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.040
 extra actions 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.340
 get rid of unnecessary actions facilitate 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.160
 life is like this 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.470
 the settings are very simple so who 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.479
 helped set thumbs up subscribe 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.479
