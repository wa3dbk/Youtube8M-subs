a<00:01:00.719> little<00:01:00.809> bit<00:01:00.989> more<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.260> aggro<00:01:01.620> side<00:01:01.890> of

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
a little bit more on the aggro side of

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.640 
a little bit more on the aggro side of
the<00:01:02.070> spectrum<00:01:02.280> being<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.820> he<00:01:02.910> has<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.059> 31%<00:01:03.780> pfr

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the spectrum being that he has a 31% pfr

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.670 
the spectrum being that he has a 31% pfr
and<00:01:05.309> 50<00:01:05.640> hands<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.240> enough<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.260> at<00:01:07.380> least<00:01:07.470> get

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
and 50 hands is enough to at least get

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.100 
and 50 hands is enough to at least get
an<00:01:07.799> idea<00:01:08.189> on<00:01:08.340> V<00:01:08.760> Pip<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.060> VFR<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.869> at<00:01:09.960> least

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
an idea on V Pip and VFR and at least

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.899 
an idea on V Pip and VFR and at least
start<00:01:10.350> putting<00:01:10.740> someone<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.340> player<00:01:11.580> type

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
start putting someone in a player type

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.179 
start putting someone in a player type
bucket<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.990> as<00:01:13.260> far<00:01:13.439> as<00:01:13.500> fish<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.070> would

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
bucket and as far as fish I would

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.280 
bucket and as far as fish I would
definitely<00:01:14.549> say<00:01:14.729> fish<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.299> fair<00:01:15.570> probably

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
definitely say fish is fair probably

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.810 
definitely say fish is fair probably
more<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.619> aggro<00:01:16.950> side<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.400> spectrum

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
more on the aggro side of the spectrum

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.810 
more on the aggro side of the spectrum
so<00:01:18.150> all<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.170> being<00:01:19.350> said<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:20.130> think<00:01:20.250> we

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
so all that being said I think we

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.490 
so all that being said I think we
definitely<00:01:21.060> want<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.509> go<00:01:21.600> much<00:01:21.990> much<00:01:22.229> larger

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
definitely want to go much much larger

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.760 
definitely want to go much much larger
here<00:01:22.920> something<00:01:23.490> like<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:24.090> minimum<00:01:24.600> 18<00:01:25.200> cents

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
here something like a minimum 18 cents

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.380 
here something like a minimum 18 cents
and<00:01:25.950> probably<00:01:26.280> gonna<00:01:26.369> be<00:01:26.549> somewhere<00:01:26.939> between

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
and probably gonna be somewhere between

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.990 
and probably gonna be somewhere between
like<00:01:27.720> 20<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.080> 25<00:01:28.530> cents<00:01:28.860> most<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.340> time<00:01:29.549> this

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
like 20 and 25 cents most the time this

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.850 
like 20 and 25 cents most the time this
is<00:01:30.180> just<00:01:30.390> someone<00:01:30.630> who<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.810> view<00:01:31.110> as<00:01:31.229> fishy<00:01:31.500> I

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
is just someone who I view as fishy I

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.890 
is just someone who I view as fishy I
think<00:01:32.490> they're<00:01:32.610> going<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.790> call<00:01:33.030> at<00:01:33.329> least<00:01:33.360> a

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
think they're going to call at least a

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.149 
think they're going to call at least a
large<00:01:34.079> chunk<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.590> time<00:01:34.770> they<00:01:34.979> have

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
large chunk of the time they have

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.859 
large chunk of the time they have
position<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:35.939> have<00:01:36.090> no<00:01:36.270> reason<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.720> think

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
position and I have no reason to think

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.510 
position and I have no reason to think
that<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.140> person<00:01:37.530> isn't<00:01:37.740> going<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.189> utilize

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
that this person isn't going to utilize

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.640 
that this person isn't going to utilize
that<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.909> their<00:01:39.030> advantage<00:01:39.439> couple<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.560> with

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
that to their advantage couple that with

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.380 
that to their advantage couple that with
the<00:01:40.680> fact<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:41.220> do<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:41.640> deeper<00:01:42.060> stacks

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the fact that we do have deeper stacks

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.420 
the fact that we do have deeper stacks
and<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:43.200> want<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.619> try<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.829> make<00:01:44.070> sure<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.340> we

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
and I want to try to make sure that we

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.700 
and I want to try to make sure that we
get<00:01:44.520> as<00:01:44.670> much<00:01:45.030> money<00:01:45.299> endow<00:01:45.810> as<00:01:46.020> possible<00:01:46.560> so

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
get as much money endow as possible so

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.200 
get as much money endow as possible so
that<00:01:46.829> we<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:47.009> start<00:01:47.280> building<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.759> pot<00:01:47.970> as

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
that we can start building the pot as

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.749 
that we can start building the pot as
quickly<00:01:48.570> as<00:01:48.810> possible<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.590> did<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.220> full<00:01:50.430> video

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
quickly as possible I did a full video

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.789 
quickly as possible I did a full video
on<00:01:50.820> pot<00:01:51.270> geometry<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.049> kind<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.290> covers<00:01:52.649> this

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
on pot geometry that kind of covers this

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.010 
on pot geometry that kind of covers this
concept<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.430> why<00:01:53.579> slightly<00:01:54.360> larger<00:01:54.780> sizes

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
concept of why slightly larger sizes

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.679 
concept of why slightly larger sizes
early<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.890> can<00:01:56.040> help<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.670> final<00:01:57.270> pot<00:01:57.450> size

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
early on it can help the final pot size

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.510 
early on it can help the final pot size
and<00:01:58.140> if<00:01:58.560> you're<00:01:58.680> interested<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.399> would

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
and if you're interested in that I would

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.920 
and if you're interested in that I would
definitely<00:01:59.820> suggest<00:01:59.939> checking<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.630> out<00:02:00.719> but

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
definitely suggest checking it out but

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.420 
definitely suggest checking it out but
it's<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.140> huge<00:02:01.469> element<00:02:01.950> when<00:02:02.040> you're<00:02:02.159> playing

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
it's a huge element when you're playing

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.889 
it's a huge element when you're playing
against<00:02:02.700> fishy<00:02:02.969> opponents<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.659> have

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
against fishy opponents and you have

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.530 
against fishy opponents and you have
these<00:02:04.110> monster<00:02:04.590> hands<00:02:04.860> sometimes<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:06.000> larger

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
these monster hands sometimes the larger

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.840 
these monster hands sometimes the larger
preflop<00:02:06.990> size<00:02:07.229> can<00:02:07.500> do<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> lot<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.129> lot<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.489> lot

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
preflop size can do a lot a lot a lot

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.610 
preflop size can do a lot a lot a lot
good<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.390> lot<00:02:09.540> of<00:02:09.570> benefit<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.260> the<00:02:10.350> hand

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:10.620 
good and a lot of benefit to the hand

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.220 
good and a lot of benefit to the hand
and<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:10.830> profit<00:02:11.250> as<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.400> whole<00:02:11.990> so<00:02:12.990> in<00:02:13.140> this

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
and the profit as a whole so in this

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.890 
and the profit as a whole so in this
situation<00:02:13.440> MP<00:02:14.040> calls<00:02:14.280> go<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.300> flop<00:02:15.540> hero

flop<00:02:16.140> stop<00:02:16.410> set<00:02:16.680> as<00:02:16.830> we<00:02:16.950> knew<00:02:17.070> from<00:02:17.280> the

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
question and Michel says on the flop I

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.430 
question and Michel says on the flop I
checked<00:02:20.670> because<00:02:21.240> I<00:02:21.420> didn't<00:02:21.720> think<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:22.020> MP

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
checked because I didn't think that MP

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.200 
checked because I didn't think that MP
would<00:02:22.590> have<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:22.860> case<00:02:23.100> a<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.340> too<00:02:23.580> often<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.150> I

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
would have the case a is too often and I

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.760 
would have the case a is too often and I
wouldn't<00:02:24.480> get<00:02:24.630> much<00:02:24.750> value<00:02:25.230> after<00:02:25.500> three

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
wouldn't get much value after three

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.920 
wouldn't get much value after three
betting<00:02:25.950> him<00:02:26.160> off<00:02:26.310> of<00:02:26.340> queen<00:02:26.760> x<00:02:26.970> hands<00:02:27.540> or<00:02:27.660> jack

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
betting him off of queen x hands or jack

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.320 
betting him off of queen x hands or jack
straights<00:02:28.320> preflop<00:02:28.860> after<00:02:29.730> he<00:02:29.820> checked<00:02:30.090> back

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
straights preflop after he checked back

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.660 
straights preflop after he checked back
I<00:02:30.660> put<00:02:30.990> him<00:02:31.080> on<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.230> very<00:02:31.500> mediocre<00:02:31.770> hand<00:02:32.340> like

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
I put him on a very mediocre hand like

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.360 
I put him on a very mediocre hand like
second<00:02:33.060> pair<00:02:33.300> so<00:02:33.840> shy<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.530> preflop<00:02:35.040> size

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
second pair so shy of the preflop size

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.400 
second pair so shy of the preflop size
this<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:35.790> gonna<00:02:36.060> be<00:02:36.270> my<00:02:36.450> next<00:02:36.510> biggest<00:02:37.050> gripe

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
this is gonna be my next biggest gripe

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.290 
this is gonna be my next biggest gripe
with<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.740> hand<00:02:37.980> because<00:02:38.490> I<00:02:38.520> think<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.210> we

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
with the hand because I think that we

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.270 
with the hand because I think that we
definitely<00:02:39.510> want<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:39.990> be<00:02:40.110> betting<00:02:40.380> here<00:02:40.740> now

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
definitely want to be betting here now

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.410 
definitely want to be betting here now
you<00:02:41.340> mentioned<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:41.940> thought<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.270> may

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
you mentioned that you thought you may

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.730 
you mentioned that you thought you may
have<00:02:42.540> three<00:02:42.690> Bentham<00:02:43.020> off<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.350> hands<00:02:43.560> like

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
have three Bentham off of hands like

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.470 
have three Bentham off of hands like
Queen<00:02:43.980> X<00:02:44.190> or<00:02:44.460> maybe<00:02:44.610> each<00:02:44.880> through<00:02:45.210> Jack's

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
Queen X or maybe each through Jack's

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.510 
Queen X or maybe each through Jack's
preflop<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.170> I'm<00:02:46.590> going<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:46.980> totally

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
preflop and I'm going to totally

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.370 
preflop and I'm going to totally
disagree<00:02:48.000> with<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.210> given<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.930> player<00:02:49.140> type

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
disagree with that given the player type

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.840 
disagree with that given the player type
that<00:02:49.560> we<00:02:49.620> have<00:02:49.830> given<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.340> fact<00:02:50.520> that<00:02:50.580> he<00:02:50.700> has

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
that we have given the fact that he has

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.240 
that we have given the fact that he has
position<00:02:51.390> on<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.690> I<00:02:51.900> just<00:02:52.650> think<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:53.040> those

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
position on you I just think that those

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.560 
position on you I just think that those
kind<00:02:53.520> of<00:02:53.580> hands<00:02:53.790> are<00:02:53.910> gonna<00:02:54.000> be<00:02:54.180> in<00:02:54.330> there<00:02:54.540> a

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
kind of hands are gonna be in there a

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.540 
kind of hands are gonna be in there a
lot<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.200> time<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.770> because<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.310> the

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
lot of the time and because of the

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.770 
lot of the time and because of the
players<00:02:56.790> like<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.210> don't<00:02:57.390> think<00:02:57.540> he's<00:02:57.630> gonna

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
players like I don't think he's gonna

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.480 
players like I don't think he's gonna
fold<00:02:58.050> them<00:02:58.230> sure<00:02:58.650> if<00:02:58.800> he<00:02:58.920> has<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.040> case<00:02:59.310> ace

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
fold them sure if he has the case ace

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.470 
fold them sure if he has the case ace
he's<00:02:59.670> not<00:02:59.820> going<00:03:00.150> anywhere

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
he's not going anywhere

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.600 
he's not going anywhere
either<00:03:00.690> but<00:03:01.320> I<00:03:01.350> think<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.650> if<00:03:01.740> he<00:03:01.860> has<00:03:02.130> Queen

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
either but I think that if he has Queen

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.580 
either but I think that if he has Queen
X<00:03:02.850> that<00:03:03.330> there's<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:03.750> decent<00:03:04.170> chance<00:03:04.350> that<00:03:04.470> he

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
X that there's a decent chance that he

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.130 
X that there's a decent chance that he
gets<00:03:04.770> sticky<00:03:05.130> for<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.340> minimum<00:03:05.760> two<00:03:05.970> streets<00:03:06.360> so

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
gets sticky for a minimum two streets so

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.740 
gets sticky for a minimum two streets so
my<00:03:07.380> whole<00:03:07.680> goal<00:03:07.710> is<00:03:08.220> just<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.640> bet<00:03:09.120> here<00:03:09.540> and

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
my whole goal is just to bet here and

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.150 
my whole goal is just to bet here and
hope<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:10.380> he<00:03:10.500> has<00:03:10.620> something<00:03:10.860> he<00:03:10.890> can<00:03:11.070> get

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
hope that he has something he can get

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.800 
hope that he has something he can get
sticky<00:03:11.550> with<00:03:11.700> now<00:03:11.880> sure<00:03:12.150> if<00:03:12.300> he<00:03:12.450> has<00:03:12.570> something

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
sticky with now sure if he has something

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.380 
sticky with now sure if he has something
like<00:03:13.290> total<00:03:13.890> air<00:03:14.070> or<00:03:14.430> maybe<00:03:14.760> even<00:03:14.850> pocket

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
like total air or maybe even pocket

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.030 
like total air or maybe even pocket
eights<00:03:15.540> maybe<00:03:16.140> he<00:03:16.260> just<00:03:16.410> doesn't<00:03:16.590> give<00:03:16.920> us

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
eights maybe he just doesn't give us

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.800 
eights maybe he just doesn't give us
action<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.700> that's<00:03:17.880> fine<00:03:18.240> but<00:03:18.570> think<00:03:18.750> about

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
action and that's fine but think about

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.230 
action and that's fine but think about
it<00:03:18.930> if<00:03:19.260> we<00:03:19.320> check<00:03:19.890> here<00:03:20.250> what's<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.060> most

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
it if we check here what's the most

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.640 
it if we check here what's the most
amount<00:03:21.390> of<00:03:21.480> action<00:03:21.750> again<00:03:22.110> from<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.290> kind<00:03:22.560> of

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
amount of action again from that kind of

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.920 
amount of action again from that kind of
hand<00:03:22.800> anyway<00:03:23.130> maybe<00:03:23.700> one<00:03:24.060> flop<00:03:24.360> stab<00:03:24.690> and

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
hand anyway maybe one flop stab and

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.630 
hand anyway maybe one flop stab and
that's<00:03:25.080> it<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:25.980> know<00:03:26.100> it's<00:03:26.250> not<00:03:26.310> like<00:03:26.430> we're

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
that's it you know it's not like we're

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.160 
that's it you know it's not like we're
gonna<00:03:26.730> make<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:26.970> ton<00:03:27.270> of<00:03:27.300> value<00:03:27.690> if<00:03:27.780> we<00:03:27.900> check

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
gonna make a ton of value if we check

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.660 
gonna make a ton of value if we check
here<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:28.500> he<00:03:28.560> has<00:03:28.740> eights<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.340> something

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
here and he has eights and something

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.670 
here and he has eights and something
happens<00:03:30.060> unless<00:03:30.660> you<00:03:30.900> really<00:03:31.140> know<00:03:31.380> that<00:03:31.410> he's

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
happens unless you really know that he's

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.010 
happens unless you really know that he's
gonna<00:03:31.830> like<00:03:32.070> bet<00:03:32.580> that<00:03:32.820> bomb<00:03:33.120> or<00:03:33.420> something<00:03:33.600> I

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
gonna like bet that bomb or something I

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.990 
gonna like bet that bomb or something I
just<00:03:34.230> think<00:03:34.560> you<00:03:34.650> make<00:03:34.830> more<00:03:35.040> value<00:03:35.490> by<00:03:35.640> firing

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
just think you make more value by firing

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.540 
just think you make more value by firing
yourself<00:03:36.600> than<00:03:37.230> by<00:03:37.380> taking<00:03:37.560> this<00:03:37.920> check<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.460> I

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
yourself than by taking this check and I

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.550 
yourself than by taking this check and I
think<00:03:38.760> this<00:03:38.880> is<00:03:39.030> something<00:03:39.210> that<00:03:39.360> happens<00:03:39.780> to

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
think this is something that happens to

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.320 
think this is something that happens to
micro<00:03:40.980> level<00:03:41.250> players<00:03:41.460> when<00:03:41.670> they<00:03:41.760> flop<00:03:42.030> big

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
micro level players when they flop big

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.910 
micro level players when they flop big
hands<00:03:42.600> sometimes<00:03:42.900> they<00:03:43.170> panicked<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:43.800> go

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
hands sometimes they panicked and I go

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.830 
hands sometimes they panicked and I go
man<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.280> have<00:03:44.490> the<00:03:44.580> board<00:03:44.790> totally<00:03:45.210> smashed<00:03:45.510> I

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
man I have the board totally smashed I

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.440 
man I have the board totally smashed I
just<00:03:46.050> really<00:03:46.470> can't<00:03:46.650> bet<00:03:46.920> here<00:03:47.250> but<00:03:47.910> you<00:03:48.180> know

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
just really can't bet here but you know

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.480 
just really can't bet here but you know
how<00:03:48.780> wide<00:03:48.990> people<00:03:49.470> can<00:03:49.710> and<00:03:49.920> will<00:03:50.040> call<00:03:50.250> you<00:03:50.400> in

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
how wide people can and will call you in

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.100 
how wide people can and will call you in
the<00:03:50.580> micros<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.360> especially<00:03:51.690> fishy

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
the micros and especially fishy

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.750 
the micros and especially fishy
opponents<00:03:52.620> in<00:03:52.710> the<00:03:52.770> micro<00:03:53.100> so<00:03:53.160> use<00:03:53.430> that<00:03:53.640> to

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
opponents in the micro so use that to

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.280 
opponents in the micro so use that to
your<00:03:53.850> advantage<00:03:53.910> and<00:03:54.480> just<00:03:54.510> fire<00:03:54.900> here

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
your advantage and just fire here

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.950 
your advantage and just fire here
totally<00:03:55.920> totally<00:03:56.280> for<00:03:56.490> value<00:03:56.880> and<00:03:57.510> honestly

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
totally totally for value and honestly

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.810 
totally totally for value and honestly
I'd<00:03:58.080> probably<00:03:58.290> fire<00:03:58.650> here<00:03:58.920> for<00:03:59.100> like<00:03:59.220> 30<00:03:59.430> cents

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
I'd probably fire here for like 30 cents

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.490 
I'd probably fire here for like 30 cents
so<00:04:00.180> I'm<00:04:00.240> a<00:04:00.330> nice<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:00.780> large<00:04:00.990> is<00:04:01.200> gonna<00:04:01.350> make

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
so I'm a nice and large is gonna make

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.410 
so I'm a nice and large is gonna make
the<00:04:01.650> final<00:04:01.980> pot<00:04:02.130> size<00:04:02.370> nice<00:04:02.640> and<00:04:02.850> large<00:04:03.060> and

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
the final pot size nice and large and

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.960 
the final pot size nice and large and
again<00:04:03.660> I<00:04:03.900> expect<00:04:04.110> someone<00:04:04.830> who's<00:04:05.010> fishy<00:04:05.280> to<00:04:05.730> be

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
again I expect someone who's fishy to be

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.430 
again I expect someone who's fishy to be
very<00:04:06.210> inelastic<00:04:06.480> me<00:04:07.110> and<00:04:07.230> they're<00:04:07.350> gonna

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
very inelastic me and they're gonna

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.470 
very inelastic me and they're gonna
continue<00:04:07.650> at<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.220> same<00:04:08.250> hands<00:04:08.820> kind<00:04:09.420> of

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
continue at the same hands kind of

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.360 
continue at the same hands kind of
regardless<00:04:09.870> of<00:04:10.080> the<00:04:10.200> size<00:04:10.410> you<00:04:10.440> use<00:04:10.920> and<00:04:11.220> when

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
regardless of the size you use and when

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.310 
regardless of the size you use and when
that's<00:04:11.520> the<00:04:11.610> case<00:04:11.730> that<00:04:12.360> bigger<00:04:12.660> especially

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
that's the case that bigger especially

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
that's the case that bigger especially
when<00:04:13.440> you're<00:04:13.560> in<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:13.710> values<00:04:14.040> out<00:04:14.160> of<00:04:14.220> the

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
when you're in the values out of the

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.880 
when you're in the values out of the
spectrum<00:04:14.730> yourself<00:04:15.410> so<00:04:16.410> in<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.710> situation

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
spectrum yourself so in the situation

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.280 
spectrum yourself so in the situation

from here but my main issue is you're

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.930 
from here but my main issue is you're
trying<00:04:37.139> to<00:04:37.259> induce<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:37.860> get<00:04:38.039> semi<00:04:38.370> bluffs<00:04:38.729> or

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
trying to induce to get semi bluffs or

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.969 
trying to induce to get semi bluffs or
thin<00:04:39.120> value<00:04:39.479> bets<00:04:39.720> and<00:04:39.900> my<00:04:39.990> question<00:04:40.320> is<00:04:40.440> why

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
thin value bets and my question is why

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:42.560 
thin value bets and my question is why
do<00:04:41.039> we<00:04:41.220> think<00:04:41.310> he<00:04:41.639> wouldn't<00:04:42.000> have<00:04:42.120> just<00:04:42.360> been

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
do we think he wouldn't have just been

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.529 
do we think he wouldn't have just been
tous<00:04:42.780> himself<00:04:43.259> on<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.530> flop<00:04:43.770> right<00:04:44.520> so<00:04:45.120> i

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
tous himself on the flop right so i

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.740 
tous himself on the flop right so i
think<00:04:45.750> that<00:04:46.139> if<00:04:46.530> he<00:04:46.560> has<00:04:47.310> a<00:04:47.940> hand<00:04:48.389> he's<00:04:48.600> gonna

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
think that if he has a hand he's gonna

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.060 
think that if he has a hand he's gonna
check<00:04:48.990> with<00:04:49.020> on<00:04:49.259> the<00:04:49.350> flop<00:04:49.530> that<00:04:49.710> he's<00:04:49.860> most

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
check with on the flop that he's most

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.740 
check with on the flop that he's most
likely<00:04:50.460> gonna<00:04:50.639> have<00:04:50.940> things<00:04:51.300> that<00:04:51.449> are<00:04:51.509> like

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
likely gonna have things that are like

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.529 
likely gonna have things that are like
my<00:04:52.350> pears<00:04:52.830> or<00:04:53.250> things<00:04:53.490> he's<00:04:53.699> not<00:04:53.850> super<00:04:54.300> amped

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
my pears or things he's not super amped

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.050 
my pears or things he's not super amped
about<00:04:54.780> and<00:04:55.470> if<00:04:55.710> he<00:04:55.830> wanted<00:04:56.160> the<00:04:56.250> bluffer<00:04:56.789> stab

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
about and if he wanted the bluffer stab

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.820 
about and if he wanted the bluffer stab
or<00:04:57.330> do<00:04:57.449> anything<00:04:57.660> thin<00:04:58.139> he<00:04:58.350> probably<00:04:58.620> would

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
or do anything thin he probably would

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.219 
or do anything thin he probably would
have<00:04:58.919> already<00:04:59.070> done<00:04:59.220> so<00:04:59.760> so<00:05:00.419> I<00:05:00.449> don't<00:05:00.750> think

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
have already done so so I don't think

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.409 
have already done so so I don't think
checking<00:05:01.770> the<00:05:01.860> flop<00:05:02.100> makes<00:05:02.400> much<00:05:02.669> sense<00:05:02.699> again

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
checking the flop makes much sense again

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.360 
checking the flop makes much sense again
this<00:05:03.570> is<00:05:03.750> the<00:05:03.900> same<00:05:04.139> situation<00:05:04.830> as<00:05:04.979> the<00:05:05.100> flop

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
this is the same situation as the flop

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.490 
this is the same situation as the flop
where<00:05:05.669> I<00:05:05.940> think<00:05:06.419> he's<00:05:06.570> gonna<00:05:06.690> continue<00:05:06.960> kind

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
where I think he's gonna continue kind

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.140 
where I think he's gonna continue kind
of<00:05:07.650> regardless<00:05:08.100> if<00:05:08.400> he<00:05:08.490> likes<00:05:08.669> his<00:05:08.850> hand<00:05:09.030> even

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
of regardless if he likes his hand even

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.480 
of regardless if he likes his hand even
a<00:05:09.389> little<00:05:09.539> bit<00:05:09.810> and<00:05:10.229> I<00:05:10.650> can't<00:05:10.919> be<00:05:11.100> guaranteed

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
a little bit and I can't be guaranteed

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.920 
a little bit and I can't be guaranteed
that<00:05:11.520> he's<00:05:11.760> gonna<00:05:11.940> bet<00:05:12.210> it<00:05:12.330> I<00:05:12.449> mean<00:05:12.570> he<00:05:12.750> did

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
that he's gonna bet it I mean he did

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.680 
that he's gonna bet it I mean he did
check<00:05:13.169> the<00:05:13.320> flop<00:05:13.560> behind<00:05:13.949> so<00:05:14.580> I<00:05:14.880> just<00:05:15.300> see<00:05:15.419> all

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
check the flop behind so I just see all

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.379 
check the flop behind so I just see all
this<00:05:16.050> reason<00:05:16.530> for<00:05:16.860> me<00:05:16.949> to<00:05:16.979> bet<00:05:17.250> myself<00:05:17.460> and<00:05:18.030> no

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 
this reason for me to bet myself and no

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.510 
this reason for me to bet myself and no
reason<00:05:18.690> to<00:05:18.990> check<00:05:19.199> to<00:05:19.380> him<00:05:19.560> so<00:05:20.039> again<00:05:20.370> I<00:05:20.400> think

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
reason to check to him so again I think

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.029 
reason to check to him so again I think
this<00:05:20.669> is<00:05:20.729> another<00:05:21.270> miss<00:05:22.199> play<00:05:22.470> in<00:05:22.620> the<00:05:22.710> hand

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
this is another miss play in the hand

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:24.110 
this is another miss play in the hand
where<00:05:23.250> we're<00:05:23.370> kind<00:05:23.550> of<00:05:23.580> letting<00:05:23.849> him<00:05:23.940> off<00:05:24.060> the

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
where we're kind of letting him off the

where we're kind of letting him off the
hook<00:05:24.300> we're<00:05:24.720> letting<00:05:24.990> him<00:05:25.260> kind<00:05:26.130> of<00:05:26.250> check

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
hook we're letting him kind of check

about him drying out with Jack 10 I

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.839 
about him drying out with Jack 10 I
really<00:05:52.169> screwed<00:05:52.409> it<00:05:52.650> but<00:05:52.860> just<00:05:53.039> called<00:05:53.370> I<00:05:53.639> know

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:53.849 
really screwed it but just called I know

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:55.339 
really screwed it but just called I know
I<00:05:53.970> should<00:05:54.240> have<00:05:54.270> better<00:05:54.539> raised<00:05:54.870> at<00:05:55.110> some

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349 
I should have better raised at some

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:56.839 
I should have better raised at some
point<00:05:55.590> for<00:05:55.770> value<00:05:56.130> but<00:05:56.430> I<00:05:56.460> don't<00:05:56.639> think<00:05:56.789> I

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
point for value but I don't think I

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:58.520 
point for value but I don't think I
should<00:05:57.000> have<00:05:57.090> done<00:05:57.180> it<00:05:57.330> on<00:05:57.419> the<00:05:57.510> flop<00:05:57.780> so<00:05:58.409> my

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
should have done it on the flop so my

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.140 
should have done it on the flop so my
final<00:05:58.710> question<00:05:58.919> should<00:05:59.550> I<00:05:59.610> have<00:05:59.729> check<00:05:59.940> race

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
final question should I have check race

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.850 
final question should I have check race
to<00:06:00.300> turn<00:06:00.510> I<00:06:00.539> bet<00:06:00.780> the<00:06:00.900> river<00:06:01.050> should<00:06:01.560> I<00:06:01.620> check

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
to turn I bet the river should I check

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.350 
to turn I bet the river should I check
call<00:06:02.099> the<00:06:02.220> turn<00:06:02.400> and<00:06:02.639> check<00:06:02.820> raise<00:06:03.000> the<00:06:03.180> river

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
call the turn and check raise the river

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.390 
call the turn and check raise the river
or<00:06:03.810> should<00:06:03.990> I<00:06:04.020> have<00:06:04.169> done<00:06:04.320> something

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
or should I have done something

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.990 
or should I have done something
completely<00:06:05.400> different

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
completely different

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.490 
completely different
squaws<00:06:06.449> I've<00:06:06.630> kind<00:06:06.840> of<00:06:06.900> said<00:06:07.050> a<00:06:07.110> number<00:06:07.349> of

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
squaws I've kind of said a number of

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.439 
squaws I've kind of said a number of
times<00:06:07.740> in<00:06:07.949> this<00:06:08.070> video<00:06:08.220> this<00:06:08.729> is<00:06:08.789> the<00:06:09.150> kind<00:06:09.389> of

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
times in this video this is the kind of

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:10.670 
times in this video this is the kind of
situation<00:06:09.659> where<00:06:10.080> I<00:06:10.139> think<00:06:10.169> we<00:06:10.440> should<00:06:10.590> have

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
situation where I think we should have

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.439 
situation where I think we should have
done<00:06:10.800> something<00:06:11.070> completely<00:06:11.340> different<00:06:12.300> than

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449 
done something completely different than

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:14.629 
done something completely different than
the<00:06:12.570> line<00:06:12.750> we<00:06:12.960> actually<00:06:13.349> took<00:06:13.590> I<00:06:13.860> think<00:06:14.460> this

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 
the line we actually took I think this

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.779 
the line we actually took I think this
should<00:06:14.849> have<00:06:15.000> been<00:06:15.030> a<00:06:15.539> bigger<00:06:16.169> 3bet<00:06:16.710> preflop

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:16.789 
should have been a bigger 3bet preflop

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:19.520 
should have been a bigger 3bet preflop
totally<00:06:17.789> for<00:06:18.000> value<00:06:18.330> also<00:06:18.630> sets<00:06:19.020> up<00:06:19.139> a<00:06:19.289> bigger

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530 
totally for value also sets up a bigger

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.100 
totally for value also sets up a bigger
final<00:06:20.010> pot<00:06:20.220> size<00:06:20.490> I<00:06:20.789> think<00:06:21.419> the<00:06:21.570> flop<00:06:21.870> should

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
final pot size I think the flop should

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.589 
final pot size I think the flop should
have<00:06:22.199> been<00:06:22.349> bet<00:06:22.560> totally<00:06:23.010> for<00:06:23.220> value<00:06:23.580> yes<00:06:24.030> sure

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 
have been bet totally for value yes sure

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:26.240 
have been bet totally for value yes sure
he's<00:06:24.840> gonna<00:06:24.960> fold<00:06:25.260> when<00:06:25.440> he<00:06:25.500> has<00:06:25.620> total<00:06:26.010> error

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
he's gonna fold when he has total error

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.800 
he's gonna fold when he has total error
but<00:06:26.490> I<00:06:26.520> think<00:06:26.729> there's<00:06:26.880> a<00:06:26.970> lot<00:06:27.180> of<00:06:27.330> second-best

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
but I think there's a lot of second-best

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.540 
but I think there's a lot of second-best
hands<00:06:28.050> he<00:06:28.229> can't<00:06:28.500> have<00:06:28.740> and<00:06:29.010> there's<00:06:29.279> a<00:06:29.310> lot<00:06:29.430> of

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
hands he can't have and there's a lot of

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.990 
hands he can't have and there's a lot of
second

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
second

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.660 
second
Tan's<00:06:30.210> he<00:06:30.540> will<00:06:31.140> continue<00:06:31.680> with<00:06:32.010> when<00:06:32.280> we<00:06:32.460> bet

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:32.670 
Tan's he will continue with when we bet

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.510 
Tan's he will continue with when we bet
and<00:06:32.970> especially<00:06:33.510> for<00:06:33.780> an<00:06:34.050> inelastic<00:06:34.680> person

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
and especially for an inelastic person

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.890 
and especially for an inelastic person
like<00:06:35.640> this<00:06:35.820> again<00:06:36.270> I<00:06:36.300> want<00:06:36.570> to<00:06:36.630> see<00:06:36.750> that

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
like this again I want to see that

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.860 
like this again I want to see that
larger<00:06:37.500> flop<00:06:38.280> bet<00:06:38.610> size<00:06:38.850> probably<00:06:39.480> for<00:06:39.780> like

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
larger flop bet size probably for like

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.410 
larger flop bet size probably for like
30<00:06:40.140> cents<00:06:40.470> which<00:06:40.710> was<00:06:40.860> roughly<00:06:41.100> pots<00:06:41.490> and<00:06:42.210> then

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:42.420 
30 cents which was roughly pots and then

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.300 
30 cents which was roughly pots and then
once<00:06:42.780> I<00:06:42.930> take<00:06:43.170> that<00:06:43.290> line<00:06:43.530> I'm<00:06:43.860> usually<00:06:44.070> just

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.310 
once I take that line I'm usually just

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.190 
once I take that line I'm usually just
gonna<00:06:44.610> go<00:06:44.730> bet<00:06:45.000> back<00:06:45.180> that<00:06:45.420> and<00:06:45.690> it's<00:06:45.870> gonna<00:06:45.990> be

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.200 
gonna go bet back that and it's gonna be

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.530 
gonna go bet back that and it's gonna be
big<00:06:46.590> bet<00:06:46.800> on<00:06:46.830> flop<00:06:47.280> big<00:06:47.490> bet<00:06:47.670> on<00:06:47.760> turn<00:06:48.030> Big<00:06:48.360> Ben

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380 
have the absolute not part of my range

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.320 
have the absolute not part of my range
here<00:06:58.710> but<00:06:59.280> against<00:06:59.520> this<00:06:59.670> kind<00:06:59.850> of<00:06:59.970> person

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:00.330 
here but against this kind of person

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.030 
here but against this kind of person
when<00:07:00.480> I<00:07:00.510> have<00:07:00.750> the<00:07:01.020> value<00:07:01.380> part<00:07:01.590> of<00:07:01.710> my<00:07:01.800> range

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.890 
when I have the value part of my range
I'm<00:07:02.250> definitely<00:07:02.700> gonna<00:07:02.760> be<00:07:03.030> in<00:07:03.240> a<00:07:03.390> bad<00:07:03.690> bet

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 
I'm definitely gonna be in a bad bet

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:04.880 
I'm definitely gonna be in a bad bet
that<00:07:04.110> mentality

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:04.890 
that mentality

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:08.330 
that mentality
99%<00:07:05.580> of<00:07:05.820> the<00:07:05.910> time<00:07:06.260> so<00:07:07.260> I<00:07:07.620> don't<00:07:07.890> really<00:07:08.070> like

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.340 
99% of the time so I don't really like

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.740 
99% of the time so I don't really like
the<00:07:08.490> line<00:07:08.669> we<00:07:08.880> took<00:07:09.060> I<00:07:09.180> think<00:07:09.330> it<00:07:09.390> was<00:07:09.480> way<00:07:09.720> too

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:09.750 
the line we took I think it was way too

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.870 
the line we took I think it was way too
passive<00:07:10.440> I<00:07:10.500> think<00:07:10.710> when<00:07:10.860> we<00:07:11.010> check<00:07:11.460> flop<00:07:11.700> and

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:11.880 
passive I think when we check flop and

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.610 
passive I think when we check flop and
it<00:07:11.970> goes<00:07:12.060> check<00:07:12.330> check<00:07:12.600> check<00:07:12.630> in<00:07:13.110> the<00:07:13.200> turn<00:07:13.410> is

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.620 
it goes check check check in the turn is

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.260 
it goes check check check in the turn is
criminal<00:07:14.130> I<00:07:14.310> don't<00:07:14.460> think<00:07:14.610> we<00:07:14.669> can<00:07:14.790> expect<00:07:15.030> it

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.270 
criminal I don't think we can expect it

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.760 
criminal I don't think we can expect it
to<00:07:15.360> get<00:07:15.480> bent<00:07:15.780> enough<00:07:16.110> for<00:07:16.290> the<00:07:16.350> time<00:07:16.560> and<00:07:16.710> I

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:16.770 
to get bent enough for the time and I

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.140 
to get bent enough for the time and I
think<00:07:16.919> we're<00:07:17.010> gonna<00:07:17.100> leave<00:07:17.340> a<00:07:17.400> lot<00:07:17.760> of<00:07:17.880> value

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.150 
think we're gonna leave a lot of value

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.970 
think we're gonna leave a lot of value
on<00:07:18.270> the<00:07:18.360> table<00:07:18.750> and<00:07:19.350> because<00:07:19.620> I<00:07:19.650> would<00:07:19.890> have

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:19.980 
on the table and because I would have

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.770 
on the table and because I would have
really<00:07:20.370> never<00:07:20.580> played<00:07:20.880> the<00:07:21.060> flop<00:07:21.270> and<00:07:21.540> or<00:07:21.630> the

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.780 
really never played the flop and or the

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.510 
really never played the flop and or the
turn<00:07:22.020> that<00:07:22.260> way<00:07:22.410> I<00:07:22.440> really<00:07:23.040> never<00:07:23.190> see<00:07:23.430> the

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 
turn that way I really never see the

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.980 
turn that way I really never see the
river<00:07:23.730> like<00:07:23.940> this<00:07:24.180> so<00:07:24.480> I<00:07:24.660> can't<00:07:24.900> really

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:24.990 
river like this so I can't really

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.320 
river like this so I can't really
comment<00:07:25.320> too<00:07:25.680> much<00:07:25.710> on<00:07:26.040> that<00:07:26.250> but<00:07:26.940> again<00:07:27.210> the

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:27.330 
comment too much on that but again the

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.120 
comment too much on that but again the
bigger<00:07:27.570> important<00:07:28.290> inflection<00:07:28.770> points<00:07:29.040> are

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.130 
bigger important inflection points are
