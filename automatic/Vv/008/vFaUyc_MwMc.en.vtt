 hello cool people let's make a 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.060
 preparation that our friend asked us to 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.930
 She had a problem with her cake. 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.420
 chicken 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.690
 She searched the bottom so we already know. 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.600
 how to make currency a little quieter and 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.790
 to maintain with that same risk what the 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.070
 ready because in reality I 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.680
 I'm using pasta like pee or 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.539
 poop hurt killing martin padar at 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.550
 If it can involve a pot it will have a 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.340
 link yes to how to make the pasta was a 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.700
 other video we did in the case of 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.070
 mass can be hundreds of thousands of 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.649
 different way of making a mass of 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.810
 chicken pie but that's what this is 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.790
 that I use what I like to do and 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.739
 so show it to you 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.410
 the mass of 15 she wants to be seen 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:53.149
 as if they do the ready has a name 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:58.059
 roll here did not roll for more 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.059
 easy you put on our head 

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:10.420
 inside until right 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.159
 very well here but we'll see I'll do it 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:25.159
 Here we cut here the part of 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:27.799
 out mostly play very well 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.420
 because so on all sides know the 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.399
 so when you get out of it will 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.170
 me because he is very well and this 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.259
 position is that we will put the tam 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:43.460
 on top of it, it will help us to paste 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:46.610
 she's going to do it now, she 'll do it 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.000
 deep holes in the dough to 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:02:00.020
 this reflects that of the leaf take only 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:03.049
 by the mass of which I will also do now 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.380
 for the occurrence of what the network had 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.560
 reality our friend tv we go 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.630
 to roast the pasta for more or less 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.269
 five to ten minutes depends on your oven 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.190
 at 180 degrees 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.660
 the mass is already practicing myself 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.069
 I knew it would get more crispy in 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.019
 firmer 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.590
 let's make a way put the filling 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.510
 and we will cap the first stage were 60 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.139
 degrees between 5 and 10 minutes 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.569
 The table also personally thinks of that. 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:35.389
 did you want to lower the volume a little 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:41.120
 It was really cool but in both the co 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:44.239
 and also I will not do here will sit the 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:53.030
 stuffing a case that depends on what you 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:03:05.389
 likes chicken reserve is not the first 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:09.560
 deep down you want 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:15.019
 in the case here I have a chicken with 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:18.470
 up for a bit of okra 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.919
 Spinach tighten right here to fit 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.919

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.740

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.650
 gemma that at the turn of the mass 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.640

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.969
 that the top that this is going to give 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:01.069
 the heart is so cool about our 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:03.250

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.889

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:12.500
 back to 180 degrees 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.810
 mixed to the food to turn over 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.130
 again for about 7 to 10 minutes or 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.329
 less depending on your butt of course 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.150

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:49.280
 thing you like flashy but it's the 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:52.270
