00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
laptop great price it's actually very

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.370 
laptop great price it's actually very
closely<00:00:18.060> related<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.539> another<00:00:18.900> acer<00:00:19.350> aspire

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
closely related to another acer aspire

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.630 
closely related to another acer aspire
laptop<00:00:19.619> make<00:00:20.160> sure<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.310> don't<00:00:20.460> get<00:00:20.520> them

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
laptop make sure you don't get them

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.859 
laptop make sure you don't get them
confused<00:00:20.699> they<00:00:21.180> have<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.359> slightly<00:00:21.660> different

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
confused they have a slightly different

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.330 
confused they have a slightly different
model<00:00:22.020> number<00:00:22.350> it's<00:00:22.710> basically<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.160> same

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
model number it's basically the same

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.040 
model number it's basically the same
thing<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:23.760> one<00:00:23.880> has<00:00:23.939> 10<00:00:24.119> 100<00:00:24.449> 1000

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
thing so this one has 10 100 1000

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.040 
thing so this one has 10 100 1000
Ethernet<00:00:25.470> as<00:00:25.650> well<00:00:26.460> instead<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.970> 10<00:00:27.390> 100<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:27.930> if

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
Ethernet as well instead of 10 100 so if

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.359 
Ethernet as well instead of 10 100 so if
you<00:00:28.140> are<00:00:28.260> coming<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.619> network<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.220> is

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
you are coming to a network this is

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.650 
you are coming to a network this is
going<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.670> be<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.849> one<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.179> want<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.480> get

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
it's only a little bit more expensive

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.680 
it's only a little bit more expensive
I'd<00:00:32.219> get<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.610> anyway<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.180> think<00:00:33.270> it's<00:00:33.510> awesome

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
I'd get it anyway I think it's awesome

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.150 
I'd get it anyway I think it's awesome
let's<00:00:34.410> start<00:00:34.590> by<00:00:34.680> taking<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.920> look<00:00:34.950> at<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
let's start by taking a look at the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.370 
let's start by taking a look at the
display<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> very<00:00:36.090> nice<00:00:36.390> 15.6<00:00:37.230> inch

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
display this is a very nice 15.6 inch

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.260 
display this is a very nice 15.6 inch
laptop<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:38.219> native<00:00:38.489> resolution<00:00:38.640> on<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.059> is

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
laptop the native resolution on this is

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.350 
laptop the native resolution on this is
1366<00:00:39.750> x<00:00:40.320> 768<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.250> will<00:00:41.370> play<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> full<00:00:41.820> 720p

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
1366 x 768 so it will play a full 720p

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.450 
1366 x 768 so it will play a full 720p

not now the whole thing is LED LCD back

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.340 
not now the whole thing is LED LCD back
so<00:00:59.399> it's<00:00:59.579> an<00:00:59.699> LED<00:01:00.030> back<00:01:00.210> with<00:01:00.510> an<00:01:00.600> LCD<00:01:00.960> display

so it's an LED back with an LCD display

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.290 
so it's an LED back with an LCD display
on<00:01:01.469> top<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.890> it's<00:01:02.399> powered<00:01:02.699> by<00:01:02.820> an<00:01:02.910> intel

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.420 
connectivity goes like I mentioned this
one's<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.439> little<00:01:25.500> bit<00:01:25.710> better<00:01:25.860> because<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.250> has

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
one's a little bit better because it has

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.749 
one's a little bit better because it has
the<00:01:26.640> 802<00:01:26.939> 11<00:01:27.060> n<00:01:27.450> as<00:01:27.750> well<00:01:28.350> as<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.650> 10<00:01:28.799> 100<00:01:29.189> 1000

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
the 802 11 n as well as the 10 100 1000

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.700 
the 802 11 n as well as the 10 100 1000
it's<00:01:30.119> also<00:01:30.420> got<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.810> six<00:01:31.049> cell<00:01:31.170> battery<00:01:31.200> so

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
it's also got the six cell battery so

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.260 
it's also got the six cell battery so
it's<00:01:31.860> going<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.040> give<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.280> about<00:01:32.610> five<00:01:32.939> hours

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
it's going to give you about five hours
