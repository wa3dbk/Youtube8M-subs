so<00:01:42.680> you're<00:01:43.400> going<00:01:43.730> to<00:01:43.840> minimize<00:01:44.840> all<00:01:45.200> this

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
so you're going to minimize all this

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.480 
so you're going to minimize all this
crap<00:01:45.650> and<00:01:47.650> then<00:01:48.650> you're<00:01:48.800> going<00:01:48.980> to<00:01:49.130> get<00:01:49.280> this

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.590 
crap and then you're going to get this
