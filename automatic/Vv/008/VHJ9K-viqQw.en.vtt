solar<00:02:42.670> power<00:02:42.940> this<00:02:43.570> lift<00:02:43.960> can<00:02:44.230> be<00:02:44.410> solar

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
solar power this lift can be solar

solar charging

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:07.500 
solar charging
in<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.510> case<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:55.010> person<00:02:56.010> in<00:02:56.099> the<00:02:56.220> Chicago

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510

as<00:03:07.659> you<00:03:07.780> know<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:07.930> lot<00:03:08.140> of<00:03:08.200> lakes<00:03:08.500> competitively

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
as you know a lot of lakes competitively

the<00:03:11.980> assoc<00:03:12.780> listener

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
the assoc listener

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.610 
the assoc listener
because<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.190> great<00:03:15.370> solution

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
because the great solution

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.490 
because the great solution
for<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.040> wintertime<00:03:17.959> another<00:03:18.959> benefit<00:03:19.440> of

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:36.740 

trying<00:03:30.330> to<00:03:30.390> be<00:03:30.450> done<00:03:30.660> like

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.600 

now<00:03:37.320> open<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.650> Great<00:03:37.860> Lakes<00:03:38.040> area<00:03:38.220> we<00:03:38.460> have<00:03:38.580> a

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
now open the Great Lakes area we have a

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.110 
now open the Great Lakes area we have a
lot<00:03:38.820> of<00:03:38.850> different

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
lot of different

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.220 
lot of different
super<00:03:40.390> muscles

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.480 

the<00:03:44.230> water<00:03:44.410> like<00:03:44.650> this<00:03:44.680> is<00:03:44.980> certainly<00:03:45.280> going

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
the water like this is certainly going

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:46.920 
the water like this is certainly going
to<00:03:45.550> be<00:03:45.610> a<00:03:45.700> blessing<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.330> maintenance<00:03:46.720> of<00:03:46.810> the

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
to be a blessing the maintenance of the

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.590 
to be a blessing the maintenance of the
boat<00:03:47.080> as<00:03:47.230> well<00:03:47.440> absolutely<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:48.460> not<00:03:49.180> only<00:03:49.330> is

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
boat as well absolutely and not only is

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.480 
boat as well absolutely and not only is
a<00:03:49.630> saving<00:03:50.110> maintenance<00:03:50.470> but<00:03:50.680> as<00:03:50.890> you've<00:03:51.250> seen

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
a saving maintenance but as you've seen

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:59.050 
a saving maintenance but as you've seen
around<00:03:51.820> country<00:03:52.450> lot<00:03:52.870> of<00:03:53.080> states

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.960 

that<00:03:59.239> were<00:03:59.390> long<00:03:59.840> beach

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.570 

mystery<00:04:04.970> and

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
mystery and

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.940 
mystery and
so<00:04:07.330> a<00:04:07.660> lip<00:04:07.930> like<00:04:08.140> is<00:04:08.380> really

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.890 

now<00:04:13.310> the<00:04:13.370> main<00:04:13.610> differences<00:04:14.150> from<00:04:14.360> this<00:04:14.629> lift

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
now the main differences from this lift

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.860 
now the main differences from this lift
and<00:04:15.080> it's<00:04:15.800> out<00:04:15.980> there<00:04:16.250> he

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
and it's out there he

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.689 
and it's out there he
help<00:04:18.139> walk<00:04:18.470> me<00:04:18.680> through<00:04:18.709> the<00:04:19.040> process<00:04:19.160> of<00:04:19.579> what

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699 
help walk me through the process of what

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:20.979 
help walk me through the process of what
makes<00:04:19.940> this<00:04:20.120> different<00:04:20.180> what<00:04:20.660> makes<00:04:20.690> it

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
makes this different what makes it

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.050 
makes this different what makes it
better<00:04:21.169> but<00:04:21.859> what<00:04:22.070> makes<00:04:22.340> them<00:04:22.520> mean<00:04:22.880> it's

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
better but what makes them mean it's

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.390 
better but what makes them mean it's
really<00:04:23.360> different<00:04:23.780> is<00:04:24.320> that<00:04:24.410> you<00:04:24.740> got<00:04:24.919> a<00:04:24.949> fork

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
really different is that you got a fork

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.600 
really different is that you got a fork
tape<00:04:25.699> configuration<00:04:26.690> so<00:04:27.530> under<00:04:27.949> my<00:04:27.979> panels

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
tape configuration so under my panels

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.110 
tape configuration so under my panels
here

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.710 

I<00:04:34.350> have<00:04:35.350> a<00:04:35.380> very<00:04:35.710> simple<00:04:36.250> valve<00:04:36.610> in<00:04:37.030> blower<00:04:37.360> set

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
I have a very simple valve in blower set

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.260 
I have a very simple valve in blower set
up<00:04:37.870> this<00:04:38.560> system<00:04:39.100> is<00:04:39.220> replicated<00:04:40.000> in<00:04:40.120> each

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
up this system is replicated in each

up this system is replicated in each
paint

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.559 

four<00:04:44.789> valves<00:04:45.389> for

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:47.569 
four valves for

on the go with
how<00:05:07.590> long<00:05:07.740> did<00:05:07.950> they<00:05:08.130> get<00:05:08.400> this<00:05:08.550> thing<00:05:08.760> all<00:05:08.910> the

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
how long did they get this thing all the

how long did they get this thing all the
way<00:05:09.030> in<00:05:09.120> the<00:05:09.180> water<00:05:09.360> and<00:05:09.570> get<00:05:09.690> it<00:05:09.780> all<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:09.870> way

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
way in the water and get it all the way

way in the water and get it all the way
back<00:05:10.110> up<00:05:10.169> well<00:05:10.590> that<00:05:10.860> was<00:05:11.010> all<00:05:11.190> about<00:05:11.400> making

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
back up well that was all about making

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.340 
back up well that was all about making
you<00:05:12.320> take<00:05:13.320> it<00:05:14.750> 75<00:05:15.750> sec

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
you take it 75 sec

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.820 
you take it 75 sec
bringing<00:05:17.070> the<00:05:17.130> boat<00:05:17.310> up

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.800 

we've<00:05:20.100> got<00:05:20.310> a<00:05:20.340> relatively<00:05:21.000> short<00:05:21.120> time<00:05:21.390> frame

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
we've got a relatively short time frame

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.170 
we've got a relatively short time frame
to<00:05:21.840> be<00:05:22.050> having<00:05:22.350> fun<00:05:22.380> with<00:05:22.740> your<00:05:22.860> principal

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
so if we're not able to make it down to

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.350
