00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.880
 he simply sees these icons 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.399
 which you put in the applications 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.179
 the game is made like almost for everyone 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:49.130
 but not all of them 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:52.759
 of application installations 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.729
 then after we go then we open 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.639
 winery will exit this icon above with 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:02.959
 a glass we crush it we go up 

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:04.399

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:05.509
 this stuff because they are all the others 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:11.619

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.850
 I saved them on my desk or 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.190
 two seem to me to you on time 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.590
 desk because it's more comfortable 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:30.660
 so this one will appear out here now 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:33.300
 a window that will start at which 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.670
 here she is then starting to create these 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.330
 this folder with files that will be the 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.100
 our virtual windows precisely on the 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.060
 his desk 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.209

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:06.450
 open and then this will succeed 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.480
 this single file that would be setup that 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.260
 as you can see the point ex as 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.060
 you want to see the setup is finished 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.390
