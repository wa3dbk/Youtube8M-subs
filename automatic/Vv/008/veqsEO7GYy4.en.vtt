00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.090
 yes today we compare that again 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:16.550
 Samsung Galaxy S3 with the Samsung Galaxy 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:20.000
 s2 here and today we want to test how 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.109
 So fast we offer the phones 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.570
 they will shut it down only once 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:27.140
 and then turn it on and watch which one 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:30.289
 Mobile phone is faster we turn 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.699
 now both times we are testing this now 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.340
 here are just the same now 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.280
 no optimal test conditions but we 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.899
 Just try it now 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:43.629
 I'll take it in my hand and 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.629
 start pressing now 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:52.940
 the s2 just has it a bit 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:56.680
 slower to respond but 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.680
 that's what i count it too 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.509
 so it is three seemingly 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.000
 booted 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:15.590
 Now we can enter the pin code 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.390
 I'll just leave it that way 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.830
 will be the s2 is like that too 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.409
 Of course it is like that 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.170
 are so high up at s2 it is 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.700
 In any case, so that some things 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.159
 but not quite loaded but that 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.310
 I ignore now just so so 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.789
 the s3 was now definitely 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.100
 I say it is much faster 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.380
 Of course, not really big 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.869
 difference but that was the test now 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.780
 I do the video because I said 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.340
 20 likes comes a new comparison and 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.110
 made it so again when the video 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.300
 now has 20 likes then comes a new one 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.970
 compare and write me please 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.729
 here and in the comments what he likes 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.009
 want to see for a comparison with it 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.509
 just know what interests you and 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.740
 I hope to see you later 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.330
 next video 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.940
 you can subscribe me then 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.360
 you do not miss that either and until the 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.360
 next time
