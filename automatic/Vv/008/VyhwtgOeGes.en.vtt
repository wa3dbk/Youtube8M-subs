something and the hardness is set very
high<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.730> go<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.940> preview<00:00:57.420> there<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:58.410> it'll

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
high so you go to preview there so it'll

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.279 
high so you go to preview there so it'll
look<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.980> moist<00:00:59.640> whiter<00:00:59.969> than<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.420> not<00:01:00.899> very

now if we click the arrow
go<00:02:12.069> to<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.340> first<00:02:12.610> material<00:02:13.420> so<00:02:14.110> it's<00:02:14.260> got<00:02:14.380> two

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
go to the first material so it's got two

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.979 
go to the first material so it's got two
materials<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.280> this<00:02:15.370> is<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:15.580> first<00:02:15.610> one<00:02:16.120> if

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
materials and this is the first one if

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.229 
materials and this is the first one if
you<00:02:17.170> select<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.890> deselect<00:02:18.310> you'll<00:02:18.880> see<00:02:19.090> it

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
you select and deselect you'll see it

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.220 
you select and deselect you'll see it
selects<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.349> other<00:02:21.060> phases<00:02:22.060> so<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:23.110> can

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
selects the other phases so you can

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.600 
selects the other phases so you can
quickly<00:02:23.410> see<00:02:23.739> that's<00:02:23.950> how<00:02:24.069> you<00:02:24.130> set<00:02:24.489> up<00:02:24.580> the

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
quickly see that's how you set up the

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.809 
quickly see that's how you set up the
material<00:02:25.270> indexes<00:02:25.840> by<00:02:26.020> selecting<00:02:26.700> phases<00:02:27.700> or

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
material indexes by selecting phases or

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.140 
material indexes by selecting phases or
vertex<00:02:28.239> points<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:28.959> assigning<00:02:29.790> but<00:02:30.790> it's<00:02:31.030> not

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
vertex points and assigning but it's not

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.510 
vertex points and assigning but it's not
the<00:02:31.180> only<00:02:31.330> step<00:02:31.780> to<00:02:32.080> do<00:02:32.230> obviously<00:02:32.620> we<00:02:32.709> click

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
the only step to do obviously we click

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.130 
the only step to do obviously we click
click<00:02:33.790> now<00:02:33.970> on<00:02:34.180> to<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.390> material<00:02:34.930> better

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
click now on to the material better

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.630 
click now on to the material better
material<00:02:35.650> buttons<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.069> we've<00:02:36.160> got<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.310> similar

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
material buttons and we've got a similar

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.210 
material buttons and we've got a similar
thing<00:02:36.850> here<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.780> it<00:02:37.959> shows<00:02:38.200> that<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:39.010> white

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
thing here and it shows that the white

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.830 
thing here and it shows that the white
color<00:02:39.550> has<00:02:39.790> got<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.920> users<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:43.209> users<00:02:43.660> if<00:02:43.780> I

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
color has got to users to users if I

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.110 
color has got to users to users if I
move<00:02:44.019> down<00:02:44.170> cross<00:02:44.380> you<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.620> stay<00:02:44.800> to<00:02:45.610> users<00:02:46.000> of

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
move down cross you to stay to users of

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.910 
move down cross you to stay to users of
that<00:02:46.269> data<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:46.870> you<00:02:46.959> click<00:02:47.140> on<00:02:47.290> it<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.500> ask<00:02:47.800> if

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
that data so you click on it and ask if

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.460 
that data so you click on it and ask if
you<00:02:47.980> want<00:02:48.130> to<00:02:48.190> make<00:02:48.459> it<00:02:48.610> a<00:02:48.640> single<00:02:49.030> user<00:02:49.470> we're

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
you want to make it a single user we're

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.500 
you want to make it a single user we're
looking<00:02:50.950> at<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.220> second<00:02:51.910> material<00:02:52.180> which<00:02:52.480> can

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
looking at the second material which can

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.530 
looking at the second material which can
be<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.810> pupil<00:02:53.290> which<00:02:53.590> we<00:02:53.739> will<00:02:53.860> now<00:02:54.010> name

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
be the pupil which we will now name

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.630 
be the pupil which we will now name
pupil<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:56.980> obviously<00:02:57.130> we<00:02:57.370> going<00:02:57.489> to<00:02:57.549> make

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
pupil and so obviously we going to make

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.840 
pupil and so obviously we going to make
that<00:02:57.700> our<00:02:57.910> black<00:02:58.120> color<00:02:58.390> so<00:02:59.019> you<00:02:59.080> click<00:02:59.440> on<00:02:59.620> the

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
that our black color so you click on the

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.580 
that our black color so you click on the
color<00:03:00.850> picker<00:03:01.090> there<00:03:01.420> drag<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:02.019> down<00:03:02.200> move<00:03:02.440> the

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
color picker there drag it down move the

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.530 
color picker there drag it down move the
cursor<00:03:02.769> away<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:03.880> it's<00:03:04.030> as<00:03:04.150> simple<00:03:04.299> as<00:03:04.480> that

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
cursor away and it's as simple as that

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.000 
cursor away and it's as simple as that
once<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:04.989> understand<00:03:05.350> it<00:03:05.410> was<00:03:05.560> selected

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
once you understand it was selected

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.289 
once you understand it was selected
we've<00:03:06.880> created<00:03:07.150> now<00:03:07.680> there's<00:03:08.680> two<00:03:08.920> materials

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
we've created now there's two materials

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.550 
we've created now there's two materials
to<00:03:10.299> material<00:03:10.690> indexes<00:03:11.110> and<00:03:11.230> we've<00:03:11.350> created

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
to material indexes and we've created

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.640 
to material indexes and we've created
two<00:03:11.769> separate<00:03:12.069> materials<00:03:12.580> on<00:03:12.760> our<00:03:13.600> object<00:03:14.110> so

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
two separate materials on our object so

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.530 
two separate materials on our object so
although<00:03:15.040> we<00:03:15.430> need<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.819> set<00:03:16.000> it<00:03:16.120> on<00:03:16.180> smooth

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
although we need to set it on smooth

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.770 
although we need to set it on smooth
that<00:03:17.350> creates<00:03:17.890> a<00:03:17.980> simple<00:03:18.340> I<00:03:18.430> for<00:03:18.820> us<00:03:18.970> click<00:03:19.630> on

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
that creates a simple I for us click on

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.979 
that creates a simple I for us click on

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
the preview screen like this set solid

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.319 
the preview screen like this set solid
you<00:03:26.980> can<00:03:27.160> see<00:03:27.400> that<00:03:27.609> we've<00:03:27.940> got<00:03:27.970> a<00:03:29.370> simple<00:03:30.370> but

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
you can see that we've got a simple but

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.990 
you can see that we've got a simple but
hopefully<00:03:32.079> effective<00:03:32.500> I<00:03:32.650> so<00:03:33.609> it's<00:03:33.730> got<00:03:33.880> in<00:03:33.940> the

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
hopefully effective I so it's got in the

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.490 
hopefully effective I so it's got in the
camera<00:03:34.329> view<00:03:34.359> more<00:03:34.780> quickly<00:03:34.959> render<00:03:35.230> that

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
camera view more quickly render that

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.729 
camera view more quickly render that
thing<00:03:35.769> see<00:03:35.980> how<00:03:36.070> it<00:03:36.160> looks<00:03:37.410> we've<00:03:38.410> just<00:03:38.440> got

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
thing see how it looks we've just got

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.920 
thing see how it looks we've just got
the<00:03:39.040> noir<00:03:39.250> empty<00:03:39.970> and<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.299> scene<00:03:40.540> where<00:03:40.810> the

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
cameras tracking to the empty so if we

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.520 
cameras tracking to the empty so if we
just<00:03:44.290> move<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:45.600> move<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:46.720> camera<00:03:46.959> around<00:03:47.079> in

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
just move the move the camera around in

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.770 
just move the move the camera around in
the<00:03:47.950> top<00:03:48.130> view<00:03:48.160> for<00:03:48.730> answer<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.209> the<00:03:49.329> left<00:03:49.540> and

then<00:03:50.430> move<00:03:51.430> our<00:03:51.609> mt<00:03:52.060> which<00:03:52.780> is<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.049> same<00:03:53.200> as<00:03:53.350> we

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
then move our mt which is the same as we

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.970 
then move our mt which is the same as we
did<00:03:53.530> in<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:53.739> city<00:03:53.980> tutorial<00:03:54.760> and<00:03:55.560> if<00:03:56.560> you<00:03:56.739> are

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
did in the city tutorial and if you are

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.160 
did in the city tutorial and if you are
the<00:03:57.130> Lighting's<00:03:57.519> not<00:03:57.609> very<00:03:57.940> good<00:03:58.150> we'll<00:03:58.420> we'll

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
the Lighting's not very good we'll we'll

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.890 
the Lighting's not very good we'll we'll
sort<00:03:59.410> that<00:03:59.560> help<00:04:00.209> so<00:04:01.209> you<00:04:01.269> can<00:04:01.450> get<00:04:01.600> a<00:04:01.660> good

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
sort that help so you can get a good

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.069 
sort that help so you can get a good
view<00:04:02.170> of<00:04:02.910> how<00:04:03.910> the<00:04:03.940> eyes<00:04:04.180> on<00:04:04.390> the<00:04:04.810> bridge<00:04:04.930> me

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
view of how the eyes on the bridge me

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.720 
view of how the eyes on the bridge me
quite<00:04:05.290> small<00:04:05.590> in<00:04:05.769> the<00:04:05.799> scene<00:04:06.100> but<00:04:06.280> you<00:04:06.400> can<00:04:06.549> see

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
quite small in the scene but you can see

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.819 
quite small in the scene but you can see
you<00:04:07.690> can<00:04:07.720> see<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:08.049> reflections<00:04:08.590> from<00:04:08.680> the

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
you can see the reflections from the

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:10.860 
you can see the reflections from the
lights<00:04:09.010> there<00:04:09.400> it's<00:04:09.790> just<00:04:10.000> it's<00:04:10.389> very<00:04:10.600> simple

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
lights there it's just it's very simple

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.949 
lights there it's just it's very simple
and<00:04:11.139> very<00:04:12.209> basic<00:04:13.209> obviously<00:04:13.540> you<00:04:13.660> could<00:04:13.810> use

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
and very basic obviously you could use

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.349 
and very basic obviously you could use
image<00:04:14.200> textures<00:04:14.620> to<00:04:14.739> make<00:04:14.889> it<00:04:15.010> more<00:04:15.359> complex

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
image textures to make it more complex

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.690 
image textures to make it more complex
texture<00:04:16.840> now<00:04:17.650> to<00:04:17.709> make<00:04:17.979> it<00:04:18.130> easier<00:04:18.459> for<00:04:18.669> a

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
texture now to make it easier for a

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.120 
texture now to make it easier for a
pending<00:04:19.239> that<00:04:19.359> from

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
pending that from

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.280 
pending that from
into<00:04:20.730> other<00:04:20.850> scenes<00:04:21.239> we<00:04:21.720> need<00:04:21.870> to<00:04:21.989> give<00:04:22.110> that

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
into other scenes we need to give that

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.640 
into other scenes we need to give that
sphere<00:04:22.620> a<00:04:22.650> proper<00:04:23.430> proper<00:04:24.060> name<00:04:24.650> which

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
sphere a proper proper name which

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.010 
sphere a proper proper name which
surprise<00:04:26.580> it<00:04:26.760> is<00:04:26.850> going<00:04:27.030> to<00:04:27.090> be<00:04:27.150> I<00:04:29.870> so<00:04:30.870> now

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
surprise it is going to be I so now

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.510 
surprise it is going to be I so now
instead<00:04:31.200> of<00:04:31.320> looking<00:04:31.650> for<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:32.010> objects<00:04:32.370> when

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
instead of looking for the objects when

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.100 
instead of looking for the objects when
you<00:04:32.610> go<00:04:32.700> to<00:04:32.760> a<00:04:32.880> pending<00:04:33.360> are<00:04:33.510> which<00:04:33.660> objects

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
you go to a pending are which objects

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.810 
you go to a pending are which objects
which<00:04:34.320> sphere<00:04:34.650> is<00:04:34.860> it<00:04:35.010> it's<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:35.670> one<00:04:35.790> that's

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
which sphere is it it's the one that's

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.710 
which sphere is it it's the one that's
called<00:04:36.150> I<00:04:36.300> because<00:04:36.630> it's<00:04:36.780> the<00:04:36.870> high<00:04:38.570> and<00:04:39.570> will

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
called I because it's the high and will

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.510 
called I because it's the high and will
actually<00:04:40.020> save<00:04:40.710> oh<00:04:40.860> I've<00:04:41.010> already<00:04:41.130> got<00:04:41.370> one

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
actually save oh I've already got one

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.110 
actually save oh I've already got one
called<00:04:41.730> I<00:04:41.820> so<00:04:42.090> call<00:04:42.300> it<00:04:42.390> I<00:04:42.510> too<00:04:43.760> but<00:04:44.760> obviously

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
called I so call it I too but obviously

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.240 
called I so call it I too but obviously
you<00:04:45.990> could<00:04:46.170> if<00:04:46.440> you're<00:04:46.560> looking<00:04:46.950> for<00:04:46.980> the<00:04:47.130> eyes

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
you could if you're looking for the eyes

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.350 
you could if you're looking for the eyes
you're<00:04:47.490> going<00:04:47.610> to<00:04:47.670> pin<00:04:47.820> them<00:04:47.970> from<00:04:48.120> one<00:04:48.240> of<00:04:48.300> the

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
you're going to pin them from one of the

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.800 
you're going to pin them from one of the
