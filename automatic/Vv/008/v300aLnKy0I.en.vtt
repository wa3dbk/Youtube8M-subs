00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.060
 centimeters 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.060

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:44.079
 the apex to hear it 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:47.840
 everything true has antonino turns 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:50.960
 the brustico c in bond that sees me has me 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:56.589
 also assured you the quarrels and wins 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:01:00.229
 the door to love obviously I expect the 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:04.820
 son of the mouse winner is all provence 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:07.520
 it's incredible how he manages to lend here 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.070
 a balance on the pole that is incredible 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.420
 it really is winning 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:19.190
 Latin oil spill Pope's victory is the 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:27.649
 time taken so he is the 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:31.060
 winner of the 200th in the sea we see 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.060
 if we can grasp it directly 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.670
 I'm not happy with your feelings 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.640
 but this I would recognize you we were 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.960
 many have played it for a while 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.360
 I say caution 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.100
 what happened to her in 2009 in 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.729
 that year I took the flag but not 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.860
 it broke and he won that edition 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:58.039
 and how football is gone this time 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.679
 good to me it went wrong to him but I have it 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.899
 wanted to take advantage to set goals from 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.549
 part all the grudges that were there 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.890
 in recent years because basically a game 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.350
 we have to be sporty and everything ends 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.170
 here is the appointment for the year 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.440
 next and I dedicate the victory to all 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.540
 friends, family fans, and that's it 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.780
 well so there is no need for too many 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.780
 words
