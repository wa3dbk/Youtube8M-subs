00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
need a lot of brute force on this the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.139 
need a lot of brute force on this the
steel<00:00:30.950> plate<00:00:31.250> that<00:00:31.279> we<00:00:31.520> were<00:00:31.640> using<00:00:31.820> weighs<00:00:32.119> a

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
steel plate that we were using weighs a

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:33.670 
steel plate that we were using weighs a
couple<00:00:32.390> hundred<00:00:32.719> pounds<00:00:32.870> and<00:00:33.230> with<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:33.440> size

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
couple hundred pounds and with the size

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.229 
couple hundred pounds and with the size
of<00:00:33.950> it<00:00:34.070> it's<00:00:34.219> a<00:00:34.280> little<00:00:34.399> bit<00:00:34.520> flimsy<00:00:35.059> in<00:00:35.149> the

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
of it it's a little bit flimsy in the

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.209 
of it it's a little bit flimsy in the
middle<00:00:35.450> so<00:00:35.660> we<00:00:35.690> really<00:00:36.020> need<00:00:36.140> to<00:00:36.260> get<00:00:36.440> at<00:00:37.010> least

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
middle so we really need to get at least

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.639 
middle so we really need to get at least
three<00:00:37.430> or<00:00:37.520> four<00:00:37.579> guys<00:00:37.910> on<00:00:38.149> each<00:00:38.300> side<00:00:39.070> ready

okay watch Jason's he's got a wok on the

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:45.669 
okay watch Jason's he's got a wok on the
plate<00:00:44.449> really<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:44.870> first<00:00:45.050> thing<00:00:45.289> to<00:00:45.379> do<00:00:45.499> is

00:00:45.669 --> 00:00:45.679 
plate really the first thing to do is

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:48.009 
plate really the first thing to do is
bend<00:00:46.339> that<00:00:46.519> big<00:00:46.850> round<00:00:47.120> tube<00:00:47.449> that's<00:00:47.690> gonna<00:00:47.809> be

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
bend that big round tube that's gonna be

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.709 
bend that big round tube that's gonna be
the<00:00:48.140> main<00:00:48.319> cooking<00:00:49.309> chamber<00:00:49.730> of<00:00:49.879> the<00:00:50.149> smoker

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
the main cooking chamber of the smoker

00:00:50.719 --> 00:01:00.130 
the main cooking chamber of the smoker
it<00:00:51.649> was<00:00:51.769> good<00:00:51.980> centering

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.750 

the<00:01:01.140> roller<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.530> we<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.129> capable<00:01:02.640> of

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
the roller that we have is capable of

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.840 
the roller that we have is capable of
bending<00:01:02.970> a<00:01:03.210> large<00:01:03.420> piece<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.830> plate<00:01:04.850> we

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
bending a large piece of plate we

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.580 
bending a large piece of plate we
usually<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:06.210> use<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:06.659> tenon<00:01:07.229> and

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
usually just use it for tenon and

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.380 
usually just use it for tenon and
lighter<00:01:08.250> metals<00:01:08.700> eighth<00:01:08.940> inch<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
lighter metals eighth inch is the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.600 
lighter metals eighth inch is the
thickest<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.009> first<00:01:11.250> time<00:01:11.460> that

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
thickest so it's the first time that

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.609 
thickest so it's the first time that
we've<00:01:11.759> ever<00:01:12.180> put<00:01:12.690> some<00:01:12.869> substantial<00:01:13.530> it's

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
we've ever put some substantial it's

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:24.260 
we've ever put some substantial it's
really<00:01:15.020> besides<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.229> go<00:01:16.320> over<00:01:22.940> with<00:01:23.940> a<00:01:24.000> little

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
really besides to go over with a little

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.060 
really besides to go over with a little
tweaking<00:01:24.509> here<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.140> there<00:01:25.259> before<00:01:25.770> able<00:01:25.979> to

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
tweaking here and there before able to

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:34.940 
tweaking here and there before able to
roll<00:01:26.550> everything<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> nice<00:01:27.210> big<00:01:27.420> ring<00:01:33.950> all

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.080 
roll everything to a nice big ring all
the<00:01:34.979> straw<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.369> roll<00:01:35.550> or<00:01:35.670> we<00:01:35.820> just<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.060> know

clamp it all together and just tacked it

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.469 
clamp it all together and just tacked it
real<00:01:37.679> good<00:01:37.830> and<00:01:38.039> we<00:01:38.940> could<00:01:39.060> just<00:01:39.149> roll<00:01:39.330> around

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
real good and we could just roll around

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.330 
real good and we could just roll around
like<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.840> full<00:01:40.020> rotation<00:01:40.170> just<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:41.070> get<00:01:41.190> it<00:01:41.280> a

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
like a full rotation just to get it a

like a full rotation just to get it a
really<00:01:41.550> nice<00:01:41.670> circle<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.450> I'm<00:01:42.660> gonna<00:01:42.750> work

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
really nice circle and I'm gonna work

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:50.099 
really nice circle and I'm gonna work
out<00:01:43.050> great
