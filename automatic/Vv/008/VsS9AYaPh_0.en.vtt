00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.160
 also in the twelfth year has the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.710
 Erzgebirgsbahn a successful 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.410
 development aimed at this 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.059
 underpin and document that invited 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.050
 company on 21 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.660
 february 2013 media representatives to one 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.500
 press trip on the section kofler has 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.990
 Albarn from Chemnitz to Olbernhau 1 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.449
 at a press conference explained the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.430
 Head of the traffic operation 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.460
 Erzgebirgsbahn wolfgang bodily at 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.690
 a rhine city presentation the 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.540
 revolutionary use of modern 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.129
 hybrid drive technology for railcars 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:47.340
 the ore mountain railway type vt 642 man 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.620
 uses a fraction of traction energy and 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.510
 the stored energy and the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.090
 to generate drive power 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.600
 that is, when he means mixed operation that is 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.140
 as again savings or a pure one 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.609
 electrical form 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.190
 that means we know about 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.710
 stretch sections then purely electric 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.869
 Form with diesel engine decoupled from the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.729
 whole system and there I think of them 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.860
 tunnel example demand what the mind 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.340
 says the host where to go with the preference 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.080
 then drive accordingly thin areas 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.229
 can 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:23.460
 This is the electro-hybrid drive 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.220
 for example for the rail.de 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.110
 stretch of 80 kilometers 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.030
 per hour is allowed and the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.240
 early reserves allow that accordingly 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.110
 now not shown before 76 then can 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.350
 She punctually 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.189
 we do that since 2006 7 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.890
 We should never forget the initiator 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:46.680
 This system I am especially positive 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.509
 It is suitable in our network but it is also 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.659
 have already been tested on larger 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.670
 for example, example is stretched 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.219
 One can use berlin for this is the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.420
 Schedule something vaguely the goal 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.490
 however, it should be ready by the end of 2016 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.200
 the locomotives of the Erzgebirgsbahn 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.899
 obtained ready for serial production 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.479
 Thus, the Erzgebirgsbahn would be worldwide 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.890
 the first company which one 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.290
 brings such technology to the track 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.690
 a saving of up to 25 percent 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.330
 diesel fuel can also be 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.650
 it will still be heard and seen 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.720
 crucial in difference to that 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.510
 own vehicle is that there is one here 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.520
 Energy storage is so the batteries 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.209
 can save energy and we 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.070
 then when form either completely as 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.840
 can use electric form in 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.760
 mixed operation means we use 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.450
 in addition to the contraction newspaper off 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.510
 the motto the batteries are stored or 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.959
 from purely electric that means before guest 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.250
 it was noticed people's dream 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.550
 oh well you know my motto 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.130
 go out and still we continue 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.400
 also a newly developed one 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.670
 passenger information system was 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.800
 presents this real-time information 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.709
 are of every passenger on the internet 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.709
 and as an app for smartphones and 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:08.440
 Internet-enabled mobile phones available 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.910
 So this is our newest screaming would 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.780
 I mean, that means they have 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:20.049
 really on the internet the possibility the 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:22.780
 that means we have been moving 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.670
 also in 2006 the first ones you all before 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.130
 between equipped with gps the 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.670
 basics for all these semesters too 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.290
 also ensure customer satisfaction 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.620
 takes the Erzgebirgsbahn nationwide 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.620
 a peak and the new one 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.290
 modernization of the infrastructure and 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.200
 high commitment of the employees would 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.470
 in 2012 to one 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.489
 punctuality rate of 98.7 percent 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.290
 this also plays the good 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.250
 cooperation with the many communes 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:57.010
 regions play a key role 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.340
 we carry a press ford through the 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.400
 Erzgebirgsbahn 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.800
 I am very happy with the progress so far 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.840
 satisfied because the interest of 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.400
 various journalists of 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.160
 various newspapers and media 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.610
 but also the mayor in particular 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.440
 the city Lengefelder city Ulm have 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.109
 are very strong we have a lot to 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.810
 offer as Erzgebirgsbahn so are 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.760
 Innovations to which the work to 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.610
 example of this modern vehicle in the 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.639
 we form the prototype of a hybrid 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:32.300
 Vehicles build this press drive 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:34.910
 shows very clearly how innovative and 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.979
 how progressive we are here with the 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.410
 Colleagues 250 colleagues of ours 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:42.380
 Erzgebirgsbahn is not only 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.210
 the daily good service good offer 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.460
 which is also rewarded by the customers 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.700
 But it is the introduction of new ones 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.300
 new techniques 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.330
 passenger information systems and there is 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:57.620
 the Erzgebirgsbahn is already a leader in 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:59.720
 federal territory we hope and wish 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.210
 that the Erzgebirgsbahn with their new 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.470
 technology and its passengers in one 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:08.000
 Future with long existence drives 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.550
 let's take a look at the Erzgebirgsbahn as 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.380
 our train as a facility which 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.380
 just belong to the Erzgebirge
