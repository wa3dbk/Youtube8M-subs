00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
it to hopefully break up the grease and

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.490 
it to hopefully break up the grease and
then<00:01:38.909> I'm<00:01:39.210> going<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.600> take<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.259> car

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
then I'm going to take it to the car

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.410 
then I'm going to take it to the car
wash<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.770> pressure<00:01:41.340> wash<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.790> see<00:01:42.150> what<00:01:42.299> we

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
wash and pressure wash it see what we

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.859 
wash and pressure wash it see what we
get

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
get

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.560 
get
can't<00:01:43.829> be<00:01:44.159> really<00:01:44.640> any<00:01:44.790> worse<00:01:45.030> than<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.360> is

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
can't be really any worse than that is

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.149 
can't be really any worse than that is
so<00:01:46.200> that's<00:01:47.189> just<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.520> quickie<00:01:48.229> before<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.860> then

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
so that's just a quickie before and then

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.480 
so that's just a quickie before and then
I'll<00:01:50.460> try<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.880> edit<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.329> after<00:01:51.810> video<00:01:52.490> in

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
I'll try and edit the after video in

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.710 
I'll try and edit the after video in
with<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.939> I'll<00:01:54.060> probably<00:01:54.240> have<00:01:54.509> everything

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
with it I'll probably have everything

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.700 
with it I'll probably have everything
done<00:01:55.110> except<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.920> headliner<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:57.350> alright<00:01:58.350> I

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
seat in it for quite a while because I'm

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.750 
seat in it for quite a while because I'm
not<00:04:36.530> putting<00:04:36.830> everything<00:04:36.890> back<00:04:37.220> in<00:04:37.460> until<00:04:37.730> I

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
not putting everything back in until I

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.340 
not putting everything back in until I
get<00:04:37.970> it<00:04:38.060> all<00:04:38.210> done<00:04:38.450> the<00:04:38.690> headliner<00:04:39.080> and

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.340 
get it all done the headliner and
everything<00:04:39.740> so<00:04:40.730> I<00:04:41.090> might<00:04:41.810> get<00:04:41.960> better<00:04:42.110> gas

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
everything so I might get better gas

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.910 
everything so I might get better gas
mileage<00:04:42.380> with<00:04:42.890> all<00:04:43.040> the<00:04:43.190> less<00:04:43.520> weight<00:04:44.920> all
