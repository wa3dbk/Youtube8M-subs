00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
about the just cus air for die-cutting

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.190 
about the just cus air for die-cutting
system<00:00:11.759> we're<00:00:12.240> going<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.509> be<00:00:12.599> using<00:00:12.960> some

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
system we're going to be using some

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.530 
system we're going to be using some
bottle<00:00:13.679> caps<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.580> we're<00:00:14.759> going<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.059> be<00:00:15.150> using

you<00:00:17.369> again<00:00:17.699> some<00:00:18.029> basic<00:00:18.420> techniques<00:00:18.930> so<00:00:19.740> if<00:00:19.830> we

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
you again some basic techniques so if we

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.130 
you again some basic techniques so if we
have<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.100> look<00:00:20.279> at<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.520> machine<00:00:20.850> we<00:00:21.660> have<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
have a look at the machine we have the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.800 
have a look at the machine we have the
pressure<00:00:22.380> switch<00:00:22.769> firmly<00:00:23.369> set<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.939> number<00:00:24.269> 18

and we have a selection of bottle caps
with<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.880> cutting<00:00:36.210> edge<00:00:36.390> facing<00:00:37.350> upwards

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
with the cutting edge facing upwards

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.799 
with the cutting edge facing upwards
just<00:00:37.980> arrange<00:00:38.790> them<00:00:38.940> on<00:00:39.030> your<00:00:39.180> base<00:00:39.360> plate<00:00:39.570> as

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
just arrange them on your base plate as

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.720 
just arrange them on your base plate as
many<00:00:40.050> as<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.290> like<00:00:40.320> leave<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.160> gap<00:00:41.430> between

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
many as you like leave a gap between

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.139 
many as you like leave a gap between
each<00:00:42.030> cap<00:00:42.500> this<00:00:43.500> time<00:00:43.770> we<00:00:44.010> take<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.520> time<00:00:44.940> and

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
each cap this time we take the time and

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.540 
each cap this time we take the time and
bossing<00:00:45.480> map<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.870> we<00:00:46.230> lay<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.829> top<00:00:46.890> and

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
bossing map and we lay that on top and

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.299 
bossing map and we lay that on top and
then<00:00:48.360> we<00:00:48.450> close<00:00:48.690> up<00:00:48.719> with<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.530> clear<00:00:49.770> cutting

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
then we close up with the clear cutting

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.510 
then we close up with the clear cutting
plate<00:00:50.570> okay<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:52.199> we<00:00:52.350> have<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.980> thick<00:00:53.250> white

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
plate okay so we have the thick white

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.869 
plate okay so we have the thick white
cutting<00:00:53.940> mat<00:00:54.289> bottlecaps<00:00:55.289> edge<00:00:55.590> upwards<00:00:56.160> down

plate pressure smoke set at number 18 so

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.170 
plate pressure smoke set at number 18 so
off<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.300> go<00:01:03.329> take<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.619> rollers

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
off we go take this to the rollers

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.420 
off we go take this to the rollers
engage<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.780> rollers<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.320> go<00:01:07.680> all<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.010> way

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
engage in the rollers and go all the way

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.789 
engage in the rollers and go all the way
through<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.909> machine<00:01:09.240> let<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.110> I'll<00:01:10.350> use<00:01:10.619> two

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
through the machine let it I'll use two

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.280 
through the machine let it I'll use two
fingers<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.189> show<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.540> very<00:01:12.869> little

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
fingers to show you that is very little

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.320 
fingers to show you that is very little
pressure<00:01:13.650> at<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.340> very<00:01:14.729> little<00:01:15.119> pressure

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
pressure at a very little pressure

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.899 
pressure at a very little pressure
indeed<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.900> do<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.220> we<00:01:17.220> pull<00:01:17.610> all<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> way

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
indeed to do this we pull all the way

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.380 
indeed to do this we pull all the way
through<00:01:18.330> with<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.930> tray<00:01:19.170> full<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.560> bottle<00:01:20.040> cap

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
through with the tray full of bottle cap

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.969 
through with the tray full of bottle cap
that<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.600> finished<00:01:21.840> let's<00:01:22.290> come<00:01:22.500> back<00:01:22.530> now<00:01:22.860> and

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
that is finished let's come back now and

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.300 
that is finished let's come back now and
have<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.130> look<00:01:23.340> at<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.549> results<00:01:24.680> okay<00:01:25.680> we<00:01:26.130> take

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
have a look at the results okay we take

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.219 
have a look at the results okay we take
the<00:01:26.400> top<00:01:26.610> plate<00:01:26.880> off<00:01:27.150> remove<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.659> template

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
the top plate off remove the template

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.370 
the top plate off remove the template
right<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.979> there<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:29.939> have<00:01:30.150> we<00:01:30.810> have<00:01:30.990> one<00:01:31.200> two

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
right and there we have we have one two

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.289 
right and there we have we have one two
three<00:01:31.409> four<00:01:31.890> five<00:01:32.159> six<00:01:32.490> seven<00:01:32.759> eight<00:01:32.820> nine<00:01:33.030> ten

eleven<00:01:33.600> twelve<00:01:33.630> thirty<00:01:34.020> forty<00:01:34.380> five<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:35.100> have

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
eleven twelve thirty forty five we have

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.700 
eleven twelve thirty forty five we have
about<00:01:35.400> sixteen<00:01:36.030> cups<00:01:36.270> there<00:01:36.630> which<00:01:37.259> are<00:01:37.409> fully

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
about sixteen cups there which are fully

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.550 
about sixteen cups there which are fully
flattened<00:01:38.220> let<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.790> ready<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.329> decorate<00:01:39.560> to

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
flattened let it ready to decorate to

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.380 
flattened let it ready to decorate to
embellish<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.220> turn<00:01:41.520> into<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.820> card<00:01:42.119> project

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
embellish and turn into a card project

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.960 
embellish and turn into a card project
so<00:01:43.170> that's<00:01:43.409> how<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:43.619> flatten<00:01:44.189> bottle<00:01:44.520> caps<00:01:44.729> on

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
so that's how we flatten bottle caps on

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.730 
so that's how we flatten bottle caps on
the<00:01:45.090> machine<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.899> can<00:01:46.049> do<00:01:46.170> less<00:01:46.350> than<00:01:46.409> that

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
the machine you can do less than that

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.770 
the machine you can do less than that
you<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.159> do<00:01:47.340> more<00:01:47.520> than<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.880> then<00:01:48.540> we<00:01:48.630> want

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
you can do more than that then we want

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.179 
you can do more than that then we want
to<00:01:48.899> something<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.380> show<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.590> something<00:01:50.040> just

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
to something to show you something just

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.819 
to something to show you something just
a<00:01:50.310> little<00:01:50.340> bit<00:01:50.670> more<00:01:50.909> unusual<00:01:51.299> now<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:52.380> let's

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
a little bit more unusual now so let's

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.230 
a little bit more unusual now so let's
just<00:01:52.920> remove<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.610> bottom<00:01:53.909> cuts<00:01:54.890> okay<00:01:56.240> we're

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
just remove the bottom cuts okay we're

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.980 
just remove the bottom cuts okay we're
going<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.450> be<00:01:57.540> using<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.110> base<00:01:58.530> plate<00:01:58.860> again

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
going to be using the base plate again

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.569 
going to be using the base plate again
but<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.170> time<00:02:01.469> I'm<00:02:01.740> going<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.159> put<00:02:02.399> the

but this time I'm going to put the

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.749 
but this time I'm going to put the
pressure<00:02:02.759> switch<00:02:03.299> down<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:04.759> roundabout

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
pressure switch down to roundabout

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.210 
pressure switch down to roundabout
number<00:02:06.170> twelve<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.590> we'll<00:02:07.740> set<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.009> to

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
number twelve so we'll set it to

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.589 
number twelve so we'll set it to
roundabout<00:02:08.700> number<00:02:08.910> twelve

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
roundabout number twelve

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.850 
roundabout number twelve
there<00:02:10.020> we<00:02:10.170> are

down here we will take the term
embossing<00:03:26.730> mouth<00:03:26.940> off<00:03:28.160> okay<00:03:29.160> there<00:03:30.060> we<00:03:30.209> are

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
embossing mouth off okay there we are

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.780 
embossing mouth off okay there we are
now<00:03:31.410> then<00:03:31.590> what<00:03:31.860> do<00:03:31.980> we<00:03:32.100> have<00:03:32.250> let's<00:03:32.580> have<00:03:32.730> a

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
now then what do we have let's have a

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.780 
now then what do we have let's have a
look<00:03:32.970> take<00:03:33.840> that<00:03:34.019> off

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
look take that off

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.440 
look take that off
take<00:03:35.790> that<00:03:35.970> off<00:03:36.800> and<00:03:37.940> there<00:03:38.940> we<00:03:39.120> have<00:03:39.300> the

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
take that off and there we have the

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.780 
take that off and there we have the
results<00:03:39.930> maybe<00:03:40.230> have<00:03:40.530> one<00:03:40.830> coin<00:03:41.100> now<00:03:41.430> made<00:03:41.640> out

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
results maybe have one coin now made out

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.040 
results maybe have one coin now made out
of<00:03:41.970> foil<00:03:42.890> we<00:03:43.890> now<00:03:44.070> have<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.790> second<00:03:45.450> coin<00:03:45.690> here

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
of foil we now have the second coin here

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.310 
of foil we now have the second coin here
basing<00:03:46.530> it<00:03:46.680> off<00:03:46.890> of<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.160> 10p<00:03:47.610> I<00:03:48.050> think<00:03:49.050> you<00:03:49.170> can

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
basing it off of the 10p I think you can

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.020 
basing it off of the 10p I think you can
see<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.650> results<00:03:50.070> both<00:03:50.280> of<00:03:50.489> those<00:03:50.640> have<00:03:50.910> been

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
see the results both of those have been

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.050 
see the results both of those have been
clearly<00:03:51.510> cut<00:03:51.720> out<00:03:51.930> just<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:53.430> prove<00:03:53.580> that<00:03:53.790> not

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
clearly cut out just to prove that not

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.410 
clearly cut out just to prove that not
the<00:03:54.209> 10p<00:03:54.630> where<00:03:55.350> are<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.590> coins<00:03:55.769> themselves

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
the 10p where are the coins themselves

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.479 
the 10p where are the coins themselves
so<00:03:57.420> we<00:03:57.570> know<00:03:57.720> how<00:03:57.959> to<00:03:58.380> perfectly<00:03:59.040> flat<00:03:59.220> and

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
so we know how to perfectly flat and

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.790 
so we know how to perfectly flat and
bottle<00:03:59.790> caps<00:03:59.959> we<00:04:00.959> have<00:04:01.080> to<00:04:01.320> foil

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
bottle caps we have to foil

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.940 
bottle caps we have to foil
embellishments<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:03.440> of<00:04:04.440> course<00:04:04.680> we<00:04:04.800> still

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
embellishments and of course we still

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.880 
embellishments and of course we still
have<00:04:05.010> our<00:04:05.130> 10<00:04:05.459> piece<00:04:05.670> to<00:04:05.850> use<00:04:06.030> again<00:04:06.330> again

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
have our 10 piece to use again again

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.670 
have our 10 piece to use again again
that's<00:04:07.890> a<00:04:08.070> very<00:04:08.100> simple<00:04:08.880> way<00:04:09.060> of<00:04:09.330> making

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
that's a very simple way of making

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.400 
that's a very simple way of making
embellishments<00:04:10.680> for<00:04:10.769> a<00:04:10.830> crowd<00:04:11.100> car<00:04:11.430> project

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
embellishments for a crowd car project

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.130 
embellishments for a crowd car project
using<00:04:13.410> very<00:04:13.650> little<00:04:14.040> indeed<00:04:14.220> now<00:04:15.120> you<00:04:15.510> can<00:04:15.750> use

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
using very little indeed now you can use

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.620 
using very little indeed now you can use
thicker<00:04:16.620> items<00:04:17.100> if<00:04:17.310> you<00:04:17.340> want<00:04:17.669> all<00:04:18.180> you<00:04:18.479> would

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
thicker items if you want all you would

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.960 
thicker items if you want all you would
do<00:04:18.780> was<00:04:19.020> alter<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.680> pressure<00:04:19.919> switch<00:04:20.310> we've

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
do was alter the pressure switch we've

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.800 
do was alter the pressure switch we've
had<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.239> pressure<00:04:21.450> switch<00:04:21.780> set<00:04:22.080> there<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.500> run

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
had the pressure switch set there to run

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.409 
had the pressure switch set there to run
about<00:04:22.930> number<00:04:23.350> 12<00:04:23.650> or<00:04:23.830> 13<00:04:24.310> because<00:04:25.090> all<00:04:25.270> we're

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
about number 12 or 13 because all we're

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.830 
about number 12 or 13 because all we're
using<00:04:25.600> our<00:04:26.020> thinner<00:04:26.830> 10p<00:04:27.460> coins<00:04:27.820> so<00:04:28.720> we're

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
using our thinner 10p coins so we're

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.150 
using our thinner 10p coins so we're
going<00:04:28.990> to<00:04:29.080> be<00:04:29.139> doing<00:04:29.320> something<00:04:29.650> else<00:04:29.830> using

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
going to be doing something else using

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.580 
going to be doing something else using
the<00:04:30.250> coins<00:04:30.520> now<00:04:30.790> let's<00:04:31.120> have<00:04:31.270> a<00:04:31.330> look<00:04:31.510> okay

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
the coins now let's have a look okay

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.330 
the coins now let's have a look okay
we'll<00:04:33.070> just<00:04:33.220> remove<00:04:33.490> all<00:04:33.700> that<00:04:35.160> again<00:04:36.160> we're

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
we'll just remove all that again we're

all this with a piece of embossing foil

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.409 
all this with a piece of embossing foil
just<00:05:11.889> say<00:05:12.070> we<00:05:12.190> want<00:05:12.370> to<00:05:12.520> make<00:05:12.700> a<00:05:12.850> background

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
just say we want to make a background

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:15.330 
just say we want to make a background
for<00:05:13.660> a<00:05:13.690> card<00:05:13.930> project<00:05:14.160> okay

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
for a card project okay

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.740 
for a card project okay
so<00:05:16.000> we'll<00:05:16.600> leave<00:05:16.810> them<00:05:17.139> like<00:05:17.500> that<00:05:17.740> cover<00:05:18.220> over

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
so we'll leave them like that cover over

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.159 
so we'll leave them like that cover over
just<00:05:19.750> like<00:05:19.900> that

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
just like that

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.760 
just like that
there<00:05:21.010> we<00:05:21.100> go<00:05:21.510> we'll<00:05:22.510> take<00:05:22.720> our<00:05:22.930> embossing<00:05:23.590> mat

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
there we go we'll take our embossing mat

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.060 
there we go we'll take our embossing mat
cover<00:05:24.460> over<00:05:24.820> the<00:05:24.910> top<00:05:25.150> like<00:05:25.389> that<00:05:25.450> and<00:05:26.070> we'll

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
cover over the top like that and we'll

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.560 
cover over the top like that and we'll
put<00:05:27.280> the<00:05:27.370> pressure<00:05:27.610> switch<00:05:27.940> down<00:05:28.210> a<00:05:28.270> little

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
put the pressure switch down a little

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.830 
put the pressure switch down a little
bit<00:05:28.900> I<00:05:29.020> think<00:05:29.560> we'll<00:05:29.770> put<00:05:30.039> it<00:05:30.190> down<00:05:30.400> to<00:05:30.840> number

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
bit I think we'll put it down to number

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.570 
bit I think we'll put it down to number
eleven<00:05:32.229> this<00:05:32.350> time<00:05:32.650> and<00:05:32.950> we'll<00:05:33.160> have<00:05:33.340> a<00:05:33.370> look

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
eleven this time and we'll have a look

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.460 
eleven this time and we'll have a look
at<00:05:33.669> the<00:05:33.760> results<00:05:34.210> so<00:05:34.930> we<00:05:35.050> have<00:05:35.200> the<00:05:35.289> pressure

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
at the results so we have the pressure

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.130 
at the results so we have the pressure
switch<00:05:35.800> set<00:05:36.070> to<00:05:36.190> number<00:05:36.370> eleven<00:05:36.850> we<00:05:37.720> have<00:05:37.900> the

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
switch set to number eleven we have the

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.469 
switch set to number eleven we have the
base<00:05:38.530> plate<00:05:38.830> we<00:05:39.550> have<00:05:39.669> a<00:05:39.700> selection<00:05:40.030> of<00:05:40.180> coins

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
base plate we have a selection of coins

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.960 
cutting plate okay let's run everything
through<00:05:46.600> the<00:05:46.900> machine<00:05:47.229> there<00:05:48.100> we<00:05:48.220> go<00:05:48.370> oh<00:05:48.550> I<00:05:48.640> can

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
through the machine there we go oh I can

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.629 
through the machine there we go oh I can
feel<00:05:49.150> the<00:05:49.330> pressure<00:05:49.570> as<00:05:49.780> we<00:05:49.870> go<00:05:49.990> through<00:05:50.289> so

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
feel the pressure as we go through so

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.650 
feel the pressure as we go through so
hopefully<00:05:51.639> we've<00:05:51.789> got<00:05:51.940> the<00:05:52.060> pressure<00:05:52.330> switch

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
hopefully we've got the pressure switch

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.500 
hopefully we've got the pressure switch
set<00:05:52.960> just<00:05:53.200> about<00:05:53.470> right<00:05:54.000> we'll<00:05:55.000> remove<00:05:55.270> that

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
set just about right we'll remove that

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.500 
set just about right we'll remove that
from<00:05:55.750> the<00:05:55.960> machine<00:05:56.639> and<00:05:57.639> let's<00:05:58.150> have<00:05:58.270> a<00:05:58.360> look

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
from the machine and let's have a look

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.490 
from the machine and let's have a look
at<00:05:58.630> what<00:05:58.780> we've<00:05:58.960> done<00:05:59.250> let's<00:06:00.250> take<00:06:00.490> this<00:06:00.700> off

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
at what we've done let's take this off

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.920 
at what we've done let's take this off
remove<00:06:02.500> the<00:06:02.650> term<00:06:02.889> embossing<00:06:03.370> mat<00:06:03.750> just<00:06:04.750> give

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
remove the term embossing mat just give

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.290 
remove the term embossing mat just give
that<00:06:05.110> a<00:06:05.139> shake<00:06:05.410> and<00:06:05.680> if<00:06:05.770> I<00:06:05.919> hold<00:06:06.160> up<00:06:06.340> there<00:06:06.580> you

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:39.950 
embellishments as we would alter the

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.980 
embellishments as we would alter the
pressure<00:06:40.310> switch<00:06:40.670> we<00:06:41.210> would<00:06:41.420> open<00:06:41.870> the

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:41.990 
pressure switch we would open the

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.570 
pressure switch we would open the
rollers<00:06:42.320> up<00:06:42.470> a<00:06:42.560> little<00:06:42.740> more<00:06:42.950> a<00:06:43.190> little<00:06:43.280> bit

rollers up a little more a little bit

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.060 
rollers up a little more a little bit
more<00:06:43.700> to<00:06:44.450> take<00:06:44.660> account<00:06:45.050> of<00:06:45.200> the<00:06:45.440> thickness<00:06:45.740> of

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
more to take account of the thickness of

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.430 
more to take account of the thickness of
the<00:06:46.520> embellishments<00:06:47.180> you're<00:06:47.810> not<00:06:48.050> going<00:06:48.350> to

the embellishments you're not going to

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.380 
the embellishments you're not going to
go<00:06:48.560> overboard<00:06:48.980> with<00:06:49.280> the<00:06:49.520> thickness<00:06:49.850> of<00:06:49.970> items

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:50.390 
go overboard with the thickness of items

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.360 
go overboard with the thickness of items
you<00:06:50.450> put<00:06:50.600> through<00:06:50.870> the<00:06:50.960> machine<00:06:51.290> but<00:06:51.920> probably

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
you put through the machine but probably

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.160 
you put through the machine but probably
up<00:06:52.610> to<00:06:52.670> the<00:06:52.880> thickness<00:06:53.210> of<00:06:53.540> the<00:06:53.660> likes<00:06:53.870> of<00:06:54.050> a

yogi can easily be done and all we are
doing<00:06:57.500> is<00:06:57.860> altering<00:06:58.520> the<00:06:58.670> pressure<00:06:58.910> switch

00:06:59.260 --> 00:06:59.270 
doing is altering the pressure switch

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.630 
doing is altering the pressure switch
now<00:06:59.990> things<00:07:00.320> like<00:07:00.530> coins<00:07:00.920> charms

now things like coins charms

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.370 
now things like coins charms
embellishments<00:07:02.300> will<00:07:02.450> always<00:07:02.930> work<00:07:03.140> better

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:03.380 
embellishments will always work better

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.280 
embellishments will always work better
on<00:07:04.100> to<00:07:04.370> embossing<00:07:04.760> foil<00:07:05.240> than<00:07:05.600> anything<00:07:05.930> else

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:06.290 
on to embossing foil than anything else

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.820 
on to embossing foil than anything else
so<00:07:06.890> bear<00:07:07.100> that<00:07:07.130> in<00:07:07.340> mind<00:07:07.520> but<00:07:07.970> sometimes
