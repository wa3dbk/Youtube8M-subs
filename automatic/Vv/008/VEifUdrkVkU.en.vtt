00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:26.029
 marked the absence of Marcelinho serginho and 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.369
 following the bid the corinthians did 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.449
 his first goal with captive Ricardinho 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.449
 can paint the boat 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:45.160
 I'm a corinthians now a mistake that 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.830

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.450
 scored a clear penalty and vampeta and 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.570
 still gave the yellow card to the steering wheel 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:56.410
 do not get dressed 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.840
 a rapa the corinthians ran over the floor

 paulo sérgio seemed to know how 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.920
 it would be missing 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.190
 those goal that gave him a hat and 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.810
 ball passed a law that threatened to leave the 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.670
 club if he was not a holder and then 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.979
 turned back the chance to get in the place 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.979
 de fernando baiano made his 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.020
 a move by the skilful Edwardian 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.720
 left 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.880

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.880
 marcelinho made the third of corinthians 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:39.680
 the corinthians marcelinho me more 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.790
 for I played there sells on 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.790

 Marcelo broke his right foot and hit 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.880
 the corinthians speech tries to be 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.040
 humble 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.050
 São Paulo is a fully staffed 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.060
 capable of reversing this situation of 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.300
 four goals in the next game you take 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.920
 of 4 you recover the group is to raise the 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.810
 A little complicated head, right? 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.350
 we have little time there to be able to 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.350
 to recover
