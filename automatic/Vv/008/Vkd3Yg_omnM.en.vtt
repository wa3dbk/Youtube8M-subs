00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
it's meant for Mellie and I had no idea

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.010 
it's meant for Mellie and I had no idea
during<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.530> time<00:02:37.740> and<00:02:38.130> I<00:02:38.850> use<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.090> for<00:02:39.330> magic<00:02:39.780> I

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
during the time and I use it for magic I

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.200 
during the time and I use it for magic I
had<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.620> live<00:02:40.920> stream<00:02:41.310> when<00:02:41.550> I<00:02:41.610> was<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:41.850> next

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
had a live stream when I was that next

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.080 
had a live stream when I was that next
to<00:02:42.860> so<00:02:43.860> I'm<00:02:44.010> guessing<00:02:44.400> many<00:02:44.670> of<00:02:44.820> you<00:02:44.970> guys

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.240 
to so I'm guessing many of you guys
probably<00:02:45.630> saw<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.080> live<00:02:46.350> stream<00:02:46.680> when<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.040> was

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250
