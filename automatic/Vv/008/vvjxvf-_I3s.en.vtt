00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
very faint at least from what I've heard

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.759 
very faint at least from what I've heard
in<00:02:13.850> terms<00:02:14.090> of<00:02:14.299> the<00:02:14.359> actual<00:02:14.959> chords<00:02:15.590> that<00:02:15.650> you

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
in terms of the actual chords that you

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.080 
in terms of the actual chords that you
hear<00:02:16.070> is<00:02:16.220> very<00:02:16.579> very<00:02:16.910> low<00:02:17.239> very<00:02:18.130> distorted<00:02:19.130> and

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
hear is very very low very distorted and

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.699 
hear is very very low very distorted and
that's<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.600> purpose<00:02:20.900> effect<00:02:21.410> by<00:02:21.650> the

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
that's the purpose effect by the

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.120 
that's the purpose effect by the
producer<00:02:22.310> so<00:02:23.239> it's<00:02:23.630> kind<00:02:24.260> of<00:02:24.350> thing<00:02:24.590> but<00:02:24.859> it's

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
producer so it's kind of thing but it's

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.699 
producer so it's kind of thing but it's
enough<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.579> play<00:02:26.120> piano<00:02:26.420> or<00:02:26.870> have<00:02:27.410> a<00:02:27.440> piano

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.610 
root position chords without the 7th
degree<00:03:46.320> or<00:03:47.190> not<00:03:47.490> it's<00:03:47.700> really<00:03:47.940> up<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:50.360> and

then<00:03:52.620> we<00:03:53.010> go<00:03:53.160> up<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.580> ad<00:03:54.420> major<00:03:57.050> root<00:03:58.730> position

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
then we go up to ad major root position

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.970 
then we go up to ad major root position
