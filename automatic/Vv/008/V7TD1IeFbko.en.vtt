00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
think that when i say along for the

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.210 
think that when i say along for the
other<00:01:40.899> thing<00:01:41.110> second<00:01:41.709> going<00:01:41.830> to<00:01:41.890> be<00:01:41.950> like<00:01:42.069> an

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
other thing second going to be like an

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.090 
other thing second going to be like an
hour<00:01:42.399> video<00:01:42.759> but<00:01:43.149> my<00:01:43.630> like<00:01:44.140> my<00:01:44.500> term<00:01:44.740> or<00:01:44.979> my

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
hour video but my like my term or my

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.990 
hour video but my like my term or my
definition<00:01:45.250> of<00:01:45.580> a<00:01:45.610> long<00:01:45.759> video<00:01:46.390> is<00:01:47.399> like<00:01:48.399> a<00:01:48.429> 15

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
definition of a long video is like a 15

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.940 
definition of a long video is like a 15
minute<00:01:49.209> max<00:01:49.509> video<00:01:49.929> or<00:01:50.170> minimum<00:01:50.590> between<00:01:50.679> nine

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.690 
minutes and i think that's like a
perfect<00:01:53.259> time<00:01:53.440> for<00:01:53.649> a<00:01:53.679> video<00:01:53.950> got<00:01:54.310> enough<00:01:54.520> time
