bowl that's a beautiful red color so now

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.650 
bowl that's a beautiful red color so now
I'm<00:03:49.290> going<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.770> just<00:03:50.010> continue<00:03:50.640> to<00:03:50.670> stir<00:03:51.390> my

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
I'm going to just continue to stir my

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.660 
I'm going to just continue to stir my
mixture<00:03:52.140> so<00:03:53.010> that<00:03:53.040> i<00:03:53.220> can<00:03:53.780> again<00:03:54.780> combine<00:03:55.670> all

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
mixture so that i can again combine all

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.460 
mixture so that i can again combine all
of<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:57.240> coloring<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.830> paste<00:03:59.130> and<00:04:00.470> create

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
of the coloring and the paste and create

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.800 
of the coloring and the paste and create
more<00:04:01.950> of<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.160> smooth<00:04:02.460> consistency<00:04:02.810> because

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
more of a smooth consistency because

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.780 
more of a smooth consistency because
this<00:04:04.230> is<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.500> day<00:04:04.740> that<00:04:04.770> I'm<00:04:05.040> going<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.520> be

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
this is the day that I'm going to be

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.520 
this is the day that I'm going to be
applying<00:04:06.140> my<00:04:07.140> Hannah<00:04:07.730> treatment<00:04:08.730> to<00:04:09.000> my<00:04:09.150> hair

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
applying my Hannah treatment to my hair

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:21.640 
applying my Hannah treatment to my hair
so<00:04:10.530> I<00:04:10.560> just<00:04:10.830> continue<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.520> stir

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.950 

at<00:04:22.650> this<00:04:23.070> point<00:04:23.460> I'm<00:04:23.760> going<00:04:24.120> to<00:04:24.240> add<00:04:24.419> a<00:04:24.449> little

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
at this point I'm going to add a little

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.320 
at this point I'm going to add a little
bit<00:04:25.139> of<00:04:25.199> the<00:04:25.530> particular<00:04:25.949> coconut<00:04:26.639> oil<00:04:26.910> and

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
bit of the particular coconut oil and

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.420 
bit of the particular coconut oil and
because<00:04:28.050> it's<00:04:28.260> an<00:04:28.410> old<00:04:28.650> that<00:04:28.919> tends<00:04:29.250> to

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
because it's an old that tends to

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.180 
because it's an old that tends to
solidify<00:04:30.060> at<00:04:30.510> room<00:04:30.690> temperature<00:04:31.229> I<00:04:31.440> run<00:04:32.070> it

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
solidify at room temperature I run it

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.670 
solidify at room temperature I run it
under<00:04:32.550> hot<00:04:32.580> water<00:04:33.090> and<00:04:33.479> then<00:04:34.050> I<00:04:34.139> can<00:04:34.320> shake<00:04:34.650> it

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
under hot water and then I can shake it

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.879 
under hot water and then I can shake it
so<00:04:35.639> that<00:04:35.790> it<00:04:35.910> loosens<00:04:36.300> up<00:04:36.540> and<00:04:36.840> I<00:04:37.530> don't<00:04:37.590> really

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
so that it loosens up and I don't really

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.650 
so that it loosens up and I don't really
measure<00:04:38.160> at<00:04:38.400> this<00:04:38.550> point<00:04:38.850> but<00:04:39.000> i<00:04:39.120> just<00:04:39.150> put<00:04:39.630> a

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
measure at this point but i just put a

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.980 
measure at this point but i just put a
little<00:04:39.750> bit<00:04:40.080> in<00:04:40.350> and<00:04:40.800> stir<00:04:41.160> and<00:04:41.520> see<00:04:42.389> if<00:04:42.510> i<00:04:42.600> can

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
little bit in and stir and see if i can

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.250 
little bit in and stir and see if i can
loosen<00:04:43.590> up<00:04:43.919> the<00:04:44.400> pace<00:04:45.330> just<00:04:45.660> a<00:04:45.840> little<00:04:46.110> bit

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
loosen up the pace just a little bit

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.159 
loosen up the pace just a little bit
because<00:04:46.530> i<00:04:46.889> want<00:04:47.100> to<00:04:47.160> add<00:04:47.370> a<00:04:47.850> little<00:04:48.570> slip

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
because i want to add a little slip

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.350 
because i want to add a little slip
factor<00:04:49.710> and<00:04:49.949> that's<00:04:50.190> basically<00:04:50.460> due<00:04:50.880> to<00:04:51.120> this

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
factor and that's basically due to this

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.690 
factor and that's basically due to this
texture<00:04:52.080> of<00:04:52.139> my<00:04:52.290> hair<00:04:52.620> and<00:04:52.830> i<00:04:53.280> want<00:04:53.490> to<00:04:53.550> make

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
texture of my hair and i want to make

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.930 
texture of my hair and i want to make
sure<00:04:53.760> that<00:04:53.970> this<00:04:54.330> henna<00:04:54.630> is<00:04:54.750> able<00:04:55.350> to<00:04:55.790> come<00:04:56.790> out

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
sure that this henna is able to come out

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.640 
sure that this henna is able to come out
of<00:04:56.970> my<00:04:57.210> hair<00:04:57.450> easily<00:04:57.630> when<00:04:58.290> it's<00:04:58.440> time<00:04:58.620> to

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
of my hair easily when it's time to

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.550 
of my hair easily when it's time to
rinse<00:05:01.880> so<00:05:02.880> this<00:05:03.419> is<00:05:03.600> the<00:05:03.780> consistency<00:05:04.380> that

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
rinse so this is the consistency that

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.969 
rinse so this is the consistency that
I'm<00:05:04.800> looking<00:05:05.010> for<00:05:05.250> it's<00:05:06.060> less<00:05:06.750> of<00:05:06.960> a<00:05:07.200> mud<00:05:07.530> and

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
I'm looking for it's less of a mud and

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.940 
I'm looking for it's less of a mud and
more<00:05:08.280> of<00:05:08.370> a<00:05:08.460> pudding<00:05:09.000> type<00:05:09.300> consistency<00:05:10.200> and<00:05:10.440> I

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
more of a pudding type consistency and I

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.370 
more of a pudding type consistency and I
