used with your concern will be laced up

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.290 
used with your concern will be laced up
to<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.260> second<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:10.980> top<00:00:11.040> with<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.000> back

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
to the second to the top with the back

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.690 
to the second to the top with the back
on<00:00:12.540> left<00:00:12.750> open<00:00:13.139> so<00:00:13.920> this<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.160> what<00:00:14.309> she<00:00:14.519> used

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
on left open so this is what she used

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.880 
on left open so this is what she used
for<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.940> lot<00:00:15.089> clays<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:16.080> this<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.529> better

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
for a lot clays and this this is better

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.500 
for a lot clays and this this is better
than<00:00:17.070> lacing<00:00:17.490> up<00:00:17.580> straight<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.300> top

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
than lacing up straight to the top

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.300 
than lacing up straight to the top
because<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.320> doesn't<00:00:19.590> go<00:00:19.680> as<00:00:19.710> high<00:00:19.980> up<00:00:20.160> your

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
because it doesn't go as high up your

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.670 
because it doesn't go as high up your
foot<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:20.820> gives<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.150> bit<00:00:21.300> more<00:00:21.680> moving

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
foot so it gives you a bit more moving

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.679 
foot so it gives you a bit more moving
at<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.859> front<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.430> just<00:00:23.970> gives<00:00:24.510> bit

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
at the front and it just gives bit

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.130 
at the front and it just gives bit
improved<00:00:25.140> blood<00:00:25.380> flow<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:26.599> let's<00:00:27.599> just<00:00:27.779> get<00:00:27.930> a

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
improved blood flow so let's just get a

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:36.260 
improved blood flow so let's just get a
shoe<00:00:29.300> and<00:00:34.370> here's<00:00:35.370> what<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.850> should<00:00:35.940> look<00:00:36.090> like

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
shoe and here's what it should look like

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.790 
shoe and here's what it should look like
when<00:00:36.750> it's<00:00:37.380> done

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
when it's done

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.690 
when it's done
you'll<00:00:38.010> see<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.600> at<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.719> top<00:00:39.960> but<00:00:40.410> not<00:00:40.700> too

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
you'll see is at the top but not too

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.280 
you'll see is at the top but not too
high<00:00:41.940> up<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.329> if<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.570> laced<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.930> there'd<00:00:43.110> be<00:00:43.260> a

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
high up like if I laced it there'd be a

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.200 
high up like if I laced it there'd be a
bit<00:00:43.440> higher<00:00:43.620> up<00:00:43.829> mean<00:00:44.460> issues<00:00:44.760> not<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.000> best

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
bit higher up mean issues not the best

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.299 
bit higher up mean issues not the best
example<00:00:45.390> but<00:00:45.809> some<00:00:46.050> do<00:00:46.200> quite<00:00:46.469> go<00:00:46.829> quite<00:00:47.100> far

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
example but some do quite go quite far

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.540 
example but some do quite go quite far
back<00:00:47.370> like<00:00:47.789> there<00:00:48.110> so<00:00:49.110> say<00:00:49.680> with<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.190> method

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
back like there so say with this method

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.959 
back like there so say with this method
it<00:00:50.700> there<00:00:51.239> any<00:00:51.360> Gators<00:00:51.600> around<00:00:51.809> halfway<00:00:52.969> so

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
it there any Gators around halfway so

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.970 
it there any Gators around halfway so
for<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.270> we'll<00:00:54.449> just<00:00:54.600> undo<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.500> back<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.829> its

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
for this we'll just undo it back to its

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.360 
for this we'll just undo it back to its
normal<00:00:56.989> stuck<00:00:57.989> way<00:01:00.800> so<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.100> what<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
normal stuck way so this is what the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.690 
normal stuck way so this is what the
shoe<00:01:04.640> looks<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:07.159> when<00:01:08.159> bought<00:01:08.400> from<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
shoe looks like when bought from the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
first do is you take this side then you

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.480 
first do is you take this side then you
go<00:01:22.380> through<00:01:22.409> here<00:01:22.710> make<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.159> like<00:01:23.810> an<00:01:24.810> A<00:01:25.490> then

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
you go through the other side on the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.350 
you go through the other side on the
same<00:01:29.040> one<00:01:31.130> so<00:01:32.130> now<00:01:32.280> you've<00:01:32.430> got<00:01:32.460> these<00:01:33.060> two

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
same one so now you've got these two

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.910 
same one so now you've got these two
here<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.900> pull<00:01:34.079> them<00:01:34.200> through<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.470> bit<00:01:36.920> so

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
here so you pull them through a bit so

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.850 
here so you pull them through a bit so
now<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.640> take<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.600> side<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.619> pull<00:01:40.829> it

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
now you take that side and pull it

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.240 
now you take that side and pull it
through<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.250> here<00:01:41.990> this<00:01:42.990> side<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.710> tow<00:01:44.220> it

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.179 
through that here this side and tow it
through<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.590> is<00:01:46.590> just<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.979> case<00:01:47.159> of

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
through that it is just a case of

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.630 
through that it is just a case of
pulling<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.850> tight<00:01:50.990> and<00:01:51.990> there<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.229> have<00:01:52.380> it

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
pulling it tight and there you have it

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.679 
pulling it tight and there you have it
there<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:54.899> lock<00:01:55.110> lace<00:01:56.060> they<00:01:57.060> also<00:01:57.210> play

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
there is the lock lace they also play

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.899 
there is the lock lace they also play
around<00:01:57.780> with<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.170> bit<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.500> get<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:59.790> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
around with it a bit to get it to the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.100 
around with it a bit to get it to the
overlap<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:01.200> sync<00:02:01.700> and<00:02:02.700> then<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.270> hope<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.719> hope

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
overlap in sync and then I hope it hope

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.630 
overlap in sync and then I hope it hope
it<00:02:04.229> improves<00:02:04.649> your<00:02:04.950> shoes<00:02:05.850> stability
