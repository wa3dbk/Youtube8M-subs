00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello today we will realize 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.660
 a hem at the double pointed at the 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.910
 sewing machine 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:13.049
 so I prepared the machine with a 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:17.609
 Film year puts cans and file 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:21.119
 polyester for the needle fields i have 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.949
 dropped a little attention of the fields 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.019
 needles to have a good point 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.550
 elastic 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:33.350
 here and there I go I prepared my gold 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:38.160
 the ones I attached to the tape 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:41.180
 temporary I lost 2 cm and so 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:46.170
 I will prepare my work table 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:57.859
 with putting a scotch mark 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:01:01.320
 colored to 2 cm that will allow me to 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.640
 follow more easily to be from 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.300
 realize my would have much more 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.960
 regularly 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.010
 I removed this part of the machine 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.619
 to have the long arm 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.020
 and here we are going to start heavy the 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.780
 teeth the beginning of the side of the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.909
 assembly stitch that's it for that 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.360
 is seen less 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:26.100
 we'll start just before to not 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.170
 for easter the machine that is in same 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.820
 if if there is no problem since I have 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.729
 a double workout for this 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.890
 flagship machine so she would go without 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.259
 worry about the assembly stitch 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.020
 jabÃ¨s montpied mutsch and we start to 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.310
 sew I asked the machine like 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.220
 these electronic machines i'm going 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.509
 ask that needles remain 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.509
 always down when I stop 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.680
 cool to see just now what 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.680
 it's gone 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:04.600
 that's the sound it's the coils that get 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.550
 unfolds as you sew 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.550
 do not worry about normal enough 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:25.640
 I accompany gently got off the 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.959
 manage the fabric here i'm going to show you 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.340
 just now when I have more than 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.519
 sewing I'm going to show you what that 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.519
 given 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:05.810
 every time I give the tissues well 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.600
 There are plenty of them and here we are, I do not shoot 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.400
 on everything we stretch because otherwise we will 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.930
 have cuts that convolent and we 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.930
 it's not the goal 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:08.680
 so that's what it gives on the wrong side 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:10.540
 we see here we see here blue films 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.330
 I have deliberately made targets 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.700
 needles then this is the film where the 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.880
 in the middle that will do virtually no 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.240
 design but against me that's me 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:26.639
 allows me to have an elastic seam 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:34.979
 who will follow the fabric is the goal 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:34.979
 here we are going to take care of the thing 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.910
 here I want to get my girls on 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.430
 the reverse of work before coming 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:49.500
 superimpose the beginning and the end of a 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.150
 sewing so here I have my film I 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.389
 yours 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:58.199
 and then I pass my pin in the 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:09.090
 queuing to get my sons 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:11.610
 of aiguilhe on the other side I did 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:16.070
 to align I try to go and name me 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:18.840
 two cultures that's two points 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.510
 no more because I'm going to tie the 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.070
 son between them if I go further they 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:28.139
 are too far away to be named 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:31.370
 together and then I climb my limits I 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.370
 make my firefighters houseboat 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:41.310
 I also have enough time 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:44.100
 to be able to noodles so see here 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.830
 again I have my nets him who 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.919
 censor laonnois I will pass 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:54.229
 on back always with my pin 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:54.229
 So there he began were 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:03.949
 I shoot a little my film years and I have them 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:08.000
 loops that appear and so I'm going 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:09.940
 we and the finances between and the queues 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.370
 polyester needle threads 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.630
 Overall if you do not have Freenews 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.490
 you can use a well of 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.069
 polyester instead you will have a little 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:26.930
 little less extensibility but that 

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:29.300
 still works to achieve 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.530
 this tour you need a needle 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.860
 double stretch 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.509
 that is to say a double needle of which 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:40.430
 both needles are designed to 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:44.449
 sew the jersey fabric the enamel too 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:48.740
 I used emulators is double 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:51.560
 stretch here with a spacing of 4 mm 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:55.819
 this is the first number here here and in 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:07:00.860
 size 64 not too big to not do 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:07:05.590
 too big too much in the gr 10 here 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.590
 it's a cotton surfer exactly 

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.139
 and now a knee 

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.530
 his son and leather 

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:45.790
 here is the stitching stopped I'm going 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.170
 to take this with nepal a needle 

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.670
 I will go into sewing for 

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:51.280
 that they see it appears that they are 

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:54.430
 do not go away and on the spot this is at 

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:57.580
 beginning and end of sewing are there and 

00:07:54.430 --> 00:08:01.750
 this is a new relay that does not control 

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:06.150
 not the regulars that's all we 

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:06.150
 wanted a balloon on the g16
