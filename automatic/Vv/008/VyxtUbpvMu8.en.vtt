00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:08.250
 the perfect delineated is usually a 

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:11.130
 mix of practice and technique if the pulse 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.140
 is not your best friend do not worry here 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.980
 We will give you some techniques to 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.710
 delineate your eyes in this opportunity 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.080
 We will use the following products 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.600
 pencil eyeliner with pure color shade 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.350
 in the back black eyeliner 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.260
 style eyeliner gel mask 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.239
 perfect curly we'll start by 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.999
 show you the technique with the eyeliner 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.120
 the pencil ensures that the tip is 

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:41.729
 sharpened for more precision the basics of 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.909
 any outline is to make small 

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:46.469
 traces that we will be joining little by little 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:48.859
 you can do it from the middle of the eye 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.589
 backwards or from the lacrimal 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:54.179
 depending on how comfortable you are 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.460
 like the texture of this eyeliners 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:58.829
 creamy seal with a shadow on 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.589
 powder of the same color so that it does not 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.009
 run this outlined has a result 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.900
 more casual and is perfect for the day to 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.600
 day 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.030
 and then we'll go to the technique to 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.940
 apply liquid eyeliner so 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.920
 we will use this pen style 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.590
 requires more pulse so the first 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.450
 advice is to use your minute as a point of 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.520
 support on the cheekbone 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.030
 the key is to use it horizontally 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.790
 and not the tip you can start from where 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.090
 you want the result in this outlined 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.100
 it's a little more intense so it's 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.010
 very good for special occasions or 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.100
 to wear at night last you 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.140
 we will show how to delineate with gel this 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.960
 eyeliner is worked with a brush 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.810
 special bristles couples and that are not 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.450
 very flexible together the brush in the 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.850
 container and we are working small 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.150
 strokes from the middle of the eye towards 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.790
 outside it 's important to do it from this 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.800
 way so that we can better control the 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.710
 quantity of products to delineate the 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.560
 Lacrimal area the result of this 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.679
 product is light and precise so that 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.109
 serves both day and night 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.989
 all delineated are reinforced with a 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:17.980
 pair of mask layers for this 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:21.560
 we will use the perfect curly mask 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:26.379
 as you can see it's not that hard you're 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.379
 ready to show off that fabulous delineated
