00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
they are not ready for

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.170 
they are not ready for
in<00:05:26.810> other<00:05:26.960> words<00:05:27.140> mass<00:05:27.590> awakening<00:05:28.370> it<00:05:28.580> sounds

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.080 
good
but<00:05:30.110> the<00:05:30.500> reason<00:05:30.950> that<00:05:31.130> it<00:05:31.310> is<00:05:31.340> flawed<00:05:31.790> is

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
but the reason that it is flawed is

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.940 
but the reason that it is flawed is
because<00:05:32.420> you<00:05:32.780> can't<00:05:33.080> wake<00:05:33.290> up<00:05:33.470> for<00:05:33.650> anyone

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
because you can't wake up for anyone

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.530 
because you can't wake up for anyone
else<00:05:34.190> you<00:05:34.340> can<00:05:34.490> only<00:05:34.670> wake<00:05:34.820> up<00:05:35.000> for<00:05:35.180> yourself

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
else you can only wake up for yourself
