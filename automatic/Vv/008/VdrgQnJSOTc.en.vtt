00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.410
 the work the best kept secret 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.719
 this side of 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.190
 actually makes good from everywhere 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.900
 maybe not much but this one 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.830
 Moist rock holds more than a few 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.830
 surprises ready 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.349
 Life here is insane 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.720
 but not for the faint of heart 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.509
 while most people are hobbies 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.800
 have remained carving or embroidering 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.800
 we do more with such things as 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.690
 We used to have a little kite 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.880
 problem but that was five years ago 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.680
 Now they all live with us 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.110
 honest why not yet we have 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.240
 Special place to eat a new can 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.450
 feed dispenser an automatic kite 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:01:00.250
 car wash and even a 1a 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.250
 Fire protection if I say so 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.340
 So, now, train your dragon for the second of the 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.800
 The first film was at that time with the public 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.850
 how critical a towering 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.930
 Surprise success that a second 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:17.750
 The young boy could hardly resist 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.350
 vikings hicks and his zama dragon without 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.870
 tooth 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.540
 two friends the common kite 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.790
 enjoy flying so intensely that you 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.540
 in front of the big 3d canvas almost jealous 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.310
 could be 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.610
 This is a scene with the whole 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.380
 charm of the first part of maybe 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.960
 towards the end of the film in the exclamation of 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.570
 fight against drago the enemy of all 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.710
 good kite and viking a little bit 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:02:01.479
 is how to work right 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:02:01.479
 small dispute but now it's your turn 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.330
 yes yes yes it's all right very well won 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.580
 he is lying on the ground 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:20.500
 not at all went so well the enemies 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.500
 battle continues until the bitter 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.680
 do not go out 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.210
 what do you mean we fly on 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:52.069
 what happened here at his 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.230
 extensive exploration airline flights arrived 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.349
 the inquisitive hicks in a bizarre 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.530
 and how it looks extremely dangerous 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.530
 terrain 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.290
 he does not suspect that he is here shortly before 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.299
 elucidation of an old family recipe 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.620
 stands 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:15.010
 who are you at all what I understand 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.010
 legend 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:44.860
 is that possible 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:48.910
 yes not not from somewhere no but 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:51.709
 a mother never forgets 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.200
 Come back , you can not 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.260
 Just say something and run off 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:03.680

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:04.690

 It has always been called you will be dead of all 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.150
 world thinks you have been eaten by 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.609
 the mother has a monster as 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.000
 created and it almost seems that the 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.730
 world is full of kites 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.250
 The spectator opens a fantasy 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:28.630
 idylle in the department of the 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:31.300
 films let off steam 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.790
 kind of believable 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.190
 designed and supervised by the big one 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:40.770
 cameraman roger deakins as possible 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.770
 authentically set in motion and moved 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:59.190

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:02.180

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.180

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:15.600
 found he was shot and killed 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:19.290

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.980
 everything about kites every dragon has one 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.420
