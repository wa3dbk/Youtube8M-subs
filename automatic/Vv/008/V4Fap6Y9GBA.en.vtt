00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.910
 other boys are various baritones 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:17.680
 art of high places of the week or the 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.270
 stage is composed of similar clip stuff there 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.099
 sees every week that you have to 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.990
 this top five is kindly 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.640
 full-page services the linke in film 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.220
 description however first guys 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.140
 start I wanted to remember about Via Cecchi 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.399
 more clips possible because of this 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.079
 week I had some problems 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:33.760
 choose the positions while the patch is 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.379
 then composed they would serve if not the 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.719
 sent I can't put clips 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.340
 beautiful as it often happens on no 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.289
 you worry there are some in this top 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.670
 of cute now we leave immediately with the 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:45.670
 fifth position that there is the door to 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.030
 bugatti is not as fast as the car 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.890
 however it is found on modern warfare you 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.050
 he said so, not even because 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.999
 is on high grade trying to do 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.800
 ciotta entry starts by shooting a no scoop 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:59.170
 maybe to start doing all the things 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.089
 what do you do trickster and take the moles 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.589
 so maybe by mistake but still there 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.500
 there is also a fourth care clip 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.970
 position we find it kills which is found 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.670
 su detroit if I 'm not mistaken with the 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.530
 bomber decides to pull it almost 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.450
 cash the team wishes ally perhaps 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.159
 will get them this time you are going to 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.870
 see in 3d between home dies obviously 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.450
 his bomber is that at 90 percent 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.460
 times to kill oneself and I recommend it 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.290
 when I pulled it and always put on 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.940
 under a house because otherwise you don't 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.290
 other than killing you even if done 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.090
 a trim for how he did not 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.340
 help in your streak why 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.070
 you are beautiful that the dead still in third 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.340
 position we find orc den which is found 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.500
 on black ops 2 on carrier and decides 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.540
 take the ballistic knife pulls the 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.450
 first boom does the first one pulls another 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.160
 he does the second one unfortunately continues here 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.080
 It does not take even in the third whether it would 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.520
 he was then kidnapped in the middle of the 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.170
 game makes another one this not 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.360
 just a cross but paul decided to 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.320
 leave it anyway since it wasn't there 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.210
 nothing bad 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.420
 this killer still follows her one 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.430
 position we find hicks for xp in 92 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.510
 I do n't know the quality was quite low 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.490
 I could not read the name 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.670
 I hope 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.110
 just a wine rmn so I don't think of it 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.940
 let's make a good slaughter 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.860
 with the remington pity a little 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.560
 fades had all been quads 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.540
 that is, if what is has not happened 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.060
 success in short, you have understood before that 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.550
 say between crap since then there are 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.959
 all the fidel experts below in the 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.849
 comments as it should be that me 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.980
 they say I don't understand a shit it is 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.849
 true, however, let's leave has done 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.400
 a beautiful feed 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.290
 to the first position we find today xt 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.780
 Pep the two is on advanced warfare 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.610
 with the laser weapon that has become a bit 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.190
 too strong it seems to me told with the page 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.140
 already taken two for and in the third the fourth 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.720
 then it would just own stereo located on 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.970
 alison obviously starts making one 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.799
 nafiz slaughter very long for this 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.540
 in my opinion, if the first position was guided 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.610
 then with the violet there were no 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.470
 clips will be guided as I like of 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.569
 so usually you remember again 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.180
 send us more good clips anyway already 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.470
 taken 67 I do not know however continues 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.510
 files on this game are enough 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.090
 slow so maybe they have facilitated 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.459
 indeed certainly but the clip I have nothing 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.140
 to say I would not do it sincerely 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.790
 I never want to play with 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.590
 bearded 6 disgusting as among other things 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.750
 a few minutes cannes managed to 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.640
 do 48 anyway and as long as and hopefully two 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.200
 cts headquarters thus transform into the square and 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.790
 commented subscribe to us still stands 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.380
