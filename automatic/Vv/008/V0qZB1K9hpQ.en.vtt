be like I said we believe in any

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.999

injustice<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.079> we<00:01:49.170> never<00:01:49.380> really<00:01:49.740> thought

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
injustice and we never really thought

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:50.600 
injustice and we never really thought
about<00:01:50.070> that

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
about that

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.289 
about that
he<00:01:51.600> kept<00:01:51.810> bended<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.350> he's<00:01:52.530> not<00:01:53.000> not<00:01:54.000> able<00:01:54.180> to

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
he kept bended that he's not not able to

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.990 
he kept bended that he's not not able to
race<00:01:54.540> because<00:01:54.960> he<00:01:55.399> didn't<00:01:56.399> do<00:01:56.460> anything<00:01:56.700> wrong

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
race because he didn't do anything wrong

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.219 
race because he didn't do anything wrong
and<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:58.070> believe<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.100> it

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
and I believe that it

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:06.520 
and I believe that it
the<00:02:00.860> situation<00:02:01.399> sells<00:02:01.700> quickly<00:02:05.530> honestly

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
the situation sells quickly honestly

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.520 
the situation sells quickly honestly
before<00:02:06.950> before<00:02:07.880> Frank's<00:02:08.179> case<00:02:08.479> I<00:02:10.300> never<00:02:11.500> was

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
before before Frank's case I never was

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.750 
before before Frank's case I never was
if<00:02:12.890> there<00:02:13.040> was<00:02:13.190> something<00:02:13.430> I<00:02:14.000> always<00:02:14.030> fought

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
if there was something I always fought

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.000 
if there was something I always fought
but<00:02:16.760> it<00:02:16.910> really<00:02:17.060> changed<00:02:17.510> my<00:02:17.569> way<00:02:18.349> of<00:02:18.380> thinking

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
but it really changed my way of thinking

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.229 
but it really changed my way of thinking
I<00:02:20.709> believe<00:02:21.709> that<00:02:21.920> mothers<00:02:22.610> can<00:02:22.640> be<00:02:22.970> really

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
I believe that mothers can be really

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.640 
I believe that mothers can be really
treated<00:02:23.599> unfair<00:02:23.989> in<00:02:24.110> second<00:02:25.720> so<00:02:26.720> I<00:02:27.049> don't

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
treated unfair in second so I don't

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.979 
treated unfair in second so I don't
point<00:02:27.860> my<00:02:27.950> finger<00:02:28.400> at<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:29.090> case<00:02:29.269> like<00:02:29.510> until<00:02:29.870> I

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
point my finger at the case like until I

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.360 
point my finger at the case like until I
can<00:02:30.170> maybe<00:02:31.480> someone<00:02:32.480> is<00:02:33.349> positive<00:02:33.980> like<00:02:34.190> we've

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
can maybe someone is positive like we've

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.300 
can maybe someone is positive like we've
seen<00:02:34.580> in<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.819> past<00:02:35.080> get<00:02:36.080> caught<00:02:36.319> with<00:02:36.530> EPO<00:02:36.920> or

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
testing and you cannot compare the time

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.800 
testing and you cannot compare the time
now<00:03:42.170> then<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.980> time<00:03:43.340> was<00:03:46.239> 10<00:03:47.239> years<00:03:47.389> ago<00:03:47.510> with

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
now then the time was 10 years ago with

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.370 
now then the time was 10 years ago with
Lance<00:03:48.019> and<00:03:48.440> the<00:03:49.069> time<00:03:49.310> all<00:03:49.549> of<00:03:50.019> yeah<00:03:51.019> let's<00:03:51.260> say

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
Lance and the time all of yeah let's say

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.309 
Lance and the time all of yeah let's say
that<00:03:51.560> area<00:03:51.980> because<00:03:52.370> also<00:03:53.090> if<00:03:53.329> you<00:03:53.660> look<00:03:53.780> back

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
that area because also if you look back

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:55.960 
that area because also if you look back
at<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.560> time<00:03:54.769> no<00:03:54.950> one<00:03:54.980> get<00:03:55.280> caught<00:03:55.489> positive

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
at the time no one get caught positive

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.050 
at the time no one get caught positive
because<00:03:56.510> there<00:03:56.660> was<00:03:56.750> not<00:03:56.870> enough<00:03:56.930> tests<00:03:58.060> today

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
because there was not enough tests today

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.420 
because there was not enough tests today
every<00:03:59.389> year<00:03:59.660> you<00:03:59.810> get<00:03:59.989> again<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:00.440> every<00:04:00.680> every

lead

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.149 
lead
we<00:04:05.959> emit<00:04:06.959> something<00:04:07.200> so<00:04:07.530> I<00:04:07.560> believe<00:04:07.920> that's

also that's also because there's there's

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.220 
also that's also because there's there's
more<00:04:11.609> testing<00:04:12.120> just<00:04:12.299> biologically<00:04:12.989> possible

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
more testing just biologically possible

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.099 
more testing just biologically possible
and<00:04:13.680> if<00:04:14.370> I<00:04:14.519> hear<00:04:14.700> if<00:04:14.999> I<00:04:15.180> read<00:04:15.389> oh<00:04:15.420> here's

doping 20 or 15 years ago that you you

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.209 
doping 20 or 15 years ago that you you
have<00:05:51.270> to<00:05:51.419> depend<00:05:52.169> them<00:05:52.440> from<00:05:52.740> from<00:05:52.919> cycling

today<00:05:53.490> because<00:05:53.820> that's<00:05:54.030> also<00:05:54.800> maybe<00:05:55.800> the

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
today because that's also maybe the

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:57.469

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
difference today because he knew how it

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:00.980 
difference today because he knew how it
was<00:05:59.190> in<00:05:59.370> the<00:05:59.460> past<00:05:59.639> and<00:06:00.000> they<00:06:00.150> learn<00:06:00.599> from<00:06:00.840> the

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
was in the past and they learn from the
