00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.330
 hello friends welcome to train review 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.770
 this time we are with Luis Alberto 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.629
 sometimes you ask us what they have in the 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.889
 backpack to the winners that put in a 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.630
 backpack well we are going to ask you 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.539
 Luis Alberto is in his backpack 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.390
 to do a transvulcania in this 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:25.900
 case the 2015 edition luis alberto 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.430
 first that backpack is good to the material 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.560
 mandatory as secure as what 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.529
 can carry in the mornings are a 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.640
 fanny pack and then yes we are going to not 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.710
 we have it all acid but 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.390
 alternating the backpack to carry the 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.710
 more comfortable water this year have been removed 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.089
 a habitually and it will be necessary 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.100
 bring more water and in the fanny pack maybe 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:43.929
 can not take everything necessary maybe 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.510
 need one liter last year had 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:50.589
 in the fanny pack only 700 milliliters 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.359
 and good this year in some sector 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:53.739
 of between two attachments we are going to 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.539
 need a liter is to say that it's going to 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.550
 There are stretches of backpack and stretches in 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.800
 you're going to change it up riÃ±onera 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.569
 that's the idea of agreement the backpack 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.219
 in this case that's what you have here 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:04.750
 the backpack to bring it to the interview 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.550
 the interview is valid in the morning 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.960
 come the question to which you take again 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.939
 is the mandatory material is a 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.640
 windbreaker I will wear this that is a 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:15.210
 smoking paper 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.520
 and nothing as sure as the good thing that 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.720
 goal that is a position 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.900
 I will not do it anymore if I would put it here in it 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.090
 in the jacket pocket dance more 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.300
 more more folding was going to still bulge 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.300
 less 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.310
 the windbreaker good do we have 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.260
 have to carry a red light for the output 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.960
 is going to be this very tiny and I 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.100
 I will also put in will also go into 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.690
 the bag behind the tricks and it 's 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.030
 enough for the orange to look 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.800
 well I'm taking out the thermal blanket 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.880
 It also goes super-folded of the measures 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.280
 it's not exactly what it has to be 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.410
 you gave them I had lived 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.790
 three laps of the dice three laps 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.890
 so that they give the touches so that it remains 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.500
 this pretty brown earthquake that does not come back 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.880
 between now and then the front this is 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.280
 the front that I will carry throughout the race 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.560
 the smallest thing that we have that we have 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.550
 found for a squeeze would serve 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.440
 but good for the exit until 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.670
 the desired ones more or less we will continue 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.020
 confront a little bit bigger than 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.340
 then maybe we 'll leave but let's go this is 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.470
 the number that I will carry all the 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.040
 race also mandatory material 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.880
 Okay, here's my phone 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.520
 so it will carry in a pocket 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.190
 here the meshes are worth the same phone 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.740
 as small as possible of the old ones and 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.260
 as a compulsory subject is then 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.980
 we are always going to take the course 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.290
 water gels bars consumers of 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.379
 gels 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.379
 every 20 minutes every 30 or so 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:47.689
 that you did not take that quite alone 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.890
 take every 45 minutes every 50 more or 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:51.500
 less as the 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.170
 refreshments but yes yes no no no 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.049
 It gives no kind of problems and as it took 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.879
 quite is also a matter of that being 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.530
 some carbohydrate gummies 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.689
 bar also and good above all 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.579
 too much much liquid is to say that 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:06.439
 a transvulcania the whole raisin only 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.150
 with this also the flags to the 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.650
 controls you attack something to the solids and 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.220
 Attempt are also the refreshments 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.049
 and with taking therefore the logical not if there is 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.670
 some figs are also usually give 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.889
 some banana figs whatever 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.049
 he also takes a drink because 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.639
 to take it and to take between a 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.370
 demented habitat and another of course that 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:28.129
 apart from that it gives much more energy 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.260
 images for a gel is much more comfortable 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.790
 take of course for those who have 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.799
 seen many times with the clubs you have 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.849
 lowered and I can attest that they are about 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:39.769
 sticks as if we would say curados and that 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.439
 have been good hours these I think are what 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.150
 lighter are carbon and apart they give 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:45.890
 quite stiff the only thing that I have 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.720
 changed is that I have removed the 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.840
 the hilt not because of the weight but because 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.600
 by hitting them then a bullet bulge still 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.000
 less and how I'm hanging normally from 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.610
 the dragonera almost does not need me 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.350
 that have grip and good when it is 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.450
 no longer embassy since you have already seen it 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.700
 a video out there I put it on my back 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.280
 and going up then in a moment you know 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.980
 blocks and those are the best canes 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.650
 I have found and this year is from 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.360
 we did not use last year and this year as 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.870
 I think that from that of the 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.370
 desired of the pillar forgiveness we will take from 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.340
 pillar or the blowout we will take these 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.110
 sticks to take them to the rock 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.150
 well this is to say we like 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.380
 much the material is well thought of 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.760
 somehow it's true that these clubs 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.530
 when the ones already expected between us are the 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.570
 grip makes fattening that is to say that 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.740
 in this way also with the 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.180
 adhesive tape you have not got 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.560
 slide with what you already have but 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.620
 How do you say your license plate of the dragonera 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.790
 already explains mind not practically the 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.770
 force we do it like that with your hand 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.780
 open even for all the strength of 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.009
 tense because we do not save simply 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.639
 we make 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:54.360
 the grip in principle is not necessary 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:56.719
 Well, this is what will take tomorrow 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.580
 is Luis Alberto to face is 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:00.990
 Transvulcania 2015 of much luck of 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.580
 thanks for explaining the material that 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.899
 you use and that it goes very well 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.919
 come thanks to you chests 

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:06.919
 then see you later
