 Depression is a very common heart disease, but 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:16.240
 Instead, if you become depressed, your mood will become basic 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:20.300
 It is easy to put a vicious cycle in such a way that you are depressed more if you think about things pessimistically 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:25.759
 In other words, it is known that there is a danger of getting worse and worse if you leave it 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:31.699
 In the worst case you lose work or in the worst case suicide 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:33.590
 Brain that very is why it is known that often it another depression can become 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:37.879
 It is abnormal condition of 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.290
 Well, maybe I'm in a state where I'm lacking in the brain transmitter and serotonin . 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:45.030
 But it's a long lasting husband 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.370
 If Denon itself gets weird and it gets so hard to cure 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.040
 It is known to say 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:54.430
 Fu that's early detection and early treatment is very important disease because depression in that sense 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.550
 I believe in 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:03.130
 Until now, the principle was to cure with medicine 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:04.640
 And very well, it is a treatment that is expected to selectively increase serotonin in the brain. 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:11.120
 It is true that 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:16.369
 Toka's who are receiving such treatment recently while stick will come out is violence urge 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:18.980
 I'm going home and I'm getting more suicide or I can't stop medicine for a long time 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:24.630
 Become strange wind and would quit from it 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:28.590
 It is understood that there are many unexpected side effects in the form of 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:33.329
 Between I such as another recent depression Society 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:37.220
 Because the side effects of drugs are becoming a problem, especially when it is mild, counseling treatment 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:42.210
 Japanese case Unfortunately, said not a do it but have to Fu that is good 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:44.620
 It can not be said that adequate training for the treatment of counseling is widespread 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:50.500
 I think that way 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:56.530
 To what is paid attention that certain suicide is reduced surely or there is relatively immediate effect 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.640
 There is an electric treatment, but the electric shock treatment is properly done by general anesthesia in the room. 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.420
 It will have to be 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:05.689
 And Do not pretty ambitious things 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:09.380
 At the same but it's a treatment method using the time to say tms than this is relatively 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:13.340
 First of all side effects is very low it from Well 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:19.440
 On the other hand it significantly reduces the risk of suicide 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:22.010
 Feel free to by the Fu say that it is the treatment that can be very promising in that attend an outpatient visits 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.010
 I think
