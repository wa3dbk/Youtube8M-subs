00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
because like I said cartoon network

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.800 
because like I said cartoon network
doesn't<00:03:16.650> give<00:03:16.920> a<00:03:16.950> damn<00:03:17.040> about<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.640> and<00:03:17.810> let's

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
doesn't give a damn about it and let's

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.600 
doesn't give a damn about it and let's
just<00:03:18.900> say<00:03:19.110> they<00:03:19.200> can't<00:03:19.410> buy<00:03:19.530> no<00:03:19.740> network<00:03:20.130> why

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
just say they can't buy no network why

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.190 
just say they can't buy no network why
that<00:03:20.820> create<00:03:21.120> your<00:03:21.300> own<00:03:21.360> network<00:03:21.930> and

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
that create your own network and

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.500 
that create your own network and
probably<00:03:22.920> save<00:03:23.250> us<00:03:23.459> all<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.760> trouble<00:03:24.000> and

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
probably save us all the trouble and

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.480 
probably save us all the trouble and
then<00:03:25.020> number<00:03:25.140> three<00:03:25.530> which<00:03:25.950> is<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.190> one<00:03:26.340> that

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
then number three which is the one that

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.360 
then number three which is the one that
I<00:03:26.670> want<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:27.120> happen<00:03:27.530> just<00:03:28.530> release<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:29.040> entire

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
I want to happen just release the entire
