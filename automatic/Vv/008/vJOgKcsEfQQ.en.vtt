00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 Well, I'll show you the lever 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:09.150
 arcade I made and I made it several 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.410
 little things and controls that buy and 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.929
 buttons and chinga of media it was 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:19.289
 pretty much this more or less and I would not say 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.830
 pretty much more or less difficult to 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.960
 monitor and control parades 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.699
 connect them mom buttons no no no 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.349
 I think it's difficult but because 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.800
 there are many cables where is it going to 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.090
 see below then there is the is not 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.840
 well doing what is here 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.840
 this is 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.420
 and there I will show you the 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.850
 explanations then it goes out then 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.530
 no, it's not here 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.789
 on a table 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.789
 and on a table 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.280
 and then I do not stay well so I put a 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.800
 pinturita to make it look like a 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.970
 dark color the wood buttons 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.970
 red the lever too 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.890
 It does not work well 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:16.229
 perfect let's see what it would look like 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.530
 not there is the table as you can see it is 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.479
 a table and then the cables are like this 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.420
 no sight because I have not seen that 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.110
 put him and I can not think of anything you can 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.110
 with that mother 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.479
 and so 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.170
 what more advanced and monkeys are going to see it 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.210
 under 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.870
 how about the good taste you 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.790
 Some 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.630
 let's see a cable from the one who knows 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.630
 what monkeys 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.119
 now I say of the china that you are going to see 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.119
 here 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.219
 to our mother 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.610
 Well, if a good pull hit me 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.229
 Peleite who can sell this method 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.229
 cable has hurt tallin's shit 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.350
 so the connections have been grabbed with 

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.480
 terminals 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.790
 and with a terminal block too 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.490
 those that go out to nuance more 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.120
 better the cables and you can see it here 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:24.100
 the plate is the control board is 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.010
 this below that is here 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.210
 he can not and he better wants to take them out 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.520
 to the cables of a pull the cables 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.040
 so that the connections of some cables or 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.200
 of the hard drive of the old is a 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:44.230
 agreement as it is called a bit of those 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.230
 and there they are from with a little 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.530
 what's this shit called if you read with 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.450
 milk so they will not be interference 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.970
 of the connections I do not know if it's short or 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:59.200
 something like that and I put that in a 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.910
 from a little box where they put a sandwich 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.900
 ready ready nose 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.900
 let's see it here 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.740
 everything you want and everything is fine 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.320
 playable and ready, well, there is everything 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.160
 and then it comes out thanks for the idea of power 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.160
 be
