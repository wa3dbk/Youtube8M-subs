because<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.700> love<00:02:31.000> competing<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.840> love

so that seems physique seems to be the

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.150 
so that seems physique seems to be the
division<00:02:37.090> of<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.270> future<00:02:37.630> and<00:02:38.110> I<00:02:38.680> think<00:02:38.890> I

division of the future and I think I

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.860

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
probably should hop on board and after

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.420 
probably should hop on board and after
