00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.770
 good 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.460
 i 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.320
 Y 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.980
 good 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.380
 hi how about that since in huancayo with a 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.020
 advantage over eating for children of 5 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.260
 minutes is not much we are relaxed 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.600
 happy without pressure to go out to a 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:13.160
 one that you heard yesterday accelerates a little more 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.350
 if you can increase the advantage and get 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.570
 the quietest for Cuban ayacucho 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.490
 that is in the mix with a man in the 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.220
 ports not spectacular really 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.170
 we have there as a copilot we have 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.090
 fernando mussano the coordinator is 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.010
 Alvaro Grande we are doing a good 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.200
 team work all the boys 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.280
 they are very happy and that good no no 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.990
 with other roads we end up very 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.800
 calm before the race and that's 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.800
 pretty good 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.200
 that will look for a stage with fall of 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.400
 course accelerates like all stages 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.400
 then a little more
