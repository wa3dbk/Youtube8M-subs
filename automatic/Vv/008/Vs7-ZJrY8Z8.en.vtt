00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello and welcome to world of tanks 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.960
 with the 13th 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.370
 my name is khan and today i announce 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:15.660
 me back with a little one 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:18.210
 bang in plates with 39 tanks 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.000
 in a battle in which we are the only ones 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.220
 are apart from the three in the opponent 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.599
 team that could be good 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.420
 and I have it now at the very beginning 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:35.190
 already mentioned small bang 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:36.840
 get ready for what you see 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.719
 team is distributed relatively evenly 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.370
 here on the map that's it 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.780
 a good condition on this map 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.010
 order here to win 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.360
 Let's see how we go about this 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:55.230
 you see blog here right of me 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:58.039
 I make room for oslo 84 here in the 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.329
 50 120 can deal powerfully 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.820
 and when I reloaded I was 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.750
 back there 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.600
 until then, the two already have 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.650
 everything tidied up 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.820
 I could not do that so fast 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.930
 Do not react to your load 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.909
 So we have to do a little bit 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.270
 Next venture to a shot 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.270
 catch 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:24.530
 t 34 which is guaranteed to keep good yes 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.530
 probably took chance to risk 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.390
 Of course, that's just the moment 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.000
 Normally you can drive with 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.400
 this cannon also t 34 at toom 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.450
 damage when you head off to the 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.090
 side therefore meets this tower lack 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.829
 if you like 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.600
 well next time maybe we 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.520
 push as before said we are here 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.630
 only 9th 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.630
 apart from the three in the opposing team 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.250
 That's why we can stay here a bit 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:02.470
 Take out what year is sleeping 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:05.050
 me here through the picture of the tower but he 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.360
 misses the T 34 an important shot 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.890
 Now I have a bit of a problem 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.160
 did not drive after me here because of me 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.840
 it's just too hot up there again 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.470
 bounced or not hit better 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.490
 It is sometimes called a real flight 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.490
 this stupid t 34 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.750
 but now comes in the beautiful 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.970
 weird sound from the side 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.650
 quite good 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.940
 t 25 2 you have just left in the picture 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:41.080
 seen the exact but first get it 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:44.560
 s8 again 502 devils pushed in t25 2 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.470
 Becomes courageous even if I know exactly 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.240
 has no chance 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.450
 obviously he does not know that 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:56.890
 and I prefer it here the s8 only 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.480
 let's take it out t25 two now you have 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.140
 a problem does not know if it already 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.140
 have noticed 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:10.359
 so much for the other two 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.549
 busy at tidying up tiger two here 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:14.319
 this is what collar is when son 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.849
 Frankie autoloader comes around the corner 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.799
 you should not do better with the thing 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.060
 understand 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.760
 yes, you see, everyone gets it 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.609
 neat fire actually thought 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.170
 I 'm here in time 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.180
 no chance in the thunderstorm that the 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.609
 both here in captivity no chance 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.599
 to come to it 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:34.870
 next tank he falls into the eye 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:38.980
 is rather in the 103 once short around the bend 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.780
 Drove and that was gone now 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.629
 I have two smaller tanks here 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.849
 Rheinmetall Rheinmetall is doing it to me now 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:46.959
 I do not worry that much 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.349
 on the two here too just once 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.780
 on it because the two can do me so well 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.430
 like nothing and against one 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.319
 I also dare to buy a single rhine metal 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.790
 still in the field 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.730
 when suddenly a tiger is already on 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.579
 blocks all right then so be it 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.989
 we take just in the daily with 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.989
 also for him again 410 damage 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.290
 rhine metal you see already has me 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.340
 but now found exactly the first 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.720
 shot with us already should be 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.579
 Of course not too much on his 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.739
 leave armor but was in the case 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.739
 that's a good chance 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.220
 We would have brothers in it 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.020
 arms won 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.430
 New York has caught the k4 here 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:37.020
 I almost caught the Rheinmetall 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:39.150
 At the same time we are at 3 and 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:43.199
 many are seven and 13 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:45.240
 hmm so that's almost welcome 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:49.139
 contribution makes a decisive contribution 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:53.090
 look inside if he can do it 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.090
 three tanks are still alive 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.550
 In any case , we still have to 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:02.270
 kill two but that looks pretty good 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:08.280
 we are at 11 1 we still need 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:09.840
 ok the a 1 659 I would live yes 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.350
 actually like to wait like in 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.800
 safe with a shot can kill or 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.860
 can destroy 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.240
 there is the shot and with it we would have 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.120
 also the size could be like already in the 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.770
 bag 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.750
 my god is almost as much fun 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:29.520
 to watch how this game also when 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:31.410
 Playing 3564 does not hurt 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.240
 good at the opposing team left 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.570
 you have already seen them here 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.180
 really no chance 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.920
 I can not say anything if that is now 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.450
 the players or whether we just with 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.350
 The tanks here a good choice 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.890
 hit 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:51.840
 In any case what super fun round 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:53.669
 Let's go to the breast games so bad 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.710
 like some rounds at the fivefold event 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:57.500
 also are and as annoying as it is 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.300
 The team simply does not want to play 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:03.110
 for such rounds makes a fivefold 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.110
 Event just fun 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:12.120
 8800 25p 52 1939 credits a crinkle 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:17.010
 contribution decisive contribution to 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:21.419
 German press named Waffenbrüder and 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:24.600
 a top gun the warriors we'll see 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:26.340
 how the team looked like that 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:30.690
 Score here is relatively high 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:34.200
 already seen 1121 basics p3 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:38.390
 medals and see team 13 with 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:44.790
 our gastro 84 at the top bluo 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:47.850
 1091 basics p &amp; s run 84 939 all over 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:51.270
 3000 damage blue fox even over 4000 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:56.220
 damage was really awesome so the round was 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:58.979
 You can not really go crazy 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.720
 say otherwise to against team we need 

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:02.789
 do not say much they are not here 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.620
 more to come right into the game 

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:06.770
 Find 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.820
 I'm not sure what 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.820
 was going on here 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.470
 the opposing team was like I said 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.660
 have the city ​​currently off 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.830
 I did not see it either 

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.060
 really interesting for everyone 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:21.550
 case, that was down 

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:24.199
 the profits could dry 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:27.530
 okay a look at the details 

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:31.850
 portraits even that I have 32,000 plus 

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:35.000
 have done and since damage in 1920 

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:37.130
 with an armor intercepted that 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.050
 have been salt for today I say 

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:41.229
 Thanks for watching and until 

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.229
 soon
