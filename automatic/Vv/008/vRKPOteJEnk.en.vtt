pat<00:00:02.580> 6.1<00:00:03.330> PTR<00:00:03.959> video<00:00:04.290> so<00:00:04.650> today<00:00:04.710> I'm<00:00:05.100> going<00:00:05.310> to

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
pat 6.1 PTR video so today I'm going to

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.710 
pat 6.1 PTR video so today I'm going to
be<00:00:05.460> showing<00:00:05.730> you<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.120> new<00:00:06.240> system<00:00:06.480> that

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
be showing you the new system that

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.150 
be showing you the new system that
they've<00:00:06.960> added<00:00:07.290> with<00:00:07.470> flight<00:00:07.770> points

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
they've added with flight points

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.580 
they've added with flight points
essentially<00:00:09.030> you<00:00:09.269> will<00:00:09.450> be<00:00:09.570> able<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:10.019> request

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
essentially you will be able to request

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.430 
essentially you will be able to request
to<00:00:11.010> get<00:00:11.309> off<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.790> flight<00:00:12.030> point<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.570> what

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
to get off the flight point and what

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.079 
to get off the flight point and what
doing<00:00:13.830> that<00:00:13.980> will<00:00:14.160> do<00:00:14.309> will<00:00:14.460> essentially<00:00:14.849> just

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
doing that will do will essentially just

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.970 
doing that will do will essentially just
drop<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.509> off<00:00:15.660> at<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.020> next<00:00:16.260> point<00:00:16.619> in<00:00:16.859> your

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
drop you off at the next point in your

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.040 
drop you off at the next point in your
flight<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:17.580> if<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:18.210> was<00:00:18.390> here<00:00:18.539> at<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.660> tranquil

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
flight so if I was here at the tranquil

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.320 
flight so if I was here at the tranquil
court<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:20.100> wanted<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.490> fly<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.789> emberia

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
court and I wanted to fly to emberia

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.599 
court and I wanted to fly to emberia
llege<00:00:21.630> but<00:00:22.080> then<00:00:22.199> halfway<00:00:22.500> through<00:00:22.710> decided<00:00:23.519> I

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
llege but then halfway through decided I

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.070 
llege but then halfway through decided I
actually<00:00:23.789> want<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.300> stop<00:00:24.539> at<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.720> path<00:00:24.930> of

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
actually want to stop at the path of

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.540 
actually want to stop at the path of
light<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.470> could<00:00:25.680> do<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.160> don't<00:00:26.369> show<00:00:26.490> you

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
light I could do that I don't show you

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.790 
light I could do that I don't show you
how<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.060> right<00:00:27.300> now<00:00:27.810> we're<00:00:28.109> flying<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.439> embark

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
how so right now we're flying to embark

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.009 
how so right now we're flying to embark
village<00:00:29.220> however<00:00:29.789> imagine<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.779> now

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
village however imagine that I now

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.139 
village however imagine that I now
realize<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.279> terrible<00:00:32.640> mistake<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.090> I

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
realize the the terrible mistake that I

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.340 
realize the the terrible mistake that I
made<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.540> want<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.809> get<00:00:33.899> off<00:00:34.050> at<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.170> path

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
made and I want to get off at the path

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.290 
made and I want to get off at the path
of<00:00:34.380> light<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:35.160> just<00:00:35.250> hit<00:00:35.370> request<00:00:35.760> stop<00:00:36.059> and

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
of light I can just hit request stop and

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.540 
of light I can just hit request stop and
now<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.020> flight<00:00:37.350> point<00:00:37.649> will<00:00:38.100> drop<00:00:38.370> me<00:00:38.399> off

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
now the flight point will drop me off

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.270 
now the flight point will drop me off
over<00:00:38.700> here<00:00:39.360> at<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.170> path<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.500> light<00:00:40.710> this

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
over here at the the path of light this

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.000 
over here at the the path of light this
is<00:00:41.489> very<00:00:41.670> handy<00:00:41.879> because<00:00:42.300> well<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.800> know<00:00:43.829> if

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
is very handy because well you know if

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.410 
is very handy because well you know if
you<00:00:44.070> if<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.340> made<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.520> wrong<00:00:44.730> decision<00:00:45.270> or

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
you if you made the wrong decision or

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.690 
you if you made the wrong decision or
perhaps<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:46.170> want<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.770> actually<00:00:46.920> get<00:00:47.399> off<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
perhaps you want to actually get off the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.799 
perhaps you want to actually get off the
flight<00:00:47.910> point<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.210> head<00:00:48.300> back<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> your

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
flight point and head back to your

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.569 
flight point and head back to your
garrison<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.710> don't<00:00:49.860> want<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.070> be<00:00:50.160> sitting

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
garrison you don't want to be sitting

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.220 
garrison you don't want to be sitting
there<00:00:50.820> for<00:00:51.030> six<00:00:51.239> minutes<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.750> flight<00:00:51.960> point

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
there for six minutes in a flight point

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.540 
there for six minutes in a flight point
that's<00:00:52.440> not<00:00:52.590> really<00:00:52.860> relevant<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.399> you

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
that's not really relevant to you

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.310 
that's not really relevant to you
basically<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:54.539> just<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.780> little<00:00:54.899> bit<00:00:55.110> more

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
basically it's just a little bit more

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.139 
basically it's just a little bit more
choice<00:00:55.649> which<00:00:56.219> i<00:00:56.370> think<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.670> always<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> good

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
choice which i think is always a good

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.209 
choice which i think is always a good
thing<00:00:57.210> now<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.020> course<00:00:58.079> it's<00:00:58.469> not<00:00:58.649> really

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
thing now of course it's not really

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.369 
thing now of course it's not really
perfect<00:00:59.699> on<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.910> flight<00:01:00.120> system<00:01:00.539> still<00:01:00.809> isn't

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
perfect on the flight system still isn't

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.399 
perfect on the flight system still isn't
fantastic<00:01:02.120> though<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.359> lot<00:01:03.539> better<00:01:03.690> what

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
fantastic though it is a lot better what

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.509 
fantastic though it is a lot better what
Blizzard<00:01:04.680> have<00:01:04.769> said<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.100> they're<00:01:05.280> going<00:01:05.430> to

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
Blizzard have said that they're going to

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.910 
Blizzard have said that they're going to
do<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.000> patch<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.299> make<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.560> if

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
do in this patch is make it so that if

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.830 
do in this patch is make it so that if
you<00:01:08.640> are<00:01:08.850> flying<00:01:09.689> from<00:01:10.470> one<00:01:10.830> point<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.250> another

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
you are flying from one point to another

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.030 
you are flying from one point to another
previously<00:01:12.840> would<00:01:12.990> only<00:01:13.170> use<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.830> flight

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
previously would only use the flight

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.740 
previously would only use the flight
points<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.670> have<00:01:14.909> discovered<00:01:15.299> when

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
points that you have discovered when

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.330 
points that you have discovered when
it's<00:01:15.900> doing<00:01:16.140> your<00:01:16.259> route<00:01:16.409> but<00:01:16.950> apparently

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
it's doing your route but apparently

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.770 
it's doing your route but apparently
they<00:01:17.430> said<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.759> they<00:01:17.880> want<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.299> do<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.570> so

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
they said that they want to do it so

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.679 
they said that they want to do it so
that<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:19.320> will<00:01:19.530> just<00:01:19.890> use<00:01:20.040> any<00:01:20.729> flight<00:01:21.420> point

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
that it will just use any flight point

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.390 
that it will just use any flight point
whether<00:01:21.900> you've<00:01:22.110> discovered<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.740> or<00:01:22.860> not<00:01:23.130> I've

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
whether you've discovered it or not I've

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.060 
whether you've discovered it or not I've
got<00:01:23.820> no<00:01:24.060> idea<00:01:24.090> how<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.720> would<00:01:25.080> really<00:01:25.770> tie<00:01:26.040> in

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
got no idea how that would really tie in

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.560 
got no idea how that would really tie in
to<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.340> system<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.000> being<00:01:27.180> able<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.479> get

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
to the system of you being able to get

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.539 
to the system of you being able to get
off<00:01:27.689> mid-flight<00:01:27.960> point<00:01:28.500> but<00:01:28.890> for<00:01:29.130> an<00:01:29.220> example

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
off mid-flight point but for an example

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.700 
off mid-flight point but for an example
and<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.509> know<00:01:30.600> it's<00:01:30.990> still<00:01:31.170> all<00:01:31.320> perfect

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
and you know it's still all perfect

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.990 
and you know it's still all perfect
right<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.189> flying<00:01:32.490> from<00:01:32.759> where<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:32.970> am

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
right so flying from where I am

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.289 
right so flying from where I am
currently<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:34.380> tulare<00:01:34.890> station<00:01:35.430> doesn't<00:01:35.970> make

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
currently to tulare station doesn't make

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.240 
currently to tulare station doesn't make
a<00:01:36.329> great<00:01:36.630> deal<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.869> sense<00:01:37.229> it's<00:01:37.530> not<00:01:37.829> as<00:01:38.040> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
a great deal of sense it's not as the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.160 
a great deal of sense it's not as the
crow<00:01:38.430> flies<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.970> there<00:01:39.390> are<00:01:39.509> faster<00:01:39.780> routes

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
crow flies and there are faster routes

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.569 
crow flies and there are faster routes
with<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.590> flight<00:01:40.799> points<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.310> have

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
with the flight points that I have

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.270 
with the flight points that I have
available<00:01:41.909> at<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.869> minute<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:43.890> think<00:01:44.040> that

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
available at the minute so I think that

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.069 
available at the minute so I think that
this<00:01:44.520> probably<00:01:45.060> isn't<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.329> final<00:01:45.540> version<00:01:45.869> of

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
this probably isn't the final version of

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.749 
this probably isn't the final version of
what<00:01:46.200> will<00:01:46.350> get<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.799> beta<00:01:46.979> maybe<00:01:47.369> this<00:01:47.610> is

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
what will get in the beta maybe this is

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.639 
what will get in the beta maybe this is
just<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.149> or<00:01:48.420> not<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.630> beta<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> PTR

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
just the or not the beta that the PTR

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.609 
just the or not the beta that the PTR
perhaps<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.640> just<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:51.060> first<00:01:51.600> kind<00:01:52.470> of

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
perhaps this is just the first kind of

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.560 
perhaps this is just the first kind of
incrementation<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.149> getting<00:01:54.360> off

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
incrementation of this and getting off

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.450 
incrementation of this and getting off
mid-flight<00:01:54.869> thingy<00:01:55.439> or<00:01:55.740> just<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.219> general

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
mid-flight thingy or just the general

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.190 
mid-flight thingy or just the general
flight<00:01:56.820> point<00:01:57.090> improvements<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.810> hopefully

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
flight point improvements and hopefully

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.260 
flight point improvements and hopefully
more<00:01:58.350> come<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.619> next<00:01:58.890> patch<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.490> think<00:02:00.119> it

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
more come the next patch I think it

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.380 
more come the next patch I think it
should<00:02:00.630> hopefully<00:02:01.040> go<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.070> decent<00:02:02.610> way<00:02:02.729> towards

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
should hopefully go a decent way towards

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.510 
should hopefully go a decent way towards
laying<00:02:04.079> some<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:05.009> maze<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.399> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
laying some of the this maze of the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.490 
laying some of the this maze of the
people<00:02:05.820> who<00:02:05.939> really<00:02:06.360> do<00:02:06.719> just<00:02:07.020> want<00:02:07.140> regular

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
people who really do just want regular

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.219 
people who really do just want regular
flying<00:02:07.770> back<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.220> I'm<00:02:08.970> happy<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.720> regular

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
flying back in I'm happy that regular

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.479 
flying back in I'm happy that regular
flying<00:02:10.440> isn't<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.800> thing<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.099> rain<00:02:11.280> or<00:02:11.400> I

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
flying isn't the thing and rain or I

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.170 
flying isn't the thing and rain or I
think<00:02:11.700> it's<00:02:11.849> very<00:02:12.090> good<00:02:12.239> for<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.599> game<00:02:12.900> does

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
think it's very good for the game does

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.880 
think it's very good for the game does
and<00:02:13.239> many<00:02:13.450> other<00:02:13.599> things<00:02:13.689> but<00:02:14.109> I<00:02:14.379> suppose<00:02:14.769> for

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
and many other things but I suppose for

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.250 
and many other things but I suppose for
that<00:02:15.010> video<00:02:15.189> or<00:02:15.790> for<00:02:16.239> this<00:02:16.359> video<00:02:16.629> its<00:02:16.780> kind<00:02:17.079> of

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
that video or for this video its kind of

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.289 
that video or for this video its kind of
besides<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.859> point<00:02:18.040> anyway<00:02:18.760> so<00:02:18.819> i'll<00:02:18.969> just<00:02:19.030> do

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
besides the point anyway so i'll just do

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.050 
besides the point anyway so i'll just do
this<00:02:19.420> again<00:02:19.840> one<00:02:20.170> more<00:02:20.319> time<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:21.459> for<00:02:22.000> the

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
this again one more time and for the

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.240 
this again one more time and for the
sake<00:02:22.269> of<00:02:22.480> showing<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:23.590> what<00:02:23.769> it's<00:02:24.010> like

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
sake of showing you what it's like

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.229 
sake of showing you what it's like
pretty<00:02:24.760> nifty<00:02:25.000> feature<00:02:26.430> yeah<00:02:27.430> i<00:02:27.459> guess<00:02:28.030> you

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
pretty nifty feature yeah i guess you

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.990 
pretty nifty feature yeah i guess you
know<00:02:28.359> we're<00:02:28.510> not<00:02:28.900> always<00:02:29.730> people<00:02:30.730> who<00:02:30.849> make

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
know we're not always people who make

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.550 
know we're not always people who make
the<00:02:31.209> best<00:02:31.359> decisions<00:02:31.810> all<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.019> time<00:02:32.139> and<00:02:32.500> you

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
the best decisions all the time and you

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.640 
the best decisions all the time and you
might<00:02:32.819> back<00:02:33.819> up<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.480> know<00:02:34.629> and<00:02:34.989> it'll<00:02:35.439> be

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
might back up you know and it'll be

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.470 
might back up you know and it'll be
handy<00:02:36.040> not<00:02:36.549> really<00:02:36.790> much<00:02:36.879> else<00:02:36.939> to<00:02:37.180> say<00:02:37.269> about

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
handy not really much else to say about

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.149 
handy not really much else to say about
that<00:02:37.599> though<00:02:38.230> there<00:02:38.379> is<00:02:38.469> one<00:02:38.650> thing<00:02:38.859> that<00:02:38.920> i

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
that though there is one thing that i

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.520 
that though there is one thing that i
think<00:02:39.310> is<00:02:39.819> worth<00:02:40.120> testing<00:02:40.629> right<00:02:41.019> now<00:02:41.079> in<00:02:41.439> the

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
think is worth testing right now in the

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.309 
think is worth testing right now in the
video<00:02:41.769> so<00:02:42.219> if<00:02:42.489> i<00:02:42.609> go<00:02:42.849> here<00:02:42.879> and<00:02:43.810> let's<00:02:44.019> choose<00:02:44.290> a

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
video so if i go here and let's choose a

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.080 
video so if i go here and let's choose a
flight<00:02:44.650> point<00:02:45.010> where<00:02:45.810> yeah<00:02:46.810> okay<00:02:47.139> here<00:02:48.099> I'm<00:02:48.250> to

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
flight point where yeah okay here I'm to

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.530 
flight point where yeah okay here I'm to
shattrath<00:02:49.359> city<00:02:49.840> I<00:02:50.189> want<00:02:51.189> to<00:02:51.340> see<00:02:51.549> if<00:02:51.790> after

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
shattrath city I want to see if after

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.099 
shattrath city I want to see if after
anchorites<00:02:53.139> EMSA<00:02:53.799> jordam<00:02:54.359> just<00:02:55.359> after<00:02:55.810> I<00:02:55.840> go

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
anchorites EMSA jordam just after I go

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.289 
anchorites EMSA jordam just after I go
past<00:02:56.379> past<00:02:56.769> there<00:02:57.069> will<00:02:57.489> it<00:02:57.639> drop<00:02:57.790> me<00:02:57.969> off<00:02:58.000> at

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
past past there will it drop me off at

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.780 
past past there will it drop me off at
Eric<00:02:58.599> our<00:02:58.780> refuge<00:02:59.290> I'm<00:02:59.680> imagining<00:03:00.159> it<00:03:00.549> won't

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
Eric our refuge I'm imagining it won't

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.940 
Eric our refuge I'm imagining it won't
i'm<00:03:01.209> pretty<00:03:01.480> sure<00:03:01.659> that<00:03:01.689> it's<00:03:01.989> only<00:03:02.319> the<00:03:02.530> next

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
i'm pretty sure that it's only the next

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.220 
i'm pretty sure that it's only the next
stage<00:03:03.340> in<00:03:03.609> the<00:03:03.700> flight<00:03:03.939> path<00:03:03.969> that<00:03:04.870> you<00:03:05.049> have

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
stage in the flight path that you have

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.800 
stage in the flight path that you have
selected<00:03:05.530> are<00:03:06.129> not<00:03:06.400> just<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:07.239> clearest

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
selected are not just the clearest

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.140 
selected are not just the clearest
flight<00:03:08.079> point<00:03:08.379> note<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:09.250> you<00:03:09.430> so<00:03:09.639> we'll<00:03:09.819> have

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
flight point note to you so we'll have

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.199 
flight point note to you so we'll have
to<00:03:10.359> test<00:03:10.719> and<00:03:11.079> see<00:03:11.139> what<00:03:11.409> that's<00:03:11.500> like<00:03:12.150> okay<00:03:13.150> so

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
to test and see what that's like okay so

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.479 
to test and see what that's like okay so
we<00:03:13.569> are<00:03:13.599> coming<00:03:14.139> up<00:03:14.319> to<00:03:14.379> anchorites<00:03:15.040> draw<00:03:15.340> and

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
we are coming up to anchorites draw and

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.250 
we are coming up to anchorites draw and
we'll<00:03:15.579> have<00:03:15.700> to<00:03:15.849> be<00:03:15.939> really<00:03:16.480> really<00:03:16.750> quick<00:03:17.109> in

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
we'll have to be really really quick in

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.039 
we'll have to be really really quick in
the<00:03:17.290> quick<00:03:17.829> in<00:03:17.949> the<00:03:17.979> ball<00:03:18.190> here<00:03:18.459> so<00:03:19.269> nearly

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
the quick in the ball here so nearly

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.750 
the quick in the ball here so nearly
passed<00:03:20.470> it<00:03:20.799> i'll<00:03:21.069> just<00:03:21.280> wait<00:03:21.430> till<00:03:21.639> we're

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
passed it i'll just wait till we're

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.009 
passed it i'll just wait till we're
actually<00:03:21.849> passed<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.359> physical<00:03:22.540> flight

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
actually passed the physical flight

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.750 
actually passed the physical flight
point<00:03:23.290> itself<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.889> maybe<00:03:24.280> just<00:03:24.489> give<00:03:24.609> it<00:03:24.699> a

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
point itself and maybe just give it a

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.759 
point itself and maybe just give it a
little<00:03:24.970> bit<00:03:25.209> of<00:03:25.299> leeway<00:03:25.479> in<00:03:25.750> between<00:03:26.079> all

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
little bit of leeway in between all

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.199 
little bit of leeway in between all
right<00:03:26.949> i<00:03:26.979> think<00:03:27.099> that's<00:03:27.370> enough<00:03:27.549> leeway<00:03:27.760> so<00:03:27.940> if

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
right i think that's enough leeway so if

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.300 
right i think that's enough leeway so if
I<00:03:28.299> hit<00:03:28.449> the<00:03:28.629> request<00:03:29.229> start<00:03:29.739> button<00:03:30.159> I'm

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
I hit the request start button I'm

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.369 
I hit the request start button I'm
assuming<00:03:31.060> it's<00:03:31.180> not<00:03:31.449> going<00:03:31.689> to<00:03:31.840> take<00:03:32.019> me<00:03:32.199> over

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
assuming it's not going to take me over

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.699 
assuming it's not going to take me over
here<00:03:32.739> into<00:03:32.949> Terracor<00:03:33.400> refuge<00:03:33.909> and<00:03:34.439> yeah<00:03:35.439> that

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
here into Terracor refuge and yeah that

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.319 
here into Terracor refuge and yeah that
would<00:03:35.829> be<00:03:35.859> correct<00:03:36.099> so<00:03:36.729> it's<00:03:37.000> essentially

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
would be correct so it's essentially

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.869 
would be correct so it's essentially
just<00:03:37.479> based<00:03:37.840> off<00:03:38.139> the<00:03:38.500> flight<00:03:39.340> points<00:03:39.729> that

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
just based off the flight points that

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:41.819 
just based off the flight points that
you<00:03:39.909> have<00:03:40.150> got<00:03:40.329> set<00:03:40.629> up<00:03:40.659> and<00:03:40.989> that's<00:03:41.620> their

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
you have got set up and that's their

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.369 
you have got set up and that's their
current<00:03:42.189> implementation<00:03:42.909> and<00:03:43.030> I<00:03:43.930> suppose

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
current implementation and I suppose

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.499 
current implementation and I suppose
while<00:03:45.040> it<00:03:45.310> could<00:03:45.579> be<00:03:45.759> handy<00:03:45.970> or<00:03:46.239> if<00:03:46.359> it<00:03:46.479> just

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:46.509 
while it could be handy or if it just

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:47.999 
while it could be handy or if it just
dropped<00:03:46.870> you<00:03:47.019> off<00:03:47.049> at<00:03:47.169> the<00:03:47.349> nearest<00:03:47.590> flight

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:48.009 
dropped you off at the nearest flight

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:50.670 
dropped you off at the nearest flight
point<00:03:48.310> that<00:03:49.030> does<00:03:49.599> sort<00:03:50.199> of<00:03:50.229> cause<00:03:50.439> some

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
point that does sort of cause some

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.469 
point that does sort of cause some
issues<00:03:50.859> with<00:03:51.040> undiscovered<00:03:51.849> flight<00:03:52.090> points

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:52.479 
issues with undiscovered flight points

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:54.420 
issues with undiscovered flight points
so<00:03:52.900> perhaps<00:03:53.079> if<00:03:53.500> they<00:03:53.769> could<00:03:53.919> just<00:03:53.949> do<00:03:54.159> it<00:03:54.280> so

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
so perhaps if they could just do it so

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.129 
so perhaps if they could just do it so
it'll<00:03:54.609> drop<00:03:54.849> you<00:03:54.909> off<00:03:55.239> automatically<00:03:55.930> at<00:03:56.109> the

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
it'll drop you off automatically at the

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:57.899 
it'll drop you off automatically at the
nearest<00:03:56.409> discovered<00:03:57.009> flight<00:03:57.250> point<00:03:57.519> rather

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
nearest discovered flight point rather

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.819 
nearest discovered flight point rather
than<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.269> next<00:03:58.569> one<00:03:58.750> in<00:03:58.870> your<00:03:58.989> wrote<00:03:59.259> that

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
than the next one in your wrote that

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.460 
than the next one in your wrote that
would<00:04:00.040> make<00:04:00.220> sense<00:04:00.250> however<00:04:01.060> that<00:04:01.329> is<00:04:01.569> easier

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
would make sense however that is easier

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.039 
would make sense however that is easier
said<00:04:02.530> than<00:04:02.889> done<00:04:03.129> currently<00:04:04.060> Blizzard<00:04:04.509> seem

to<00:04:05.229> hand<00:04:05.500> path<00:04:05.919> all<00:04:06.250> of<00:04:06.819> the<00:04:06.939> flight<00:04:07.150> points

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
to hand path all of the flight points

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.689 
to hand path all of the flight points
right<00:04:07.720> so<00:04:07.959> if<00:04:08.109> you<00:04:08.199> look<00:04:08.349> here<00:04:08.620> every<00:04:09.430> single

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:09.699 
right so if you look here every single

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:11.819 
right so if you look here every single
connection<00:04:10.239> between<00:04:10.629> every<00:04:11.319> node<00:04:11.530> is

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
connection between every node is

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.069 
connection between every node is
basically<00:04:12.759> put<00:04:12.939> in<00:04:13.090> by<00:04:13.269> a<00:04:13.299> person<00:04:13.750> it's<00:04:13.840> not

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
basically put in by a person it's not

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:15.929 
basically put in by a person it's not
like<00:04:14.229> it's<00:04:14.409> dynamically<00:04:15.040> generated<00:04:15.819> and

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:15.939 
like it's dynamically generated and

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:17.399 
like it's dynamically generated and
there's<00:04:16.090> no<00:04:16.180> like<00:04:16.359> path<00:04:16.630> finding<00:04:17.109> algorithm

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:17.409 
there's no like path finding algorithm

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:19.469 
there's no like path finding algorithm
or<00:04:17.709> something<00:04:18.039> that<00:04:18.190> it<00:04:18.579> works<00:04:18.849> that<00:04:19.120> stuff

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
or something that it works that stuff

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.060 
or something that it works that stuff
out<00:04:20.130> perhaps<00:04:21.130> if

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
out perhaps if

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.520 
out perhaps if
you<00:04:22.880> know<00:04:23.000> right<00:04:23.750> there<00:04:23.960> was<00:04:24.110> some<00:04:24.290> sort<00:04:24.410> of

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
you know right there was some sort of

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.140 
you know right there was some sort of
algorithm<00:04:24.770> that<00:04:25.010> would<00:04:25.160> they<00:04:25.340> you<00:04:25.880> know<00:04:25.970> could

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
algorithm that would they you know could

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.570 
algorithm that would they you know could
do<00:04:26.300> that<00:04:26.450> and<00:04:26.630> automatically<00:04:27.280> path<00:04:28.280> things

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
do that and automatically path things

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.850 
do that and automatically path things
that<00:04:28.730> would<00:04:28.880> make<00:04:28.910> a<00:04:29.090> little<00:04:29.360> bit<00:04:29.450> of<00:04:29.510> sense

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
that would make a little bit of sense

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.110 
that would make a little bit of sense
now<00:04:30.860> actually<00:04:31.100> one<00:04:31.250> thing<00:04:31.400> that<00:04:31.580> I<00:04:31.610> just

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
now actually one thing that I just

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.810 
now actually one thing that I just
noticed<00:04:32.540> here<00:04:32.690> that<00:04:32.720> I<00:04:32.840> didn't<00:04:33.230> realize<00:04:33.620> is<00:04:33.890> I

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
noticed here that I didn't realize is I

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.510 
noticed here that I didn't realize is I
don't<00:04:35.300> have<00:04:36.050> like<00:04:36.710> on<00:04:36.830> this<00:04:36.950> character<00:04:37.250> the

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
don't have like on this character the

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.610 
don't have like on this character the
the<00:04:37.850> Iron<00:04:38.090> siege<00:04:38.450> works<00:04:38.690> flight<00:04:39.020> point<00:04:39.290> isn't

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
the Iron siege works flight point isn't

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.470 
the Iron siege works flight point isn't
there<00:04:39.890> however<00:04:40.610> i'm<00:04:40.880> currently<00:04:41.150> here<00:04:41.390> at

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
there however i'm currently here at

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.450 
there however i'm currently here at
shattrath<00:04:41.690> city<00:04:42.110> and<00:04:42.350> if<00:04:43.010> i<00:04:43.070> want<00:04:43.280> to<00:04:43.310> go<00:04:43.430> to

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
shattrath city and if i want to go to

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.730 
shattrath city and if i want to go to
sky<00:04:43.730> see<00:04:43.940> point<00:04:44.210> it<00:04:44.690> could<00:04:44.990> either<00:04:45.140> path<00:04:45.500> me

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
sky see point it could either path me

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.890 
sky see point it could either path me
all<00:04:46.010> the<00:04:46.790> way<00:04:46.910> over<00:04:47.150> here<00:04:47.180> which<00:04:47.600> is<00:04:47.750> what

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
all the way over here which is what

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.020 
all the way over here which is what
would<00:04:48.140> you<00:04:48.560> know<00:04:48.710> currently<00:04:49.460> do<00:04:49.610> in<00:04:49.760> the<00:04:49.850> game

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
would you know currently do in the game

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.840

iron<00:04:52.970> siege<00:04:53.300> works<00:04:53.570> this<00:04:54.140> actually<00:04:54.380> lets<00:04:54.770> us

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
iron siege works this actually lets us

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.860 
iron siege works this actually lets us
test<00:04:55.340> if<00:04:55.550> we<00:04:55.640> can<00:04:55.820> get<00:04:55.970> off<00:04:56.150> at<00:04:56.330> the<00:04:56.390> Iron<00:04:56.630> siege

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
test if we can get off at the Iron siege

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.830 
test if we can get off at the Iron siege
works<00:04:57.140> even<00:04:57.500> though<00:04:57.650> it's<00:04:57.860> not<00:04:58.130> being<00:04:58.520> a

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
works even though it's not being a

works even though it's not being a
discovered<00:04:59.840> flight<00:05:00.110> punch<00:05:00.350> I<00:05:00.500> think's<00:05:00.710> pretty

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
discovered flight punch I think's pretty

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.130 
discovered flight punch I think's pretty
interesting<00:05:01.520> so<00:05:01.970> I'm<00:05:02.420> just<00:05:02.660> going<00:05:02.810> to<00:05:02.870> cut<00:05:03.110> a

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
interesting so I'm just going to cut a

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.200 
interesting so I'm just going to cut a
head<00:05:03.350> to<00:05:03.710> I<00:05:03.740> am<00:05:04.220> until<00:05:04.580> when<00:05:04.730> I<00:05:04.760> get<00:05:05.060> a<00:05:05.090> little

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
head to I am until when I get a little

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.560 
head to I am until when I get a little
bit<00:05:05.390> closer<00:05:06.940> alright<00:05:07.940> then<00:05:08.090> so<00:05:08.360> we<00:05:08.480> are

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
bit closer alright then so we are

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.300 
bit closer alright then so we are
entering<00:05:08.930> frostfire<00:05:09.290> rage<00:05:09.620> I'm<00:05:09.890> just<00:05:10.160> going

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
entering frostfire rage I'm just going

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.000 
entering frostfire rage I'm just going
to<00:05:10.370> click<00:05:10.790> request<00:05:11.150> stop<00:05:11.840> now<00:05:12.110> and<00:05:12.140> we'll<00:05:12.620> see

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
to click request stop now and we'll see

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.220 
to click request stop now and we'll see
if<00:05:13.130> anything<00:05:13.550> happens<00:05:14.060> I'd<00:05:14.690> actually<00:05:14.930> just

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
if anything happens I'd actually just

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.540 
if anything happens I'd actually just
noticed<00:05:15.530> normally<00:05:15.890> when<00:05:15.980> I<00:05:16.010> click<00:05:16.280> request

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
noticed normally when I click request

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.910 
noticed normally when I click request
stop<00:05:16.910> the<00:05:17.210> sort<00:05:17.660> of<00:05:17.750> character<00:05:18.320> model<00:05:18.800> and

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
stop the sort of character model and

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.410 
stop the sort of character model and
stuff<00:05:19.100> jitters<00:05:19.520> a<00:05:19.580> little<00:05:19.790> bit<00:05:19.910> it<00:05:20.090> didn't

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.420 
stuff jitters a little bit it didn't

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.810 
stuff jitters a little bit it didn't
jitter<00:05:20.660> this<00:05:20.930> time<00:05:21.200> which<00:05:21.830> perhaps<00:05:22.100> suggest

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
jitter this time which perhaps suggest

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.450 
jitter this time which perhaps suggest
that<00:05:22.970> it's<00:05:23.120> not<00:05:23.330> going<00:05:23.660> to<00:05:23.810> drop<00:05:23.960> us<00:05:24.140> off<00:05:24.290> here

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
that it's not going to drop us off here

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.920 
that it's not going to drop us off here
frankly<00:05:25.460> I<00:05:25.490> don't<00:05:25.670> think<00:05:26.060> it<00:05:26.150> should<00:05:26.180> drop<00:05:26.750> us

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
frankly I don't think it should drop us

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.210 
frankly I don't think it should drop us
off<00:05:27.050> with<00:05:27.170> the<00:05:27.290> iron<00:05:27.410> siege<00:05:27.680> works<00:05:27.920> because

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
off with the iron siege works because

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.040 
off with the iron siege works because
obviously<00:05:28.370> it's<00:05:28.880> not<00:05:29.030> discovered<00:05:29.810> flight

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
obviously it's not discovered flight

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.680 
obviously it's not discovered flight
point<00:05:30.350> and<00:05:31.280> it<00:05:31.430> would<00:05:31.520> only<00:05:31.580> make<00:05:31.730> sense<00:05:31.880> in<00:05:32.420> my

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
point and it would only make sense in my

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:33.910 
point and it would only make sense in my
opinion<00:05:32.990> if<00:05:33.170> it<00:05:33.230> drops<00:05:33.380> you<00:05:33.590> off<00:05:33.650> at<00:05:33.890> the

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920 
opinion if it drops you off at the

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.380 
opinion if it drops you off at the
discovered<00:05:34.370> flight<00:05:34.580> points<00:05:34.880> and<00:05:35.030> that<00:05:35.180> does

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
discovered flight points and that does

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.210 
discovered flight points and that does
appear<00:05:35.720> to<00:05:35.750> be<00:05:35.840> how<00:05:36.020> it's<00:05:36.200> being<00:05:36.380> done<00:05:36.500> so

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
appear to be how it's being done so

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.980 
appear to be how it's being done so
essentially<00:05:37.640> this<00:05:37.850> new<00:05:38.090> flight<00:05:38.300> point<00:05:38.570> system

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
essentially this new flight point system

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.560 
essentially this new flight point system
will<00:05:39.140> in<00:05:39.410> times<00:05:39.950> as<00:05:40.250> we<00:05:40.460> can<00:05:40.610> see<00:05:40.790> here<00:05:40.820> path

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
will in times as we can see here path

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.540 
will in times as we can see here path
you<00:05:41.870> through<00:05:42.470> a<00:05:42.680> note<00:05:43.160> you<00:05:43.370> haven't

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
you through a note you haven't

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.070 
you through a note you haven't
discovered<00:05:43.970> for<00:05:44.240> the<00:05:44.330> sake<00:05:44.510> of<00:05:44.540> getting<00:05:44.810> a

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
discovered for the sake of getting a

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.650 
discovered for the sake of getting a
more<00:05:45.320> direct<00:05:45.500> route<00:05:45.950> however<00:05:46.670> you<00:05:47.210> can<00:05:47.240> only

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
more direct route however you can only

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.060 
more direct route however you can only
use<00:05:48.110> the<00:05:48.410> request<00:05:49.040> stop<00:05:49.520> feature<00:05:50.000> to<00:05:50.990> get<00:05:51.860> off

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
use the request stop feature to get off

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.150 
use the request stop feature to get off
at<00:05:52.400> the<00:05:52.430> next<00:05:52.580> flight<00:05:53.300> point<00:05:53.690> in<00:05:53.930> your<00:05:54.830> path

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
at the next flight point in your path

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.760 
at the next flight point in your path
that<00:05:55.790> you<00:05:55.910> have<00:05:56.090> discovered<00:05:56.720> so<00:05:57.230> something

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
that you have discovered so something

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.040 
that you have discovered so something
like<00:05:57.800> the<00:05:58.310> RNC<00:05:58.670> jerks<00:05:58.940> back<00:05:59.150> there<00:05:59.390> wouldn't

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
like the RNC jerks back there wouldn't

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.540 
like the RNC jerks back there wouldn't
count<00:06:00.290> because<00:06:00.590> while<00:06:00.740> it<00:06:00.890> is<00:06:01.010> a<00:06:01.040> part<00:06:01.370> of<00:06:01.430> the

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
count because while it is a part of the

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.420 
count because while it is a part of the
path<00:06:01.730> it<00:06:01.940> hasn't<00:06:02.630> been<00:06:02.750> discovered<00:06:03.290> and<00:06:03.470> yeah

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
path it hasn't been discovered and yeah

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.530 
path it hasn't been discovered and yeah
that's<00:06:04.610> really<00:06:04.970> it<00:06:05.030> for<00:06:05.120> this<00:06:05.240> video<00:06:05.390> I

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:05.540 
that's really it for this video I

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.360 
that's really it for this video I
suppose<00:06:05.900> all<00:06:06.140> the<00:06:06.260> job's<00:06:06.470> done<00:06:06.590> I<00:06:06.920> think

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
suppose all the job's done I think

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.210 
suppose all the job's done I think
that's<00:06:07.550> a<00:06:07.790> very<00:06:07.970> solid<00:06:08.570> improvement<00:06:08.810> to<00:06:09.800> the

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
that's a very solid improvement to the

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.330 
that's a very solid improvement to the
you<00:06:11.120> know<00:06:11.180> the<00:06:11.330> overall<00:06:11.750> flight<00:06:12.410> point<00:06:12.800> system

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
you know the overall flight point system

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.710 
you know the overall flight point system
however<00:06:13.880> there<00:06:14.120> are<00:06:14.240> definitely<00:06:14.570> a<00:06:14.660> few

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
however there are definitely a few

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.630 
however there are definitely a few
scenarios<00:06:15.230> where<00:06:15.650> I<00:06:15.680> think<00:06:15.950> they<00:06:16.100> should<00:06:16.340> just

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:16.640 
scenarios where I think they should just

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.720 
scenarios where I think they should just
work<00:06:16.940> out<00:06:17.150> the<00:06:17.270> pathing<00:06:17.630> a<00:06:17.690> little<00:06:17.930> bit<00:06:18.080> better

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.730 
work out the pathing a little bit better

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.100 
work out the pathing a little bit better
perhaps<00:06:19.730> the<00:06:20.090> way<00:06:20.180> they<00:06:20.390> work<00:06:20.600> it<00:06:20.780> out<00:06:20.900> is

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
perhaps the way they work it out is

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.830 
perhaps the way they work it out is
based<00:06:21.320> on<00:06:21.470> flight<00:06:21.740> time<00:06:22.010> so<00:06:22.340> maybe<00:06:22.840> well

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 
based on flight time so maybe well

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.300 
based on flight time so maybe well
actually<00:06:24.050> no<00:06:24.290> I<00:06:24.320> mean<00:06:24.680> just<00:06:24.830> looking<00:06:25.010> at<00:06:25.160> what

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
actually no I mean just looking at what

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.210 
actually no I mean just looking at what
we've<00:06:25.460> got<00:06:25.640> right<00:06:25.670> here<00:06:25.940> this<00:06:26.270> makes<00:06:26.540> no<00:06:26.780> sense

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
we've got right here this makes no sense

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.870 
we've got right here this makes no sense
surely<00:06:28.220> it<00:06:28.370> should<00:06:28.400> go<00:06:29.080> from<00:06:30.080> lunar<00:06:31.070> fall<00:06:31.310> to

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
surely it should go from lunar fall to

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.000 
surely it should go from lunar fall to
emberia<00:06:32.300> llege<00:06:32.660> to<00:06:33.140> the<00:06:33.260> path<00:06:33.440> of<00:06:33.590> light<00:06:33.800> and

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.010 
emberia llege to the path of light and

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.180 
emberia llege to the path of light and
shouldn't<00:06:34.430> path<00:06:34.640> down<00:06:34.880> to<00:06:35.030> the

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
shouldn't path down to the

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.100 
shouldn't path down to the
I<00:06:35.220> like<00:06:35.490> late<00:06:35.760> that<00:06:36.300> just<00:06:36.600> doesn't<00:06:36.720> make<00:06:36.930> much

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
I like late that just doesn't make much

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.680 
I like late that just doesn't make much
sense<00:06:37.170> so<00:06:37.820> there<00:06:38.820> are<00:06:38.940> some<00:06:39.180> things<00:06:39.360> here<00:06:39.660> that

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:39.690 
sense so there are some things here that

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.660 
sense so there are some things here that
need<00:06:39.990> to<00:06:40.080> be<00:06:40.140> fixed<00:06:40.410> up<00:06:40.710> it's<00:06:40.950> not<00:06:41.130> perfect<00:06:41.610> but

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:41.670 
need to be fixed up it's not perfect but

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.610 
need to be fixed up it's not perfect but
certainly<00:06:42.120> improvement<00:06:42.690> anyway<00:06:43.230> that's<00:06:43.440> it

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
certainly improvement anyway that's it

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.230 
certainly improvement anyway that's it
for<00:06:43.680> this<00:06:43.890> early<00:06:44.190> stuff<00:06:44.430> of<00:06:44.610> course<00:06:44.790> it's<00:06:45.120> the

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
for this early stuff of course it's the

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.180 
for this early stuff of course it's the
PTR<00:06:45.810> this<00:06:46.170> could<00:06:46.380> be<00:06:46.500> improved<00:06:46.710> it<00:06:46.980> could<00:06:47.100> be

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190 
PTR this could be improved it could be

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.560 
PTR this could be improved it could be
made<00:06:47.370> better<00:06:47.520> it's<00:06:47.790> hard<00:06:48.000> to<00:06:48.090> know<00:06:48.180> right<00:06:48.390> now

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:48.570 
made better it's hard to know right now

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.240 
made better it's hard to know right now
but<00:06:49.080> for<00:06:49.110> now<00:06:49.560> thank<00:06:49.890> you<00:06:49.950> very<00:06:50.010> much<00:06:50.220> for

but for now thank you very much for

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.930 
but for now thank you very much for
