product<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.619> little<00:01:47.070> bit<00:01:47.189> difficult<00:01:47.399> to

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
product is a little bit difficult to

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.940 
product is a little bit difficult to
work<00:01:48.090> with<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.960> guess<00:01:49.229> there's<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.649> good

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
work with and I guess there's a good

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.679 
work with and I guess there's a good
reason<00:01:50.189> behind<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.149> want<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.450> bring<00:01:51.600> in

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
reason behind that so I want to bring in

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.300 
reason behind that so I want to bring in
the<00:01:51.780> pink<00:01:52.079> one<00:01:52.140> which<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.560> didn't<00:01:52.890> install<00:01:53.130> and

the pink one which I didn't install and

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.580 
the pink one which I didn't install and
show<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.490> why<00:01:53.759> these<00:01:54.450> skins<00:01:54.840> are<00:01:55.200> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
show you why these skins are the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.590 
show you why these skins are the
thinnest<00:01:55.979> skins<00:01:56.250> i've<00:01:56.460> ever<00:01:56.670> seen<00:01:57.030> for<00:01:57.060> any

thinnest skins i've ever seen for any
mobile<00:01:58.110> device<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.829> because<00:01:59.640> they're<00:01:59.850> so

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
mobile device and because they're so

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.090 
mobile device and because they're so
thin<00:02:00.360> i<00:02:00.600> guess<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.110> know<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.500> can<00:02:01.680> use<00:02:01.860> them

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
thin i guess you know you can use them

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.249 
thin i guess you know you can use them
with<00:02:02.250> cases<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.270> if<00:02:03.600> you're<00:02:03.780> looking<00:02:03.899> for<00:02:04.079> a

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.620 
with cases so if you're looking for a
skin<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.829> will<00:02:05.369> allow<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.969> use<00:02:06.360> your

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
skin that will allow you to use your

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.660 
skin that will allow you to use your
device<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.290> case<00:02:07.590> usually<00:02:08.399> they're<00:02:08.550> too

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
device in a case usually they're too

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.630 
device in a case usually they're too
thick<00:02:09.030> they<00:02:09.209> won't<00:02:09.390> fit<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:10.080> one<00:02:10.349> will<00:02:11.009> like

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
thick they won't fit this one will like

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.850 
thick they won't fit this one will like
provide<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.780> ability<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.319> use<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.650> in

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
provide the ability to use it in

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.260 
provide the ability to use it in
case<00:02:14.040> because<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.430> can<00:02:14.580> hopefully<00:02:14.760> make<00:02:15.120> out

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
case because you can hopefully make out

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.660 
case because you can hopefully make out
just<00:02:15.870> how<00:02:16.050> thin<00:02:16.440> they<00:02:16.650> are<00:02:16.860> but<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.310> cause<00:02:17.490> are

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
just how thin they are but the cause are

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.700 
just how thin they are but the cause are
so<00:02:17.880> flexible<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.990> makes<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.440> little<00:02:19.530> bit

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
so flexible it makes it a little bit

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.040 
so flexible it makes it a little bit
more<00:02:19.890> challenging<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.490> install<00:02:21.050> especially

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
more challenging to install especially

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.010 
more challenging to install especially
on<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.590> iPad<00:02:23.100> much<00:02:23.790> harder<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.690> other<00:02:24.840> issue

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
on the iPad much harder the other issue

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.690 
on the iPad much harder the other issue
is<00:02:25.230> they're<00:02:25.560> not<00:02:25.710> really<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:25.950> removable<00:02:26.520> there

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700

them on and again when i say not
removable<00:02:30.390> i<00:02:30.660> mean<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.900> can't<00:02:31.110> pick<00:02:31.320> them<00:02:31.470> up

it and hopefully you can see in the
upper<00:02:39.450> corner<00:02:40.110> up<00:02:40.230> there<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.470> kind<00:02:40.709> of<00:02:40.860> murdered

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
upper corner up there I kind of murdered

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.920 
upper corner up there I kind of murdered
it<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.340> little<00:02:41.490> bit<00:02:41.730> because<00:02:42.120> pulling<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.780> off

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
it a little bit because pulling it off

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.320 
it a little bit because pulling it off
just<00:02:43.680> damages<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.520> it's<00:02:44.700> really<00:02:44.880> not<00:02:45.000> meant<00:02:45.270> to

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
just damages it it's really not meant to

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.060 
just damages it it's really not meant to
come<00:02:45.480> off<00:02:45.630> so<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:46.290> have<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.560> take<00:02:46.740> your<00:02:46.890> time

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070

come off so you have to take your time
when<00:02:47.130> you<00:02:47.400> go<00:02:47.520> to<00:02:47.580> put<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.820> on<00:02:48.000> so<00:02:48.240> good<00:02:48.900> thing

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
when you go to put it on so good thing

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.660 
when you go to put it on so good thing
in<00:02:49.350> that<00:02:49.380> they're<00:02:49.680> thin<00:02:49.950> because<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:50.400> can<00:02:50.550> use

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
in that they're thin because you can use

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.310 
in that they're thin because you can use
them<00:02:50.820> with<00:02:50.940> cases<00:02:51.360> but<00:02:51.600> bad<00:02:51.870> thing<00:02:52.110> in<00:02:52.290> that

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
them with cases but bad thing in that

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.140 
them with cases but bad thing in that
number<00:02:52.920> one<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.280> makes<00:02:53.400> them<00:02:53.640> very<00:02:53.790> hard<00:02:54.060> to

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
number one it makes them very hard to

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.810 
number one it makes them very hard to
install<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.810> makes<00:02:55.470> them<00:02:55.650> kind<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.520> one

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
install and makes them kind of a one

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.660 
install and makes them kind of a one
time<00:02:57.060> usage<00:02:57.630> type<00:02:58.020> deal<00:02:58.320> so<00:02:58.650> there's<00:02:59.489> the

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
time usage type deal so there's the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.220 
time usage type deal so there's the
