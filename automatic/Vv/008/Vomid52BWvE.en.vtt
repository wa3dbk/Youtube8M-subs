housing<00:01:20.900> of<00:01:21.080> the<00:01:21.110> spotter<00:01:21.500> there's<00:01:22.460> another

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
housing of the spotter there's another

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.740 
housing of the spotter there's another
box<00:01:23.119> inside<00:01:23.740> and<00:01:24.740> let's<00:01:25.729> open<00:01:25.850> this<00:01:26.119> up<00:01:26.299> see

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
box inside and let's open this up see

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.310 
box inside and let's open this up see
what's<00:01:26.960> in<00:01:27.110> here

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
what's in here

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.770 
what's in here
oh<00:01:30.460> so<00:01:31.460> it<00:01:31.520> looks<00:01:31.670> like<00:01:31.820> it<00:01:31.970> has<00:01:32.119> an<00:01:32.360> AC<00:01:32.509> adapter

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
oh so it looks like it has an AC adapter

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.010 
oh so it looks like it has an AC adapter
so<00:01:33.500> spotter<00:01:34.070> can<00:01:34.340> be<00:01:35.210> plugged<00:01:35.420> directly<00:01:35.630> into

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
so spotter can be plugged directly into

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.289 
so spotter can be plugged directly into
the<00:01:36.470> wall<00:01:36.770> if<00:01:37.460> you're<00:01:37.549> not<00:01:37.700> planning<00:01:38.060> to<00:01:38.090> use

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
the wall if you're not planning to use

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.819 
the wall if you're not planning to use
the<00:01:38.780> batteries<00:01:40.659> comes<00:01:41.659> with<00:01:41.869> some<00:01:42.110> simple

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
the batteries comes with some simple

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.640 
the batteries comes with some simple
mounting<00:01:43.310> mechanism<00:01:44.030> velcro<00:01:44.840> and<00:01:45.110> screws

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
mounting mechanism velcro and screws

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.670 
mounting mechanism velcro and screws
okay<00:01:46.070> this<00:01:46.520> is<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.850> spotter<00:01:47.380> hmm<00:01:48.380> there's<00:01:48.619> a

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
okay this is the spotter hmm there's a

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.170 
okay this is the spotter hmm there's a
pole<00:01:48.860> time<00:01:49.040> I<00:01:49.130> think<00:01:49.340> that's<00:01:49.490> for<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.820> battery

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
pole time I think that's for the battery

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.460 
pole time I think that's for the battery
probably<00:01:50.509> so<00:01:50.600> let's<00:01:50.780> open<00:01:50.899> up<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.259> see<00:01:51.409> if

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
probably so let's open up the see if

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.170 
probably so let's open up the see if
there<00:01:51.649> the<00:01:52.520> you<00:01:52.640> know<00:01:52.820> she<00:01:52.880> comes

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
there the you know she comes

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.050 
there the you know she comes
pre-installed<00:01:53.960> with<00:01:54.530> batteries<00:01:55.009> and<00:01:55.909> there

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
pre-installed with batteries and there

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.249 
pre-installed with batteries and there
it<00:01:56.149> is<00:01:56.210> it<00:01:56.630> actually<00:01:56.810> does<00:01:57.110> come

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
it is it actually does come

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.069 
it is it actually does come
pre-installed<00:01:57.590> with<00:01:58.070> batteries<00:01:58.479> so<00:01:59.479> in

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
pre-installed with batteries so in

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.289 
pre-installed with batteries so in
double-a<00:02:00.740> switch<00:02:01.189> is<00:02:01.340> good<00:02:01.520> much<00:02:01.820> easier<00:02:02.210> to

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
double-a switch is good much easier to

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.249 
double-a switch is good much easier to
find<00:02:02.570> in<00:02:02.869> Tripoli<00:02:03.320> we'll<00:02:04.040> take<00:02:04.219> this<00:02:04.369> off<00:02:05.259> okay

until you hear so okay we're ready let
it<00:03:08.560> count<00:03:08.710> down<00:03:09.010> so<00:03:09.340> it's<00:03:09.460> counting<00:03:09.760> down

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
it count down so it's counting down

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.360 
it count down so it's counting down
let's<00:03:10.060> put<00:03:10.240> it<00:03:10.330> on<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.920> it<00:03:12.040> gets<00:03:12.190> it's

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
let's put it on and it gets it's

of a flashing and it's flashing the
sensor<00:03:17.910> and<00:03:18.910> and<00:03:19.210> giving<00:03:19.600> I<00:03:19.810> guess<00:03:19.960> my<00:03:20.170> Wi-Fi

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
sensor and and giving I guess my Wi-Fi

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:36.100 
sensor and and giving I guess my Wi-Fi
data<00:03:20.890> to<00:03:21.220> it

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.590
