really sort of glowy skin this is a very

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:16.690 
really sort of glowy skin this is a very
I<00:01:15.289> think<00:01:15.709> it's<00:01:15.830> very<00:01:15.920> natural<00:01:16.190> but<00:01:16.550> it's

I think it's very natural but it's

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.699 
I think it's very natural but it's
really<00:01:17.060> pretty<00:01:17.270> cuz<00:01:17.690> her<00:01:17.869> her<00:01:18.140> dress<00:01:18.380> was<00:01:18.560> so

00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:18.709 
really pretty cuz her her dress was so

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:20.499 
really pretty cuz her her dress was so
elaborate<00:01:19.069> I<00:01:19.399> mean<00:01:19.550> she<00:01:19.670> looked<00:01:19.880> gorgeous<00:01:20.090> but

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
elaborate I mean she looked gorgeous but

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.690 
elaborate I mean she looked gorgeous but
her<00:01:20.660> dress<00:01:20.869> was<00:01:21.050> quite<00:01:21.259> you<00:01:21.890> know<00:01:21.920> ornate<00:01:22.399> so<00:01:22.670> I

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
her dress was quite you know ornate so I

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.940 
her dress was quite you know ornate so I
think<00:01:22.819> that<00:01:23.209> they<00:01:24.110> kind<00:01:24.319> of<00:01:24.349> toned<00:01:24.649> down<00:01:24.800> the

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
think that they kind of toned down the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.130 
think that they kind of toned down the
makeup<00:01:25.369> so<00:01:25.729> that<00:01:25.880> it<00:01:25.970> wasn't<00:01:26.179> gonna<00:01:26.479> be<00:01:26.660> too

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
makeup so that it wasn't gonna be too

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.440 
makeup so that it wasn't gonna be too
much<00:01:27.470> so<00:01:28.369> I<00:01:28.429> hope<00:01:28.550> you<00:01:28.670> enjoy<00:01:28.849> watching<00:01:29.060> this

wonderstruck luster glass so that's
pretty<00:07:14.070> much<00:07:14.250> it<00:07:14.460> for<00:07:14.610> the<00:07:14.729> look<00:07:14.910> as<00:07:15.150> you<00:07:15.300> can

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:21.419 
think that because her dress was so

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:24.469 
think that because her dress was so
elaborate<00:07:22.050> and<00:07:22.200> so<00:07:22.470> ornate<00:07:22.950> that<00:07:23.370> her<00:07:24.120> makeup

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 
elaborate and so ornate that her makeup

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:25.940 
elaborate and so ornate that her makeup
artist<00:07:24.750> Society<00:07:25.050> sort<00:07:25.260> of<00:07:25.320> tone<00:07:25.530> down<00:07:25.770> her
