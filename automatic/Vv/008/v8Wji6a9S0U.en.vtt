00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
trailer I don't think so and there's

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.360

additional<00:04:34.880> that<00:04:35.600> additional<00:04:36.140> line<00:04:36.770> that<00:04:37.160> she

speaks sort of near the beginning which

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.960 
speaks sort of near the beginning which
I<00:04:40.430> don't<00:04:40.490> think<00:04:41.000> appears<00:04:41.660> or<00:04:41.960> we<00:04:42.260> hear<00:04:42.680> in<00:04:42.970> the
