familiar<00:00:23.580> with<00:00:23.880> Louise's<00:00:24.449> spinning<00:00:25.109> reels

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
familiar with Louise's spinning reels

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.529 
familiar with Louise's spinning reels
because<00:00:26.430> it's<00:00:26.580> what<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.760> have<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.060> my<00:00:27.180> other<00:00:27.300> rod

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
because it's what I have on my other rod

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.450 
because it's what I have on my other rod
so<00:00:27.720> I'm<00:00:27.810> pretty<00:00:27.960> happy<00:00:28.080> with<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:28.949> I'm

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
so I'm pretty happy with it so I'm

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.060 
so I'm pretty happy with it so I'm
hoping<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.330> loos<00:00:30.510> baitcasting<00:00:31.260> reel<00:00:31.859> is

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
hoping that the loos baitcasting reel is

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.010 
hoping that the loos baitcasting reel is
going<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.309> be<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.640> as<00:00:32.790> good<00:00:32.940> for<00:00:33.000> me<00:00:33.300> now<00:00:33.870> this

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
going to be just as good for me now this

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.560 
going to be just as good for me now this
particular<00:00:34.170> one<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.070> speed<00:00:35.399> spool<00:00:35.790> LFS

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
particular one is the speed spool LFS

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.889 
particular one is the speed spool LFS
and<00:00:36.870> it's<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.170> SSG<00:00:37.649> one<00:00:38.399> SH<00:00:38.940> bit<00:00:39.210> caster<00:00:39.600> model

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
and it's the SSG one SH bit caster model

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.340 
and it's the SSG one SH bit caster model
and<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.100> high<00:00:41.340> speed<00:00:41.670> 7<00:00:42.270> v<00:00:42.510> 1<00:00:42.899> gear

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
and it is the high speed 7 v 1 gear

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.500 
and it is the high speed 7 v 1 gear
ratio<00:00:43.379> version<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.640> let's<00:00:44.789> go<00:00:44.969> ahead<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.390> get

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
ratio version so let's go ahead and get

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.020 
ratio version so let's go ahead and get
it<00:00:45.600> out<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.840> box<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.410> look<00:00:46.620> at<00:00:46.770> it

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.389 

so<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.510> real<00:00:51.809> here<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:52.920> all<00:00:53.160> metal

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
so this is the real here it's all metal

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.010 
so this is the real here it's all metal
construction<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.329> think<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.629> lot<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.809> them

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
construction and I think a lot of them

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.930 
construction and I think a lot of them
really<00:00:55.140> are<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.710> what<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:56.460> here<00:00:56.730> is

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
really are and what you have here is

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.560 
really are and what you have here is
this<00:00:57.210> has<00:00:57.449> got<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.690> nice<00:00:58.020> sort<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.039> matte

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
this has got a nice sort of a matte

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.569 
this has got a nice sort of a matte
gunmetal<00:01:00.570> gray<00:01:00.960> finish<00:01:01.440> here<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.160> then<00:01:02.489> it

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
gunmetal gray finish here and then it

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.640 
gunmetal gray finish here and then it
has<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> matte<00:01:03.120> black<00:01:03.300> finish<00:01:03.420> on<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.199> outside

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
has a matte black finish on the outside

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.609 
has a matte black finish on the outside
the<00:01:05.250> traditional<00:01:05.600> loose<00:01:06.600> sort<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.140> handles

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
the traditional loose sort of handles

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.730 
the traditional loose sort of handles
that<00:01:08.340> are<00:01:08.490> sort<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.850> rubberized<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.750> grippy<00:01:10.710> a

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
that are sort of rubberized and grippy a

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.020 
that are sort of rubberized and grippy a
little<00:01:10.979> bit<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.189> case<00:01:11.310> your<00:01:11.520> hands<00:01:11.729> are<00:01:11.850> wet

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
little bit in case your hands are wet

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.109 
little bit in case your hands are wet
now<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:12.960> these<00:01:13.350> they<00:01:13.680> are<00:01:13.820> changeable<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:14.939> guess

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
now on these they are changeable I guess

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.910 
now on these they are changeable I guess
you<00:01:15.270> can<00:01:15.450> go<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.720> find<00:01:16.080> some<00:01:16.350> other<00:01:16.439> ones<00:01:16.710> and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
you can go and find some other ones and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.740 
you can go and find some other ones and
change<00:01:17.280> them<00:01:17.400> out<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.240> reason<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.540> say

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
change them out and the reason I say

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.480 
change them out and the reason I say
that<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.960> because<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.680> pretty<00:01:19.830> much<00:01:20.040> have<00:01:20.280> two

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
that is because you pretty much have two

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.190 
that is because you pretty much have two
minds<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:20.939> this<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.299> people<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.689> don't<00:01:21.990> mind

thought<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.270> using<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:51.899> would<00:01:52.079> be<00:01:52.170> a

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
thought that using this would be a

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.020 
thought that using this would be a
little<00:01:52.320> bit<00:01:52.500> easier<00:01:52.860> for<00:01:53.130> my<00:01:53.250> getting<00:01:53.520> used<00:01:53.850> to

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
little bit easier for my getting used to

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.420 
little bit easier for my getting used to
this<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.479> going<00:01:54.899> through<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.439> learning

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
this and going through the learning

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.490 
this and going through the learning
curve<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.149> comes<00:01:57.570> along<00:01:57.869> with<00:01:58.049> using<00:01:58.290> a

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
curve that comes along with using a

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.499 
curve that comes along with using a
baitcaster<00:01:58.680> it'll<00:01:59.670> also<00:01:59.759> be<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.000> lot<00:02:00.149> easier<00:02:00.180> to

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
baitcaster it'll also be a lot easier to

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.069 
baitcaster it'll also be a lot easier to
pick<00:02:00.810> out<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.590> bird's<00:02:02.070> nest<00:02:02.369> if<00:02:02.640> or<00:02:03.299> not<00:02:03.479> if<00:02:03.659> when

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
pick out a bird's nest if or not if when

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.880 
pick out a bird's nest if or not if when
that's<00:02:04.530> going<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.770> happen<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.250> me<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:06.890> pretty

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
that's going to happen to me so pretty

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.369 
that's going to happen to me so pretty
much<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.220> have<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.429> outside<00:02:09.420> adjustment<00:02:10.229> here

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
much you have a outside adjustment here

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.660 
much you have a outside adjustment here
for<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.679> breaks<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.069> it's<00:02:11.250> not<00:02:11.340> one<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.520> those

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
for the breaks so it's not one of those

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.510 
for the breaks so it's not one of those
ones<00:02:11.819> where<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.030> have<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.450> take<00:02:12.629> off<00:02:12.810> this<00:02:13.050> out

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
ones where you have to take off this out

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.940 
ones where you have to take off this out
a<00:02:13.550> piece<00:02:13.880> in<00:02:14.060> order<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.560> adjust<00:02:15.560> it<00:02:15.740> and<00:02:15.920> I

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
a piece in order to adjust it and I

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:16.870 
a piece in order to adjust it and I
thought<00:02:16.130> that<00:02:16.190> was<00:02:16.400> pretty<00:02:16.550> good

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
thought that was pretty good

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.300 
thought that was pretty good
especially<00:02:17.810> for<00:02:18.050> someone<00:02:18.590> who's<00:02:18.800> pretty<00:02:19.010> new

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
especially for someone who's pretty new

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.210 
especially for someone who's pretty new
because<00:02:19.820> I'm<00:02:20.170> going<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.380> be<00:02:21.530> probably<00:02:21.920> playing

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
because I'm going to be probably playing

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.470 
because I'm going to be probably playing
around<00:02:22.340> with<00:02:22.490> that<00:02:22.610> a<00:02:22.670> little<00:02:22.880> bit<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:23.270> then

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
around with that a little bit and then

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.270 
around with that a little bit and then
here<00:02:23.690> you<00:02:23.780> have<00:02:23.960> your<00:02:24.080> tension<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:24.800> then<00:02:25.070> your

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
here you have your tension and then your

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.240 
here you have your tension and then your
drag<00:02:26.150> is<00:02:26.420> here<00:02:27.080> this<00:02:27.230> little<00:02:27.470> star<00:02:27.740> sort<00:02:28.640> of

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
drag is here this little star sort of

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.420 
drag is here this little star sort of
assembly<00:02:31.250> here<00:02:31.580> so<00:02:32.240> that's<00:02:32.510> pretty<00:02:32.720> much<00:02:32.840> the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
assembly here so that's pretty much the

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.670 
assembly here so that's pretty much the
bait<00:02:34.430> casting<00:02:34.940> reel<00:02:35.420> there<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:36.410> what<00:02:36.590> I'm

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
bait casting reel there and what I'm

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.050 
bait casting reel there and what I'm
going<00:02:36.830> to<00:02:36.890> go<00:02:37.010> ahead<00:02:37.130> and<00:02:38.260> set<00:02:39.260> that<00:02:39.470> up<00:02:39.500> with

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
going to go ahead and set that up with

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.840 
going to go ahead and set that up with
it's<00:02:41.060> gonna<00:02:41.210> be<00:02:41.450> this<00:02:41.630> Seles<00:02:42.260> rod<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:43.520> this<00:02:43.730> is

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
it's gonna be this Seles rod and this is

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.180 
it's gonna be this Seles rod and this is
actually<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.210> crankbait<00:02:44.630> rod<00:02:45.020> bite<00:02:45.710> made<00:02:45.980> by<00:02:46.160> a

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
actually a crankbait rod bite made by a

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.970 
actually a crankbait rod bite made by a
Shimano<00:02:47.290> let<00:02:48.290> me<00:02:48.410> see<00:02:48.560> if<00:02:48.650> I<00:02:48.710> can<00:02:48.800> get<00:02:48.890> the

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
Shimano let me see if I can get the

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.190 
Shimano let me see if I can get the
specs<00:02:49.280> in<00:02:49.460> here<00:02:49.730> so<00:02:49.970> this<00:02:50.150> is<00:02:50.300> a<00:02:50.330> 7-foot<00:02:50.960> rod

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
specs in here so this is a 7-foot rod

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.890 
specs in here so this is a 7-foot rod
and<00:02:51.530> you<00:02:52.340> can<00:02:52.550> see<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:53.000> line<00:02:53.300> mono<00:02:53.570> in<00:02:53.810> the

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
and you can see the line mono in the

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.140 
and you can see the line mono in the
power<00:02:54.110> Pro<00:02:54.320> there<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:55.160> lower<00:02:55.400> rate<00:02:55.670> which<00:02:55.940> is

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
power Pro there the lower rate which is

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.380 
power Pro there the lower rate which is
3/8<00:02:56.570> to<00:02:56.780> one<00:02:56.990> out<00:02:57.260> it<00:02:58.010> is<00:02:58.340> a<00:02:58.370> medium<00:02:58.970> heavy

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
3/8 to one out it is a medium heavy

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:07.150 
3/8 to one out it is a medium heavy
action<00:02:59.890> fast<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:01.310> it's<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:03.130> 24<00:03:04.130> ton<00:03:06.160> rod

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
action fast and it's the 24 ton rod

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.220 
action fast and it's the 24 ton rod
there<00:03:07.400> so<00:03:07.730> there<00:03:08.570> you<00:03:08.690> go<00:03:08.810> sorry<00:03:09.080> I<00:03:09.110> got

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
there so there you go sorry I got

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.600 
there so there you go sorry I got
distracted<00:03:09.380> I<00:03:09.770> thought<00:03:09.950> my<00:03:10.070> cat<00:03:10.130> was<00:03:10.400> gonna

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
distracted I thought my cat was gonna

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.180 
distracted I thought my cat was gonna
jump<00:03:10.850> up<00:03:11.000> again<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:12.290> basically<00:03:12.530> I<00:03:12.890> think<00:03:12.950> this

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
jump up again and basically I think this

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.280 
jump up again and basically I think this
would<00:03:13.310> be<00:03:13.430> a<00:03:13.460> good<00:03:13.640> sort<00:03:14.150> of<00:03:14.240> beginning<00:03:14.630> rod

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
would be a good sort of beginning rod

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.990 
would be a good sort of beginning rod
for<00:03:15.560> me<00:03:15.680> I<00:03:15.860> didn't<00:03:16.100> want<00:03:16.190> something<00:03:16.490> bottom<00:03:16.880> of

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
for me I didn't want something bottom of

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.600 
for me I didn't want something bottom of
the<00:03:17.060> barrel<00:03:17.420> but<00:03:17.860> kind<00:03:18.860> of<00:03:18.920> wanted<00:03:19.190> something

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
the barrel but kind of wanted something

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.020 
the barrel but kind of wanted something
that<00:03:19.640> was<00:03:20.260> gonna<00:03:21.260> be<00:03:21.640> good<00:03:22.640> for<00:03:22.820> at<00:03:22.940> least

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
that was gonna be good for at least

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.430 
that was gonna be good for at least
learning<00:03:23.360> and<00:03:23.630> kind<00:03:23.780> of<00:03:23.900> getting<00:03:24.050> out<00:03:24.260> there

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
learning and kind of getting out there

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.050 
learning and kind of getting out there
and<00:03:24.650> again<00:03:24.860> as<00:03:24.980> I<00:03:25.100> said<00:03:25.370> when<00:03:25.610> I<00:03:25.640> get<00:03:25.940> into

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
and again as I said when I get into

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.180 
and again as I said when I get into
doing<00:03:26.420> like<00:03:26.570> frogs<00:03:26.870> and<00:03:27.110> such<00:03:27.380> I'm<00:03:27.830> gonna<00:03:28.070> be

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
doing like frogs and such I'm gonna be

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.710 
doing like frogs and such I'm gonna be
using<00:03:28.370> something<00:03:28.700> quite<00:03:29.060> a<00:03:29.090> bit<00:03:29.270> more

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
using something quite a bit more

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.140 
using something quite a bit more
heavy-duty<00:03:30.020> maybe<00:03:30.470> and<00:03:31.310> here<00:03:31.700> you<00:03:31.790> can<00:03:31.940> see

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
heavy-duty maybe and here you can see

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.730 
heavy-duty maybe and here you can see
the<00:03:32.270> tag<00:03:32.450> and<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:32.780> sort<00:03:32.959> of<00:03:33.020> indicates<00:03:33.500> that

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
the tag and it sort of indicates that

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.890 
the tag and it sort of indicates that
this<00:03:34.010> rod<00:03:34.340> would<00:03:34.520> be<00:03:34.640> good<00:03:34.850> for<00:03:35.060> using<00:03:35.390> on<00:03:35.540> jigs

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
this rod would be good for using on jigs

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.800 
this rod would be good for using on jigs
on<00:03:36.200> maybe<00:03:36.980> some<00:03:37.190> top<00:03:37.400> waters<00:03:37.880> I<00:03:38.300> see<00:03:38.510> some

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
on maybe some top waters I see some

sort of is like a cheat to kind of give
you<00:03:55.190> a<00:03:55.250> little<00:03:55.430> idea<00:03:55.640> of<00:03:56.150> what<00:03:56.510> that<00:03:56.750> rod<00:03:57.020> is

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
you a little idea of what that rod is

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.610 
you a little idea of what that rod is
good<00:03:57.380> for<00:03:57.620> so<00:03:58.180> that's<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.390> one<00:03:59.540> on<00:03:59.660> there<00:03:59.870> and

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
good for so that's the one on there and

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.470 
good for so that's the one on there and
I<00:04:00.680> try<00:04:00.890> to<00:04:00.920> stick<00:04:01.340> all<00:04:01.550> with<00:04:01.820> Shimano<00:04:02.060> ROG

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
I try to stick all with Shimano ROG

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.530 
I try to stick all with Shimano ROG
anyway<00:04:03.459> it's<00:04:04.459> not<00:04:04.640> as<00:04:04.820> much<00:04:05.150> a<00:04:05.180> brand

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
anyway it's not as much a brand

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.120 
anyway it's not as much a brand
preference<00:04:06.020> although<00:04:06.230> I<00:04:06.260> like<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:06.650> Shimano's

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
preference although I like the Shimano's

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.820 
preference although I like the Shimano's
as<00:04:07.370> it<00:04:07.700> is<00:04:07.820> the<00:04:08.000> fact<00:04:08.240> that<00:04:08.360> I<00:04:08.810> understand<00:04:09.650> that

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
as it is the fact that I understand that

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.850 
as it is the fact that I understand that
the<00:04:10.070> power<00:04:10.220> ratings<00:04:10.730> on<00:04:11.000> rods<00:04:11.540> are<00:04:11.870> not<00:04:12.170> an

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
the power ratings on rods are not an

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.430 
the power ratings on rods are not an
industry<00:04:13.700> standard<00:04:14.120> so<00:04:14.480> if<00:04:14.840> I<00:04:14.989> pretty<00:04:15.230> much

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
industry standard so if I pretty much

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.390 
industry standard so if I pretty much
stick<00:04:15.770> with<00:04:16.010> one<00:04:17.500> brand<00:04:18.500> then<00:04:18.859> I<00:04:18.919> always<00:04:19.100> know

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
stick with one brand then I always know

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.130 
stick with one brand then I always know
if<00:04:19.549> I'm<00:04:19.669> using<00:04:19.850> a<00:04:20.060> medium<00:04:20.450> it's<00:04:20.750> going<00:04:20.959> to<00:04:21.020> be<00:04:21.109> a

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
if I'm using a medium it's going to be a

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.680 
if I'm using a medium it's going to be a
medium<00:04:21.560> compared<00:04:22.040> to<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:22.760> other<00:04:22.940> rods<00:04:23.419> in

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
medium compared to the other rods in

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.770 
medium compared to the other rods in
that<00:04:23.900> line<00:04:24.140> so<00:04:24.950> this<00:04:25.520> is<00:04:25.700> pretty<00:04:25.880> much<00:04:26.000> my<00:04:26.180> very
