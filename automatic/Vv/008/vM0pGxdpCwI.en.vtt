this<00:02:55.110> but<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.590> probably<00:02:55.829> wouldn't<00:02:56.280> because

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
this but you probably wouldn't because

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.979 
this but you probably wouldn't because
pretty<00:02:56.730> much<00:02:56.819> just<00:02:57.150> me<00:02:57.329> whining<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.959> whole

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
pretty much just me whining the whole

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.960 
pretty much just me whining the whole
time<00:02:58.319> but<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.620> guess<00:02:58.829> that<00:02:59.010> is<00:02:59.069> what<00:02:59.340> my<00:02:59.489> normal

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
time but I guess that is what my normal

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.870 
time but I guess that is what my normal
episodes<00:03:00.510> are<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:01.739> if<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.099> like<00:03:02.280> those<00:03:02.640> I

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
episodes are so if you like those I

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.339 
episodes are so if you like those I
guess<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.180> should<00:03:03.360> like<00:03:03.569> this<00:03:03.959> even<00:03:04.230> though

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
guess you should like this even though

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.390 
guess you should like this even though
it<00:03:04.590> was<00:03:04.709> kind<00:03:04.890> of<00:03:04.950> dumb<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:06.319> not<00:03:07.319> planned<00:03:07.799> and

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
it was kind of dumb and not planned and

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.720 
it was kind of dumb and not planned and
it's<00:03:09.390> not<00:03:09.660> funny<00:03:10.079> and<00:03:10.459> you're<00:03:11.459> probably

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
it's not funny and you're probably

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.430 
it's not funny and you're probably
thinking<00:03:12.030> I'm<00:03:12.329> a<00:03:12.420> jerk<00:03:12.690> right<00:03:12.720> now<00:03:12.930> for

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
thinking I'm a jerk right now for

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.979 
thinking I'm a jerk right now for
canceling<00:03:14.400> it<00:03:14.549> and<00:03:14.819> i<00:03:15.120> think<00:03:15.269> i'm<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.720> trick

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.430 
canceling it and i think i'm a trick
right<00:03:16.019> now<00:03:16.349> so<00:03:16.620> I<00:03:16.860> mean<00:03:17.579> I<00:03:17.819> don't<00:03:18.750> even<00:03:18.989> care<00:03:19.290> if

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
right now so I mean I don't even care if

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.900 
right now so I mean I don't even care if
