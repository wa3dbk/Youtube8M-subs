on our laptop so again to Joy's we can
do<00:01:07.710> two<00:01:07.979> things<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.490> either<00:01:08.580> get<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.510> phone

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
do two things you can either get a phone

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.780 
do two things you can either get a phone
and<00:01:10.049> put<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.500> sim<00:01:10.740> card<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.310> Heather<00:01:11.520> like

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
and put a sim card in and Heather like

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.630 
and put a sim card in and Heather like
I'm<00:01:11.939> doing<00:01:12.409> or<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.500> can<00:01:13.590> do<00:01:13.710> an<00:01:13.830> air<00:01:14.040> card<00:01:14.369> and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
I'm doing or you can do an air card and

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.149 
I'm doing or you can do an air card and
I'm<00:01:14.700> actually<00:01:14.880> thinking<00:01:15.619> the<00:01:16.619> air<00:01:16.770> card<00:01:17.040> is

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
I'm actually thinking the air card is

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.550 
I'm actually thinking the air card is
probably<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.520> best<00:01:17.729> because<00:01:18.320> like<00:01:19.320> let's<00:01:19.500> say

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
probably the best because like let's say

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.609 
probably the best because like let's say
for<00:01:19.799> true<00:01:20.040> here<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.729> can<00:01:21.200> get<00:01:22.200> these<00:01:22.320> data

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
for true here you can get these data

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.090 
for true here you can get these data
packages<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.880> got<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.630> daily<00:01:25.290> or<00:01:25.320> or

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
packages and so on I got a daily or or

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.630 
packages and so on I got a daily or or
you<00:01:26.790> know<00:01:26.909> up<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.360> 30<00:01:27.840> days<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.530> on

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
you know up to 30 days and so on

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.060 
you know up to 30 days and so on
but<00:01:30.640> you<00:01:30.730> still<00:01:30.790> need<00:01:31.030> to<00:01:31.150> buy<00:01:31.300> the<00:01:31.740> USB<00:01:32.740> stick

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
but you still need to buy the USB stick

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.160 
but you still need to buy the USB stick
which<00:01:33.220> is<00:01:33.310> going<00:01:33.400> to<00:01:33.460> be<00:01:33.550> a<00:01:33.640> vote<00:01:34.050> you<00:01:35.050> know

3,000 baht or a hundred dollars u.s.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.780 
3,000 baht or a hundred dollars u.s.
what<00:01:40.120> I'm<00:01:40.240> thinking<00:01:40.270> is<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:40.930> a<00:01:41.140> is<00:01:41.440> here<00:01:42.040> they

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
what I'm thinking is the a is here they

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.249 
what I'm thinking is the a is here they
have<00:01:43.650> their<00:01:44.650> current<00:01:45.040> here<00:01:45.700> that's<00:01:46.300> a<00:01:47.220> 3g<00:01:48.220> 7.2

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
have their current here that's a 3g 7.2

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.510 
have their current here that's a 3g 7.2
megabits<00:01:50.259> per<00:01:50.320> cent<00:01:50.650> second<00:01:51.340> it's<00:01:52.110> 3190<00:01:53.110> bond

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
megabits per cent second it's 3190 bond

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.090 
megabits per cent second it's 3190 bond
but<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.700> nice<00:01:54.850> thing<00:01:54.880> is<00:01:55.119> going<00:01:55.300> to<00:01:55.420> see<00:01:55.570> here

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
but the nice thing is going to see here

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.200 
but the nice thing is going to see here
you<00:01:57.100> get<00:01:57.869> 1<00:01:58.869> gig<00:01:59.110> of<00:01:59.259> 3g<00:02:00.300> plus<00:02:01.300> 100<00:02:01.750> megs<00:02:02.440> of<00:02:02.680> 2g

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
you get 1 gig of 3g plus 100 megs of 2g

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.480 
you get 1 gig of 3g plus 100 megs of 2g
for<00:02:04.210> a<00:02:04.240> total<00:02:04.479> of<00:02:04.509> eleven<00:02:04.630> hundred<00:02:04.869> megabytes

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
for a total of eleven hundred megabytes

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.120 
for a total of eleven hundred megabytes
that's<00:02:06.490> valid<00:02:06.850> for<00:02:06.970> six<00:02:07.240> months<00:02:07.660> so<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.979> that

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
that's valid for six months so so that

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.240 
that's valid for six months so so that
might<00:02:09.310> be<00:02:09.340> another<00:02:09.459> alternative<00:02:10.179> there<00:02:11.250> it's

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
might be another alternative there it's

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.790 
might be another alternative there it's
because<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.120> buy<00:02:13.270> them<00:02:13.540> you<00:02:13.660> get<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:14.020> USB

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
because you buy them you get the USB

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.650 
because you buy them you get the USB
stick<00:02:15.190> plus<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.640> sim<00:02:15.850> card<00:02:15.880> all<00:02:16.209> together<00:02:16.360> in

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
stick plus the sim card all together in

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.660 
stick plus the sim card all together in
a<00:02:16.750> package<00:02:17.200> least<00:02:18.040> that's<00:02:18.190> what<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.340> believe

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
a package least that's what I believe

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.949 
a package least that's what I believe
from<00:02:18.850> what<00:02:18.940> reading<00:02:19.239> this<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:22.330> can<00:02:22.600> get

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
from what reading this and you can get

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.070 
from what reading this and you can get
the<00:02:23.080> one<00:02:23.260> that's<00:02:23.940> less<00:02:24.940> of<00:02:25.269> megabits<00:02:26.019> per

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
the one that's less of megabits per

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.620 
the one that's less of megabits per
second<00:02:26.620> but<00:02:26.769> it's<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.940> price<00:02:28.120> difference<00:02:28.420> is

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
second but it's the price difference is

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.380 
second but it's the price difference is
not<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:29.050> much<00:02:29.290> is<00:02:29.500> so<00:02:29.620> they're<00:02:29.800> like<00:02:30.209> this<00:02:31.209> is

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
not that much is so they're like this is

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.820 
not that much is so they're like this is
only<00:02:31.540> four<00:02:31.780> hundred<00:02:32.050> baht<00:02:32.230> which<00:02:32.260> is<00:02:32.650> like

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
only four hundred baht which is like

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.290 
only four hundred baht which is like
eleven<00:02:33.459> dollars

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
eleven dollars

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.250 
eleven dollars
so<00:02:36.410> yeah<00:02:37.410> so<00:02:38.130> check<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.700> out<00:02:38.900> I'll<00:02:39.900> put<00:02:40.140> the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
so yeah so check that out I'll put the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.410 
so yeah so check that out I'll put the
links<00:02:40.620> on<00:02:40.830> on<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.610> video<00:02:41.850> as<00:02:42.030> well<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:44.360> yeah<00:02:45.360> I

think<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.750> might<00:02:45.930> be<00:02:45.960> the<00:02:46.080> better

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
think that might be the better

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.910 
think that might be the better
