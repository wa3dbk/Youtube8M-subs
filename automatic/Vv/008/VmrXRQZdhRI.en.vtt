00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.609
 we are looking for a lot of training 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.139
 movement I heard another recording 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.630
 my fantasy live on the ball 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.690
 hit a straight line for you 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.880
 getting more control of the ball is 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.720
 You 'll want a little more effect. 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.390
 on the ball 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.400
 to pull the ball a little more then to 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.119
 This is what happens is that you have to 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.050
 do an arm pressure exercise 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.969
 who to force it will put pressure on you 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.090
 after you are 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.610
 pressed it is natural that force you 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.920
 will want this type of exercise 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.110
 interesting because when you 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.570
 brought up person with one step of winning 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.579
 and you hit the ball when you 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.780
 will hit the ball what are you going to try 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.730
 do worse now 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.219
 if I see trying to force racket for 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.449
 front and up starting here 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.059
 forcing and rising to the worst 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.090
 I'm simulating it in my muscle to do 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.830
 this movement to the worse bating order that 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.470
 Forcing him, he simply tried to 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.810
 of this circular movement I am not 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.450
 forcing the racket forward is that I 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.310
 I think you do not leave it there for this one. 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.100
 movement is very much exercise is 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.380
 very good you do it here looks 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.760
 do a four five times forcing 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:30.160
 fairly compact 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:33.790
 pressure multiplied the pressure after 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.040
 You take off that lasko so it will not let go. 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.480
 He and you, you'll get it too. 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.070
 drop some balls 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.040
 you will see that the movement really 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.800
 It's much easier, much more natural. 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.270
 so it was this kind of exercise is 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.370
 very important that you are not 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.820
 stimulating the ones you need to put 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.440
 pressure when you draw a bow 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.270
 who is going to hit the ball you will see that 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.470
 this movement is much more natural as well 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.810
 four more 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.630
 this exercise we have to do 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.790
 about five times as 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.620
 takes someone drops the ball that will 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.229
 hitting another half-dozen hours in 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.840
 lages was elastic does not make a half of 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.680
 side of 45 times in the west forcing well 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.570
 a monster 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.300
 then it's about four-five hours in 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.800
 miracles you will begin to feel the 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.420
 match you do not feel the difference 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.819
 What do you have when you start to force 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.739
 to listen to some optical articulation of the 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.739
 right legal way
