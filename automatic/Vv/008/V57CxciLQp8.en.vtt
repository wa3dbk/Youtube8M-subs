00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.290
 with local first quality 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.730
 open from the hallertau and spring 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.980
 fresh water from the nature park 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.929
 Western forests are emerging 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.779
 traditional recipes were the popular ones 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:23.359
 ustersbacher beer specialties and the 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.519
 the brewery for over 400 years 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.609
 from that price a brewery in bavaria 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.899
 the beer and soft drinks 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.339
 we are produced here in the 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:33.559
 brewery made as well as the 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:36.379
 Soft drinks are then 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.379
 bottled in bottles are packed in 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:42.440
 carriers and then with stackers 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.230
 First put in a fully well position and 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.199
 then on order with stackers on 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.910
 truck and then go with our 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.909
 in-house logistics or with 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.519
 forwarding to the customer our wealth 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:58.579
 plant produces 60,000 bottles per 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.859
 hour and 24 hours thus produce 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.100
 around one million bottles and that 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:06.439
 gives about 2000 pallets per day 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.479
 such quantities must be moved flexibly 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.509
 The company is also doing so 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.210
 on the toyota tournaments opti max the 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.009
 forklifts move the empties to 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.450
 palletizing the palletizing takes the 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.430
 boxes will be apart the bottles 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.469
 processed and filled and the 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.110
 filled bottles are taken from the stacker 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:27.350
 taken off again and was as palettes 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.329
 deposited in the warehouse while cleaning the 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.840
 empties are left over 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.159
 transported and disposed of 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.560
 detached labels from the bottles 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.240
 are washed off and with a 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.250
 Conveyor belt in a container 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.930
 the container must be transported by 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.640
 be emptied time to time 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.369
 Here we use our new tour 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.680
 raw the own valve intended for it 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.060
 has on the hydraulic side with it 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.100
 can deliver the container 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.200
 why has the brewery been for the 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.549
 tournaments opti max decided since we 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.490
 have an economic calculation 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.409
 set up where you stop the tower with 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.299
 to convince the products of competitors and 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.070
 we were of the opinion that with the 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.439
 tournament in any case cut off well 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.880
 be and its productivity in things 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.310
 economics 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.959
 But it was the purchase price 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.970
 we saw advantages at the tournament 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.800
 we have many in the past 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.810
 diesel forklift in use and have stop 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.000
 also the disadvantages of diesel 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.069
 Stack over many 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.530
 Hours not so clean 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.599
 work and we wanted but what 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.370
 the exhaust quality and then so too 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.680
 as regards the air quality in the halls 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.739
 that's why the choice was clear 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.870
 on liquid gas stacker and the other 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.420
 that was at least three 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.430
 tons of oblast need only two 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.890
 pallets can move full well 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.170
 another crucial point was 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:49.370
 that toyota own system for active 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.690
 stability briefly sas thereby act more 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.360
 functions together 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.459
 one of them is the automatic fork 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.410
 leveling in daily operation 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.420
 the fork leveling itself as very 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.700
 useful because we are very 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.130
 piled high and the forklift driver of the 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.290
 Can the mast and the fork exactly 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.060
 stand vertically and horizontally and 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.470
 can then drive it on a sentence purely 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.079
 has turned out in operation that 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.890
 the stacker very sturdy and 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:16.299
 powerful and that will us in the 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.299
 future will help a lot
