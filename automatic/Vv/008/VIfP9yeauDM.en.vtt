00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
so no what they're gonna do is we're

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.440 
so no what they're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:02:53.010> go<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.400> upper<00:02:53.670> River<00:02:53.910> Valley<00:02:54.180> and

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
gonna go to the upper River Valley and

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.820 
gonna go to the upper River Valley and
hopefully<00:02:54.870> in<00:02:54.980> this<00:02:55.980> winds<00:02:56.280> not<00:02:56.580> up<00:02:56.730> there<00:02:56.940> but

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
hopefully in this winds not up there but

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.560 
hopefully in this winds not up there but
it<00:02:58.830> doesn't<00:02:59.040> seem<00:02:59.250> like<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.520> northern<00:02:59.880> wind<00:03:00.120> so

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
it doesn't seem like a northern wind so

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.880 
it doesn't seem like a northern wind so
it<00:03:00.690> could<00:03:00.870> be<00:03:01.020> up<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.230> valley<00:03:01.410> too<00:03:01.680> if<00:03:01.740> you

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
it could be up the valley too if you

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.310 
it could be up the valley too if you
just<00:03:02.040> head<00:03:02.250> right<00:03:02.280> up<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.700> valley<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:03.600> have<00:03:04.230> to

well we fished the lower it was a pretty

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.270 
well we fished the lower it was a pretty

much close to hurricane force winds down

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.520 
much close to hurricane force winds down
there<00:03:33.519> so<00:03:33.700> we'd<00:03:33.819> abandoned<00:03:34.299> that<00:03:34.470> decided<00:03:35.470> to

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
there so we'd abandoned that decided to

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.929 
there so we'd abandoned that decided to
come<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:35.799> the<00:03:35.920> upper<00:03:36.040> there's<00:03:36.370> no<00:03:36.519> wind<00:03:36.760> up

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:36.939

here but for whatever reason with the

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.429 
here but for whatever reason with the
league<00:03:38.560> recent<00:03:38.980> rains<00:03:39.189> in<00:03:40.000> this<00:03:40.209> wind<00:03:40.510> even

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:41.439 
league recent rains in this wind even

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:43.559 
league recent rains in this wind even
the<00:03:41.530> river<00:03:41.739> above<00:03:42.129> the<00:03:42.340> clay<00:03:42.579> banks<00:03:42.819> is<00:03:43.150> really

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
the river above the clay banks is really

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.830 
the river above the clay banks is really
dirty<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:44.680> what<00:03:45.579> few<00:03:45.879> runs<00:03:46.120> up<00:03:46.390> here<00:03:46.629> have

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
dirty and what few runs up here have

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.330 
dirty and what few runs up here have
enough<00:03:47.140> water<00:03:47.379> because<00:03:47.650> its<00:03:47.739> waters<00:03:48.159> really

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
enough water because its waters really

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.789 
enough water because its waters really
low<00:03:48.430> so<00:03:49.299> what<00:03:49.450> few<00:03:49.720> runs<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.109> beholding<00:03:50.590> fish

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
low so what few runs the beholding fish

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.920 
low so what few runs the beholding fish
there's<00:03:51.040> like<00:03:51.220> five<00:03:51.459> cars<00:03:51.790> at<00:03:52.030> every<00:03:52.209> run<00:03:52.420> so<00:03:52.689> I

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
there's like five cars at every run so I

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.339 
there's like five cars at every run so I
think<00:03:53.739> you<00:03:54.189> know<00:03:54.310> as<00:03:55.239> far<00:03:55.450> as<00:03:55.569> I'm<00:03:55.750> concerned<00:03:56.140> I

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
think you know as far as I'm concerned I

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.080 
think you know as far as I'm concerned I
only<00:03:56.470> want<00:03:56.709> to<00:03:56.739> fish<00:03:56.950> so<00:03:57.250> it's<00:03:57.609> all<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:57.849> cars

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
only want to fish so it's all the cars

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.150 
only want to fish so it's all the cars
that<00:03:58.359> I<00:03:58.420> think<00:03:58.659> nothing's<00:03:58.989> going<00:03:59.139> to<00:03:59.170> bail

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
that I think nothing's going to bail

00:04:01.160 --> 00:05:09.010 
that I think nothing's going to bail
we'll<00:04:01.400> come<00:04:01.550> back<00:04:01.730> on<00:04:01.910> another<00:04:02.120> day

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
for a quick fish I'll throw some of that

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.490 
for a quick fish I'll throw some of that
video<00:05:13.250> up<00:05:13.550> but<00:05:13.730> it<00:05:13.820> was<00:05:13.910> a<00:05:13.940> horrific<00:05:14.690> windstorm

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
video up but it was a horrific windstorm

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.960 
video up but it was a horrific windstorm
and<00:05:15.710> then<00:05:15.800> the<00:05:15.890> river<00:05:16.040> blew<00:05:16.310> out<00:05:16.460> so<00:05:16.730> that<00:05:16.850> was

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
and then the river blew out so that was

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.850 
and then the river blew out so that was
kind<00:05:17.150> of<00:05:17.180> the<00:05:17.270> end<00:05:17.300> of<00:05:17.450> that<00:05:17.540> day<00:05:17.810> so<00:05:18.650> now
