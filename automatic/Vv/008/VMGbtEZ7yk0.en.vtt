00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello in this video I show you how 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.020
 you can prepare a rice salad 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.250
 I have the details for a portion 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.559
 reduced and for this you need 250 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.740
 gram mayonnaise two tablespoons 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.130
 Soy sauce 125 grams of cooked ham 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.160
 a green and a red paprika one 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.400
 onion a tangerine as well as the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:31.289
 half of mandarin juice 125 grams 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.210
 rice and two tablespoons of sugar as 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:39.120
 First of all you cook your rice in the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:41.340
 salt water from in the meantime you can 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.140
 your peppers the onions yours 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.090
 tangerines and ham small 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.090
 cut into fine cubes 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.810
 I peeled the onion first 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:23.399
 Now beat them into relatively thin ones 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:28.039
 slices and if you still have them 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.039
 times in slices you have dice 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.049
 Finally, the peppers are on it 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.890
 Of course this must be washed 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:41.330
 then you halve it best 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.330
 now she could pull apart 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:52.590
 then remove the inner part again 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.520
 quarter the white cut out as well 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.520
 remove the cores 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.930
 now slice and this 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:13.300
 You can now slice in wonderfully 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:15.520
 dice little bakken now give her 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:23.710
 just cut your ingredients in 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:25.570
 a bowl with the rice and after you 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.060
 you mix everything well you care 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:32.220
 you order the sauce for this is their heritage 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:40.900
 half of your Mandarin what hats added 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:44.910
 then the mayonnaise in my sugar 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.910
 this is the half of the pack and 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.060
 to the conclusion nor the soy sauce 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:06.780
 and now mix everything just fine 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.629
 he would have to draw another hour 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.489
 leave and you're done a lot of fun 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.489
 imitation and good appetite
