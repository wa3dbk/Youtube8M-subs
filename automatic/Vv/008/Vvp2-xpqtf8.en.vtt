you<00:01:27.619> just<00:01:28.060> blend<00:01:29.060> it

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.499 

this<00:01:41.280> mean<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.579> bend<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.969> till<00:01:42.119> it's<00:01:42.270> slightly

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
this mean to bend it till it's slightly

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
smooth and there are no lumps if you

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.550 
smooth and there are no lumps if you
think<00:01:44.280> it's<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.490> little<00:01:44.789> sticky<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:46.229> can<00:01:46.409> just

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
think it's a little sticky you can just

00:01:46.560 --> 00:02:02.420 
think it's a little sticky you can just
add<00:01:46.710> some<00:01:46.950> more<00:01:48.320> contra

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.130 

now<00:02:02.970> that<00:02:03.150> the<00:02:03.240> batter's<00:02:03.510> done<00:02:03.540> we<00:02:04.110> just

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
now that the batter's done we just

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.120 
now that the batter's done we just
grease<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:05.100> bowl

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.520 

we'll<00:02:09.700> just<00:02:09.910> take<00:02:10.030> a<00:02:10.060> deep<00:02:10.330> tally<00:02:10.720> and<00:02:10.960> grease

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530

we'll just take a deep tally and grease
it<00:02:11.710> a<00:02:11.740> little<00:02:11.980> bit

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
it a little bit

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.530 
it a little bit
the<00:02:15.070> reason<00:02:15.340> with<00:02:15.490> greasing<00:02:15.910> it<00:02:16.060> is<00:02:16.240> so<00:02:16.360> that

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
the reason with greasing it is so that

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.470 
the reason with greasing it is so that
the<00:02:16.720> batter<00:02:17.230> 1/16<00:02:17.980> who<00:02:18.220> doesn't<00:02:18.610> stick<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.330> the

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
base which is natural grease the sides

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.040 
base which is natural grease the sides
also<00:02:21.970> well

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.190
