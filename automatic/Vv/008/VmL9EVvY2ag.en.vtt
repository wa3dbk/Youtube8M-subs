00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
look at the bottom side of the board you

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.420 
look at the bottom side of the board you
would<00:02:33.570> simply<00:02:33.780> just<00:02:34.170> need<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.560> disconnect<00:02:35.040> all

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
would simply just need to disconnect all

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.670 
would simply just need to disconnect all
the<00:02:35.460> cables<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.240> then<00:02:36.810> remove<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.320> screws

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
the cables and then remove the screws

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.400 
the cables and then remove the screws
that<00:02:37.710> hold<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.310> board<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.820> panel<00:02:39.230> be<00:02:40.230> sure

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
that hold the board to the panel be sure

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.560

when disconnecting cables and removing

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.600 
when disconnecting cables and removing
screws<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.260> take<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.470> picture<00:02:43.800> of<00:02:44.190> what

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
screws that you take a picture of what

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.010 
screws that you take a picture of what
the<00:02:44.730> board<00:02:45.000> looks<00:02:45.060> like<00:02:45.480> in<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.930> original

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
the board looks like in the original

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.350 
the board looks like in the original
state<00:02:46.680> with<00:02:46.920> all<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.220> cables<00:02:47.610> connected<00:02:48.180> and

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
state with all the cables connected and

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.330 
state with all the cables connected and
then<00:02:48.930> you'll<00:02:49.080> have<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.260> reference<00:02:49.560> for<00:02:50.070> when

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
then you'll have a reference for when

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.300 
then you'll have a reference for when
you<00:02:50.460> reconnect<00:02:51.090> all<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.630> cables<00:02:52.020> rules<00:02:52.710> if

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
you reconnect all the cables rules if

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.400 
you reconnect all the cables rules if
all<00:02:53.490> the<00:02:53.640> components<00:02:53.910> look<00:02:54.270> good<00:02:54.540> then<00:02:55.230> you'll

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
all the components look good then you'll

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.050 
all the components look good then you'll
want<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.770> check<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.130> fuse<00:02:56.460> on<00:02:56.490> the<00:02:56.880> power

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
want to check the fuse on the power

are some images of what a blown fuse can

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.380 
are some images of what a blown fuse can
look<00:03:02.220> like<00:03:03.650> some<00:03:04.650> TVs<00:03:05.040> have<00:03:05.310> glass<00:03:05.610> fuses<00:03:06.180> and

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
look like some TVs have glass fuses and

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.870 
look like some TVs have glass fuses and
some<00:03:06.690> have<00:03:06.900> ceramic<00:03:07.470> music<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.130> glass<00:03:08.370> fuses

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
some have ceramic music the glass fuses

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.700 
some have ceramic music the glass fuses
can<00:03:08.910> show<00:03:09.300> visual<00:03:09.780> damage<00:03:10.260> when<00:03:10.440> they<00:03:10.590> are

can show visual damage when they are

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.820 
can show visual damage when they are
blown<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.820> ceramic<00:03:12.330> fuses<00:03:12.690> do<00:03:12.870> not<00:03:13.080> and<00:03:13.380> would

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
blown the ceramic fuses do not and would

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.610 
blown the ceramic fuses do not and would
need<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.040> be<00:03:14.250> tested<00:03:14.730> with<00:03:14.880> a<00:03:14.910> meter<00:03:15.210> if<00:03:15.620> the

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
need to be tested with a meter if the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.740 
need to be tested with a meter if the
fuse<00:03:16.890> is<00:03:17.040> blown<00:03:17.190> replace<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.120> fuse<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:18.420> then

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
fuse is blown replace the fuse and then

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.530 
fuse is blown replace the fuse and then
plug<00:03:18.989> your<00:03:19.020> TV<00:03:19.350> back<00:03:19.770> in<00:03:20.090> after<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.180> plug<00:03:21.390> it

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
plug your TV back in after you plug it

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.270 
plug your TV back in after you plug it
back<00:03:21.570> in<00:03:21.959> if<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.380> new<00:03:22.530> fuse<00:03:22.920> blows

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
back in if the new fuse blows

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.400 
back in if the new fuse blows
immediately<00:03:24.030> then<00:03:24.510> there's<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:24.840> problem<00:03:25.290> with

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
immediately then there's a problem with

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.229 
immediately then there's a problem with
the<00:03:25.530> power<00:03:25.680> supply<00:03:25.860> board<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:26.910> should<00:03:27.120> be

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
the power supply board and it should be

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.199 
the power supply board and it should be
replaced<00:03:27.570> if<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.770> fuse<00:03:29.010> does<00:03:29.190> not<00:03:29.370> blow<00:03:29.670> then

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
replaced if the fuse does not blow then

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.910 
replaced if the fuse does not blow then
you<00:03:30.360> may<00:03:30.510> have<00:03:30.630> just<00:03:30.810> had<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:30.959> power<00:03:31.230> surge<00:03:31.620> or

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
you may have just had a power surge or

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.650 
you may have just had a power surge or
another<00:03:32.220> problem<00:03:32.640> that<00:03:32.820> caused<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.239> fuse<00:03:33.480> to

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
another problem that caused the fuse to

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.530 
another problem that caused the fuse to
blow<00:03:33.870> if<00:03:34.170> your<00:03:35.130> fuse<00:03:35.459> is<00:03:35.670> good<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.180> you<00:03:36.300> do<00:03:36.420> not

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
blow if your fuse is good and you do not

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.240 
blow if your fuse is good and you do not
see<00:03:36.810> any<00:03:36.989> visible<00:03:37.230> damage<00:03:37.590> on<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.040> power

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
see any visible damage on the power

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.760 
see any visible damage on the power
supply<00:03:38.520> board<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:39.660> next<00:03:39.989> step<00:03:40.200> is<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.590> use<00:03:40.620> a

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
supply board the next step is to use a

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.190 
supply board the next step is to use a
meter<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:41.430> start<00:03:42.030> checking<00:03:42.270> voltages<00:03:42.930> on<00:03:43.080> the

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
meter and start checking voltages on the

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.170 
meter and start checking voltages on the
power<00:03:43.380> supply<00:03:43.739> board<00:03:43.769> to<00:03:44.610> see<00:03:44.790> where<00:03:45.030> the
