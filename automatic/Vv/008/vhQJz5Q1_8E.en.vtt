00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:57.539 
worries at all so the trace has got
three<00:02:52.239> snapper<00:02:52.659> in<00:02:52.959> about<00:02:53.530> six<00:02:53.920> cars<00:02:54.250> so<00:02:56.549> it's

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
three snapper in about six cars so it's

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.349 
three snapper in about six cars so it's
not<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.819> bad<00:02:58.060> effort<00:02:59.310> the<00:03:00.310> simplest<00:03:01.090> technique

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
not a bad effort the simplest technique

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:06.300 
not a bad effort the simplest technique
with<00:03:01.810> these<00:03:01.930> things<00:03:03.480> with<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.599> snapper<00:03:05.310> it's

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
with these things with the snapper it's

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.430 
with these things with the snapper it's
again<00:03:06.849> like<00:03:07.090> same<00:03:07.329> as<00:03:07.540> most<00:03:07.690> stuff<00:03:07.989> that<00:03:08.139> we<00:03:08.230> do

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
again like same as most stuff that we do

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.039 
again like same as most stuff that we do
it's<00:03:08.950> not<00:03:09.099> rocket<00:03:09.370> science<00:03:09.909> you<00:03:10.090> can<00:03:10.780> flick

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
it's not rocket science you can flick

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.229 
it's not rocket science you can flick
the<00:03:11.170> plastic<00:03:11.590> out<00:03:11.769> let<00:03:12.340> it<00:03:12.370> hit<00:03:12.519> the<00:03:12.609> bottom

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.339

right side still sinking still sinking
still<00:03:20.349> sinking<00:03:20.879> just<00:03:21.879> get<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.090> bottom<00:03:22.359> now

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
still sinking just get the bottom now

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.080 
still sinking just get the bottom now
give<00:03:23.560> it<00:03:23.590> a<00:03:23.709> couple<00:03:23.829> of<00:03:23.980> twitches<00:03:24.370> wine<00:03:24.909> on<00:03:25.060> the

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
give it a couple of twitches wine on the

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.649 
give it a couple of twitches wine on the
slack<00:03:25.389> better<00:03:26.290> hit<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.530> bottom<00:03:26.859> again<00:03:27.659> switch

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:28.659 
slack better hit the bottom again switch

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:31.199 
slack better hit the bottom again switch
switch<00:03:28.920> wonderful<00:03:29.920> thing<00:03:30.159> and<00:03:30.879> I<00:03:30.940> mean<00:03:31.120> that's

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
switch wonderful thing and I mean that's

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.420 
switch wonderful thing and I mean that's
all<00:03:31.450> there<00:03:31.629> is<00:03:31.659> to<00:03:31.780> it<00:03:32.129> the<00:03:33.129> biggest

all there is to it the biggest
thing<00:03:34.700> to<00:03:34.819> take<00:03:34.969> into<00:03:35.049> consideration<00:03:36.049> is<00:03:36.170> this

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
thing to take into consideration is this

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.089 
thing to take into consideration is this
idea<00:03:36.500> jig<00:03:37.040> head<00:03:37.250> for<00:03:38.239> the<00:03:38.329> current<00:03:38.689> flag<00:03:40.359> or

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
idea jig head for the current flag or

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:49.869 
idea jig head for the current flag or
the<00:03:43.099> current<00:03:43.519> flow<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:47.120> current<00:03:47.510> flow<00:03:47.719> one<00:03:48.879> if

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 
the current flow the current flow one if

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:51.640 
the current flow the current flow one if
it's<00:03:50.090> fairly<00:03:50.359> fairly<00:03:50.900> quick<00:03:51.200> with<00:03:51.409> fairly

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
it's fairly fairly quick with fairly

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.539 
it's fairly fairly quick with fairly
stiff<00:03:51.950> current<00:03:52.840> if<00:03:53.840> you<00:03:53.989> got<00:03:54.109> to<00:03:54.980> light<00:03:55.189> a<00:03:55.219> jig

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
stiff current if you got to light a jig

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.539 
stiff current if you got to light a jig
head<00:03:56.290> you<00:03:57.290> can't<00:03:57.530> stay<00:03:57.769> in<00:03:57.889> contact<00:03:58.099> with<00:03:58.459> the

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
head you can't stay in contact with the

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.330 
head you can't stay in contact with the
bottle<00:03:59.349> so<00:04:00.349> I'll<00:04:00.439> just<00:04:00.469> flick<00:04:00.799> that<00:04:00.920> he<00:04:01.129> nearly

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
bottle so I'll just flick that he nearly

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.800 
bottle so I'll just flick that he nearly
got<00:04:01.489> me<00:04:01.549> I<00:04:01.700> never<00:04:01.969> got<00:04:02.090> that<00:04:02.150> plastic<00:04:02.659> off<00:04:02.780> the

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
got me I never got that plastic off the

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.759 
got me I never got that plastic off the
jig<00:04:03.139> head<00:04:03.319> so<00:04:04.180> we'll<00:04:05.180> just<00:04:05.329> see<00:04:05.480> if<00:04:05.510> we<00:04:05.659> can<00:04:05.810> put

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
jig head so we'll just see if we can put

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.229 
jig head so we'll just see if we can put
him<00:04:06.859> on<00:04:06.980> a<00:04:07.010> fraction<00:04:07.459> different<00:04:07.879> so<00:04:08.030> we<00:04:08.120> can

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
him on a fraction different so we can

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.879 
him on a fraction different so we can
sell<00:04:08.450> with<00:04:08.629> the<00:04:08.659> plastic<00:04:09.639> all<00:04:10.639> right<00:04:10.730> so<00:04:11.889> look

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889 
sell with the plastic all right so look

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:17.680 
sell with the plastic all right so look
it<00:04:13.010> out<00:04:13.659> better<00:04:14.659> hit<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:14.870> bottom<00:04:16.570> you<00:04:17.570> get<00:04:17.660> a

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
it out better hit the bottom you get a

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.420 
it out better hit the bottom you get a
lot<00:04:17.810> of<00:04:17.840> mulloway<00:04:18.169> in<00:04:18.349> this<00:04:18.560> spot<00:04:18.799> two<00:04:19.070> small

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
lot of mulloway in this spot two small

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:29.529 
lot of mulloway in this spot two small
bomb<00:04:19.639> away<00:04:20.109> don't<00:04:21.109> I<00:04:21.229> say<00:04:27.970> write<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.090> score

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
bomb away don't I say write the score

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:37.060 
bomb away don't I say write the score
we're<00:04:30.080> on<00:04:35.050> now<00:04:36.050> this<00:04:36.229> one<00:04:36.440> realizes<00:04:36.830> he's
