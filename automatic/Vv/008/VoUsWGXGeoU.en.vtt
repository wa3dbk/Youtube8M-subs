00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
reviews with people using either logic

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.709 
reviews with people using either logic
or<00:00:34.140> some<00:00:34.680> other<00:00:34.800> program<00:00:35.130> but<00:00:36.030> I'm<00:00:36.329> just<00:00:36.570> going

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
or some other program but I'm just going

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.990 
or some other program but I'm just going
to<00:00:36.750> stick<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.170> basics<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.370> garage<00:00:38.670> band

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
to stick to the basics of a garage band

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.410 
to stick to the basics of a garage band
on<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:40.290> Mac<00:00:40.649> just<00:00:41.160> how<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.670> get<00:00:41.940> started<00:00:42.090> on

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
on a Mac just how to get started on

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.529 
on a Mac just how to get started on
Garageband<00:00:43.020> because<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.680> didn't<00:00:44.219> know<00:00:44.280> how

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
Garageband because I didn't know how

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.869 
Garageband because I didn't know how
even<00:00:45.539> though<00:00:45.690> i<00:00:45.960> don't<00:00:46.620> regret<00:00:46.920> buying<00:00:47.640> this

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
even though i don't regret buying this

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.049 
even though i don't regret buying this
at<00:00:48.270> all<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:49.430> thought<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.670> would<00:00:50.789> have<00:00:50.879> still

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
at all I thought it would have still

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.830 
at all I thought it would have still
been<00:00:51.120> really<00:00:51.690> nice<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.199> just<00:00:53.160> hear<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.420> sample

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
been really nice to just hear a sample

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.770 
been really nice to just hear a sample
that's<00:00:55.440> why<00:00:56.010> I'm<00:00:56.160> making<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:57.059> i<00:00:57.360> could

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
that's why I'm making this so i could

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.799 
that's why I'm making this so i could
help<00:00:57.809> someone<00:00:58.500> else<00:00:58.820> so<00:00:59.820> yeah<00:01:00.120> let's<00:01:00.600> get

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
like my old microphone and it also came

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.700 
like my old microphone and it also came
with<00:01:22.490> headphones<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.880> i<00:01:24.720> find<00:01:25.170> them<00:01:25.409> really

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
with headphones and i find them really

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.660 
with headphones and i find them really
cool<00:01:26.130> they<00:01:26.610> adjust<00:01:27.570> by<00:01:28.140> themselves<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.860> have

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
cool they adjust by themselves and have

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.920 
cool they adjust by themselves and have
a<00:01:29.729> three<00:01:30.180> metre<00:01:30.390> long<00:01:30.680> cable<00:01:31.680> then<00:01:32.689> he<00:01:33.689> ball

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
a three metre long cable then he ball

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.640 
a three metre long cable then he ball
which<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.159> three<00:01:35.970> meters<00:01:36.180> long<00:01:36.540> last<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:37.619> not

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
which is three meters long last but not

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.899 
which is three meters long last but not
least<00:01:38.540> it<00:01:39.540> included<00:01:40.700> this<00:01:42.110> one<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.909> thought

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
least it included this one I thought

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.639 
least it included this one I thought
that<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.210> was<00:01:45.299> really<00:01:45.450> nice<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.750> these<00:01:46.140> knobs

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
that it was really nice that these knobs

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.270 
that it was really nice that these knobs

I kind of like hard to twist so you

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.850 
I kind of like hard to twist so you
wouldn't<00:01:50.579> do<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.729> accidentally<00:01:51.689> one<00:01:52.590> thing

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
wouldn't do that accidentally one thing

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.020 
wouldn't do that accidentally one thing
that<00:01:53.220> they<00:01:53.610> should<00:01:54.140> change<00:01:55.399> on<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.610> website

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
that they should change on the website

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.160

with cuba's I got the impression that I
have<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.610> download<00:02:05.969> this<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.689> in

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
have to download this and in

have to download this and in
and<00:02:07.750> all<00:02:08.020> that<00:02:08.260> jazz<00:02:08.619> but<00:02:09.210> I<00:02:10.210> didn't<00:02:10.960> they

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
and all that jazz but I didn't they

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.240 
and all that jazz but I didn't they

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
should tell you that you can use all of

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.440 
should tell you that you can use all of
this<00:02:16.020> without<00:02:17.020> this<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:18.070> have<00:02:18.730> no<00:02:18.760> experience

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
this without this I have no experience

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.260 
this without this I have no experience
from<00:02:19.720> this<00:02:19.900> but<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:21.010> looked<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.580> little<00:02:22.060> bit

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
from this but it looked a little bit

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.610 
from this but it looked a little bit
complicated<00:02:23.010> what<00:02:24.010> I<00:02:24.040> like<00:02:24.460> about<00:02:24.510> microphone

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
complicated what I like about microphone

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.590 
complicated what I like about microphone
is<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:27.670> as<00:02:28.060> long<00:02:28.990> as<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.410> sing<00:02:29.970> into<00:02:30.970> it<00:02:31.270> from

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
is that as long as you sing into it from

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.270 
is that as long as you sing into it from
here<00:02:32.170> this<00:02:32.920> side<00:02:33.160> it<00:02:34.120> didn't<00:02:34.480> take<00:02:34.510> any

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
here this side it didn't take any

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.530 
here this side it didn't take any
background<00:02:37.710> noises<00:02:38.710> or<00:02:39.250> anything<00:02:39.790> other<00:02:40.270> than

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
background noises or anything other than

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.950 
background noises or anything other than
that<00:02:40.780> I<00:02:41.020> just<00:02:41.340> get<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.490> the<00:02:42.610> instructions

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
that I just get to the instructions

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.810 
that I just get to the instructions
once<00:02:45.960> you've<00:02:46.140> unboxed<00:02:46.710> at<00:02:46.830> you<00:02:47.070> connect<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.580> to

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
once you've unboxed at you connect it to

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.090 
once you've unboxed at you connect it to
