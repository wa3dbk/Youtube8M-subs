00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
go back to the old way so I don't think

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.810 
go back to the old way so I don't think
all<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.620> fans<00:02:43.830> also<00:02:44.070> know<00:02:44.340> what<00:02:44.460> they<00:02:44.580> want

know<00:02:47.880> what<00:02:47.970> they<00:02:48.060> want<00:02:48.180> but<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.450> chemistry

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
actual kill streak called in so I think

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.629 
actual kill streak called in so I think
I'm<00:04:52.229> actually<00:04:52.379> in<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.860> minority<00:04:53.069> in<00:04:53.400> that

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
I'm actually in the minority in that

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.159 
I'm actually in the minority in that
opinion<00:04:53.849> that<00:04:54.060> I<00:04:54.180> think<00:04:54.419> nuclear<00:04:54.569> is<00:04:54.900> kind<00:04:55.139> of

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
opinion that I think nuclear is kind of

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:56.089 
opinion that I think nuclear is kind of
nice<00:04:55.259> compared<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.710> that<00:04:55.800> Counter<00:04:56.039> Strike

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
nice compared to that Counter Strike

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:57.409 
nice compared to that Counter Strike
because<00:04:56.400> something<00:04:56.669> about<00:04:56.759> it<00:04:57.090> just<00:04:57.270> seems
