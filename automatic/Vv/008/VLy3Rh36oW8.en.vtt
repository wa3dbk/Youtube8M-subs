00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.990
 I'm going to show you how to make pacifiers for 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.960
 a decoration of villaguay a 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:12.620
 decoration for a baby with balloons with 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.180
 example today let's take first are 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.000
 long balloons 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.870
 those are 260 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.870
 how to think it 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.849
 maximum 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.300
 there 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:34.200
 we are high 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.200
 do not 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.760
 let's inflate four balloons of 5 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.760
 inches 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.590
 [Music] 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.010
 Hello 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.109
 we do the same again 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.110
 same 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.110
 we are with each other 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.440
 we make two pieces 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.370
 we will make a balloon 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.120
 with helium 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.120
 11 inches 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.090
 and then we are going to do it 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.090
 this rule 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.880
 directly from we access all 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.420
 two 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.420
 then we put every part 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.549
 i 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.909
 and then what we do later a 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.909
 appointment 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.550
 they are very beautiful 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.009
 [Music] 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.070
 how can 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.090
 but a little more shape 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.900
 let's go here 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.900
 and it will not be 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.580
 Y 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.660
 let's do is put together another other rose 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.760
 with another technique the balloon technique 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.460
 inside another balloon already covered 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.880
 He showed our videos after double 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:26.010
 so that something is different 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.010
 first at home inside 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.130
 we have outside 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.430
 ah 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.810
 quite 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.770
 peak 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.230
 and we put him 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.630
 in the middle 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.020
 this technique we give ourselves 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.240
 I started this boy and dogs 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.280
 good to get an entry from a mini 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.280
 shower 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.220
 8 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.819
 can use in simple technique and they are 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.819
 good ones
