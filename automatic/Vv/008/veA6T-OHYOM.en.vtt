00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.040 
I'd was rocks to go on the bottom but
that<00:02:18.760> may<00:02:18.879> not<00:02:18.910> be<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.300> problem<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:19.720> may<00:02:19.810> drain

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
that may not be a problem it may drain

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.520 
that may not be a problem it may drain
just<00:02:20.319> fine<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:21.099> I<00:02:21.340> have<00:02:21.760> four<00:02:22.090> of<00:02:22.209> these<00:02:22.530> I'm

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
just fine so I have four of these I'm

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.160 
just fine so I have four of these I'm
thinking<00:02:24.010> about<00:02:24.190> putting<00:02:27.420> three<00:02:28.420> rhizomes<00:02:28.959> of

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
thinking about putting three rhizomes of

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.740 
thinking about putting three rhizomes of
her<00:02:29.410> I<00:02:29.739> think<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.760> can<00:02:30.910> fit<00:02:31.030> those<00:02:31.180> diagonal<00:02:31.660> if

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
her I think I can fit those diagonal if

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.729 
her I think I can fit those diagonal if
it<00:02:31.900> were<00:02:31.989> second<00:02:32.319> here<00:02:32.410> I<00:02:32.470> definitely

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
it were second here I definitely

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:33.750 
it were second here I definitely
wouldn't<00:02:32.980> do<00:02:33.069> that<00:02:33.099> those<00:02:33.400> would<00:02:33.489> be<00:02:33.580> in<00:02:33.670> the

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
wouldn't do that those would be in the

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.920 
wouldn't do that those would be in the
ground<00:02:34.170> but<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:35.230> think<00:02:35.590> this<00:02:35.680> is<00:02:35.739> going<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:36.010> work

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
ground but I think this is going to work

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.770 
ground but I think this is going to work
so<00:02:37.930> once<00:02:38.410> again<00:02:38.530> there<00:02:39.069> is<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.519> height<00:02:40.450> I<00:02:40.480> have

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
so once again there is the height I have

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.680 
so once again there is the height I have
to<00:02:40.900> work<00:02:41.049> with<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:42.700> we<00:02:43.209> need<00:02:43.330> to<00:02:43.420> put<00:02:43.540> some

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
to work with and we need to put some

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.870 
to work with and we need to put some
more<00:02:43.750> I<00:02:43.810> hooks<00:02:44.110> but<00:02:44.319> that<00:02:44.560> will<00:02:44.769> be<00:02:44.799> it<00:02:45.670> will<00:02:45.730> be

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
more I hooks but that will be it will be

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.390 
more I hooks but that will be it will be
for<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.090> while<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.329> know<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:47.130> it's<00:02:48.130> probably

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
for a while you know I it's probably

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.620 
for a while you know I it's probably
going<00:02:48.549> to<00:02:48.610> be<00:02:48.670> at<00:02:49.060> least<00:02:49.090> a<00:02:49.329> month<00:02:49.569> before

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
going to be at least a month before

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.970 
going to be at least a month before
these<00:02:50.019> get<00:02:50.230> up<00:02:50.319> to<00:02:50.440> where<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:50.590> need<00:02:50.769> start

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
these get up to where I need start

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.400 
these get up to where I need start
training<00:02:51.340> them<00:02:51.400> on<00:02:51.519> some<00:02:51.790> 20<00:02:52.390> so<00:02:52.690> today's

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
training them on some 20 so today's

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.509 
training them on some 20 so today's
planting<00:02:53.860> day<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.220> I<00:02:54.819> will<00:02:55.209> have<00:02:55.390> an<00:02:55.540> update

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
planting day and I will have an update

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.100 
planting day and I will have an update
as<00:02:57.519> soon<00:02:57.579> as<00:02:57.970> these<00:02:58.090> things<00:02:58.329> actually<00:02:58.810> i'll

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
as soon as these things actually i'll

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.630 
as soon as these things actually i'll
probably<00:02:59.290> update<00:02:59.500> later<00:02:59.769> with<00:03:00.069> how<00:03:00.310> I<00:03:00.340> packed

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
probably update later with how I packed

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.490 
probably update later with how I packed
them<00:03:00.790> in<00:03:00.910> how<00:03:01.090> they<00:03:01.209> look<00:03:01.420> where<00:03:01.989> I<00:03:02.019> position

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
them in how they look where I position

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.119 
them in how they look where I position
them<00:03:02.650> in<00:03:02.769> the<00:03:02.829> backyard<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:04.739> then<00:03:05.739> i<00:03:05.769> will

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
them in the backyard and then i will

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.250 
them in the backyard and then i will
update<00:03:06.370> again<00:03:06.790> when<00:03:07.450> they<00:03:07.540> start<00:03:07.780> popping<00:03:08.140> out

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
update again when they start popping out

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.299 
update again when they start popping out
of<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.470> dirt<00:03:08.650> so<00:03:09.190> stay<00:03:10.120> tuned
