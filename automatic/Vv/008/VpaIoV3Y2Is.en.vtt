00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:16.349
 went completely preseason by myself 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.880
 Well, I am 90% satisfied there already 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.470
 will continue to depend on the coach now 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.960
 we go to the server magnitogorsk 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.880
 I will try to prove there first 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.480
 workouts there you can say the first two 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.810
 weeks in khl it was very hard there 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.940
 cost others there is no time 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.400
 think there too much like there mikhail 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.659
 the towers could play somewhere on the pause 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.629
 here quickly eats and then when already 

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:46.260
 practice a month or two, then calmly 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.049
 it only remains to add your own 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.479
 how would criteria there I would not be so 

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:53.689
 what is it like to myself everything is manly I 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:57.089
 never really need any help 

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:58.890
 but I can say that communicating with everyone with 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:02.010
 veterans of foreigners can 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.070
 poked around as if with vital cheap 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.030
 Well there we communicate with Oleg veil than 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.590
 through the type but I would not say that I am there 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.020
 some kind of super these starved something 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.920
 only by 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.500
 performance through execution 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.970
 tasks 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.479
 supposedly from his style of play not 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.429
 refuse aggressively 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:26.369
 help towers if they fear injury 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:28.430
 its meaning is the further you are afraid of 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.470
 you get more for 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.060
 foreign music meets deron Quint 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.090
 vitali put me in charge 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.159
 Russian music, I would leave it there 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.590
 more such calm composition then me 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.470
 like there everyone there is pizza degrees 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.430
 such music as everyone listens well 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.310
 shansonchik can 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.470
 dress rehearsal for the season will be 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.869
 strumming those schemes that strumming 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.759
 in training would work them out what 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.329
 even practiced already perform because 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:02.020
 what is already about the seasons you need already 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.250
 perform as if I do not know every game 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.210
 we will definitely play on the surface 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.210
 could not do otherwise
