00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
they didn't cut it out because it was

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.289 
they didn't cut it out because it was
clearly<00:02:44.439> unfinished<00:02:45.189> pretty<00:02:45.849> sure<00:02:46.030> they<00:02:46.150> ran

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
clearly unfinished pretty sure they ran

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.640 
clearly unfinished pretty sure they ran
on<00:02:46.450> a<00:02:46.480> budget<00:02:46.689> in<00:02:46.900> that<00:02:47.079> movie<00:02:47.379> that's<00:02:47.530> what

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
on a budget in that movie that's what

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.979 
on a budget in that movie that's what
happened<00:02:47.980> but<00:02:48.099> it<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.939> style<00:02:49.299> of<00:02:49.599> the<00:02:49.780> halt

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
happened but it the style of the halt

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.949 
happened but it the style of the halt
looks<00:02:50.409> like<00:02:50.620> that<00:02:50.859> one<00:02:51.209> it<00:02:52.209> doesn't<00:02:52.599> much<00:02:52.689> look

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
looks like that one it doesn't much look

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.199 
looks like that one it doesn't much look
like<00:02:53.169> the<00:02:53.319> most<00:02:53.500> recent<00:02:53.980> Hulk<00:02:54.609> movie<00:02:54.909> which

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
like the most recent Hulk movie which

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.009 
like the most recent Hulk movie which
had<00:02:55.359> really<00:02:55.810> good<00:02:55.930> cg<00:02:56.349> um<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:57.790> CG<00:02:58.359> on<00:02:58.510> Iron<00:02:58.780> Man

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019

off type action movie nothing to

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:36.640 
off type action movie nothing to
psychological<00:04:35.139> but<00:04:36.139> I<00:04:36.169> definitely<00:04:36.319> looks

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
psychological but I definitely looks

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.110 
psychological but I definitely looks
like<00:04:36.680> it's<00:04:36.860> going<00:04:36.979> to<00:04:37.009> be<00:04:37.189> a<00:04:37.400> lot<00:04:37.789> of<00:04:37.849> fun<00:04:38.060> i

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
like it's going to be a lot of fun i

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.760 
like it's going to be a lot of fun i
didn't<00:04:38.360> say<00:04:38.449> my<00:04:38.599> last<00:04:38.689> but<00:04:38.930> i<00:04:38.960> think<00:04:39.259> that<00:04:39.289> the

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
didn't say my last but i think that the

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.200 
didn't say my last but i think that the
bad<00:04:39.919> man<00:04:40.069> probably<00:04:40.310> better<00:04:40.610> and<00:04:40.789> i<00:04:40.849> still

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
bad man probably better and i still

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.390 
bad man probably better and i still
think<00:04:41.389> it<00:04:41.539> probably<00:04:41.810> will<00:04:42.050> be<00:04:42.110> but<00:04:42.830> obviously

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
think it probably will be but obviously

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.939 
think it probably will be but obviously

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.279 
enough action in them I thought the Thor
had<00:05:55.669> good<00:05:55.849> amount<00:05:56.060> of<00:05:56.120> action<00:05:56.539> the<00:05:57.050> first

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 
had good amount of action the first

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:58.809 
had good amount of action the first
Ironman<00:05:57.740> while<00:05:57.919> the<00:05:58.039> Iron<00:05:58.250> Man's<00:05:58.520> have<00:05:58.699> had

00:05:58.809 --> 00:05:58.819 
Ironman while the Iron Man's have had

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:00.309 
Ironman while the Iron Man's have had
good<00:05:58.969> action<00:05:59.330> but<00:05:59.479> Captain<00:05:59.810> America<00:06:00.050> didn't

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319 
good action but Captain America didn't

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:02.110 
good action but Captain America didn't
have<00:06:00.439> enough<00:06:00.649> action<00:06:01.009> in<00:06:01.159> it<00:06:01.279> I<00:06:01.399> really<00:06:02.029> hope

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
have enough action in it I really hope

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.700 
have enough action in it I really hope
they<00:06:02.330> don't<00:06:02.509> cheap<00:06:02.810> out<00:06:02.990> on<00:06:03.050> the<00:06:03.259> action<00:06:03.409> in

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
they don't cheap out on the action in

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.679 
they don't cheap out on the action in
this<00:06:03.830> I<00:06:04.069> hope<00:06:04.520> there<00:06:04.699> are<00:06:04.819> good<00:06:05.149> amounts<00:06:05.599> of
