the dark I pulled this up to 25600 on
the<00:01:50.100> ISO<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.939> was<00:01:51.299> very<00:01:51.600> impressed<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
the ISO and was very impressed the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.460 
the ISO and was very impressed the
photographs<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.220> took<00:01:53.399> with<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:54.470> looked

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
photographs that I took with it looked

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.260 
photographs that I took with it looked
like<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.799> was<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> bright<00:01:56.219> sunny<00:01:56.430> day<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:57.060> it's

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
like it was a bright sunny day and it's

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.139 
like it was a bright sunny day and it's
far<00:01:57.570> from<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.259> burst<00:01:59.040> mode<00:01:59.219> it's<00:01:59.700> highly

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
far from it in burst mode it's highly

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.679 
far from it in burst mode it's highly
efficient<00:02:00.829> but<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:01.950> takes<00:02:02.189> typical<00:02:03.149> time<00:02:03.390> for

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
efficient but it takes typical time for

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.869 
efficient but it takes typical time for
it<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.810> process<00:02:04.649> them<00:02:04.890> but<00:02:05.689> yeah

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:49.919 
video and again impressive on both

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.189 
video and again impressive on both
counts<00:02:50.129> so<00:02:50.879> if<00:02:51.000> you're<00:02:51.150> an<00:02:51.239> old<00:02:51.359> shaky<00:02:51.780> grandpa

counts so if you're an old shaky grandpa

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:54.770 
counts so if you're an old shaky grandpa
it's<00:02:52.469> going<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.709> work<00:02:52.829> for<00:02:53.069> you<00:02:53.480> in<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.599> really

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
it's going to work for you in a really

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.800 
it's going to work for you in a really
obvious<00:02:55.049> I<00:02:55.500> think<00:02:55.889> this<00:02:56.010> is<00:02:56.449> ideally<00:02:57.449> suited

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
obvious I think this is ideally suited

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.429 
obvious I think this is ideally suited
towards<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.829> professional<00:02:59.639> consumer<00:03:00.629> so<00:03:01.409> a

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
towards a professional consumer so a

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:04.179 
towards a professional consumer so a
high-end<00:03:01.949> amateur<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.939> I<00:03:03.150> imagine<00:03:03.750> that

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:04.189 
high-end amateur and I imagine that

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:06.379 
high-end amateur and I imagine that
somebody<00:03:05.189> with<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.489> good<00:03:05.699> degree<00:03:05.849> of<00:03:06.090> skill

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
somebody with a good degree of skill

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.110 
somebody with a good degree of skill
would<00:03:07.079> be<00:03:07.260> able<00:03:07.409> to<00:03:07.500> utilize<00:03:07.680> these<00:03:08.669> aspects

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
would be able to utilize these aspects

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.509 
would be able to utilize these aspects
it's<00:03:09.419> maybe<00:03:09.750> not<00:03:09.870> professional<00:03:10.650> but<00:03:11.219> again

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
it's maybe not professional but again

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.280 
it's maybe not professional but again
there's<00:03:11.909> no<00:03:12.060> reason<00:03:12.359> why<00:03:12.480> this<00:03:12.540> can't<00:03:12.900> be<00:03:13.139> in

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
there's no reason why this can't be in

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.240 
there's no reason why this can't be in
the<00:03:13.650> Quebec<00:03:14.060> favorite<00:03:15.060> feature<00:03:15.299> so<00:03:15.659> far<00:03:16.189> can<00:03:17.189> I
