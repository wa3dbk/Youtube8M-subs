00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.769 

these<00:00:05.009> plants<00:00:05.549> are<00:00:05.640> absolutely<00:00:06.240> thriving

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
these plants are absolutely thriving

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.290 
these plants are absolutely thriving
here<00:00:07.080> but<00:00:07.259> there's<00:00:07.529> no<00:00:08.099> Sun<00:00:08.370> no<00:00:08.580> soil<00:00:08.880> that's

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
here but there's no Sun no soil that's

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.370 
here but there's no Sun no soil that's
right<00:00:09.559> so<00:00:10.559> how<00:00:10.650> do<00:00:10.710> we<00:00:10.800> do<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.870> we<00:00:12.870> the

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
right so how do we do that we the

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.499 
right so how do we do that we the
technical<00:00:13.950> group<00:00:14.160> that<00:00:14.429> came<00:00:15.150> up<00:00:15.210> with<00:00:15.389> this

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
technical group that came up with this

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.599 
technical group that came up with this
idea<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.929> begin<00:00:16.080> with<00:00:16.490> determined<00:00:17.490> that

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
idea to begin with determined that

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.250 
idea to begin with determined that
plants<00:00:18.060> only<00:00:18.240> need<00:00:18.449> two<00:00:18.660> wavelengths<00:00:19.199> of

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
plants only need two wavelengths of

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.250 
plants only need two wavelengths of
light<00:00:19.460> blue<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.670> red<00:00:20.820> that's<00:00:21.630> chlorophyll<00:00:22.140> a

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
light blue and red that's chlorophyll a

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.380 
light blue and red that's chlorophyll a
and<00:00:22.289> B<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:23.279> that's<00:00:23.460> that's<00:00:23.730> basically<00:00:24.240> what

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
and B so that's that's basically what

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.230 
and B so that's that's basically what
drives<00:00:24.810> plants<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.380> grow<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:26.310> you've<00:00:27.210> got

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
drives plants to grow so you've got

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.810 
drives plants to grow so you've got
artificial<00:00:27.840> sunlight<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.830> specializes<00:00:29.789> in

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
artificial sunlight that specializes in

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.600 
artificial sunlight that specializes in
what<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.150> plants<00:00:30.480> need<00:00:30.660> only<00:00:30.949> now<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.009> second

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
what the plants need only now the second

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.770 
what the plants need only now the second
problem<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:33.059> how<00:00:33.270> do<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.390> get<00:00:33.510> rid<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.660> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
problem is how do you get rid of the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.200 
problem is how do you get rid of the
soil<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.430> actually<00:00:35.430> what<00:00:35.579> soil<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.180> a

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
soil and actually what soil is is a

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.780 
soil and actually what soil is is a
matrix<00:00:36.649> it's<00:00:37.649> not<00:00:37.829> actually<00:00:38.219> eaten<00:00:38.579> by<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
matrix it's not actually eaten by the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.790 
matrix it's not actually eaten by the
plants<00:00:39.300> what<00:00:39.719> they<00:00:39.870> do<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.079> they<00:00:40.320> suck<00:00:40.620> up

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
plants what they do is they suck up

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.440 
plants what they do is they suck up
water<00:00:40.829> that's<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.460> between<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.969> particles

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
water that's in between the particles

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.840 
water that's in between the particles
and<00:00:42.570> soil<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.920> soil<00:00:44.160> never<00:00:44.340> disappears

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
and soil so the soil never disappears

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.979 
and soil so the soil never disappears
the<00:00:44.969> water<00:00:45.180> does<00:00:45.390> that's<00:00:45.600> why<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.780> have<00:00:45.899> to

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
the water does that's why you have to

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.200 
the water does that's why you have to
keep<00:00:46.079> watering<00:00:46.350> plants<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.340> here<00:00:47.730> we've

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
keep watering plants so here we've

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.420 
keep watering plants so here we've
included<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.809> nutrients<00:00:49.379> into<00:00:49.920> water<00:00:50.219> and

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
included the nutrients into water and

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.170 
included the nutrients into water and
we've<00:00:51.360> actually<00:00:51.570> watered<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.199> roots<00:00:52.410> and

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
we've actually watered the roots and

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.369 
we've actually watered the roots and
they're<00:00:54.180> perfectly<00:00:54.600> happy<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.989> live<00:00:55.230> like

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
they're perfectly happy to live like

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.459 
they're perfectly happy to live like
this<00:00:55.730> artificial<00:00:56.730> Sun<00:00:57.170> nutrients<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.289> their

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
this artificial Sun nutrients of their

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.709 
this artificial Sun nutrients of their
of<00:00:58.800> our<00:00:59.129> choice<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.730> match<00:00:59.910> exactly<00:01:00.510> what

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
of our choice that match exactly what

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.420 
of our choice that match exactly what
they<00:01:00.870> need<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.890> next<00:01:02.070> thing<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.309> know

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
they need and the next thing you know

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.920 
they need and the next thing you know
you've<00:01:02.579> got<00:01:02.640> plants<00:01:03.090> growing<00:01:03.270> twice<00:01:03.480> as<00:01:03.719> fast

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
you've got plants growing twice as fast

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.109 
you've got plants growing twice as fast
as<00:01:04.140> they<00:01:04.229> do<00:01:04.379> outside<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.010> your<00:01:05.549> vision<00:01:05.820> is

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
as they do outside and your vision is

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.390 
as they do outside and your vision is
you<00:01:06.900> can<00:01:07.080> put<00:01:07.260> stacks<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.799> stacks<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.340> stacks

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
you can put stacks and stacks and stacks

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.609 
you can put stacks and stacks and stacks
of<00:01:08.820> these<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.360> skyscrapers<00:01:10.280> growing<00:01:11.280> food<00:01:11.610> yes

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
of these in skyscrapers growing food yes

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.100 
of these in skyscrapers growing food yes
simple<00:01:13.619> that's<00:01:14.549> that's<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.090> idea<00:01:15.420> hence<00:01:15.630> it's

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
simple that's that's the idea hence it's

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.560 
simple that's that's the idea hence it's
really<00:01:16.409> stupid<00:01:16.680> simple<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:18.000> that's<00:01:18.210> exactly

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
really stupid simple but that's exactly

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.440 
really stupid simple but that's exactly
what<00:01:19.080> we<00:01:19.200> should<00:01:19.229> be<00:01:19.530> doing<00:01:20.299> what<00:01:21.299> are<00:01:21.360> they

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
what we should be doing what are they

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.539 
what we should be doing what are they
using<00:01:21.720> them<00:01:22.020> for<00:01:22.049> here<00:01:22.590> there's<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.340> more

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
using them for here there's a more

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.670 
using them for here there's a more
scientific<00:01:24.180> application<00:01:25.049> for<00:01:25.170> these<00:01:25.290> plants

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
scientific application for these plants

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.700 
scientific application for these plants
that's<00:01:25.860> right<00:01:26.360> this<00:01:27.360> facility<00:01:27.900> specializes

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
that's right this facility specializes

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.719 
that's right this facility specializes
in<00:01:28.740> using<00:01:29.130> plants<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:30.450> produce<00:01:31.189> substances<00:01:32.189> of

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
in using plants to produce substances of

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.170 
in using plants to produce substances of
medical<00:01:33.299> importance<00:01:33.810> for<00:01:34.290> people<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.700> one

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
medical importance for people so in one

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.719 
medical importance for people so in one
case<00:01:36.210> they<00:01:36.750> were<00:01:36.810> using<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.350> plant<00:01:37.650> related<00:01:38.610> to

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
case they were using a plant related to

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.280 
case they were using a plant related to
the<00:01:38.850> tobacco<00:01:39.150> plant<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.750> produce<00:01:39.900> a

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
the tobacco plant to produce a

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.310 
the tobacco plant to produce a
virus-like<00:01:41.060> particle<00:01:42.060> which<00:01:42.720> could<00:01:42.990> be<00:01:43.079> used

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
virus-like particle which could be used

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.789 
virus-like particle which could be used
as<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.590> vaccine<00:01:44.070> against<00:01:44.549> influenza<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.810> h1n1

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
as a vaccine against influenza the h1n1

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.249 
as a vaccine against influenza the h1n1
strain<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.790> influenza<00:01:48.149> which<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.869> very<00:01:49.049> common

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
strain of influenza which is very common

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.960 
strain of influenza which is very common
throughout<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.799> world<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.579> great<00:01:50.820> demand

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
throughout the world is a great demand

throughout the world is a great demand
for<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.329> vaccine<00:01:51.479> very<00:01:52.110> difficult<00:01:52.500> to

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
for the vaccine very difficult to

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.639 
for the vaccine very difficult to
produce<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:53.130> duck<00:01:53.549> eggs<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.060> chicken<00:01:54.360> eggs

get 1500 doses of the virus vaccine very
efficient<00:02:10.410> but<00:02:10.950> they're<00:02:11.099> growing<00:02:11.430> plants<00:02:11.910> for

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
efficient but they're growing plants for

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.800 
efficient but they're growing plants for
science<00:02:13.080> here<00:02:13.410> they<00:02:13.800> are<00:02:13.950> but<00:02:14.790> using<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.540> same

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
science here they are but using the same

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.559 
science here they are but using the same
technology<00:02:16.470> yeah<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:17.099> say<00:02:17.310> we<00:02:17.550> can<00:02:17.730> grow<00:02:17.940> food

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
technology yeah you say we can grow food

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.870 
technology yeah you say we can grow food
for<00:02:18.599> people<00:02:19.010> correcting<00:02:20.010> well<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.459> actually

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
for people correcting well that actually

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.520 
for people correcting well that actually
food<00:02:21.239> for<00:02:21.390> people<00:02:21.510> came<00:02:21.780> first<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.230> then<00:02:22.410> this

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
food for people came first and then this

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.740 
food for people came first and then this
came<00:02:22.769> later<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:23.610> they<00:02:23.760> got<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.150> idea<00:02:24.510> from

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
came later so they got the idea from

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.809 
came later so they got the idea from
looking<00:02:25.140> at<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.380> way<00:02:25.500> high-tech<00:02:26.430> greenhouses

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
looking at the way high-tech greenhouses

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.380 
looking at the way high-tech greenhouses
already<00:02:27.510> produce<00:02:27.750> food<00:02:28.170> for<00:02:28.200> people<00:02:28.530> now<00:02:29.250> the

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
already produce food for people now the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.270 
already produce food for people now the
biggest<00:02:30.390> jump<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.440> make<00:02:31.620> this<00:02:31.799> into<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.069> tall

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
biggest jump is to make this into a tall

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.059 
biggest jump is to make this into a tall
building<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.750> that's<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.470> can<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:34.920> be<00:02:35.040> done

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
building and that's it can it be done

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.009 
building and that's it can it be done
it's<00:02:35.700> already<00:02:35.970> been<00:02:36.150> done<00:02:36.330> so<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.720> answer<00:02:36.750> is

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
it's already been done so the answer is

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.140 
it's already been done so the answer is
yes<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.590> can<00:02:37.769> be<00:02:37.950> done<00:02:38.130> and<00:02:38.340> it's<00:02:38.670> being<00:02:38.910> done

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
yes it can be done and it's being done

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.020 
yes it can be done and it's being done
in<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.420> will<00:02:39.510> be<00:02:39.630> done<00:02:39.750> more<00:02:40.049> as<00:02:40.819> the<00:02:41.819> years

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
in it will be done more as the years

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.670 
in it will be done more as the years
progress<00:02:42.269> I<00:02:42.630> think<00:02:42.660> in<00:02:42.959> another<00:02:43.080> five<00:02:43.440> years

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
progress I think in another five years

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.130 
progress I think in another five years
from<00:02:43.799> now<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.670> answer<00:02:44.880> won't<00:02:45.030> be<00:02:45.239> can<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:45.930> be

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
from now the answer won't be can it be

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.410 
from now the answer won't be can it be
done<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:47.130> won't<00:02:47.370> even<00:02:47.489> mean<00:02:47.670> where<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:48.060> can<00:02:48.299> be

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
done it won't even mean where it can be

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.199 
done it won't even mean where it can be
done<00:02:48.599> it'll<00:02:49.230> be<00:02:49.349> G<00:02:50.069> can<00:02:50.549> I<00:02:50.610> go<00:02:50.730> visit<00:02:50.760> one<00:02:51.180> of

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
done it'll be G can I go visit one of
