00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.150
 It is each one who killed well 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.029
 Marauder hates 8 o when wearing it 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:15.029
 It's a good time for Akira Katakura 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:17.570
 ja Itoshima 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.619
 Even now another compilation series scheme may not be relevant though 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.550
 Remote island 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.679
 At first we talked to the field 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.679
 The club and science will change at all 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.789
 Important se 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.510
 But really 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.050
 I laughed if I try my best this time for blindness 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.680
 This 1.6 billion yen 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.330
 Somewhere 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.330
 I have a pocket 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.110
 End 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.640
 other than this 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.720
 under 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.370
 Japan system was 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.670
 Told at the conference 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.090
 Other battles 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.399
 nfl has already been sold 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.239
 Phillies' Inoue Iguchi infielder hit a 2 match against Nationals 

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:22.239
 Nobuto Iguchi of the Phillies 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.880
 Wish 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.150
 Wish 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.020
 No two 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.020
 The wish did not come true 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.790
 Wish 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:23.559
 Goodbye win 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:37.829
 1148 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.829
 Middle strike 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:57.309
 But 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:00.309
 Joint 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:10.569
 url 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.189
 Significantly lower 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:16.189
 f1 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.849
 End 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:28.469
 But 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:36.769
 waiting 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.769
 morning's 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.309
 New 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:46.309
 Beach value is 1 hit 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:49.329
 However 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.689
 Like 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:54.780
 ett it's now am 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.780
 It became a song to the right from one station 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.099
 eh 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.200
 It is speed It is called speed 127 points 278 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.929
 Although it is bpm 

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:07.329
 Well 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:08.519
 But it has become 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.379
 But 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:11.689
 Actually 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:14.849
 It's a record 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.389
 It is also so 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.659
 It's true that I hear the speed properly here 

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:20.539
 And 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.919
 I'm waiting outside that pitch 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.960
 Safety Controller 1 This is the controller. 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.779
 It is a sense of speed area 

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:31.119
 On the other hand, I have to play together 

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:33.040
 The work is endless 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.979
 I think I can shoot 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.039
 Upper flight convenient 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.080
 Yes it feels like it's a beginner 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.080
 I feel that the yen is after 10 o'clock 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.639
 Of course, even those who put together the power I heard with that ear 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:48.580
 Great 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.409
 Important 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:52.580
 Nothing important 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.090
 The important point of the presence or absence of bondi 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.819
 But why not 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:01.879
 I want to see in the school zone in the beginning of the play 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.900
 I have not been there for 24 days 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.300
 For example 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.180
 There were all the songs in the station and the number of people, but I went there 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.180
 I would like to have a play with Lee 

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:19.550
 Very useful 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.999
 I think that is great as the entrance of the villa 

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:25.400
 Maybe not 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.879
 It's like that 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:29.969
 It is putt 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:31.699
 An effector 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.849
 decreased 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:35.080
 How to use 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.699
 Even if it is a cheap form, the thing called hectare can be used but decadan 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:39.949
 Terry to do 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:41.809
 So what is this? 

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:43.849
 What is the effector 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:46.009
 There are many people who don't understand 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:47.830
 So to explain 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.969
 The most familiar effector is 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:54.069
 I do not know whether it is closest 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:58.210
 It's not there karaoke box karaoke 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.210
 Dias Kodera is engaged and that 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:05.169
 Therefore when you buy or hang out with something high you are talking in the bath 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.169
 It sounds like it sounds like 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.129
 The voiceless voice changes 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:16.129
 It's also a messy steel 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:19.659
 I wonder what will be done 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:23.259
 I think 8otto 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:27.439
 It is a feeling that what changes the stranger 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:30.949
 At the site in the different dimension world 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.900
 Nanjing 

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:40.319
 Rather than just changing from the next side 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:44.960
 I want to heat up the mood of the people who are taking a break 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.430
 Steel framed to express obise's view of the world 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.639
 Runn 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.139
 For example 8 here 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:55.360
 This is the sector, but one shot 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.360
 Allo Parts High Pass Band Pass 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:01.599
 Phaser success 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:03.110
 There are many 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.009
 eco2 

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:06.349
 wet 

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:08.879
 I do not like it 

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:11.689
 Because the game of eco-rahara will be long 

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:14.689
 Please study for yourself during winter, for now 

00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:20.419
 It will change over and it will become a disqualifying judge 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:23.080
 Not 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.080
 I just do what I do 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.180
 I don't care 

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.300
 Squid grilled a little in red 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.749
 A little exciting 

00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:33.999
 Someday 

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:36.919
 It is cool to do from the first shoot Thursday 

00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:40.080
 It became a target from this area 

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:45.520
 Fujian 

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:50.159
 Green onion 

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:56.690
 Afternoon hole opens
