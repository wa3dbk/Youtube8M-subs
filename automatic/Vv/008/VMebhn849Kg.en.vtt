 drug world publisher which is 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.420

 localizers in Russia new disc game 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.829
 was in general 2008 in the genre of action and 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.010
 announced as a sandbox which 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.629
 surpass Ukraine gta well so as not to 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.000
 reveal all her trumps let's 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.170
 let's see the developers from the very beginning 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.690
 tell us that the game was made 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.149
 zoo well or based on the transfer to 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.370
 animal world with nicholas drazdovym and who 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.829
 knows maybe grandfather indulges than before 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.039
 that looks at all the birds and bugs 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.379
 and after another lag saver we 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.869
 we fall into the menu which is not at all 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.360
 I want to watch the way in the topic of drugs 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.860
 yet put on the front of bumaro but a little 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.050
 I'll give you a chance later 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.050
 original sound design from the game 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.830
 force in low resolution shitty 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.780
 quality I think if you want something 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.670
 look listen yourself but if 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.679
 in short the plot then appears some 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.569
 new lakota cycle that turns into 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.160
 10 minutes of terminators and our task 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:34.179
 the main character prevent it all 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.069
 nightmare disaster and the first mission to us 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:37.119
 immediately show the capabilities of the military 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:39.220
 shooting in the game 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.319
 the gun does not run out of ammo full 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.630
 auto spot no pulse spread 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:45.610
 shooting don't want after passing this 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.310

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.229
 but immediately to the promised sandbox and our 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.170
 Dvas pleases you fucking hell knows where 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.479

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.959
 at least for this moment 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.500
 after training is given to us 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.450
 the right to pass tedious not really 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.460

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.900
 number of species such as crack cocaine 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.360
 ecstasy and LSD marijuana speeds hashish and 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.940
 others, and at the reception they have 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.450
 their action which ones accelerate 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.450
 character 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.549

 where music just plays and everything floats 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.349
 green paper 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:44.599
 but 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:48.049
 and the chicken coop itself on the lane and smiles 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:04:01.190
 bite a roll 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:04:15.680
 well there is still a search division 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:17.389
 Nark that it is shorter designed know 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.979
 sense in this matter and campaign still themselves 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.910
 used when they created it 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:24.530
 drug advocates long ago instead 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.050
 secretive movement character 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:32.240
 uses a brilliant stealth move he 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:33.979
 disguised as doctor zoe calculate 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.350
 drug addict or gangster on the streets 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.690
 easy enough is 99 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.699
 percent men 99 percent women 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.560

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:48.470
 slacking off that recognize all this shit 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:50.360
 who of what sex and generally half an hour 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.430
 the game begins to appear that 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.680
 slowly get crazy after an hour of this 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.970
 delusions can start to find foam from my mouth i 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.520

 what is happening on the screen 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.770

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.539
 I sympathize with the possible and interesting to take 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.220
 addict and drug control figs I know 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:21.669
