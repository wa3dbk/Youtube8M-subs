00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.750
 in proportion you can see 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.880
 Yenir 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.410
 here it won the fatimids sound 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.220
 how you do not want to achieve Th 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.240
 I just remember putting all the servants 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.420
 to my 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.490
 places and make work 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.500
 unfairly different worlds attitude 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:31.790
 patient steps again and 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.790
 heard us our what we decided 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.920
 stay 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.590
 one 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.810
 absolute 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.200
 So 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.200
 except sphere 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.370
 also need 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.980
 participant 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.150
 but 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.150
 in personal good print 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:30.600
 and sunbathe business cove look like this 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.600
 was the most valuable remark 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.770
 nothing will open tatyana everyone will notice 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.630
 slightly this 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.229
 persuasiveness 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.409
 same 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.600
 that's why 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.400
 nice well that was 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.400
 did not pass 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.120
 because 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.250
 can be passed last 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.500
 keep it up no 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.099
 here 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.680
 lucky 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.360
 not 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.610
 write protection 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.580
 here 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.599
 I need to see us here 1 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:16.379
 that's why I was here at 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:16.379
 I walk the sea and then we are a physicist
