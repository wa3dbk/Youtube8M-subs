00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
to note about this unit guys is that it

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.279 
to note about this unit guys is that it
has<00:00:29.189> 1,000<00:00:30.150> bravery<00:00:30.599> as<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.929> can<00:00:31.080> see<00:00:31.260> right

has 1,000 bravery as you can see right

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.680 
has 1,000 bravery as you can see right
here<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:32.309> means<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.790> unit<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.239> very

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
here this means that the unit is very

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.410 
here this means that the unit is very
very<00:00:34.110> very<00:00:34.500> unlikely<00:00:35.040> almost<00:00:35.520> impossible<00:00:36.270> to

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
very very unlikely almost impossible to

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.090 
very very unlikely almost impossible to
be<00:00:36.510> suppressed<00:00:36.960> now<00:00:37.590> if<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.770> don't<00:00:37.890> know<00:00:38.010> what

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
be suppressed now if you don't know what

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.830 
be suppressed now if you don't know what
suppress<00:00:38.489> means<00:00:38.790> then<00:00:39.300> you're<00:00:39.450> kind<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.750> a

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
suppress means then you're kind of a

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.720 
suppress means then you're kind of a
noob<00:00:40.079> but<00:00:40.500> i'll<00:00:40.620> explain<00:00:40.920> anyways<00:00:41.399> it

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
noob but i'll explain anyways it

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.479 
noob but i'll explain anyways it
basically<00:00:42.180> means<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.600> your<00:00:43.100> attacks<00:00:44.100> that

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
basically means that your attacks that

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.880 
basically means that your attacks that
you<00:00:44.670> use<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.120> your<00:00:45.149> units<00:00:45.600> their<00:00:46.170> offense<00:00:46.770> is

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
you use on your units their offense is

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.590 
you use on your units their offense is
lowered<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.610> way<00:00:47.760> they<00:00:48.030> usually<00:00:48.420> get

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
lowered in that way they usually get

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.560 
lowered in that way they usually get
more<00:00:49.590> misses<00:00:50.039> or<00:00:50.219> more<00:00:50.430> dodges<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.210> then<00:00:51.420> they

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
more misses or more dodges and then they

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.209 
more misses or more dodges and then they
just<00:00:51.750> don't<00:00:51.960> do<00:00:52.110> as<00:00:52.320> much<00:00:52.350> damage<00:00:52.559> in

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
just don't do as much damage in

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.520 
just don't do as much damage in
comparison<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.910> what<00:00:54.090> their<00:00:54.270> normal<00:00:54.600> on<00:00:54.809> base

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
comparison to what their normal on base

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.889 
comparison to what their normal on base
offense<00:00:56.039> could<00:00:56.280> do<00:00:56.399> for<00:00:56.640> them<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.690> that's

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
offense could do for them so that's

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.959 
offense could do for them so that's
basically<00:00:58.050> what<00:00:58.469> suppression<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.160> now<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.879> is

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
basically what suppression is now it is

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.880 
basically what suppression is now it is
a<00:01:00.000> blocking<00:01:00.480> unit<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.989> does<00:01:01.440> have<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.649> cool-down

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
a blocking unit it does have a cool-down

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.280 
a blocking unit it does have a cool-down
of<00:01:02.190> 7<00:01:02.489> which<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.670> kind<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.059> unfortunate<00:01:03.290> since

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
of 7 which is kind of unfortunate since

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.740 
of 7 which is kind of unfortunate since
it<00:01:04.890> takes<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.189> long<00:01:05.339> while<00:01:05.400> for<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.479> cool

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
it takes a long while for that to cool

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.690 
it takes a long while for that to cool
down<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.200> then<00:01:07.260> r<00:01:07.350> attack<00:01:07.710> again<00:01:08.040> but<00:01:08.549> that's

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
down and then r attack again but that's

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.179 
down and then r attack again but that's
alright<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.810> does<00:01:09.990> have<00:01:10.170> dotd<00:01:10.830> image<00:01:11.040> of

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
alright it does have dotd image of

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.910 
alright it does have dotd image of
poison<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.880> it's<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.330> 55<00:01:12.810> five<00:01:13.290> percent<00:01:13.740> chance

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
poison and it's a 55 five percent chance

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.149 
poison and it's a 55 five percent chance
of<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.220> which<00:01:14.760> can<00:01:14.939> do<00:01:15.030> from<00:01:15.330> 131<00:01:16.170> 244<00:01:16.799> damage

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
of that which can do from 131 244 damage

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.370 
of that which can do from 131 244 damage
and<00:01:17.400> that's<00:01:18.000> can<00:01:18.360> last<00:01:18.659> up<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.900> three<00:01:19.200> turns

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
and that's can last up to three turns

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.350 
and that's can last up to three turns
now<00:01:20.189> what's<00:01:20.340> really<00:01:20.549> interesting<00:01:20.820> about<00:01:21.090> this

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
now what's really interesting about this

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.230 
now what's really interesting about this
unit<00:01:21.689> guys<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.409> it's<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:23.520> can<00:01:23.759> be<00:01:23.850> ranked

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
unit guys is that it's it can be ranked

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.940 
unit guys is that it's it can be ranked
up<00:01:24.330> pretty<00:01:24.720> easily<00:01:24.960> like<00:01:25.409> looking<00:01:25.710> at<00:01:25.830> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
up pretty easily like looking at the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.030 
up pretty easily like looking at the
stats<00:01:26.159> right<00:01:26.430> now<00:01:26.580> arm<00:01:27.140> it<00:01:28.140> only<00:01:28.350> costs<00:01:28.829> around

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
stats right now arm it only costs around

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.710 
stats right now arm it only costs around
13<00:01:30.320> KSP<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.650> get<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.430> rheank<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.850> which<00:01:33.570> is

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
13 KSP to get it to rheank to which is

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.499 
13 KSP to get it to rheank to which is
actually<00:01:33.869> pretty<00:01:34.200> small<00:01:34.530> concerning<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.509> bunch

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
actually pretty small concerning a bunch

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.960 
actually pretty small concerning a bunch
of<00:01:36.630> other<00:01:36.750> units<00:01:37.110> require<00:01:37.380> way<00:01:37.710> more<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.400> that

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
of other units require way more and that

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.270 
of other units require way more and that
this<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.329> boss<00:01:39.570> drop<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.170> it's<00:01:40.710> just<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.040> very

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
this is a boss drop and it's just a very

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.249 
this is a boss drop and it's just a very
great<00:01:41.579> unit<00:01:41.939> because<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.899> all<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.049> its

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
great unit because of all of its

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.139 
great unit because of all of its
immunities<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.829> what<00:01:44.130> as<00:01:44.310> well<00:01:44.579> it's<00:01:44.850> immune

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
immunities of what as well it's immune

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.999 
immunities of what as well it's immune
to<00:01:45.329> basically<00:01:45.720> everything<00:01:46.350> if<00:01:46.950> not

you a few battles just um show off what

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.569 
you a few battles just um show off what
this<00:01:51.930> can<00:01:52.110> do<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.369> show<00:01:53.549> a

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
this can do so just to show a

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.359 
this can do so just to show a
side-by-side<00:01:53.909> comparison<00:01:54.270> um<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.219> egg

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
side-by-side comparison um that the egg

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.830 
side-by-side comparison um that the egg
is<00:01:56.610> really<00:01:56.820> match<00:01:56.969> up<00:01:57.000> against<00:01:57.540> we're<00:01:57.719> just

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
is really match up against we're just

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.359 
is really match up against we're just
going<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.049> show<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.350> electric<00:01:58.770> fence<00:01:58.979> here

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
going to show the electric fence here

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.789 
going to show the electric fence here
now<00:01:59.850> they're<00:02:00.000> both<00:02:00.149> very<00:02:00.600> similar<00:02:01.229> both

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
now they're both very similar both

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.190 
now they're both very similar both
attack<00:02:02.189> across<00:02:02.969> three<00:02:03.420> squares<00:02:03.750> right<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.110> the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
attack across three squares right in the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.679 
attack across three squares right in the
front<00:02:04.409> hold<00:02:04.710> their<00:02:04.860> frontline<00:02:05.159> units<00:02:05.310> um<00:02:05.880> they

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
front hold their frontline units um they

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.540 
front hold their frontline units um they
vary<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.079> little<00:02:07.259> bit<00:02:07.409> once<00:02:07.799> tons<00:02:08.129> in<00:02:08.340> one

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
vary a little bit once tons in one

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.339 
vary a little bit once tons in one
poisons<00:02:09.060> but<00:02:09.629> just<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.929> show<00:02:09.959> off<00:02:10.200> their

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
poisons but just to show off their

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.720 
poisons but just to show off their
damages<00:02:10.860> and

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
damages and

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.190 
damages and
just<00:02:11.909> show<00:02:12.180> what<00:02:12.330> they<00:02:12.450> can<00:02:12.480> do<00:02:12.750> compared<00:02:13.110> to

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
just show what they can do compared to

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.449 
just show what they can do compared to
each<00:02:13.319> other<00:02:13.500> i'm<00:02:13.709> just<00:02:13.890> going<00:02:14.069> to<00:02:14.099> show<00:02:14.159> that

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
each other i'm just going to show that

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.410 
each other i'm just going to show that
now<00:02:15.470> so<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.590> egg<00:02:16.739> it<00:02:17.129> does<00:02:17.790> devastating

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
now so the egg it does devastating

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.000 
now so the egg it does devastating
damage<00:02:18.540> against<00:02:18.930> on<00:02:19.080> armored<00:02:19.379> units<00:02:19.739> as<00:02:19.890> you

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
damage against on armored units as you

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.160 
damage against on armored units as you
could<00:02:20.159> see<00:02:20.190> there<00:02:20.519> and<00:02:20.810> then<00:02:21.810> here's<00:02:22.110> the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
could see there and then here's the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.820 
could see there and then here's the
electric<00:02:22.620> fence<00:02:24.140> so<00:02:25.140> as<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.290> can<00:02:25.440> see<00:02:25.590> we<00:02:25.709> had

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
electric fence so as you can see we had

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.410 
electric fence so as you can see we had
some<00:02:26.010> stun<00:02:26.310> there<00:02:26.519> but<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.790> poison<00:02:27.209> from<00:02:27.390> the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
some stun there but the poison from the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.180 
some stun there but the poison from the
egg<00:02:27.629> is<00:02:27.870> very<00:02:28.140> important<00:02:28.620> because<00:02:28.709> that<00:02:28.920> can

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
egg is very important because that can

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.890 
egg is very important because that can
get<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.340> lot<00:02:29.610> more<00:02:29.640> damage<00:02:30.060> if<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.540> just<00:02:30.750> let

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
get a lot more damage if you just let

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.339 
get a lot more damage if you just let
that<00:02:31.019> poison<00:02:31.410> go<00:02:31.560> on<00:02:32.540> both<00:02:33.540> have<00:02:33.750> pretty

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
that poison go on both have pretty

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.289 
that poison go on both have pretty
lengthy<00:02:34.620> cooldowns<00:02:35.280> as<00:02:35.549> you<00:02:35.640> can<00:02:35.790> see<00:02:35.970> here

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
lengthy cooldowns as you can see here

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.210 
lengthy cooldowns as you can see here
the<00:02:36.660> electric<00:02:36.989> fence<00:02:37.170> has<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.709> little<00:02:38.010> bit

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
the electric fence has a little bit

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.240 
the electric fence has a little bit
shorter<00:02:38.400> of<00:02:38.549> a<00:02:38.670> cool<00:02:38.879> down<00:02:39.030> but<00:02:39.900> um<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:41.069> egg

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
shorter of a cool down but um the egg

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.110 
shorter of a cool down but um the egg
and<00:02:41.459> Mac<00:02:41.610> shrink<00:02:42.180> has<00:02:42.569> more<00:02:43.049> HP<00:02:43.799> toll<00:02:44.760> combined

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
and Mac shrink has more HP toll combined

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.569 
and Mac shrink has more HP toll combined
HP<00:02:45.540> than<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.989> electric<00:02:46.560> fence<00:02:46.739> so<00:02:47.430> that's

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
HP than the electric fence so that's

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.339 
HP than the electric fence so that's
just<00:02:47.670> something<00:02:47.819> to<00:02:48.239> note<00:02:48.420> so<00:02:49.230> they're

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
just something to note so they're

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.699 
just something to note so they're
actually<00:02:49.650> pretty<00:02:49.829> similar<00:02:50.190> arm<00:02:51.410> if<00:02:52.410> you<00:02:52.620> were

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
actually pretty similar arm if you were

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.080 
actually pretty similar arm if you were
going<00:02:52.859> to<00:02:52.890> rank<00:02:53.160> up<00:02:53.310> something<00:02:53.819> and<00:02:54.000> you

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
going to rank up something and you

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.580 
going to rank up something and you
didn't<00:02:54.420> have<00:02:54.569> an<00:02:54.690> egg<00:02:54.840> obviously<00:02:55.440> you're

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
didn't have an egg obviously you're

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.380 
didn't have an egg obviously you're
going<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.859> use<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.160> electric<00:02:56.489> fence<00:02:56.700> very

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
going to use the electric fence very

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.220 
going to use the electric fence very
handy<00:02:57.810> unit<00:02:58.140> but<00:02:59.040> um<00:02:59.540> yeah<00:03:00.540> in<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:01.019> ball/strike

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
handy unit but um yeah in a ball/strike

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.500 
handy unit but um yeah in a ball/strike
fight<00:03:01.739> I<00:03:02.010> would<00:03:02.370> just<00:03:02.579> definitely<00:03:03.180> prefer

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
fight I would just definitely prefer

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.970 
fight I would just definitely prefer
this<00:03:03.660> egg<00:03:03.870> mainly<00:03:04.319> because<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:04.590> its<00:03:04.799> many

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
this egg mainly because of its many

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.830 
this egg mainly because of its many
immunities<00:03:05.519> even<00:03:06.239> though<00:03:06.329> the<00:03:06.480> electric

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
immunities even though the electric

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.240 
immunities even though the electric
fence<00:03:06.989> has<00:03:07.230> many<00:03:07.440> immunities<00:03:07.920> it's<00:03:08.129> not

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
fence has many immunities it's not

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.069 
fence has many immunities it's not
immune<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.519> everything<00:03:08.849> unlike<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.660> egg<00:03:09.840> and

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
immune to everything unlike the egg and

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.930 
immune to everything unlike the egg and
the<00:03:10.560> egg<00:03:10.590> cannot<00:03:11.040> be<00:03:11.160> suppressed<00:03:11.489> which<00:03:11.819> is

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
the egg cannot be suppressed which is

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.660 
the egg cannot be suppressed which is
another<00:03:12.239> very<00:03:12.540> good<00:03:12.750> thing<00:03:13.190> plus<00:03:14.190> if<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:14.489> rank

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
another very good thing plus if you rank

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.759 
another very good thing plus if you rank
this<00:03:14.849> egg<00:03:15.060> up<00:03:15.239> a<00:03:15.329> little<00:03:15.569> bit<00:03:15.690> more<00:03:15.959> it's<00:03:16.560> going

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
this egg up a little bit more it's going

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.199 
this egg up a little bit more it's going
to<00:03:16.829> be<00:03:16.889> able<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.190> have<00:03:17.310> more<00:03:17.549> HP<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.060> more

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
to be able to have more HP and more

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.150 
to be able to have more HP and more
armor<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:18.900> it's<00:03:19.290> just<00:03:19.440> overall<00:03:19.799> just<00:03:20.010> going
