00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.459
 Of course we would have that great if he did 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:57.620

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:59.810
 what you can is not what it is and that 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.370

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.260
 happy children who can not do anything 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.880
 but now I'm not saying that 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.150
 children little children there are also 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.130
 twelve-year-old water can say so 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.700

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.329
 still that remained 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.950
 h after the glass has been removed i 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.219
 just noticed the room where you 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.209
 wait that's usually class before that 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:39.560

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:52.310
 down at the laga is quite funny yes 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:54.200
 and that's why we spawn 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:59.480
 and my colleagues are still alive today 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.980
 build the admin shop the gs world need 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.909

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.530
 which itself and as we said plugins us 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:11.359
 we urgently need plugins 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:13.489
 architects also because if you build completely 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:17.150
 can build so well if that is halfway 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:19.239
 looks like here now then you can 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.699

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.320

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:37.639
