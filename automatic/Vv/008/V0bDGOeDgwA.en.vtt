00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
what I thought when I first saw it I was

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.740 
what I thought when I first saw it I was
like<00:01:50.579> well<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:50.880> looks<00:01:51.270> like<00:01:51.329> Game<00:01:51.630> of

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750

Thrones that was my only thing was like

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.249 
Thrones that was my only thing was like
maybe<00:01:54.060> they<00:01:54.299> should<00:01:54.479> try<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.720> make<00:01:54.899> him<00:01:55.049> look

he<00:02:27.560> looks<00:02:27.740> so<00:02:28.069> badass<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:28.910> you<00:02:29.569> know<00:02:29.690> I<00:02:29.720> I

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
he looks so badass and I you know I I

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.170 
he looks so badass and I you know I I
wasn't<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.739> big<00:02:31.190> reader<00:02:31.430> of<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.700> comic<00:02:32.030> so<00:02:32.120> I

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
wasn't a big reader of the comic so I

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.280 
wasn't a big reader of the comic so I
don't<00:02:32.300> really<00:02:32.420> have<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.630> frame<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:32.930> reference

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
don't really have the frame of reference

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.530 
don't really have the frame of reference
of<00:02:33.470> all<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:34.190> different<00:02:34.580> versions<00:02:34.850> of<00:02:35.150> Aquaman

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
of all the different versions of Aquaman

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.150 
of all the different versions of Aquaman
but<00:02:35.660> I<00:02:35.720> know<00:02:35.810> there<00:02:36.020> are<00:02:36.170> many<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.800> I<00:02:36.920> feel

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
but I know there are many and I feel

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.710 
but I know there are many and I feel
like<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.730> thing<00:02:37.880> that<00:02:37.910> Zack<00:02:38.180> Snyder's<00:02:38.510> doing

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
like the thing that Zack Snyder's doing

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.840 
like the thing that Zack Snyder's doing
that<00:02:38.870> so<00:02:39.020> smart<00:02:39.380> is<00:02:39.620> he<00:02:39.860> is<00:02:40.220> creating<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:40.819> very

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
that so smart is he is creating a very

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.330 
that so smart is he is creating a very
cohesive<00:02:41.360> world<00:02:42.110> that<00:02:42.500> fits<00:02:42.830> together<00:02:43.100> nicely

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
cohesive world that fits together nicely

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.390 
cohesive world that fits together nicely
and<00:02:44.060> it's<00:02:44.209> dark<00:02:44.569> and<00:02:44.780> it's<00:02:45.020> interesting<00:02:45.860> and

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
and it's dark and it's interesting and

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.100 
and it's dark and it's interesting and
it's<00:02:46.519> gritty<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:47.000> use<00:02:47.120> your<00:02:47.269> word<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.630> I<00:02:47.720> think

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
it's gritty to use your word and I think

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.420 
it's gritty to use your word and I think
he<00:02:48.230> fits<00:02:48.470> in<00:02:48.620> really<00:02:48.769> well<00:02:48.890> with<00:02:49.160> what<00:02:49.310> we've

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
he fits in really well with what we've

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.610 
he fits in really well with what we've
seen<00:02:49.459> so<00:02:49.910> far<00:02:49.940> from<00:02:50.810> images<00:02:51.170> of<00:02:51.290> Batman<00:02:51.590> V

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
seen so far from images of Batman V

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.250 
seen so far from images of Batman V
Superman<00:02:52.100> and<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.370> also<00:02:52.550> think<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.810> setting<00:02:54.140> up

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
Superman and I also think the setting up

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.810 
Superman and I also think the setting up
of<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.440> of<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:54.860> Justice<00:02:55.190> League<00:02:55.250> now<00:02:55.610> he's

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
of the of the Justice League now he's

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.520 
of the of the Justice League now he's
kind<00:02:55.970> of<00:02:56.090> he's<00:02:56.450> he's<00:02:56.810> smartest<00:02:57.260> director

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
kind of he's he's smartest director

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.009 
kind of he's he's smartest director
because<00:02:57.620> he's<00:02:57.800> building<00:02:58.220> out<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:59.269> future<00:02:59.569> so

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
because he's building out the future so

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.660 
because he's building out the future so
he's<00:03:00.200> kind<00:03:00.470> of<00:03:00.560> getting<00:03:00.920> us<00:03:01.040> excited<00:03:01.459> for<00:03:01.610> the

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
he's kind of getting us excited for the

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:02.740 
he's kind of getting us excited for the
next<00:03:01.850> film<00:03:02.000> but<00:03:02.120> we<00:03:02.180> also<00:03:02.300> know<00:03:02.450> he's<00:03:02.630> gonna

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
member of the Justice League so it's

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.290 
member of the Justice League so it's
kind<00:03:06.590> of<00:03:06.650> like<00:03:06.860> building<00:03:07.430> it's<00:03:07.640> it's<00:03:07.850> it's<00:03:08.180> an

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
kind of like building it's it's it's an

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.520 
kind of like building it's it's it's an
image<00:03:08.569> that's<00:03:08.720> helping<00:03:09.080> to<00:03:09.170> build<00:03:09.350> out<00:03:09.500> that

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
image that's helping to build out that

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.320 
image that's helping to build out that
franchise<00:03:10.160> and<00:03:10.430> that<00:03:10.519> identity<00:03:10.670> so<00:03:11.120> I<00:03:11.150> think

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
franchise and that identity so I think

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.949 
franchise and that identity so I think
that's<00:03:11.450> really<00:03:11.569> smart

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
that's really smart

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.570 
that's really smart
and<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.260> Justice<00:03:12.650> League<00:03:12.860> is<00:03:13.010> looking<00:03:13.370> quite

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
and the Justice League is looking quite

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.120 
and the Justice League is looking quite
