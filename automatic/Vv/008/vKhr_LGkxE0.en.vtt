00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.359
 new minecraft mans tutorials from me 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.859
 Today I introduce you to the boss 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:11.160
 more powerful the post power modification 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.500
 and this adds many new pugs and items 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.880
 and style I'll do it for a minute 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.109
 a little something prepared here 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.180
 below you can already see the first new ones 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.609
 items and the scrolls come to that 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.470
 But right now what's up? 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.210
 This modern installed spawn in 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.680
 many flowers just in the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.689
 Mountain are there for democrats 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.970
 Coincidentally, build creepy here now 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.030
 blogs in the mountains in the desert 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.219
 spurs mummies and in the caves 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.489
 Sports also include fire ice 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.530
 tigers too and if you have one of these 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.120
 killing new pug gets you a place of 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.040
 that is, if I am 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.469
 now here's a war blog thats how it is 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.910
 two times two big stone dinger the 15 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.620
 jump up blocks, however, is here 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.730
 Unfortunately no one if I have the now 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.070
 killed then I get a place of 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.590
 mountain area and with this place 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.420
 it is available to me these scrolls 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.620
 to activate here that means there is 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.840
 Just play my game 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.510
 already so many places can be collected 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.369
 now a scroll forces that is always possible 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.710
 same scheme one has here eight blocks 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.570
 of course in the crafting table land has 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.670
 By her eight papers I mean and then 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.080
 do you do a blog for now 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.310
 Example of the desert over the window 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.420
 and then could be a disastrous 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.330
 in the woods while the leafs are in so 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.970
 here soon in the mountain while the stones 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:32.900
 in the kev the obsidian in the 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.369
 here near there it would be the net 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.650
 on the track comes from the names 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.240
 forget that bad and here if 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.740
 it then changes in the darkness 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.270
 then this is just always at night to a 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:50.009
 new jobs and the content of the cross 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.030
 of course, that's the way man does it 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.149
 Anyway if you are here now 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.619
 a mountain I meanwhile 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.600
 under now if you have a mountains 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.790
 Kroll managed eight blocks 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.619
 eight paper things here and then in 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.259
 in the middle of a stone you have mountains 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.270
 Kroll and if you then with enough 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.560
 orbs activated for example one has 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.360
 now 50 o'clock together makes mine 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.220
 the rest of the mount area and it 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.150
 build an endboss I'm with now 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.900
 Do not show intention and with them 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.269
 leave 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.860
 We definitely have in each area 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.900
 as if it is now the desert or the 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.329
 mountain the endbosses are different and 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.420
 For example, in the woods spawn then 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:26.310
 instead of here now these creepy blogs 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.470
 for example, the bandit and then there 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.780
 it the bandit leader or what I know 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.859
 the bandit boss then stop 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.900
 front and against which you have to fight 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:36.870
 then always bandits spawn and so on 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.549
 that is different today and in every area 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.290
 Of course, there are always rewards 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.560
 For example, if you say so now 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.290
 killed the boss nearby then 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.180
 you get a celebration armor 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.129
 simply fire protects and other it 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.959
 There are still boots the man 15 blocks 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.940
 can jump high and so on then 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.709
 you can still fly but that will 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.040
 you see everything when you see the 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.540
 killing each boss and that was it 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.220
 actually already from this one 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.689
 So I told you better 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.280
 Items you need to get that 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:06.000
 grabner a crafting it's always that 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.859
 same 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.170
 just stop with another window and 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:12.090
 that in the desert and so on and you 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.040
 could it be for the child of pug with 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.269
 where you can unlock the endboss 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.560
 so to speak it is always different 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.970
 how much selection needed but needed 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.940
 if you have such 20.30 that is quite 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.470
 Okay, so that was it, too 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.000
 already one comes reward for the kill 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.769
 of the different bosses and that was it 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.790
 now for good I would say so 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.530
 show you the desktop now 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.639
 installations and I have no extra 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.590
 mucks shown with that 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:39.690
 surprise effect also not lost 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.879
 is because so much to find out how 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.159
 the mobs look like you know her 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.479
 standard mops is already known 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.220
 In any case, I'll show you now 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:51.030
 the desktop installations and I would 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.409
 say so we are at the desktop 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.389
 installations have come and you need them 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:56.989
 only needs two things and twice the 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:04:00.720
 modifications and once the model or 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:02.599
 so first of all, of course, comes down here 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.979
 through the link on the side of the 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.109
 modifications manufacturer or on the 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:08.849
 Trip from minecraft forum and there the 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.319
 All pug I really wanted that 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.269
 show but now you see the x 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.000
 and yet the surprise effect is 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.739
 Definitely big for you that is 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.820
 for example the well, I'll say it first 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:23.130
 nothing at all and here you already see the 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.790
 All the extra complicates the bossen 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.220
 kill example 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.190
 be immune to fire with the brightest 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.440
 on the ear or you can up to ten blocks 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.570
 jump high and long still very much 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.030
 easy and so on that is for 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.050
 example the brightest on the ear and here 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.270
 You can finally do that downstairs 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.090
 download for the version 1.2 points 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.710
 5 just like that again model or and if you 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.500
 that has done then you go to percent 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.030
 ap dpa th percentile god because here 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.920
 to the point minecraft place times then goes 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.230
 here I put them on it then on the 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.970
 inside and open the minecraft star 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.580
 With a pack price I use like 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.830
 she was in the mood to do whatever he wanted 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.890
 First of all you do not go to the 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.890
 help from winrar but very first 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.900
 includes removed meter also 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.110
 man then deletes with words as 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.340
 Next you install in the model or 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.290
 just share all the class in here 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.880
 pull all already installation 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.500
 by model or next installed 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.990
 client boss power it's just as simple 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.510
 just all folders and class part in 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.600
 these involve so that was the 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.520
 installation of all the stuff it 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.470
 Anyway, really easy and I threaten 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.330
 would say a lot of fun with this motto 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.330
