00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
I guess we'll have to do it that way

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.790 
I guess we'll have to do it that way
because<00:03:13.520> this<00:03:14.209> game<00:03:14.480> sometimes<00:03:15.050> doesn't<00:03:15.650> roll

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
because this game sometimes doesn't roll

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.990 
because this game sometimes doesn't roll
your<00:03:15.950> way<00:03:16.100> and<00:03:16.520> you<00:03:16.580> got<00:03:17.209> accept<00:03:17.600> it<00:03:17.780> do<00:03:18.709> not
