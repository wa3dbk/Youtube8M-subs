00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.150
 bolzoni 

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.180
 the time of traveling with him that the newspaper is a short time ago 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.460
 the picture is off on this Friday we're going to land in the heart of 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:11.459
 Brazil 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:21.210
 surrounded by the Heron and Araguaia rivers on the border of mato grosso with goias and 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.509
 working the navy 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.509
 the flight in the middle of the cerrado 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.230
 from cuiabÃ¡ sinop 500 kilometers by car by br 070 which is in good 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.530
 conditions the typical fish food is one of the specialties is the 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.620
 tucunare in the pile prices range between 10 and 30 reais per person ten 

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:49.390
 offers the entire infrastructure with daily rates ranging from 40 to 80 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.370
 real the trips have been the loteros closed the itinerary of contemplation 

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:57.080
 horse riding 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.050
 let's start by the river herons are 50 reais by the 20 km ride 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.510
 in canoes and kayaks accompanied by a guide 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.250
 but this discussion our way stopped after the elected and the girls 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.060
 who name the film 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.240
 on the fringes of the treetops are the monkeys that perceive the 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.050
 our presence 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.370
 then for lack 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.240
 There's no where to go, so if all this drinking water 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.280
 you arrive is that you had a history of seeing yourself sturm 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.170
 I like it another must-see script is the snake's saw are 70 km 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.880
 by foot or 5 8 to the foot of the mountain we climbed by car to the point where 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.840
 begin the tracks 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.840
 then you have to walk in the middle of the cerrado 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.990
 but we are at 700 meters of altitude one of the most beautiful points of the 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.789
 snorer 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:57.780
 in your place 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.929
 where we are is known as 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:01.119
 the stone bridge 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.940
 for the sculpture that nature did here 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.229
 Encare thinks that all this one day he has already been under the water and sewage 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.629
 also think the Nikkei index that all regions west of east of manaus 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.099
 and even less presents us or came all this here with us can 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.099
 gilberto dos santos o giba said what's here 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.610
 another much sought after tour is the material complex 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.100
 for 60 reais the tourist can get there say dipp and cutting the farms 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:33.549
 our first stop is at the waterfall of the buracÃ£o she got this name because 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:34.479
 gives 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:37.479
 rock from where water springs 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.659
 radius of two kilometers gives to know the 17 waterfalls the highest is 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:45.649
 That 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:48.649
 75 meters of waterfall 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.920
 is very beautiful has height 'that is very high and the fall of the water of the herds 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:57.809
 it's a sensational defense 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.599
 the most searched looks 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:01.450
 of the city 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.429
 are the waterfalls 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:03.829
 the fair of the blue saw 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.399
 one of the curiosities here is this difference in temperature in 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:09.389
 the party that reaches 300 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.530
 two weeks ago 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.080
 already at that time futuristic find the cold water 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:20.089
 the region is rich in thermal waters because of that bar of the herons won until 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:21.709
 a municipal park with 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.859
 six clinton water pools 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.730
 is the one that presents the hottest of the paicv the temperature of the water revolves around 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:32.129
 42 degrees has passed the paste that technique 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:33.569
 so I follow this 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.569
 michael of the region of high temperatures and that the fight 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:45.469
 but it's the reality bar of the herons 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:47.229
 the biggest attraction around here
