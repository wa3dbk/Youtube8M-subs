the club gets it I think I think

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.809 
the club gets it I think I think
probably<00:02:13.300> 98<00:02:14.300> 99<00:02:14.750> percent<00:02:15.230> club<00:02:15.650> does<00:02:16.430> get<00:02:16.700> it

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
probably 98 99 percent club does get it

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.589 
probably 98 99 percent club does get it
I<00:02:17.030> think<00:02:17.750> what<00:02:18.349> happens<00:02:18.709> in<00:02:19.599> organizations

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
I think what happens in organizations

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.870 
I think what happens in organizations
whether<00:02:21.319> it<00:02:21.470> be<00:02:21.620> a<00:02:21.650> motorcycle<00:02:22.370> club<00:02:22.610> or<00:02:22.760> any

whether it be a motorcycle club or any

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.350 
whether it be a motorcycle club or any
other<00:02:23.120> end<00:02:23.300> I<00:02:23.780> think<00:02:25.000> personalities<00:02:26.000> get<00:02:26.239> in

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
other end I think personalities get in

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.670 
other end I think personalities get in
the<00:02:26.480> way<00:02:26.630> I<00:02:26.959> think<00:02:27.709> people<00:02:29.140> there<00:02:30.140> there<00:02:30.440> need

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
the way I think people there there need

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.970 
the way I think people there there need
to<00:02:31.480> maybe<00:02:32.480> achieve<00:02:32.930> some<00:02:33.170> type<00:02:33.349> of<00:02:33.380> status

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
to maybe achieve some type of status

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.520 
to maybe achieve some type of status
power<00:02:34.940> status<00:02:35.480> or<00:02:35.840> whatever<00:02:36.170> I<00:02:36.290> think

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
power status or whatever I think

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.460 
power status or whatever I think
sometimes<00:02:36.890> that<00:02:37.160> gets<00:02:37.340> in<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.760> way<00:02:38.470> ambition

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
sometimes that gets in the way ambition

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.770 
sometimes that gets in the way ambition
you<00:02:40.040> know<00:02:40.190> some<00:02:40.489> people<00:02:40.519> very<00:02:41.000> ambitious<00:02:41.420> and

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
you know some people very ambitious and
