today I really do want to explain just
how<00:00:16.379> it's<00:00:16.650> done<00:00:17.840> so<00:00:18.840> I'm<00:00:18.900> blocking<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> lock

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
how it's done so I'm blocking the lock

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.849 
how it's done so I'm blocking the lock

here's<00:00:23.220> my<00:00:23.279> nice<00:00:23.609> little<00:00:24.000> drafting<00:00:24.689> diagram

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
here's my nice little drafting diagram

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.960 
here's my nice little drafting diagram
of<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.529> lock<00:00:25.740> can't<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.369> see<00:00:26.519> everything

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
of the lock can't you see everything

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.060 
of the lock can't you see everything
there<00:00:27.150> isn't<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.080> pretty<00:00:28.289> yes<00:00:29.240> okay<00:00:30.859> this<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.009> a

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
there isn't it pretty yes okay this is a

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.799 
there isn't it pretty yes okay this is a
5<00:00:32.309> pin<00:00:32.579> lock<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:33.030> when<00:00:33.120> we're<00:00:33.239> picking<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> lock

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
5 pin lock so when we're picking a lock

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.540 
5 pin lock so when we're picking a lock
we're<00:00:34.079> going<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:35.130> we're<00:00:35.280> manipulating

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
we're going in and we're manipulating

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.799 
we're going in and we're manipulating
the<00:00:36.090> bottom<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.600> each<00:00:36.750> pin<00:00:37.110> with<00:00:37.860> our<00:00:38.010> pic

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
the bottom of each pin with our pic

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.869 
the bottom of each pin with our pic
right<00:00:39.809> but<00:00:40.800> normally<00:00:41.250> let's<00:00:41.550> say<00:00:41.700> we're

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
right but normally let's say we're

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.100 
right but normally let's say we're
coming<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.180> from<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.450> side<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:42.840> let's<00:00:42.989> say

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
coming in from this side so let's say

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.319 
coming in from this side so let's say
the<00:00:43.230> key<00:00:43.379> openings<00:00:43.770> over<00:00:44.010> here<00:00:44.190> right<00:00:44.399> we're

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
the key openings over here right we're

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.790 
the key openings over here right we're
usually<00:00:45.480> going<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.899> come<00:00:46.079> in<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.410> pick<00:00:46.469> from

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
usually going to come in and pick from

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.680 
usually going to come in and pick from
the<00:00:46.920> back<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.430> start<00:00:47.789> out<00:00:47.940> by<00:00:48.149> picking<00:00:48.539> this

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
the back and start out by picking this

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.619 
the back and start out by picking this
pin<00:00:48.960> first<00:00:49.610> back<00:00:50.610> pin<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.149> then<00:00:51.270> move<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
pin first back pin and then move to the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.959 
pin first back pin and then move to the
next<00:00:51.840> pin<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.379> next<00:00:52.590> pin<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.829> next<00:00:53.039> pin<00:00:53.219> all

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
next pin the next pin the next pin all

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.029 
next pin the next pin the next pin all
the<00:00:54.329> while<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:54.809> important<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.500> know<00:00:55.680> for

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
the while it's important you know for

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.880 
the while it's important you know for
here<00:00:58.670> we<00:00:59.670> have<00:00:59.789> our<00:00:59.820> torsion<00:01:00.390> wrench<00:01:00.890> putting

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
here we have our torsion wrench putting

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.070 
here we have our torsion wrench putting
torque<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.489> opening<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.120> keyhole<00:01:03.510> and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
torque on the opening the keyhole and

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.410 
torque on the opening the keyhole and
that<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.680> because<00:01:05.460> when<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:05.760> put<00:01:05.970> torque<00:01:06.240> on

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
that is because when we put torque on

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.710 
that is because when we put torque on
the<00:01:06.450> opening<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.900> keyhole<00:01:07.380> here<00:01:08.720> it

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
the opening of the keyhole here it

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.929 
the opening of the keyhole here it
creates<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.200> little<00:01:10.470> ledge<00:01:10.680> which<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.760> top

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
creates a little ledge which is the top

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.660 
creates a little ledge which is the top
pin<00:01:12.210> can<00:01:12.390> rest<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.840> when<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.890> push<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.369> bottom

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
pin can rest on when you push the bottom

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.240 
pin can rest on when you push the bottom
pin<00:01:14.880> up<00:01:15.090> enough<00:01:15.560> for<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.680> divide<00:01:17.040> between

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
pin up enough for that divide between

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.010 
pin up enough for that divide between
the<00:01:17.490> bottom<00:01:17.909> pin<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.240> top<00:01:18.450> pin<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.869> reach

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the bottom pin and the top pin to reach

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.380 
the bottom pin and the top pin to reach
that<00:01:19.259> shear<00:01:19.560> line<00:01:19.770> between<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.970> cylinder

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
that shear line between the cylinder

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.609 
that shear line between the cylinder
which<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:23.189> know<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.330> tumbler<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.619> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
which is a you know a tumbler and the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.560 
which is a you know a tumbler and the
pin<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.280> know<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.670> regular<00:01:27.000> housing<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
pin you know the regular housing of the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.210 
pin you know the regular housing of the
pen<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.530> you're<00:01:28.650> going<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.829> create<00:01:28.979> that

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
pen so you're going to create that

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.120 
pen so you're going to create that
little<00:01:29.520> edge<00:01:29.670> between<00:01:30.150> this<00:01:30.509> tumbler<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
little edge between this tumbler in the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.520 
little edge between this tumbler in the
housing<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:33.390> that's<00:01:33.600> where<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.020> top<00:01:34.200> end<00:01:34.439> is

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
housing and that's where the top end is

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.280 
housing and that's where the top end is
going<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.770> rest<00:01:35.040> once<00:01:35.970> you've<00:01:36.210> put<00:01:36.659> up<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
going to rest once you've put up the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.980 
going to rest once you've put up the
bottom<00:01:37.560> put<00:01:37.740> enough<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.189> set<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.790> pin<00:01:39.030> that's

until i get all the way to the back and
I've<00:03:36.690> kind<00:03:36.959> of<00:03:36.989> felt<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.410> pins<00:03:37.620> through<00:03:37.860> now

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
I've kind of felt the pins through now

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.470

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
degree' i have written down from 50 i

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.080 
degree' i have written down from 50 i
want<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.269> put<00:04:03.480> 80<00:04:03.750> degrees<00:04:04.880> because<00:04:05.880> that's

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
want to put 80 degrees because that's

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.940 
want to put 80 degrees because that's
how<00:04:06.239> much<00:04:06.420> this<00:04:06.600> will<00:04:06.750> turn

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
how much this will turn

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.410 
how much this will turn
just<00:04:09.790> short<00:04:10.060> of<00:04:10.120> 90s<00:04:10.599> degrees<00:04:10.900> looks<00:04:11.260> like<00:04:12.420> but

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
just short of 90s degrees looks like but

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.120 
just short of 90s degrees looks like but
as<00:04:13.540> you<00:04:13.690> can<00:04:13.840> see<00:04:14.140> I<00:04:15.090> went<00:04:16.090> through<00:04:16.359> and<00:04:17.130> with

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
as you can see I went through and with

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.009 
as you can see I went through and with
this<00:04:18.340> lock<00:04:18.549> incidentally<00:04:19.150> normally<00:04:19.570> we<00:04:19.810> pick

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
this lock incidentally normally we pick

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.379 
this lock incidentally normally we pick
from<00:04:20.200> back<00:04:20.410> to<00:04:20.440> front<00:04:20.760> move<00:04:21.760> from<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.060> back<00:04:22.210> to

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
from back to front move from the back to

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:23.850 
from back to front move from the back to
the<00:04:22.419> front<00:04:22.630> I<00:04:22.930> mean<00:04:23.230> this<00:04:23.380> is<00:04:23.530> just<00:04:23.560> a

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
the front I mean this is just a

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.890 
the front I mean this is just a
traditional<00:04:24.370> thing<00:04:24.580> some<00:04:24.940> locks<00:04:25.180> just<00:04:25.450> work

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
traditional thing some locks just work

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.420 
traditional thing some locks just work
to<00:04:26.080> be<00:04:26.200> pick<00:04:26.380> better<00:04:26.620> from<00:04:26.830> back<00:04:26.979> to<00:04:27.100> the<00:04:27.250> front

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
to be pick better from back to the front

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.730 
to be pick better from back to the front
this<00:04:28.060> one<00:04:28.330> however<00:04:28.570> it<00:04:29.080> works<00:04:29.169> better<00:04:29.440> to<00:04:29.650> be

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
this one however it works better to be

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.159 
this one however it works better to be
picked<00:04:29.979> from<00:04:30.130> the<00:04:30.220> front<00:04:30.550> to<00:04:30.610> the<00:04:30.700> back<00:04:30.790> I<00:04:31.240> mean

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
picked from the front to the back I mean

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:33.600 
picked from the front to the back I mean
it's<00:04:32.380> just<00:04:32.560> going<00:04:32.680> to<00:04:32.710> be<00:04:32.800> a<00:04:32.860> thing<00:04:33.160> for<00:04:33.460> each

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
it's just going to be a thing for each

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.280 
it's just going to be a thing for each
individual<00:04:34.120> lock<00:04:34.389> different<00:04:34.900> locks<00:04:35.080> have

tactics<00:04:37.479> to<00:04:37.600> pick<00:04:37.780> them<00:04:38.370> but<00:04:39.370> this<00:04:39.520> lock<00:04:39.790> it

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
tactics to pick them but this lock it

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.870 
tactics to pick them but this lock it
happens<00:04:40.330> to<00:04:40.479> take<00:04:40.690> just<00:04:41.380> a<00:04:41.500> light<00:04:41.710> touch<00:04:41.979> to

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
happens to take just a light touch to

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.190 
happens to take just a light touch to
each<00:04:43.060> pin<00:04:43.360> is<00:04:43.870> the<00:04:44.050> front<00:04:44.350> to<00:04:45.160> the<00:04:45.190> back<00:04:45.280> and

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
each pin is the front to the back and

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:55.290 
each pin is the front to the back and
that<00:04:47.200> light<00:04:47.440> touch<00:04:47.770> will<00:04:48.430> open<00:04:48.790> the<00:04:48.880> lock

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.689 

however<00:04:56.110> I<00:04:56.349> don't<00:04:56.860> always<00:04:57.039> have<00:04:57.280> that<00:04:57.490> light

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
however I don't always have that light

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:06.180 
however I don't always have that light
touch<00:05:00.120> but<00:05:01.120> sometimes<00:05:01.569> I<00:05:01.750> do<00:05:04.860> so<00:05:05.860> this<00:05:06.039> is<00:05:06.069> a

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
touch but sometimes I do so this is a

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.950 
touch but sometimes I do so this is a
pretty<00:05:06.370> nice<00:05:06.639> looking<00:05:06.879> lock<00:05:07.180> right<00:05:07.479> I<00:05:07.720> mean

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
pretty nice looking lock right I mean

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.330 
pretty nice looking lock right I mean
that's<00:05:08.110> what<00:05:08.349> I<00:05:08.379> thought<00:05:08.620> when<00:05:08.800> I<00:05:08.889> bought<00:05:09.069> it<00:05:09.129> I

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
that's what I thought when I bought it I

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.920 
that's what I thought when I bought it I
said<00:05:09.400> this<00:05:09.699> is<00:05:09.819> a<00:05:09.849> nice<00:05:10.090> looking<00:05:10.270> lock<00:05:10.659> it

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
said this is a nice looking lock it

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.020 
said this is a nice looking lock it
should<00:05:11.139> be<00:05:11.259> challenging<00:05:11.860> to<00:05:11.889> pick<00:05:12.159> it<00:05:12.879> should

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
should be challenging to pick it should

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.330 
should be challenging to pick it should
be<00:05:13.180> something<00:05:13.389> that<00:05:13.539> I<00:05:13.659> can<00:05:13.720> learn<00:05:13.990> from<00:05:14.280> but<00:05:15.280> I

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
be something that I can learn from but I

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.980 
be something that I can learn from but I
learned<00:05:15.580> an<00:05:15.729> even<00:05:16.000> more<00:05:16.150> interesting<00:05:16.449> lesson

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
learned an even more interesting lesson

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.320 
learned an even more interesting lesson
from<00:05:17.349> it<00:05:17.500> and<00:05:17.770> that<00:05:17.919> is<00:05:18.129> nice<00:05:18.550> looking<00:05:18.909> locks

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
from it and that is nice looking locks

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.990 
from it and that is nice looking locks
are<00:05:19.720> not<00:05:20.289> difficult<00:05:20.590> to<00:05:20.860> pick<00:05:21.129> they<00:05:21.819> can<00:05:21.970> look

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
are not difficult to pick they can look

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.700 
are not difficult to pick they can look
as<00:05:22.240> nice<00:05:22.449> as<00:05:22.690> this<00:05:22.900> and<00:05:23.259> they<00:05:23.409> won't<00:05:23.590> be

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
as nice as this and they won't be

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.670 
as nice as this and they won't be
difficult<00:05:24.599> but<00:05:25.599> that's<00:05:25.780> true<00:05:26.080> for<00:05:26.289> master

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
difficult but that's true for master

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.770 
difficult but that's true for master
locks<00:05:26.889> master<00:05:27.639> locks<00:05:27.819> are<00:05:28.000> surprisingly<00:05:28.539> easy
