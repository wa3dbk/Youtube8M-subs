00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.100
 acn was built from a 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.779
 opportunity and now we are you 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.610
 give the opportunity to help change 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.300
 lives simply by doing what 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.300
 we do the best 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.090
 at acn give back to the community done 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.430
 part of what we are actually 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.590
 since our beginnings in 1993 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.730
 our goal is to make communities 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.740
 in which we live and 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.300
 work even better than she 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.910
 was when we got there 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.460
 and for us this commitment begins 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.460
 with the children but despite the efforts 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.180
 deployed for more than 20 years it remains 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.180
 still much to do 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:43.400
 here's the reality of hunger among 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.600
 children is a scourge and this does not 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.550
 product not just in the 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.780
 Third World 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.320
 it's happening at home too 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.940
 own back yard and for acn that's 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.309
 simply unacceptable 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.530
 so we decided to join forces 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.360
 to those of the We Fall Food Foundation 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.250
 who are committed to fighting hunger 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.020
 children while giving the means 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.339
 families to have a way of life more 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.170
 healthy 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.780
 the foundation we pray for food at a 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.270
 mission to stop hunger in children 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.800
 there are about 17 million children who 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.300
 do not know when will be their next 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.009
 meal 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.319
 we accomplish this mission a 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.679
 child at the same time by offering meals 

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:25.340
 balanced nutritious and healthy to those who 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:27.590
 most need it in addition to its 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.450
 meals all must understand that this 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.740
 cycle can not be broken without a 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.959
 adequate education 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.360
 that's why at we pray for food 

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:37.190
 we are also committed to educating 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.360
 families on nutrition a 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.130
 Healthy eating 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.899
 the preparation of meals and the 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.720
 sustainability of food resources 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.640
 long term and 100% of the money we 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.599
 collect goes meal programs 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.599
 or related to the meal 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.110
 it's our responsibility and our 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.039
 privilege of helping to feed the children 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.049
 in need 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.450
 and now you can collaborate 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.189
 also by subscribing to the service 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.409
 with enough hatred and paying your bills 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.549
 every month you get not only 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.289
 excellent services at a price 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.680
 advantageous but you contribute 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.060
 also to feed a child each 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.599
 once someone subscribe to a 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.750
 n Service asean enough donated and 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.800
 a child is nurtured and whenever 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.340
 you pay for his services 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.489
 another child and fed it's also 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.049
 simple as that and remember these are 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.930
 services that you already use and 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.340
 for which you already pay but 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.860
 now help you feed a 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.160
 child in need 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.750
 there is nothing more powerful person 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.700
 do not deny and I'm sure you 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.440
 would agree with less than the end 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.510
 prevents children from reaching their 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.340
 full potential 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.620
 but together we can have one 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.959
 lasting impact on children at home 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.120
 us because when you have an impact 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.310
 on a child you do more than 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.329
 change their day you can change 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.329
 their entire life
