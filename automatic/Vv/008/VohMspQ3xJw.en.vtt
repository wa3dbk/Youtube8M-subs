00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.619
 France 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.730
 also in 2008 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:34.329
 there is something that does not seem to change much even today with this fish in 2008 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.550
 are entitled to departure are Miami and other state-of-the-art resources 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.199
 we are still forced to press the buttons as crazy as the homesick 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.480
 lose time of the late Jurassic despite the weariness of a certain frustration 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.390
 at least it's still possible to have fun like in the old days 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.049
 the new game of the series a 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:59.409
 in partnership with europa with the club has 38 modalities ranging from 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:01.380
 100 meters shallow to modesty 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.250
 going for a fable we table tennis 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.360
 there is a floor and china passed 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.360
 the choice are delegations from 32 countries 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.790
 and can participate in different ways just to test the different 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.000
 mechanics of each sport 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.410
 with pepe jeans maputo the selection will have evidence to play with friends online and 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.250
 offline 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.250
 principally insufficient 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.600
 if the country is tidy to compete in a number of different 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.270
 events per day 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.270
 a pre-set goal to move to the next day 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.530
 the beginning is simple classificatory 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.920
 but then the difficulty increases with the need to win even in 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.100
 evidence that you probably will not have much intimacy 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.770
 against so many varieties 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.750
 It also complicates the system of distribution of funds to the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.670
 end of each event you can make the laws of various attributes of your team 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:00.229
 as a force 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.950
 speed or agility once your athletes start with a dropped projection 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.349
 against competitors this can become a bit frustrating at first 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:15.719
 about the mechanics of modalities, it has hardly changed since the 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.239
 bake times 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.810
 Of course some new elements have been added here and there but get ready 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.059
 to press buttons repeatedly for a long time 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:29.290
 with the to make pressing candid on the analog levers 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.239
 races and other evidence such as pole vaulting distance diving 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.929
 mainly 

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:39.069
 still, but I do not have a repression scheme 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.899
 with one or another variation of finalization with the 

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:47.479
 winning only a new starting system and gives a boost and 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:51.029
 extra the athlete with my buttons are pressed at the right time 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.549
 an interesting variation happens for example in weight lifting without 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.109
 you need to take the analog directional 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.369
 that finally vitto expensive to balance the weight of ensigns on the target 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:12.139
 but when the game tries to escape completely this strangely fails to please 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:15.319
 as in the case of the player 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.989
 you should use analog to direct your approach to mend with 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.799
 button combinations 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.669
 and they never go very well for lack of indication of the game about what is 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:29.040
 happening or a better elaborate tutorial 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.989
 besides a good part of the mechanics and relying on the past can say the same 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.540
 of the technical part 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.050
 even though the game with the kind some very realistic models with movements 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.210
 captured from real athletes as well as some attention-grabbing textures 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.099
 for quality there is nothing that intimidates the brochure 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:52.049
 the production is simpler power and flour environment the player 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.429
 never creating a feeling of involvement 

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:58.739
 in fact it does not seem to even try 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.749
 with a previous presentation without many details of some key points 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:05.149
 of the games of beijing 

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:07.910
 accompanied by an incidental trail 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.409
 and seems to be suffering to take away the complete silence 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.809
 beijing 2008 is an extremely bureaucratic game 

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:18.049
 which uses some jurassic principles of the videogame 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.600
 and has merely average production but concern and join the largest number 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:27.320
 possible modes and the creation of an online and offline multiplayer mode 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:31.560
 end up compensating a good part of their prisoners limitations 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:36.659
 far from being memorable at least entertaining this period when the 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:38.409
 Olympic climate is more evident
