Bob weather derivatives this is a way to
hedge<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.970> hot<00:00:06.120> weather<00:00:06.330> exactly<00:00:07.140> so<00:00:07.319> you<00:00:07.379> can

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
hedge the hot weather exactly so you can

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.320 
hedge the hot weather exactly so you can
hedge<00:00:07.830> out<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.309> all<00:00:08.460> of<00:00:08.639> your<00:00:08.760> exposure<00:00:09.120> to

in New York City for your summer suit I

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.600 
in New York City for your summer suit I
did<00:00:13.410> because<00:00:13.710> I<00:00:13.799> don't<00:00:13.980> own<00:00:14.190> one<00:00:14.219> of<00:00:14.460> these

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
could have won a normal so how does it

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.760 
could have won a normal so how does it
work<00:00:17.880> well<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:18.449> first<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.560> all<00:00:19.619> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
interesting thing is that you can you

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.450 
interesting thing is that you can you
can<00:00:21.330> hedge<00:00:21.630> out<00:00:21.869> heat<00:00:22.590> in<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.800> summer<00:00:23.039> you

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
getting bigger all the time they're

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.290 
getting bigger all the time they're
adding<00:00:43.829> contracts<00:00:44.250> for<00:00:44.430> all<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.850> all<00:00:45.090> the

phenomenon per Akane's of course a big
one<00:00:49.829> but<00:00:50.340> if<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.550> want<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.910> take<00:00:51.059> one<00:00:51.300> let's

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
one but if you want to take one let's

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.380 
one but if you want to take one let's
take<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> take<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.379> look<00:00:52.469> at<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.550> heat<00:00:53.789> would<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
take a take a look at the heat would the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.569 
take a take a look at the heat would the
way<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.570> hedge<00:00:54.989> out<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> heat<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.370> that

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
way to hedge out the heat and so that

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.360 
way to hedge out the heat and so that
that's<00:00:56.760> called<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.239> cooling<00:00:57.809> degree<00:00:57.989> day<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> CDD

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
that's called a cooling degree day a CDD

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.709 
that's called a cooling degree day a CDD
is<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.170> key<00:01:01.379> index<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.480> set

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
is the is the key index and that is set

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.230 
is the is the key index and that is set
on<00:01:03.750> some<00:01:04.110> number<00:01:04.830> above<00:01:05.280> which<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.820> assumed

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
on some number above which it is assumed

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.730 
on some number above which it is assumed
believe<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.930> or<00:01:07.020> not<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.170> you're<00:01:07.439> gonna<00:01:07.530> have

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
believe it or not that you're gonna have

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.320 
believe it or not that you're gonna have
to<00:01:07.860> have<00:01:07.979> air<00:01:08.189> conditioning<00:01:08.760> running<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.180> that

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
to have air conditioning running on that

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.480 
to have air conditioning running on that
day<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.900> CDD<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> day<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.220> which<00:01:11.340> you're

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
day so a CDD is a day in which you're

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.190 
day so a CDD is a day in which you're
going<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.640> need<00:01:11.700> air<00:01:11.970> conditioning<00:01:12.049> and<00:01:13.049> what

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
going to need air conditioning and what

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.260 
going to need air conditioning and what
they<00:01:13.320> do<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.680> they<00:01:13.920> say<00:01:14.159> we're<00:01:15.090> going<00:01:15.210> to

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
they do is they say we're going to

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.850 
they do is they say we're going to
assume<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.689> baseline<00:01:16.110> temperature<00:01:16.320> for<00:01:16.770> that

assume a baseline temperature for that

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.520 
assume a baseline temperature for that

I<00:01:31.320> can't<00:01:31.590> believe<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.549> can't

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
I can't believe that so you can't

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.280 
I can't believe that so you can't
actually<00:01:33.030> there's<00:01:33.600> no<00:01:33.689> derivative<00:01:34.140> for

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
actually there's no derivative for

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.340 
actually there's no derivative for
electricity<00:01:34.890> well<00:01:35.549> that's<00:01:36.060> why<00:01:36.420> there<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.140> no

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
electricity well that's why there is no

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.899 
electricity well that's why there is no
derivatives<00:01:37.799> for<00:01:37.950> electricity<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.549> that's

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
derivatives for electricity and that's

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.600 
derivatives for electricity and that's
why<00:01:39.150> actually<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> lot<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.380> companies<00:01:41.369> will

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
why actually a lot of companies will

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.330 
why actually a lot of companies will
power<00:01:41.909> generators<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.570> consumers<00:01:43.439> will<00:01:44.009> use

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
power generators and consumers will use

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.550 
power generators and consumers will use
these<00:01:44.670> kinds<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.270> derivatives<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.229> order<00:01:46.470> to

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
these kinds of derivatives in order to

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.260 
these kinds of derivatives in order to
hedge<00:01:46.740> out<00:01:46.979> their<00:01:47.189> exposure<00:01:47.610> with<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.149> know

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
hedge out their exposure with you know

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.679 
hedge out their exposure with you know
fuel<00:01:48.630> costs<00:01:49.079> etc<00:01:49.470> etc<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:50.100> they<00:01:50.549> become<00:01:50.939> you

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
fuel costs etc etc so they become you

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.380 
fuel costs etc etc so they become you
know<00:01:51.720> very<00:01:51.840> robust<00:01:52.560> real<00:01:53.040> derivatives<00:01:53.759> that's

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
know very robust real derivatives that's

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.209 
know very robust real derivatives that's
so<00:01:54.630> wild<00:01:54.869> if<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.290> government<00:01:55.740> involved<00:01:56.130> in

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
so wild if the government involved in

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.679 
so wild if the government involved in
this<00:01:56.340> at<00:01:56.579> all<00:01:56.610> well<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.060> course<00:01:57.210> they<00:01:57.509> have<00:01:57.659> to

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
this at all well of course they have to

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.780 
this at all well of course they have to
approve<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.290> CFTC<00:01:58.920> has<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.310> approve<00:01:59.579> all<00:01:59.759> of

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
approve the CFTC has to approve all of

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.370 
approve the CFTC has to approve all of
this<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.299> when<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.540> first<00:02:00.840> heard<00:02:00.990> about<00:02:01.229> it

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
this and when I first heard about it

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.630 
this and when I first heard about it
when<00:02:01.500> many<00:02:01.740> people<00:02:01.829> hear<00:02:02.219> about<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.460> kind<00:02:02.549> of

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
when many people hear about it kind of

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.859 
when many people hear about it kind of
sounds<00:02:02.880> funny<00:02:03.090> at<00:02:03.270> first<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.630> go<00:02:03.719> wait<00:02:03.840> a

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
sounds funny at first and go wait a

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.149 
sounds funny at first and go wait a
minute<00:02:04.020> now<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.170> government's<00:02:04.649> approving

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
minute now the government's approving

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.410 
minute now the government's approving
like<00:02:05.310> whether<00:02:05.490> it's<00:02:05.640> gonna<00:02:05.759> rain<00:02:06.149> in

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
like whether it's gonna rain in

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.969 
like whether it's gonna rain in
September<00:02:06.960> or<00:02:06.990> something<00:02:07.079> like<00:02:07.530> isn't<00:02:07.890> it

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
September or something like isn't it

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.080 
September or something like isn't it
like<00:02:08.190> yeah<00:02:09.000> gambling<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.760> little

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
like yeah gambling and it is a little

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.770 
like yeah gambling and it is a little
bit<00:02:12.209> like<00:02:12.360> gambling

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
bit like gambling

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.930 
bit like gambling
but<00:02:13.020> there<00:02:13.650> are<00:02:13.860> some<00:02:14.160> real<00:02:14.370> economic

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
but there are some real economic

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.940 
but there are some real economic
consequences<00:02:15.600> as<00:02:15.780> we<00:02:15.930> just<00:02:16.170> described<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:16.830> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
consequences as we just described so the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.740 
consequences as we just described so the
CFTC<00:02:17.550> got<00:02:17.760> comfortable<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.450> this<00:02:18.540> was

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
CFTC got comfortable that this was

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.809 
CFTC got comfortable that this was
actually<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.260> know<00:02:19.380> for<00:02:19.590> good<00:02:19.819> proper

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
actually you know for good proper

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.850 
actually you know for good proper
economic<00:02:21.690> purposes<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.380> improved<00:02:22.680> these

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
economic purposes and improved these

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.860 
economic purposes and improved these
kinds<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.190> contracts<00:02:23.730> so<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.180> mean<00:02:24.450> how<00:02:24.600> does<00:02:24.660> it

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
kinds of contracts so I mean how does it

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.630 
kinds of contracts so I mean how does it
work<00:02:25.050> basically<00:02:25.350> you<00:02:25.800> look<00:02:26.190> at<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.459> weather

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
work basically you look at the weather

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.820 
work basically you look at the weather
forecast<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.750> then<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.020> go<00:02:28.140> out<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.590> see

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
forecast and then you go out and see

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.970 
forecast and then you go out and see
what's<00:02:29.310> available<00:02:29.910> what's<00:02:30.600> well<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.530> figure

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
what's available what's well you figure

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.250 
what's available what's well you figure
out<00:02:32.040> what<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.640> what<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:33.420> need<00:02:33.660> protection

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
out what you what you need protection

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.440 
out what you what you need protection
from<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.680> so<00:02:34.800> in<00:02:34.950> our<00:02:35.040> CDD<00:02:35.640> example<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.330> way

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
from and so in our CDD example the way

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.510 
from and so in our CDD example the way
it<00:02:36.569> technically<00:02:37.200> works<00:02:37.560> is<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:38.280> buy<00:02:38.489> a

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
it technically works is you buy a

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.970 
it technically works is you buy a
contract<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.239> says<00:02:39.480> listen<00:02:39.690> for<00:02:40.650> X<00:02:40.830> number

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
contract that says listen for X number

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.760 
contract that says listen for X number
of<00:02:41.160> dollars<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.760> will<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:42.390> will<00:02:42.540> get<00:02:42.720> paid<00:02:43.020> a

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
of dollars I will you will get paid a

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.640 
of dollars I will you will get paid a
certain<00:02:44.340> number<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:44.820> dollars<00:02:45.630> based<00:02:46.050> on<00:02:46.260> the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
certain number of dollars based on the

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.100 
certain number of dollars based on the
number<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:46.980> days<00:02:47.250> that<00:02:47.280> were<00:02:47.700> CDD<00:02:48.300> days<00:02:48.540> times

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
number of days that were CDD days times

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.470 
number of days that were CDD days times
a<00:02:49.590> certain<00:02:50.040> specific<00:02:50.370> number<00:02:50.880> of<00:02:50.910> dollars<00:02:51.300> so

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
a certain specific number of dollars so

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.300 
a certain specific number of dollars so
it's<00:02:51.630> dollars<00:02:51.870> times<00:02:52.230> CDD<00:02:52.709> days<00:02:52.920> that's<00:02:53.190> what

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
it's dollars times CDD days that's what

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.460 
it's dollars times CDD days that's what
you<00:02:53.430> get<00:02:53.610> paid<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:54.480> buy<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:54.780> contract

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
you get paid and you buy that contract

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.199 
you get paid and you buy that contract
for<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.680> certain<00:02:55.920> amount<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.220> money<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.700> by<00:02:57.150> the

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
for a certain amount of money and by the

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.180 
for a certain amount of money and by the
way<00:02:57.420> just<00:02:58.350> in<00:02:58.470> case<00:02:58.500> you're<00:02:58.709> wondering<00:02:58.800> you

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
way just in case you're wondering you

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.460 
way just in case you're wondering you
can<00:02:59.459> get<00:02:59.730> futures<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:00.780> can<00:03:00.900> get<00:03:01.050> options

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
can get futures and you can get options

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.740 
can get futures and you can get options
on<00:03:01.650> crunchers<00:03:02.130> so<00:03:02.580> it's<00:03:02.819> the<00:03:03.030> whole<00:03:03.269> panoply

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
on crunchers so it's the whole panoply

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.210 
on crunchers so it's the whole panoply
of<00:03:03.989> derivative<00:03:04.709> you<00:03:04.800> have<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:04.980> got<00:03:05.100> your

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
of derivative you have you got your

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.800 
of derivative you have you got your
broker<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:05.580> can't<00:03:05.790> trade<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.120> mean<00:03:06.360> you<00:03:06.630> can't

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
broker you can't trade I mean you can't

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.900
