okay<00:01:02.160> I'm<00:01:02.629> for<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.719> channel<00:01:03.989> viewer<00:01:04.170> that

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
okay I'm for the channel viewer that

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.230 
okay I'm for the channel viewer that
asked<00:01:04.559> for<00:01:04.589> this<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:05.040> okay<00:01:05.400> but<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.790> would<00:01:05.939> get

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
asked for this it's okay but I would get

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.700

something a lot better for this too

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.370 
something a lot better for this too
because<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.729> really<00:01:08.939> doesn't<00:01:09.200> fulfill<00:01:10.200> all

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
because it really doesn't fulfill all

watch I can't do it super fun I guess I

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.440 
watch I can't do it super fun I guess I
can<00:02:07.280> you<00:02:08.280> like<00:02:08.489> when<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.789> first<00:02:08.940> turn<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.300> on

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
can you like when you first turn it on

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.059 
can you like when you first turn it on
you<00:02:09.569> got<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.810> do<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.020> super<00:02:10.200> slow<00:02:10.440> like<00:02:10.860> this

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
you got to do it super slow like this

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.220 
you got to do it super slow like this
like<00:02:11.790> because<00:02:12.180> it'll<00:02:12.390> just<00:02:12.420> be<00:02:12.720> booting<00:02:13.020> up<00:02:13.080> or

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
like because it'll just be booting up or

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.559 
like because it'll just be booting up or
whatever<00:02:13.819> see<00:02:14.819> you<00:02:14.910> know<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.239> didn't<00:02:15.420> work

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
whatever see you know that didn't work

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.300 
whatever see you know that didn't work
at<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:15.750> time<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.530> then<00:02:16.770> other<00:02:16.920> times<00:02:16.980> I

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
at that time and then other times I

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.290 
at that time and then other times I
think<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:17.640> when<00:02:17.790> it's<00:02:17.910> warmed<00:02:18.150> up<00:02:18.209> you

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
think of it when it's warmed up you

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.890 
think of it when it's warmed up you
could<00:02:18.420> do<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.540> super<00:02:18.780> fast<00:02:18.959> um

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
could do it super fast um

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.660 
could do it super fast um
the<00:02:21.900> sound<00:02:22.230> quality<00:02:22.739> and<00:02:22.830> this<00:02:23.040> thing<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.340> ok

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
the sound quality and this thing is ok

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.330 
the sound quality and this thing is ok
it's<00:02:23.880> decent<00:02:24.390> but<00:02:24.630> you<00:02:25.620> know<00:02:25.709> plugging<00:02:26.190> some

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
it's decent but you know plugging some

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.020 
it's decent but you know plugging some
headphones<00:02:26.489> I'm<00:02:26.820> sure<00:02:27.000> it'll<00:02:27.120> be<00:02:27.239> ok<00:02:29.030> what

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
headphones I'm sure it'll be ok what
