 be vigilant because at the end of the video 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.699

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:38.170
 making videos of how you can earn it 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.239
 As you can see, this is the box where we 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.100
 comes this product as you see here puts 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.499

 your language and with axis 402 this is the 

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:48.489
 model that we're going to draw as 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.890
 I have commented is the fastest mouse 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.749
 of the market and well we have different 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.069
 little cracks for example informs us 

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:55.600
 to see if I can focus it well so that 

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:57.670
 you read it if you want some of you 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.679
 and jr turn because it has a sensor 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.789
 optical that milk is to know that it has 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:02.170
 a lot of speed that can also be 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:03.460
 adjust the one of pib is where we are going to see 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.809
 a moment the box we will see what is it 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.119
 that incorporates the open 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.619
 to see how I could teach it then 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.090
 I'm going to open it as you can see it's pretty 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:17.710
 easy then and we have here we go 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:19.060
 to remove this plastic moment and here 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.710
 what we have now I think that better 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.640
 no role here inside good if I left 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:28.220
 Someone else to see what this is 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.200

 this here as the time comes in 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.510
 this case we are going to remove it and attract it 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.510

 for is a bullshit but not 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.190
 it is noteworthy to have a rest of two or not 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.170

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.959

 buttons of the mice we go here true 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.260
 because this mouse is also how it is 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.700

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.040
 here it serves equally you can except of 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.780

 configurables already come with some 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.690
 factory configuration but this one 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.400
 here above all is made to change 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.060
 of weapon for example this of this mouse 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.269
 is specialized in fps ie in 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.859
 shooters then this mouse is worth 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.500
