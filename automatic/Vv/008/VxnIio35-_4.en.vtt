touch<00:02:59.340> they're<00:03:00.209> going<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.390> absolutely<00:03:00.540> screw

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
touch they're going to absolutely screw

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.650 
touch they're going to absolutely screw
me<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:02.100> doesn't<00:03:02.459> look<00:03:02.490> good<00:03:02.760> at<00:03:02.820> all<00:03:03.150> so

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
me and it doesn't look good at all so

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.660 
me and it doesn't look good at all so
that's<00:03:04.170> one<00:03:04.350> of<00:03:04.380> that's<00:03:04.650> probably<00:03:04.830> my<00:03:05.130> biggest

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
that's one of that's probably my biggest

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.730 
that's one of that's probably my biggest
tip<00:03:05.940> for<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.150> guys<00:03:06.300> is<00:03:06.540> do<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.440> next

tip for you guys is do that the next
thing<00:03:07.830> is<00:03:08.010> if<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.459> if<00:03:08.850> you<00:03:09.060> ever<00:03:09.180> you<00:03:09.540> know<00:03:09.570> a

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
thing is if you if you ever you know a

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.140 
thing is if you if you ever you know a
lot<00:03:10.530> of<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.740> hardcore<00:03:11.160> fifa<00:03:11.459> players<00:03:11.700> used<00:03:11.970> it

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
lot of the hardcore fifa players used it

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.880 
lot of the hardcore fifa players used it
but<00:03:12.270> it<00:03:12.390> was<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:13.110> left<00:03:13.350> trigger<00:03:13.560> right

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
but it was a the left trigger right

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.120 
but it was a the left trigger right
trigger<00:03:13.920> skill<00:03:14.580> dribble<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.120> in<00:03:16.050> fifa<00:03:16.500> 12<00:03:16.920> it

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
trigger skill dribble and in fifa 12 it

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.410 
trigger skill dribble and in fifa 12 it
was<00:03:17.250> more<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.459> a<00:03:17.580> thing<00:03:17.760> like<00:03:17.880> you<00:03:17.940> do<00:03:18.180> that<00:03:18.330> and

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
was more of a thing like you do that and

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.320 
was more of a thing like you do that and
give<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:19.050> a<00:03:19.080> crazy<00:03:19.530> boost<00:03:20.040> of<00:03:20.250> pace<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.670> you

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
give you a crazy boost of pace and you

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.120 
give you a crazy boost of pace and you
could<00:03:21.510> sprint<00:03:21.780> past<00:03:21.989> defenders<00:03:22.320> different

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
could sprint past defenders different

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.580 
could sprint past defenders different
instead<00:03:23.489> of<00:03:23.670> this<00:03:23.880> all<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.840> get<00:03:25.019> is<00:03:25.080> really

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
instead of this all you get is really

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.680 
instead of this all you get is really
you<00:03:25.980> know<00:03:26.100> that<00:03:26.250> booster<00:03:26.580> pace<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:27.150> still<00:03:27.480> do

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
you know that booster pace you still do

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.110 
you know that booster pace you still do
get<00:03:27.930> that<00:03:28.110> when<00:03:28.320> you<00:03:28.470> when<00:03:28.769> you<00:03:28.940> exit<00:03:29.940> in<00:03:30.030> the

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
get that when you when you exit in the

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.640 
get that when you when you exit in the
right<00:03:30.330> angle<00:03:30.750> so<00:03:30.900> if<00:03:30.989> you<00:03:31.080> get<00:03:31.200> at<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.440> perfect

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
right angle so if you get at the perfect

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.220 
right angle so if you get at the perfect
angle<00:03:31.920> you<00:03:32.489> can<00:03:32.670> accelerate<00:03:33.030> at<00:03:33.420> really<00:03:33.959> fast

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
angle you can accelerate at really fast

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.800 
angle you can accelerate at really fast
speeds<00:03:34.560> but<00:03:35.070> it's<00:03:35.250> more<00:03:35.489> use<00:03:35.820> now<00:03:36.120> where<00:03:36.570> your

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
speeds but it's more use now where your

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.390 
speeds but it's more use now where your
feet<00:03:37.050> start<00:03:37.320> to<00:03:37.350> get<00:03:37.530> tricky<00:03:37.890> you<00:03:38.010> start<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.340> be

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
feet start to get tricky you start to be

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.880 
feet start to get tricky you start to be
able<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.610> jinx<00:03:38.910> round<00:03:39.180> defenders<00:03:39.930> and<00:03:40.080> the

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
able to jinx round defenders and the

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.100 
able to jinx round defenders and the
game<00:03:41.100> is<00:03:41.310> drastically<00:03:42.000> like<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.570> pace<00:03:42.810> in<00:03:43.019> the

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
game is drastically like the pace in the

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.070 
game is drastically like the pace in the
game<00:03:43.320> is<00:03:43.500> much<00:03:43.980> slower<00:03:44.190> so<00:03:44.780> dribbling<00:03:45.780> stats

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
game is much slower so dribbling stats

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.110 
game is much slower so dribbling stats
passing<00:03:46.950> stats<00:03:47.130> are<00:03:47.340> gonna<00:03:47.459> come<00:03:47.640> into<00:03:47.910> play<00:03:48.090> a

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
passing stats are gonna come into play a

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.479 
passing stats are gonna come into play a
whole<00:03:48.510> lot<00:03:48.720> more<00:03:48.930> than<00:03:48.989> your<00:03:49.380> usual<00:03:49.500> just<00:03:49.950> pace

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
whole lot more than your usual just pace

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.790 
whole lot more than your usual just pace
pace<00:03:50.760> pace<00:03:50.820> pace<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:51.570> mean<00:03:51.930> obviously<00:03:52.080> in<00:03:52.560> any

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
pace pace pace I mean obviously in any

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.470 
pace pace pace I mean obviously in any
fifa<00:03:53.190> game<00:03:53.370> pace<00:03:53.610> is<00:03:53.820> going<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.120> be<00:03:54.239> quite<00:03:54.450> a

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
fifa game pace is going to be quite a

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.960 
fifa game pace is going to be quite a
big<00:03:54.660> factor<00:03:54.900> but<00:03:55.530> i<00:03:55.890> can<00:03:56.190> guarantee<00:03:56.400> you<00:03:56.670> in

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
big factor but i can guarantee you in

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.420 
big factor but i can guarantee you in
fifa<00:03:57.269> 13<00:03:57.300> pace<00:03:57.930> will<00:03:58.170> not<00:03:58.350> be<00:03:58.470> as<00:03:58.590> big<00:03:58.739> as<00:03:58.890> big

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
fifa 13 pace will not be as big as big

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.699 
fifa 13 pace will not be as big as big
of<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.670> factor<00:03:59.880> as<00:04:00.239> you<00:04:00.989> guys<00:04:01.170> have<00:04:01.320> previously

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
of a factor as you guys have previously

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.170 
of a factor as you guys have previously
seen<00:04:01.830> in<00:04:02.040> FIFA's<00:04:02.400> which<00:04:02.550> makes<00:04:02.790> it<00:04:02.940> really

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
seen in FIFA's which makes it really

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.600 
seen in FIFA's which makes it really
cool<00:04:03.450> for<00:04:03.660> me<00:04:03.750> because<00:04:04.010> fifa<00:04:05.010> 13<00:04:05.040> really

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
cool for me because fifa 13 really

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.520 
cool for me because fifa 13 really
promotes<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.239> idea<00:04:06.269> of<00:04:06.750> build<00:04:06.959> up<00:04:07.140> play<00:04:07.230> the

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
promotes the idea of build up play the

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.350 
promotes the idea of build up play the
passing<00:04:07.950> play<00:04:08.160> but<00:04:08.640> it's<00:04:08.790> not<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.120> point

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
passing play but it's not to the point

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.990 
passing play but it's not to the point
where<00:04:09.630> you<00:04:10.530> know<00:04:10.650> it's<00:04:11.130> a<00:04:11.250> full<00:04:11.670> possession

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
where you know it's a full possession

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.370 
where you know it's a full possession
game<00:04:12.180> you<00:04:12.420> still<00:04:12.570> have<00:04:12.720> those<00:04:12.840> moments<00:04:13.049> where

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
game you still have those moments where

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.020 
game you still have those moments where
you<00:04:13.470> just<00:04:13.500> want<00:04:13.799> to<00:04:13.860> play<00:04:14.549> that<00:04:14.580> killer

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
you just want to play that killer

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.120 
you just want to play that killer
through<00:04:15.360> ball<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:15.810> you<00:04:16.470> know<00:04:16.590> just<00:04:16.769> sprint

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
through ball and you know just sprint

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.830 
through ball and you know just sprint
all<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.310> way<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.519> the<00:04:17.729> other<00:04:17.850> end<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:18.299> put<00:04:18.750> it

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
all the way to the other end and put it

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.320 
all the way to the other end and put it
in<00:04:18.959> but<00:04:19.229> so<00:04:20.010> it's<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.280> really<00:04:20.489> solid<00:04:20.760> mix<00:04:21.120> and

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
in but so it's a really solid mix and

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.050 
in but so it's a really solid mix and
that's<00:04:21.450> what<00:04:21.570> i<00:04:21.600> like<00:04:21.810> about<00:04:21.840> it<00:04:23.060> obviously

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
that's what i like about it obviously

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.790 
that's what i like about it obviously
for<00:04:24.330> me<00:04:24.479> i'm<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.960> attacking<00:04:25.440> tell

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
for me i'm the attacking tell

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.520 
for me i'm the attacking tell
aka<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.699> way<00:04:27.300> these<00:04:27.539> players<00:04:27.870> make<00:04:28.199> their<00:04:28.379> run

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
aka the way these players make their run

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.230 
aka the way these players make their run
so<00:04:28.770> they<00:04:28.860> make<00:04:29.009> darting<00:04:29.460> runs<00:04:29.699> through<00:04:30.060> the

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
so they make darting runs through the

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.899 
so they make darting runs through the
pitch<00:04:30.560> which<00:04:31.560> really<00:04:31.949> helps<00:04:32.280> me<00:04:32.310> out<00:04:32.460> anyways

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:32.909 
pitch which really helps me out anyways

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:34.850 
pitch which really helps me out anyways
because<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:33.629> don't<00:04:34.229> know<00:04:34.289> if<00:04:34.379> you<00:04:34.500> guys<00:04:34.620> knew

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
because I don't know if you guys knew

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.520 
because I don't know if you guys knew
but<00:04:35.009> if<00:04:35.099> you<00:04:35.190> hold<00:04:35.400> left<00:04:35.610> bumper<00:04:35.849> it<00:04:36.810> forces

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
but if you hold left bumper it forces

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.680 
but if you hold left bumper it forces
the<00:04:37.710> CPU<00:04:38.099> to<00:04:38.280> make<00:04:38.430> a<00:04:38.460> manual<00:04:38.789> run<00:04:39.090> on<00:04:39.240> fifa<00:04:39.479> 12

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
the CPU to make a manual run on fifa 12

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.950 
the CPU to make a manual run on fifa 12
now<00:04:40.169> they<00:04:40.409> do<00:04:40.470> a<00:04:40.650> lot<00:04:41.159> more<00:04:41.930> automatically<00:04:42.930> i

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
now they do a lot more automatically i

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.350 
now they do a lot more automatically i
think<00:04:43.229> is<00:04:43.319> the<00:04:43.440> word<00:04:43.620> you<00:04:44.550> know<00:04:44.580> they<00:04:45.000> just<00:04:45.150> do

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
think is the word you know they just do

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.360 
think is the word you know they just do
it<00:04:45.389> without<00:04:45.840> you<00:04:46.169> having<00:04:46.440> to<00:04:46.590> command<00:04:47.159> them<00:04:47.340> to

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
it without you having to command them to

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.969 
it without you having to command them to
do<00:04:47.580> it<00:04:47.699> and<00:04:47.849> not<00:04:48.479> only<00:04:48.629> that<00:04:48.780> but<00:04:48.990> one<00:04:49.680> of<00:04:49.770> one

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
do it and not only that but one of one

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:51.230 
do it and not only that but one of one
of<00:04:50.039> the<00:04:50.099> awesome<00:04:50.490> things<00:04:50.520> is<00:04:50.879> and<00:04:51.090> they've

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
of the awesome things is and they've

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.089 
of the awesome things is and they've
done<00:04:51.360> it<00:04:51.419> a<00:04:51.509> few<00:04:51.569> times<00:04:51.780> for<00:04:52.080> me<00:04:52.199> is<00:04:52.379> they'll

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
done it a few times for me is they'll

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:54.800 
done it a few times for me is they'll
run<00:04:53.370> or<00:04:53.639> they'll<00:04:54.000> run<00:04:54.240> and<00:04:54.509> then<00:04:54.659> they'll

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
run or they'll run and then they'll

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.330 
run or they'll run and then they'll
realize<00:04:55.050> they're<00:04:55.199> offside<00:04:55.560> so<00:04:56.009> they'll<00:04:56.159> kind

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
realize they're offside so they'll kind

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.680 
realize they're offside so they'll kind
of<00:04:56.520> pull<00:04:56.699> back<00:04:56.970> a<00:04:57.000> little<00:04:57.150> bit<00:04:57.479> and<00:04:57.629> then

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
of pull back a little bit and then

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.330 
of pull back a little bit and then
they'll<00:04:58.259> can<00:04:58.409> then<00:04:58.680> we'll<00:04:58.800> start<00:04:59.039> with<00:04:59.190> their

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
they'll can then we'll start with their

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.070 
they'll can then we'll start with their
run<00:04:59.460> again<00:04:59.669> when<00:04:59.819> you<00:04:59.909> feel<00:05:00.090> as<00:05:00.240> though<00:05:00.389> they

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
run again when you feel as though they

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.439 
run again when you feel as though they
want<00:05:01.500> the<00:05:01.620> past<00:05:01.830> so<00:05:02.159> that<00:05:02.340> works<00:05:02.849> out<00:05:03.060> so

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:03.449 
want the past so that works out so

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:05.119 
want the past so that works out so
nicely<00:05:03.659> and<00:05:04.020> when<00:05:04.110> you<00:05:04.199> actually<00:05:04.349> see<00:05:04.800> it<00:05:04.889> done

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:05.129 
nicely and when you actually see it done

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:07.129 
nicely and when you actually see it done
you're<00:05:05.610> like<00:05:05.759> damn<00:05:06.090> like<00:05:06.150> if<00:05:06.479> he<00:05:06.719> if<00:05:06.930> he<00:05:07.050> had

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
you're like damn like if he if he had

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:08.480 
you're like damn like if he if he had
just<00:05:07.319> kept<00:05:07.530> going<00:05:07.800> like<00:05:07.830> he<00:05:08.069> would<00:05:08.250> have<00:05:08.370> been

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
just kept going like he would have been

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.629 
just kept going like he would have been
fifa<00:05:08.909> and<00:05:09.409> in<00:05:10.409> fifa<00:05:10.770> 12<00:05:10.979> like<00:05:11.190> I<00:05:11.219> would<00:05:11.430> just

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
fifa and in fifa 12 like I would just

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:13.369 
fifa and in fifa 12 like I would just
had<00:05:11.729> no<00:05:11.969> chance<00:05:12.210> the<00:05:12.479> attacking<00:05:12.780> option<00:05:13.259> there

00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:13.379 
had no chance the attacking option there

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:14.869 
had no chance the attacking option there
would<00:05:13.500> have<00:05:13.560> been<00:05:13.620> completely<00:05:14.039> gone<00:05:14.280> and<00:05:14.430> a

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:14.879 
would have been completely gone and a

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:16.939 
would have been completely gone and a
chance<00:05:15.120> wasted<00:05:15.599> but<00:05:15.690> these<00:05:15.870> guys<00:05:16.050> are<00:05:16.319> these

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 
chance wasted but these guys are these

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.050 
chance wasted but these guys are these
guys<00:05:17.099> are<00:05:17.310> really<00:05:17.400> good<00:05:17.639> and<00:05:17.759> one<00:05:17.879> of<00:05:17.969> the

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
guys are really good and one of the

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.850 
guys are really good and one of the
things<00:05:18.090> that<00:05:18.419> I<00:05:18.569> get<00:05:18.870> asked<00:05:19.169> a<00:05:19.199> lot<00:05:19.229> is<00:05:19.500> you

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
things that I get asked a lot is you

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.050 
things that I get asked a lot is you
know<00:05:19.979> they<00:05:20.099> improve<00:05:20.580> the<00:05:20.759> attacking

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
know they improve the attacking

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.999 
know they improve the attacking
intelligence<00:05:21.719> what<00:05:22.259> did<00:05:22.349> they<00:05:22.440> do<00:05:22.500> to<00:05:22.650> the

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:23.009 
intelligence what did they do to the

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:24.350 
intelligence what did they do to the
defense<00:05:23.520> you<00:05:23.639> know<00:05:23.759> what<00:05:23.879> the<00:05:23.969> defense<00:05:24.240> just

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
defense you know what the defense just

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.629 
defense you know what the defense just
going<00:05:24.569> to<00:05:24.629> get<00:05:24.719> completely<00:05:25.250> crapped<00:05:26.250> on<00:05:26.400> and

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
going to get completely crapped on and

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.909 
going to get completely crapped on and
the<00:05:27.300> truth<00:05:27.509> to<00:05:27.539> that<00:05:27.719> is<00:05:27.930> the<00:05:28.259> defense<00:05:28.590> works

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
the truth to that is the defense works

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.760 
the truth to that is the defense works
still<00:05:29.580> very<00:05:29.789> well<00:05:30.000> contained<00:05:30.449> and<00:05:30.690> it's<00:05:31.500> still

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
still very well contained and it's still

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.370 
still very well contained and it's still
powerful<00:05:32.219> but<00:05:32.849> very<00:05:33.210> much<00:05:33.449> more<00:05:33.719> balanced<00:05:34.229> and

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
powerful but very much more balanced and

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.100 
powerful but very much more balanced and
as<00:05:34.860> you<00:05:35.009> can<00:05:35.159> see<00:05:35.190> I<00:05:35.340> went<00:05:35.729> for<00:05:35.909> that<00:05:36.060> the<00:05:36.840> trick

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
as you can see I went for that the trick

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.830 
as you can see I went for that the trick
where<00:05:37.319> you<00:05:37.349> it's<00:05:38.250> a<00:05:38.340> standing<00:05:39.120> fake<00:05:39.360> shot<00:05:39.630> and

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
where you it's a standing fake shot and

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.749 
where you it's a standing fake shot and
you<00:05:40.169> just<00:05:40.380> kick<00:05:40.919> and<00:05:41.099> you<00:05:41.159> completely<00:05:41.460> missed

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 
you just kick and you completely missed

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.070 
you just kick and you completely missed
a<00:05:41.819> ball<00:05:41.940> obviously<00:05:42.300> it's<00:05:42.449> on<00:05:42.539> purpose<00:05:42.900> and

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
a ball obviously it's on purpose and

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.469 
a ball obviously it's on purpose and
it's<00:05:43.979> meant<00:05:44.190> to<00:05:44.279> fool<00:05:44.520> the<00:05:44.669> defender<00:05:45.029> but<00:05:45.180> you

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
it's meant to fool the defender but you

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:46.969 
it's meant to fool the defender but you
know<00:05:45.569> it<00:05:45.659> doesn't<00:05:45.690> work<00:05:46.020> all<00:05:46.259> the<00:05:46.409> time<00:05:46.440> it

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
know it doesn't work all the time it

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.499 
know it doesn't work all the time it
works<00:05:47.130> occasionally<00:05:47.520> but<00:05:47.969> it's<00:05:48.120> more<00:05:48.240> of<00:05:48.300> one

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:48.509 
works occasionally but it's more of one

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:49.820 
works occasionally but it's more of one
of<00:05:48.599> those<00:05:48.690> show-off<00:05:49.050> skills<00:05:49.349> that<00:05:49.469> you<00:05:49.529> do<00:05:49.680> and

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
of those show-off skills that you do and

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.589 
of those show-off skills that you do and
if<00:05:50.460> you<00:05:50.520> guys<00:05:50.639> are<00:05:50.789> interested<00:05:50.969> in<00:05:51.210> how<00:05:51.330> to<00:05:51.360> do

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:51.599 
if you guys are interested in how to do

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:53.450 
if you guys are interested in how to do
that<00:05:51.719> it's<00:05:51.930> just<00:05:52.259> a<00:05:52.349> simple<00:05:52.680> hold<00:05:53.190> left

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
that it's just a simple hold left

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.920 
that it's just a simple hold left
trigger<00:05:53.699> and<00:05:54.029> do<00:05:54.120> a<00:05:54.150> fake<00:05:54.449> shot<00:05:54.750> while

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
trigger and do a fake shot while

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.140 
trigger and do a fake shot while
standing<00:05:55.259> still<00:05:55.469> and<00:05:55.860> he<00:05:56.219> should<00:05:56.460> do<00:05:56.610> and<00:05:56.849> I've

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
standing still and he should do and I've
