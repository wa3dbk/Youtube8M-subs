 More or less, you 're going to take it off. 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.489
 What are you going to do is take the shell off everyone? 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.850
 to mine and 600 at home because with the shell 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.819
 you can not dilute in water lino then I 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.640
 have to take his bark can all 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.590
 take the young bark and peanut in 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.260
 blender or something else 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.720
 that you have to grind together and 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.980
 play there and turn on the blender to 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.980
 that it can grind 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.330
 it's beauty take the peanut you 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.170
 triturado the name is it with the others 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.940
 products 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.800
 Now we're almost finished. 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.110
 here everyone has just to 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.390
 mix can rest easy I'll accelerate 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.190
 and now you just have to mix paper 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.620
 as homogeneous as possible so that 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.060
 nutrients that this product time without 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.420
 more distributed 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.150
 I then this is the final product I will 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.280
 Now leave the screen after you finish 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.410
 This part I will leave on the screen all 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.080
 the information and nutritional 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.760
 time, or each portion being about 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.680
 100 grams function 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.900
 how many calories and what the price will 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.280
 stay then I recommend to you that it is 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.790
 much better than buying an ip 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.410
 together with some store that only 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.600
 It is bad compound that you are 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.790
 buying wrong thinking that the caloric ip 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.800
 registration is very low so I do 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.440
 I know you're sure of the food. 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.040
 then guys earned it spoke to the 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.040
 next video
