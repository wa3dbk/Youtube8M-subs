Sahara Desert in the middle of the
summer<00:02:25.640> with<00:02:26.510> temperatures<00:02:27.019> up<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.470> 55

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
summer with temperatures up to 55

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.760 
summer with temperatures up to 55
degrees<00:02:28.550> Celsius<00:02:29.450> so<00:02:29.540> that<00:02:30.410> was<00:02:30.530> quite<00:02:30.650> tough

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
degrees Celsius so that was quite tough

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.370 
degrees Celsius so that was quite tough
but<00:02:32.730> yeah<00:02:33.210> hopefully<00:02:33.510> this<00:02:33.810> is<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.050> easy<00:02:34.140> bit

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
but yeah hopefully this is the easy bit

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.250 
but yeah hopefully this is the easy bit
now<00:02:34.560> I'm<00:02:34.680> in<00:02:34.770> Egypt<00:02:35.120> well<00:02:36.120> for<00:02:36.600> me<00:02:36.720> it's<00:02:37.200> all

now I'm in Egypt well for me it's all
about<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.560> walking<00:02:38.010> because<00:02:38.340> it's<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.850> the

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
about the walking because it's the the

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.480 
about the walking because it's the the
slowest<00:02:39.990> form<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.440> transport<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.130> know<00:02:41.250> it's

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
slowest form of transport you know it's

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.310 
slowest form of transport you know it's
it's<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.940> only<00:02:42.120> way<00:02:42.330> that<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:42.660> can<00:02:42.840> interact

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
it's the only way that you can interact

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.190 
it's the only way that you can interact
and<00:02:43.620> engage<00:02:43.770> with<00:02:44.160> people<00:02:44.310> along<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.790> way<00:02:45.200> and
