00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 salve salve emerson Luis with 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.319
 another video lesson for you guys 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.800
 good people returning our regions from 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.450
 windows serves a little box where it is 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.980
 here the installation 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.830
 we created the virtual machine and 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.510
 installed windows server 2008 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.580
 Now I'm going to show you how we 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.949
 to configure the IP address of the 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.859
 our server that will be 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.349
 configured on the rock network 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.820
 I came here in my virtual machine 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.820
 I will be okay 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:43.110
 I'll connect my server to let me start 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.840
 remembering that I did the following is is a 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.360
 server has two network cards one 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.110
 NIC will be the one that will have 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.440
 Internet access and over again and the network 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:02.059
 internal so we will rename the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.059
 two interfaces and let's configure them ok 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.100
 week that the control alt del'll go 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.030
 with the password that the registration 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.030
 when i did the installation of windows 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.770
 beauty I just scored inside 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.720
 system 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.259
 Now I'll do the following just to stay. 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.280
 the easier it is that my administration 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.400
 inside the server 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.369
 I'll do it right here O 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.229
 on my computer show in the 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.000
 work that happens 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.070
 I just put the icon on my 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.280
 computer on the desktop 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.280
 I'm right here in my document too. 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.280
 administrator 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:55.090
 here's the control panel and that's it 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.220
 This is it for now or click here. 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.040
 in this option where it shows the network card 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.560
 my computer were under the board 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.000
 network is linked to click here central 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.710
 sharing network 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.170
 stay here and even if there are network connections 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.790
 and will show the two interfaces look only 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.490
 the two network cards from my server 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.580
 plate 1 will be the nat plate put here 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.580
 O 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:33.070
 nati or internet 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.800
 the network card that is connected to the 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:39.280
 network router is a network suite 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:47.520
 ok this one the plate 2 will serve the network 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:47.520
 internal internal 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.760
 I just renamed your interface now 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.280
 because it is renowned to identify 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.630
 interface will do for example this 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.350
 interface will receive from the internet looks is 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.350
 automatic 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.200
 this second interface and configure a 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.760
 ip address in it other than the 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:18.630
 internet than the network ip address 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:23.709
 right internal 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:26.980
 there was here in the tcp ip version 4 protocol 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:38.670
 use the following ip address or add 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:42.750
 the ip address is now at 2,172 points 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.750
 16.20 point 1 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:50.890
 here the air raising mark 255 255 255 a 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.550
 sub brand I'll have a personal network 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.230
 mass to climb to the network at 24 or 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.050
 this network mask my network 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.430
 can have up to 240 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:04.320
 4 254 holtz on the network or if it is any 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.720
 equipment that obtains the address 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.750
 ip can be a television with access to the 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.520
 internet on the cell phone that has wi-fi 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:17.790
 getting the ip of your router from your network is 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:20.220
 notebook is desktop computer and server 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.690
 everything come get ip address one 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.360
 host is personal 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.300
 The gamer here I do not need to put him 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.160
 because because he's going to be the ghetto himself 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.660
 of the internal network then this is the address 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:38.130
 ip from my server 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:40.890
 It's okay, okay, okay, beauty to the internal network . 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.200
 the unidentified network because it has not yet 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.030
 has no machine on the network if 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.730
 communicating that its internal network 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.080
 It's good, then, in this video lesson, I do not know. 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.170
 For you, how do you do it? 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:55.710
 identify our network interfaces 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:58.350
 server network cards and also 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.500
 set up in p &amp; d manual form 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.980
 On this network card, okay, I'll minimize 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:08.000
 here ends the video lesson until the next 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.000
