00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.009
 and metformin to lose weight is 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.500
 one of the pills with better effects 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.350
 to avoid gaining weight and to burn 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.440
 fat but if we do not want to use the

 what happens there are other ways to imitate 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.759
 the effects of metformin but of 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.730
 safest way natural and without effects 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:23.339
 secondary the pancreas produces insulin 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.949
 which is responsible for regulating glucose 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:27.630
 in the body there are certain foods 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.759
 that greatly improve the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.829
 operation of the pancreas and 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.350
 control glucose levels in the 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:37.500
 body below I will tell you the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.600
 main cinnamon has been shown to 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.760
 cinnamon increases the sensitivity of the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.100
 insulin while maintaining stable 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.410
 glucose levels and in turn avoiding 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.410
 that certain carbohydrates are converted 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.870
 in grease green tea to keep stable 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.410
 Glucose levels are recommended 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.020
 3 to 7 cups a day ginseng in case 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.540
 there is already an overweight insulin 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.490
 loses its effectiveness however the 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.030
 ginseng is responsible for returning it to its 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.850
 normal state 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.890
 It has a lot of fiber which was demonstrated in 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.320
 an experiment that to the people who 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.360
 they consumed more amount of fiber saw 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.880
 reduced the amount of sugar in the 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.860
 incredibly blood these are the 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.810
 main foods that will serve us 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.759
 to regulate glucose in our 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.399
 body therefore replacing the 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.070
 metformin there are other vegetables and 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.229
 fruits that can also help 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.040

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:52.030
 functioning of the pancreas if we align

 these vegetables with vinegar much better 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.740
 even since this also helps
