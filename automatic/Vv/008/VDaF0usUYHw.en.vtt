page as of today now there's two of them
one<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:11.639> shown<00:00:12.090> on<00:00:12.240> screen<00:00:12.420> which<00:00:12.960> I'm<00:00:13.139> going

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
one is shown on screen which I'm going

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.039 
one is shown on screen which I'm going
to<00:00:13.559> analyze<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.670> read<00:00:15.059> what<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.389> on<00:00:15.480> screen<00:00:15.870> if

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
to analyze and read what is on screen if

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.570 
to analyze and read what is on screen if
you<00:00:16.080> guys<00:00:16.320> cannot<00:00:16.710> read<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.160> because<00:00:17.460> it

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
you guys cannot read that because it

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.250 
you guys cannot read that because it
isn't<00:00:17.880> cursive<00:00:18.240> so<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.900> little<00:00:19.109> bit

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
isn't cursive so it is a little bit

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.689 
isn't cursive so it is a little bit
difficult<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.710> read<00:00:19.949> then<00:00:20.430> we're<00:00:20.550> going<00:00:20.640> to

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
difficult to read then we're going to

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.820 
difficult to read then we're going to
analyze<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.210> second<00:00:21.600> one<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.410> first<00:00:22.650> one

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
analyze the second one so the first one

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.519 
analyze the second one so the first one
seems<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.460> be<00:00:23.580> an<00:00:23.730> anonymous<00:00:24.330> note<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:25.199> a

me<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.880> believe<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> journal

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
me to believe that this is a journal

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.550 
me to believe that this is a journal
entry<00:01:49.649> from<00:01:50.189> Dr<00:01:50.640> Maxis<00:01:50.880> writing<00:01:51.810> about<00:01:52.020> dr.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
entry from Dr Maxis writing about dr.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.740 
entry from Dr Maxis writing about dr.
Richtofen<00:01:52.950> now<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.729> reason<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.180> think<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.540> is

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
Richtofen now the reason I think this is

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.230 
Richtofen now the reason I think this is
because<00:01:55.140> we<00:01:55.439> know<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.680> dr.<00:01:56.250> rift<00:01:56.399> Richthofen

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
because we know that dr. rift Richthofen

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.190 
because we know that dr. rift Richthofen
begins<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.320> become<00:01:58.439> insane<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.790> maybe<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.930> is

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
begins to become insane so maybe this is

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.100 
begins to become insane so maybe this is
Dr<00:02:01.710> Maxis<00:02:01.890> noticing<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.000> first<00:02:03.329> changes<00:02:03.960> of

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
Dr Maxis noticing the first changes of

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.249 
Dr Maxis noticing the first changes of
Richthofen<00:02:04.770> before<00:02:05.549> richtofen<00:02:06.210> decides<00:02:06.840> to

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
Richthofen before richtofen decides to

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.609 
Richthofen before richtofen decides to
lock<00:02:07.970> Samantha<00:02:08.970> Maxis<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.690> fluffy<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.500> the

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
lock Samantha Maxis and fluffy in the

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.130 
lock Samantha Maxis and fluffy in the
teleporter<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.730> maybe<00:02:12.180> this

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
teleporter so maybe this

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.380 
teleporter so maybe this
is<00:02:13.200> or<00:02:13.950> at<00:02:14.040> least<00:02:14.100> I<00:02:14.310> think<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.760> this<00:02:14.880> letter

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
is or at least I think that this letter

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.590 
is or at least I think that this letter
is<00:02:15.690> written<00:02:16.170> about<00:02:16.530> dr.<00:02:17.040> Richtofen<00:02:17.610> from<00:02:18.240> dr.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
is written about dr. Richtofen from dr.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.290 
is written about dr. Richtofen from dr.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.790

Maxis is referring to the newfound

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.980 
Maxis is referring to the newfound
element<00:02:26.280> which<00:02:26.520> I'm<00:02:26.670> assuming<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.390> 115

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
element which I'm assuming is the 115

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.550 
element which I'm assuming is the 115
element<00:02:28.580> and<00:02:29.580> obviously<00:02:30.570> stayed<00:02:31.200> in<00:02:31.350> them

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560

stated<00:02:32.160> in<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.370> letter<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.760> newfound

stated in the letter the newfound

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.710 
stated in the letter the newfound
element<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:34.340> risky<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:36.350> maxis<00:02:37.350> is<00:02:37.560> willing<00:02:38.130> to

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
element is risky and maxis is willing to

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.970 
element is risky and maxis is willing to
participate<00:02:39.720> in<00:02:40.230> work<00:02:40.470> with<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.709> newfound

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
participate in work with a newfound

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.100 
participate in work with a newfound
element<00:02:41.640> even<00:02:42.000> though<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.480> risks<00:02:42.660> are

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
element even though the risks are

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.740 
element even though the risks are
outstanding<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.640> that's<00:02:45.090> all<00:02:45.239> I<00:02:45.300> really<00:02:45.600> know

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
outstanding so that's all I really know

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.270 
outstanding so that's all I really know
about<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.080> first<00:02:46.290> letter<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.830> we're<00:02:47.130> going

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
about the second letter along with the

about the second letter along with the
first<00:04:46.830> one<00:04:47.009> I<00:04:47.069> don't<00:04:47.250> really<00:04:47.610> know<00:04:47.819> much<00:04:48.000> about

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
first one I don't really know much about

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.420 
first one I don't really know much about
it<00:04:48.539> I'm<00:04:48.720> just<00:04:49.050> reading<00:04:49.289> the<00:04:49.620> letters<00:04:49.979> and

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
it I'm just reading the letters and

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.219 
it I'm just reading the letters and
giving<00:04:50.789> you<00:04:50.879> guys<00:04:51.060> my<00:04:51.090> input<00:04:51.629> on<00:04:51.750> what<00:04:51.900> I<00:04:51.960> think

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
giving you guys my input on what I think

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.350 
giving you guys my input on what I think
they<00:04:52.349> mean<00:04:52.590> why<00:04:53.250> they<00:04:53.460> were<00:04:53.520> written<00:04:53.849> what<00:04:54.270> the

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
they mean why they were written what the

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.089 
they mean why they were written what the
motives<00:04:54.720> were<00:04:54.870> behind<00:04:55.229> both<00:04:55.650> of<00:04:55.919> these

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
motives were behind both of these

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.700 
motives were behind both of these
letters<00:04:56.370> so<00:04:57.090> considering<00:04:57.810> that<00:04:58.050> two<00:04:58.380> letters

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
letters so considering that two letters

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.320 
letters so considering that two letters
have<00:04:58.919> already<00:04:59.159> been<00:04:59.310> written<00:04:59.490> let's<00:05:00.030> assume

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
have already been written let's assume

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.990 
have already been written let's assume
the<00:05:00.569> first<00:05:00.840> letter<00:05:01.169> was<00:05:01.620> from<00:05:02.099> dr.<00:05:02.639> Richtofen

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
the first letter was from dr. Richtofen

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.510 
the first letter was from dr. Richtofen
instead<00:05:03.569> of<00:05:03.659> Dr<00:05:04.020> Maxis<00:05:04.229> even<00:05:05.159> though<00:05:05.250> in<00:05:05.370> my

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
instead of Dr Maxis even though in my

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.580 
instead of Dr Maxis even though in my
opinion<00:05:05.599> Dr<00:05:06.599> Maxis<00:05:06.780> would<00:05:07.169> make<00:05:07.319> more<00:05:07.530> sense

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
opinion Dr Maxis would make more sense

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.770 
opinion Dr Maxis would make more sense
to<00:05:08.490> have<00:05:08.639> written<00:05:08.849> the<00:05:09.030> letter<00:05:09.210> that's<00:05:09.569> just

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
to have written the letter that's just

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.600 
to have written the letter that's just
the<00:05:09.870> style<00:05:10.110> of<00:05:10.349> the<00:05:10.500> letter<00:05:10.680> so<00:05:11.220> if<00:05:11.460> it<00:05:11.580> is

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
the style of the letter so if it is

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.580 
the style of the letter so if it is
written<00:05:11.940> from<00:05:12.120> dr.<00:05:12.479> Richtofen<00:05:12.840> and<00:05:13.349> the

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
written from dr. Richtofen and the

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.950 
written from dr. Richtofen and the
second<00:05:13.919> one<00:05:14.039> was<00:05:14.069> from<00:05:14.400> Tokyo<00:05:14.849> maybe<00:05:15.539> trick

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
second one was from Tokyo maybe trick

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.990 
second one was from Tokyo maybe trick
will<00:05:16.199> release<00:05:16.500> two<00:05:16.830> more<00:05:16.860> letters<00:05:17.190> one<00:05:17.729> from

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
will release two more letters one from

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.180 
will release two more letters one from
tank<00:05:18.240> Dempsey<00:05:18.630> and<00:05:18.659> another<00:05:19.259> from<00:05:19.650> Nikolai

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
tank Dempsey and another from Nikolai

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.800 
tank Dempsey and another from Nikolai
that<00:05:20.729> would<00:05:20.849> confirm<00:05:21.210> that<00:05:21.270> the<00:05:21.479> four

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
that would confirm that the four

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.480 
that would confirm that the four
characters<00:05:22.259> will<00:05:22.440> be<00:05:22.530> returning<00:05:22.889> in<00:05:23.069> the<00:05:23.190> next

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
characters will be returning in the next

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.879 
characters will be returning in the next
DLC<00:05:23.849> which<00:05:24.120> would<00:05:24.270> be<00:05:24.389> pretty<00:05:24.690> cool<00:05:24.750> so<00:05:25.560> again

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
DLC which would be pretty cool so again

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:27.230 
DLC which would be pretty cool so again
that's<00:05:26.190> all<00:05:26.400> I<00:05:26.460> know<00:05:26.580> about<00:05:26.669> these<00:05:27.000> two

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
that's all I know about these two

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.330 
that's all I know about these two
letters<00:05:27.599> and<00:05:27.900> hopefully<00:05:28.530> Trek<00:05:28.770> will<00:05:28.979> release

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
letters and hopefully Trek will release

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.740 
letters and hopefully Trek will release
two<00:05:29.610> more<00:05:29.639> and<00:05:30.060> I'll<00:05:30.180> be<00:05:30.300> able<00:05:30.389> to<00:05:30.509> make<00:05:30.690> a

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
two more and I'll be able to make a

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.020 
two more and I'll be able to make a
video<00:05:30.960> on<00:05:31.349> both<00:05:31.680> of<00:05:31.710> those<00:05:32.009> with<00:05:32.789> a<00:05:32.819> little

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
video on both of those with a little

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.330 
video on both of those with a little
