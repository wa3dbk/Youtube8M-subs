00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
backlighting pretty easily just as a mom

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.330 
backlighting pretty easily just as a mom
as<00:01:31.690> I<00:01:31.720> on<00:01:32.020> and<00:01:32.230> off<00:01:32.320> and<00:01:32.680> then<00:01:32.770> like<00:01:32.920> a<00:01:32.950> brighter

buttons<00:01:48.970> you<00:01:49.090> can<00:01:49.150> program<00:01:49.570> them<00:01:49.960> to<00:01:50.020> do

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
buttons you can program them to do

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.080 
buttons you can program them to do
basically<00:01:50.830> anything<00:01:51.040> similar<00:01:51.700> to<00:01:51.730> what<00:01:51.850> you

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
would see on like a gaming keyboard so

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.800 
would see on like a gaming keyboard so
that's<00:01:54.550> a<00:01:54.640> really<00:01:54.820> cool<00:01:55.000> feature<00:01:55.180> that<00:01:55.600> not<00:01:55.780> a
