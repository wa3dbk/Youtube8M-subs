00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.810
 Draw a line 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:16.049
 How is it this time I drew a line in the textbook 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.039
 I want to talk about what to do when you get caught + 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.080
 I think 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:25.090
 And maybe you are going to draw a line in your textbook 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.450
 Toka or draw a line to where you say was also drawn do it by, for example, this kind of line I think I do this 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.869
 Ne 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:33.400
 Well, this is very important, but it's official school, for example 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:40.070
 I think that I Toka credited with doing Toka historical figures such a place line draw 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:44.450
 To feel that in the study in the Well certainly After this time minus the root of the study I'm get used 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:49.190
 Also anxious that study I do not sir remaining Te results Actually 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.360
 Because I do not remember at all if I can not improve the safety only with products and products 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.600
 Well after all 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:58.820
 I have no choice but to remember history and mathematical formulas and such, but this is a human being 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.060
 In about say line heater 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.620
 Can not do 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:06.750
 It is drawn several times not Toka or write on paper and is not good I just So the soldiers I'd 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.650
 Not'm so and say or no say 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.270
 important 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:16.020
 Is not it possible to understand at a glance where you thought it was ? 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.110
 So important that I draw a line in the textbook in the sense that so, I'm important 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:24.420
 But it's such that I do not go up the government in it 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:27.640
 Acts that say draw a line in the Toka textbook was discipline command an important place 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:32.380
 It is such a large a What I learned in this 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:37.720
 Is that I mean grades it should I Is not it So what shake mon I go up 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:44.229
 It is to say selfish things do I So if I'm important to put the cat of mark 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:45.310
 It is one that I mean that while it is nine jig smoking a place minus the star to once more notes 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.630
 There is only one 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:52.250
 Simply so Well then drew a line 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:57.470
 When I drew a line, I mean, let's take a break like that. 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:59.450
 In dense by adding the dopa to say also each Why can I say and once the thing is 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:05.600
 It means that you can remember 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:07.650
 + Is a chunky me this textbook you gave the mark enough where I I pretty thick 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.190
 But the middle When write down in a notebook 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:16.350
 It is I settled on the basis of the compactor, which together place like 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.590
 It is easy to review in the sense of returning to thin notes from such 9 hot textbooks, isn't it? 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.629
 High 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:26.459
 Since the two effects is observed once the tax notes or September 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:31.440
 I want you to do this alone . The effect of writing and remembering even this one time 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:36.580
 It all means because there is an effect that and made a compact to the summary notes 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:41.050
 As it is directly sentence haiku is say I was drawing a line in such textbooks 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.670
 Really I this please do that to pass to the note because it is good as it is 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.410
 I think it's a little time 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.300
 But a little annoying but body month or do not do or do this thing a little hen stinking 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:53.890

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.180
 What's wrong 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.110
 I guess I'm kind of a bit confused but I hope it 's good to catch fish 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.250
 I think 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:29.849
 Well, if you pull the textbook 2000, it's meaningless unless you think this 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.060
