I'm going to take a British brown color
and<00:02:09.920> I'm<00:02:10.039> going<00:02:10.100> to<00:02:10.369> use<00:02:10.610> that<00:02:10.970> same<00:02:11.270> blending

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
and I'm going to use that same blending

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.180 
and I'm going to use that same blending
brush<00:02:11.720> we<00:02:11.840> used<00:02:11.900> earlier<00:02:12.140> and<00:02:12.470> I'm<00:02:12.920> going<00:02:13.100> to

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
brush we used earlier and I'm going to

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.800 
brush we used earlier and I'm going to
focus<00:02:13.459> that<00:02:13.640> right<00:02:14.090> through<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.360> crease<00:02:14.570> and

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
focus that right through the crease and

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.210 
focus that right through the crease and
this<00:02:14.870> is<00:02:15.019> going<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.290> further<00:02:15.560> intensify<00:02:16.160> the

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
this is going to further intensify the

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.860 
this is going to further intensify the
crease<00:02:16.489> and<00:02:16.730> create<00:02:16.940> a<00:02:17.000> more<00:02:17.150> contoured

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
crease and create a more contoured

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.140 
crease and create a more contoured
to<00:02:18.260> find<00:02:18.560> a<00:02:18.680> fit<00:02:18.890> for<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.130> eyes<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:19.549> as<00:02:20.030> you

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
to find a fit for the eyes and as you

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.750 
to find a fit for the eyes and as you
can<00:02:20.269> see<00:02:20.510> it<00:02:20.690> just<00:02:20.959> creates<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.709> very<00:02:21.980> soft<00:02:22.459> and

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
can see it just creates a very soft and

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.720 
can see it just creates a very soft and
diffused<00:02:23.180> effect<00:02:23.540> using<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.019> blending<00:02:24.350> brush

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
diffused effect using the blending brush

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.100 
diffused effect using the blending brush

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
so just keep working that shadow into

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.690 
so just keep working that shadow into
the<00:02:27.230> crease<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:27.530> deepen<00:02:28.070> the<00:02:28.190> eyes<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:28.670> just

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
the crease to deepen the eyes and just

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.930 
the crease to deepen the eyes and just
create<00:02:29.299> a<00:02:29.420> more<00:02:29.630> dramatic<00:02:29.720> effect<00:02:30.940> remember

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
create a more dramatic effect remember

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.009 
create a more dramatic effect remember
while<00:02:32.090> you're<00:02:32.120> blending<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.630> use<00:02:32.750> small

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
while you're blending to use small

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.780 
while you're blending to use small
circular<00:02:33.410> motions<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:33.980> just<00:02:34.190> really<00:02:34.519> smoke

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
circular motions and just really smoke

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.380 
circular motions and just really smoke
