creative things you can do with

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.629 
creative things you can do with
controlling<00:00:10.320> helix<00:00:10.889> using<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.460> foot

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
controlling helix using the foot

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:20.830 
controlling helix using the foot
switches<00:00:12.019> so<00:00:13.019> I've<00:00:13.110> got<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.259> Pat<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.620> your<00:00:13.740> setup

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.410 

and<00:00:21.840> what<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.020> want<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.230> do<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.970> sort<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.060> assign

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
and what I want to do is sort of assign

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.700 
and what I want to do is sort of assign
some<00:00:24.660> controllers<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.470> give<00:00:25.590> me<00:00:25.619> a

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
some controllers to it to give me a

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.920 
some controllers to it to give me a
little<00:00:25.800> more<00:00:26.279> sort<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.849> creative<00:00:27.300> flexibility

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
little more sort of creative flexibility

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.689 
little more sort of creative flexibility
on<00:00:28.140> how<00:00:28.170> it's<00:00:28.380> working<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:29.250> at<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.369> moment<00:00:29.640> I

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
on how it's working so at the moment I

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.759 
on how it's working so at the moment I
want<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.910> actually<00:00:30.029> assign<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:31.050> feedback<00:00:31.740> of

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
want to actually assign the feedback of

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.470 
want to actually assign the feedback of
the<00:00:31.980> delay<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.610> pedal<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.120> check<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.390> out

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
the delay to this pedal so check it out

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.600 
the delay to this pedal so check it out
I<00:00:33.690> go<00:00:34.079> over<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.350> feedback<00:00:34.680> knob<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.219> just

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
I go over to the feedback knob I just

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.510 
I go over to the feedback knob I just
push<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.850> down<00:00:36.469> and<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.530> says<00:00:37.710> hey<00:00:37.860> what<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:38.489> you

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
push it down and I says hey what do you

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.830 
push it down and I says hey what do you
how<00:00:38.670> do<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.790> want<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:38.969> control<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.750> just

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
how do you want to control it and I just

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.619 
how do you want to control it and I just
want<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.020> learn<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.379> controller<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:41.450> now<00:00:42.450> this

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
want to learn the controller so now this

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.270 
want to learn the controller so now this
pedal<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.050> controlling<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.590> feedback<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
pedal is controlling the feedback of the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.930 
pedal is controlling the feedback of the
delay<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:45.239> if<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.390> crank<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:45.989> up<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.820> turn<00:00:47.820> to

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
delay so if I crank this up and turn to

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.090 
delay so if I crank this up and turn to
the<00:00:47.969> lay<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.360> you'll<00:00:49.320> hear<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:52.100> sticks

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the lay on you'll hear that it sticks

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.860 
the lay on you'll hear that it sticks
there<00:00:53.280> forever<00:00:53.430> which<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.360> great<00:00:56.750> one<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
there forever which is great one of the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.810 
there forever which is great one of the
great<00:00:58.050> things<00:00:58.260> about<00:00:58.379> helix<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.579> if<00:00:59.670> it's

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
great things about helix is that if it's

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.090 
great things about helix is that if it's
a<00:00:59.879> digital<00:01:00.059> base<00:01:00.570> delay<00:01:00.960> anything<00:01:01.890> that's<00:01:02.010> in

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
a digital base delay anything that's in

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.619 
a digital base delay anything that's in
the<00:01:02.190> buffer<00:01:02.489> once<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.820> bypass<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.570> you

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
the buffer once you bypass it and you

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.859 
the buffer once you bypass it and you
have<00:01:03.750> trails<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.460> will<00:01:05.460> stay<00:01:06.270> going<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:06.689> if<00:01:06.810> I

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
have trails on will stay going so if I

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.390 
have trails on will stay going so if I
want<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.140> create<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.530> little<00:01:07.650> mini<00:01:07.890> loop<00:01:08.130> for

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
want to create a little mini loop for

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.570 
want to create a little mini loop for
myself<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.479> want<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.689> sort<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.930> just<00:01:10.580> you

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
myself and I want to sort of just you

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.160 
myself and I want to sort of just you
know<00:01:11.610> sort<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:11.970> swell<00:01:12.479> something<00:01:12.900> into<00:01:13.140> that

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
know sort of swell something into that

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.480 
know sort of swell something into that
delay<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.650> have<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.860> stick<00:01:14.070> there<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.400> do

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
delay and have it stick there I can do

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.390 
delay and have it stick there I can do
that<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.479> guy<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:16.560> gonna<00:01:16.799> basically<00:01:17.009> play

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
that so this guy is gonna basically play

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.820 
that so this guy is gonna basically play
a<00:01:17.430> chord<00:01:17.700> for<00:01:17.909> me<00:01:18.170> I'm<00:01:19.170> gonna<00:01:19.290> have<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.500> swell

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
a chord for me I'm gonna have it swell

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.149 
a chord for me I'm gonna have it swell
into<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.159> delay<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.490> then<00:01:20.580> hold<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.909> so

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
into that delay and then hold it so

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.110 
into that delay and then hold it so
feedback<00:01:23.159> all<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.460> way<00:01:23.549> up

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
feedback all the way up

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:53.359 
feedback all the way up

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
so it's lovely now you might think to

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.719 
so it's lovely now you might think to
yourself<00:01:56.140> I<00:01:56.530> only<00:01:56.680> have<00:01:56.830> two<00:01:57.070> petals<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:57.670> I

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
yourself I only have two petals and I

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:58.980 
yourself I only have two petals and I
want<00:01:57.909> to<00:01:57.970> actually<00:01:58.060> control<00:01:58.510> one<00:01:58.630> more<00:01:58.810> thing

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
want to actually control one more thing

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.040 
want to actually control one more thing
I<00:01:59.170> might<00:01:59.380> be<00:01:59.440> screwed<00:01:59.680> not<00:02:00.490> so<00:02:00.760> all<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.869> very

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
I might be screwed not so all the very

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.359 
I might be screwed not so all the very
axe<00:02:02.229> knobs<00:02:02.500> can<00:02:02.770> also<00:02:02.890> be<00:02:03.130> used<00:02:03.280> as

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
axe knobs can also be used as

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:04.890 
axe knobs can also be used as
controllers<00:02:03.850> as<00:02:03.940> well<00:02:03.970> so<00:02:04.390> if<00:02:04.479> I<00:02:04.540> want<00:02:04.720> to<00:02:04.780> take

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
controllers as well so if I want to take

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.719 
controllers as well so if I want to take
the<00:02:05.049> pitch<00:02:05.229> whammy<00:02:05.590> and<00:02:05.890> want<00:02:06.490> to<00:02:06.550> take<00:02:06.640> the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
the pitch whammy and want to take the

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.220 
the pitch whammy and want to take the
position<00:02:07.119> of<00:02:07.180> that<00:02:07.330> and<00:02:07.920> have<00:02:08.920> it<00:02:08.950> learned<00:02:09.280> I

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.230 
position of that and have it learned I

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.500 
position of that and have it learned I
can<00:02:11.230> use<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.530> very<00:02:11.709> action<00:02:11.890> AAB<00:02:12.100> and<00:02:12.819> so<00:02:12.970> now<00:02:13.120> I

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
can use the very action AAB and so now I

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:29.009 
can use the very action AAB and so now I
have<00:02:14.260> this<00:02:14.350> lovely<00:02:14.620> situation<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:28.390> even

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
have this lovely situation so even

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.440 
have this lovely situation so even
though<00:02:29.110> I've<00:02:29.290> got<00:02:29.519> pedals<00:02:30.519> here<00:02:30.850> that<00:02:31.150> I'm<00:02:31.269> out

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
though I've got pedals here that I'm out

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.610 
though I've got pedals here that I'm out
of<00:02:31.600> because<00:02:31.750> they<00:02:31.900> don't<00:02:32.050> have<00:02:32.170> another<00:02:32.320> pedal

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
of because they don't have another pedal

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.930 
of because they don't have another pedal
here<00:02:32.739> I've<00:02:32.860> still<00:02:33.070> got<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.340> very<00:02:33.519> axe<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.850> be

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
here I've still got the very axe to be

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.490 
here I've still got the very axe to be
able<00:02:34.060> to<00:02:34.120> control<00:02:34.390> stuff<00:02:34.660> so<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:34.959> can<00:02:35.200> learn

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
able to control stuff so you can learn

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.340 
able to control stuff so you can learn
any<00:02:36.010> controller<00:02:36.900> connected<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:37.959> helix

whether that's on a synth or whether

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.220 
whether that's on a synth or whether
it's<00:02:39.970> a<00:02:40.030> ribbon<00:02:40.269> controller<00:02:40.600> on<00:02:40.810> something<00:02:41.140> on

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
it's a ribbon controller on something on

over<00:02:43.510> MIDI<00:02:43.690> can<00:02:43.900> be<00:02:44.019> learned<00:02:44.290> as<00:02:44.530> a<00:02:44.560> controller

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
over MIDI can be learned as a controller

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.530 
over MIDI can be learned as a controller
as<00:02:45.220> long<00:02:45.400> as<00:02:45.519> it<00:02:45.610> can<00:02:45.670> send<00:02:45.880> media<00:02:46.120> information

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
as long as it can send media information

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.530 
as long as it can send media information
so<00:02:47.080> as<00:02:47.560> a<00:02:48.010> as<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.400> master<00:02:48.880> controller<00:02:49.209> for<00:02:49.450> your
