00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.050 

so<00:00:18.960> basically<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:19.650> lick<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.189> outlining<00:00:20.730> this

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
so basically this lick is outlining this

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.740 
so basically this lick is outlining this
chord<00:00:21.830> we've<00:00:22.830> got<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.250> C<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.820> then<00:00:24.570> that

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
chord we've got the C and then that

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.240 
chord we've got the C and then that
little<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:25.140> flat<00:00:25.410> E<00:00:25.740> flat<00:00:26.010> grace<00:00:26.640> note<00:00:27.480> they're

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
little a flat E flat grace note they're

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.009 
little a flat E flat grace note they're
kind<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.310> got<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.550> floyd<00:00:29.880> cramer<00:00:30.210> sound<00:00:30.779> to

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
kind of got that floyd cramer sound to

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:40.310 
kind of got that floyd cramer sound to
it<00:00:33.350> and<00:00:34.350> then<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.590> little<00:00:34.770> triplet<00:00:38.989> let<00:00:39.989> me<00:00:40.079> play

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
it and then a little triplet let me play

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:50.060 
it and then a little triplet let me play
that<00:00:40.469> for<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.770> slowly<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:42.890> one<00:00:49.070> variation

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
that for you slowly and one variation

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.689 
that for you slowly and one variation
number<00:00:50.550> two<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.140> by<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.199> way<00:00:52.440> i<00:00:52.829> think<00:00:53.520> i'm

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
number two and by the way i think i'm

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.900 
number two and by the way i think i'm
covering<00:00:54.030> seven<00:00:54.710> variations<00:00:55.710> maybe<00:00:56.280> they're

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
covering seven variations maybe they're

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.420 
covering seven variations maybe they're
probably<00:00:57.239> half<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.809> dozen<00:00:58.020> more<00:00:58.410> even<00:00:59.160> but<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
probably half a dozen more even but the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.090 
probably half a dozen more even but the
second<00:00:59.760> variation<00:01:00.559> starts<00:01:01.559> out<00:01:01.739> like<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
second variation starts out like the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.859 
second variation starts out like the
first<00:01:02.340> one<00:01:03.589> and<00:01:04.909> you<00:01:05.909> do<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> triplet<00:01:06.659> but

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
first one and you do a triplet but

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.640 
first one and you do a triplet but
instead<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:08.240> you<00:01:09.240> do<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.750> figure<00:01:10.320> here<00:01:10.590> where

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
instead of you do this figure here where

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.020 
instead of you do this figure here where
you<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:11.030> an<00:01:12.030> e-flat<00:01:12.390> najih<00:01:13.790> energy<00:01:14.790> and

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
you have an e-flat najih energy and

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.020 
you have an e-flat najih energy and
quickly<00:01:15.630> back<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.110> E<00:01:16.140> flat<00:01:16.490> and<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> C

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
quickly back to the E flat and to the C

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.789 
quickly back to the E flat and to the C
so<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.780> total<00:01:18.990> sound<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:24.799> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
so that the total sound of it is and the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.880 
so that the total sound of it is and the
G<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.430> tied<00:01:27.060> across<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.990> top<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:28.470> not<00:01:28.530> marked

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
G is tied across the top it's not marked

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.670 
G is tied across the top it's not marked
on<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.159> music<00:01:29.520> there<00:01:29.759> but<00:01:30.479> basically<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:33.680> don't

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
on the music there but basically I don't

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.230 
on the music there but basically I don't
think<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.979> should<00:01:35.009> repeat<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.640> G<00:01:36.200> you<00:01:37.200> could

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
think you should repeat the G you could

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.469 
think you should repeat the G you could
I<00:01:39.240> leave<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.079> up<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> lick<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:44.479> do

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
I leave that up to you so the lick is do

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.039 
I leave that up to you so the lick is do
that<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.689> little<00:01:45.810> bit<00:01:45.960> slower<00:01:46.290> for<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:51.049> first

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
that a little bit slower for you first

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.109 
that a little bit slower for you first
one<00:01:52.200> except<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.340> instead<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.850> triplet

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
one except that instead of a triplet

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.499 
one except that instead of a triplet
figure<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:55.200> have<00:01:55.500> some<00:01:56.299> thirty-second<00:01:57.299> notes

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
figure you have some thirty-second notes

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.800 
figure you have some thirty-second notes
I<00:01:57.810> recommend<00:01:58.799> doing<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.670> at<00:01:59.909> slower<00:02:00.210> tempos

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
I recommend doing this at slower tempos

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.200 
I recommend doing this at slower tempos
because<00:02:01.320> if<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.710> gets<00:02:01.890> really<00:02:02.100> fast<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:03.000> can

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
because if it gets really fast it can

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.819 
because if it gets really fast it can
get<00:02:03.329> muddy<00:02:03.689> trying<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.200> pull<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:04.590> one<00:02:04.770> off

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
get muddy trying to pull this one off

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:12.040 
get muddy trying to pull this one off
but<00:02:05.490> here's<00:02:05.729> how<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:06.000> sounds

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.220 

you<00:02:13.050> want<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.319> hear<00:02:13.410> all<00:02:13.590> of<00:02:13.620> those<00:02:13.830> notes<00:02:14.129> so

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
you want to hear all of those notes so

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.990 
you want to hear all of those notes so
again<00:02:16.230> slower<00:02:16.590> tempos<00:02:17.129> let<00:02:17.640> me<00:02:17.730> try<00:02:17.940> this

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
again slower tempos let me try this

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:30.070 
again slower tempos let me try this
slowly<00:02:18.810> for<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:23.030> one<00:02:24.030> more<00:02:24.209> time

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.220 

very<00:02:31.080> nice<00:02:33.260> let's<00:02:34.260> go<00:02:34.470> on<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.739> variation<00:02:35.340> for

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
very nice let's go on to variation for

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.490 
very nice let's go on to variation for
this<00:02:37.230> one<00:02:37.470> is<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.680> simplified<00:02:38.459> version<00:02:39.500> where

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
this one is a simplified version where

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.470 
this one is a simplified version where
you<00:02:40.530> have<00:02:40.799> it<00:02:40.980> they<00:02:41.160> basically<00:02:41.940> all<00:02:42.090> have<00:02:42.329> this

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
you have it they basically all have this

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.140 
you have it they basically all have this
first<00:02:42.750> little<00:02:42.989> start<00:02:43.380> off<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:43.980> g8<00:02:44.700> note

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
first little start off of the g8 note

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:52.370 
first little start off of the g8 note
that<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.250> figure<00:02:47.489> there<00:02:51.290> let<00:02:52.290> me

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
that and that that figure there let me

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:59.270 
that and that that figure there let me
play<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.739> again<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.630> one<00:02:58.040> you<00:02:59.040> could<00:02:59.190> do

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
play that again and one you could do

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.130 
play that again and one you could do
that<00:02:59.430> at<00:02:59.610> even<00:02:59.790> fast<00:03:00.120> tempos<00:03:00.569> because<00:03:00.959> there

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
that at even fast tempos because there

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.020 
that at even fast tempos because there
are<00:03:01.200> less<00:03:01.380> notes<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:02.579> it's<00:03:02.730> not<00:03:02.880> as

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
are less notes and it's not as

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.020 
are less notes and it's not as
rhythmically<00:03:03.599> tricky<00:03:04.610> variation<00:03:05.610> five<00:03:08.030> it's

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
rhythmically tricky variation five it's

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.960 
rhythmically tricky variation five it's
kind<00:03:09.299> of<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.450> combination<00:03:10.110> of<00:03:10.400> number<00:03:11.400> one<00:03:11.579> and

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
kind of a combination of number one and

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.330 
kind of a combination of number one and
number<00:03:12.299> two<00:03:12.620> again<00:03:13.620> starting<00:03:14.069> with<00:03:14.100> this

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
number two again starting with this

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.140 
number two again starting with this
familiar<00:03:14.850> figure<00:03:15.440> and<00:03:16.549> here<00:03:17.549> you're<00:03:17.730> breaking

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
familiar figure and here you're breaking

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:30.220 
familiar figure and here you're breaking
up<00:03:18.329> this<00:03:18.540> C<00:03:18.810> chord<00:03:21.530> do<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:22.739> slowly<00:03:23.040> for<00:03:23.400> you

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.160 

okay<00:03:31.230> this<00:03:31.470> next<00:03:31.829> variation<00:03:32.760> is<00:03:33.540> actually<00:03:34.139> a

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
okay this next variation is actually a

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.949 
okay this next variation is actually a
different<00:03:34.739> lick<00:03:35.000> but<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.120> sounds<00:03:36.510> similar<00:03:36.780> to

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
different lick but it sounds similar to

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.050 
different lick but it sounds similar to
what<00:03:37.230> we've<00:03:37.410> been<00:03:37.440> playing<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.609> other<00:03:38.730> licks

a similar sound works the same way as
the<00:03:54.000> other<00:03:54.120> variations<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.200> it<00:03:55.980> sounds<00:03:56.370> like

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
the other variations and it sounds like

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:04.309 
the other variations and it sounds like
this<00:04:01.579> let<00:04:02.579> me<00:04:02.609> break<00:04:02.970> that<00:04:03.000> down<00:04:03.239> it's<00:04:03.780> that<00:04:04.049> G

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
this let me break that down it's that G

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.780 
this let me break that down it's that G
and<00:04:04.440> C<00:04:04.769> you're<00:04:05.340> just<00:04:05.579> outlining<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.209> chord

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.809 
and C you're just outlining the chord
and<00:04:08.790> then<00:04:09.060> on<00:04:09.180> beat<00:04:09.359> two<00:04:09.599> you<00:04:10.410> have<00:04:10.650> G<00:04:11.400> flat<00:04:11.430> and

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
and then on beat two you have G flat and

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.150 
and then on beat two you have G flat and
G<00:04:12.030> come<00:04:12.750> up<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:12.989> eng<00:04:13.470> then<00:04:13.799> your<00:04:13.950> triplet

then<00:04:16.080> this<00:04:16.260> figure<00:04:18.380> and<00:04:19.380> this<00:04:19.590> is<00:04:19.740> not<00:04:19.890> written

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
then this figure and this is not written

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.410 
then this figure and this is not written
in<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.400> music<00:04:20.790> but<00:04:20.940> I'll<00:04:21.060> tell<00:04:21.240> you<00:04:21.390> something

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
that I do I cheat with this all the time

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.850 
that I do I cheat with this all the time
on<00:04:23.730> beat<00:04:24.300> two<00:04:24.570> I<00:04:25.970> use<00:04:26.970> AG<00:04:27.930> flat<00:04:28.290> with<00:04:28.530> that<00:04:28.680> a

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
on beat two I use AG flat with that a

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.830 
on beat two I use AG flat with that a
flat<00:04:29.130> and<00:04:29.370> then<00:04:29.520> slide<00:04:29.880> up<00:04:29.910> and<00:04:30.330> it<00:04:30.570> sounds

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
flat and then slide up and it sounds

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.540 
flat and then slide up and it sounds

like this so you hear the difference

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:49.550 
like this so you hear the difference
between<00:04:45.080> and<00:04:47.750> either<00:04:48.750> one<00:04:49.050> of<00:04:49.080> those<00:04:49.320> would

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
between and either one of those would

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.490 
between and either one of those would
work<00:04:52.700> again<00:04:53.730> that's<00:04:54.420> that's<00:04:54.780> a<00:04:54.930> freebie<00:04:55.200> just

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
work again that's that's a freebie just

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.750 
work again that's that's a freebie just
something<00:04:56.190> extra

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
something extra

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.070 
something extra
