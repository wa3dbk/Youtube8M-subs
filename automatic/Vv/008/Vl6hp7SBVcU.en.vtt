this<00:00:37.829> video<00:00:38.160> about<00:00:38.629> MotoGP<00:00:39.710> 2015<00:00:40.710> as<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:40.980> think

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
this video about MotoGP 2015 as I think

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.040 
this video about MotoGP 2015 as I think
there<00:00:41.790> are<00:00:41.879> quality<00:00:42.390> improvements<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:42.930> this

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
there are quality improvements in this

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.020 
there are quality improvements in this
game<00:00:43.260> but<00:00:43.469> then<00:00:43.680> I've<00:00:43.950> sent<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.579> know<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.820> lot<00:00:44.969> of

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
game but then I've sent I know a lot of

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.970 
game but then I've sent I know a lot of
non<00:00:45.420> improvements<00:00:46.140> but<00:00:46.230> anyway<00:00:46.469> you're<00:00:46.860> going

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
non improvements but anyway you're going

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.110 
non improvements but anyway you're going
to<00:00:47.070> be<00:00:47.129> watching<00:00:47.250> some<00:00:47.430> gameplay<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
to be watching some gameplay in the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.430 
to be watching some gameplay in the
background<00:00:48.570> are<00:00:48.719> going<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.899> be<00:00:48.989> racing<00:00:49.350> as

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
background are going to be racing as

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.939 
background are going to be racing as
Valentino<00:00:50.129> Rossi<00:00:50.340> round<00:00:51.270> France<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.350> LeMond

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
Valentino Rossi round France the LeMond

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.040 
Valentino Rossi round France the LeMond
circuit<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.489> LeMans<00:00:53.789> or<00:00:54.180> small<00:00:54.570> circuit<00:00:54.989> I

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
circuit that LeMans or small circuit I

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.080 
circuit that LeMans or small circuit I
thought<00:00:55.199> corner<00:00:55.500> was<00:00:55.680> cooled<00:00:55.890> down<00:00:56.129> yeah<00:00:56.910> but

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
thought corner was cooled down yeah but

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.220 
thought corner was cooled down yeah but
hopefully<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.390> enjoy<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.719> game<00:00:57.899> playing<00:00:58.170> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
hopefully you enjoy that game playing a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.650 
hopefully you enjoy that game playing a
bank<00:00:58.469> round<00:00:58.710> bad<00:00:58.859> name<00:00:59.070> let's<00:01:00.059> start<00:01:00.270> off<00:01:00.449> with

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
bank round bad name let's start off with

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.170 
bank round bad name let's start off with
the<00:01:00.840> good<00:01:00.870> because<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:02.489> game<00:01:02.699> does<00:01:02.940> have<00:01:02.969> a

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
the good because this game does have a

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.759 
the good because this game does have a
lot<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.359> good<00:01:03.539> points<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.989> my<00:01:04.140> opinion<00:01:04.619> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
lot of good points in my opinion the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.270 
lot of good points in my opinion the
graphics<00:01:05.220> are<00:01:05.489> improved<00:01:05.729> over<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.540> previous

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
graphics are improved over the previous

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.039 
graphics are improved over the previous
MotoGP<00:01:08.280> games<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.790> think<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.869> something

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
MotoGP games I think this is something

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.630 
MotoGP games I think this is something
like<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.320> lighting<00:01:10.560> which<00:01:10.950> for<00:01:11.250> me<00:01:11.400> just

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
like the lighting which for me just

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.219 
like the lighting which for me just
makes<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.090> look<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.270> little<00:01:12.450> bit<00:01:12.689> nicer<00:01:12.840> makes

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
makes it look a little bit nicer makes

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.050 
makes it look a little bit nicer makes
it<00:01:13.350> look<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.530> bit<00:01:13.830> more<00:01:13.950> appealing<00:01:14.100> than<00:01:14.790> the

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
it look a bit more appealing than the

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.030 
it look a bit more appealing than the
previous<00:01:15.930> games<00:01:16.170> which<00:01:16.320> i<00:01:16.439> think<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.799> good

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
previous games which i think is good

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.410 
previous games which i think is good
it's<00:01:17.430> always<00:01:17.640> nice<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.850> have<00:01:18.000> improved

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
it's always nice to have improved

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.719 
it's always nice to have improved
graphics<00:01:18.869> on<00:01:19.020> games<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:20.130> also<00:01:20.369> think<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
graphics on games and I also think the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.940 
graphics on games and I also think the
physics<00:01:21.090> are<00:01:21.240> slightly<00:01:21.689> improved<00:01:22.259> as<00:01:22.590> well

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
physics are slightly improved as well

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.460 
physics are slightly improved as well
not<00:01:23.460> massively<00:01:23.909> but<00:01:24.180> slightly<00:01:24.689> improved<00:01:25.259> as

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
not massively but slightly improved as

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.770 
not massively but slightly improved as
well<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:25.799> we<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.460> improvement<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.299> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
well so we have the improvement in the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.990 
well so we have the improvement in the
physics<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.409> as<00:01:28.770> well<00:01:28.979> as<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.520> graphics

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
physics and as well as the graphics

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.819 
physics and as well as the graphics
which<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.299> good<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.689> also<00:01:31.290> something<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.680> have

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
which is good and also something I have

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.649 
which is good and also something I have
noticed<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.310> game<00:01:32.549> it's<00:01:33.000> no<00:01:33.150> sort<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.360> lag

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
noticed in this game it's no sort of lag

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.350 
noticed in this game it's no sort of lag
in<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> introduction<00:01:34.909> introduction<00:01:35.909> scenes

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
in the introduction introduction scenes

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.060 
in the introduction introduction scenes
and<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.900> makes<00:01:37.049> any<00:01:37.259> sense<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.829> know<00:01:37.920> when

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
and that makes any sense you know when

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.469 
and that makes any sense you know when
you<00:01:38.220> just<00:01:38.250> go<00:01:38.610> into<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.880> track<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.360> have

you just go into the track and you have
solved<00:01:39.750> some<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> shots<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.770> tracks

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
solved some of the shots of the tracks

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.399 
solved some of the shots of the tracks
lots<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.030> milestone<00:01:42.509> games<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.049> past<00:01:43.200> had

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
lots of milestone games in the past had

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.080 
lots of milestone games in the past had
lots<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.680> lag<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.100> those<00:01:44.250> sort<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.520> areas<00:01:44.670> and

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
lots of lag in those sort of areas and

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.660 
lots of lag in those sort of areas and
this<00:01:45.540> one<00:01:45.720> doesn't<00:01:45.899> which<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.229> really<00:01:46.560> good<00:01:46.770> so

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
this one doesn't which is really good so

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.069 
this one doesn't which is really good so
that's<00:01:47.790> one<00:01:47.939> thing<00:01:48.090> like<00:01:48.149> that's<00:01:48.299> all<00:01:48.420> things

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079

that's one thing like that's all things
like<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.290> character<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.619> really<00:01:49.860> do<00:01:49.979> like

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
that's something to do with the engine

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.440

extra<00:03:44.780> bit<00:03:44.959> of<00:03:45.310> personalization<00:03:46.310> in<00:03:46.609> the<00:03:46.700> game

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
extra bit of personalization in the game

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.670 
extra bit of personalization in the game
something<00:03:47.389> which<00:03:47.540> I<00:03:47.780> think<00:03:48.230> a<00:03:48.260> lot<00:03:48.410> of<00:03:48.440> people

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
something which I think a lot of people

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.860 
something which I think a lot of people
really<00:03:49.069> want<00:03:49.310> in<00:03:49.519> a<00:03:49.819> Formula<00:03:50.180> one<00:03:50.359> game<00:03:50.569> but

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
really want in a Formula one game but

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.449 
really want in a Formula one game but
when<00:03:51.049> probably<00:03:51.590> not<00:03:51.709> going<00:03:51.889> to<00:03:51.980> get<00:03:52.160> it<00:03:52.340> I

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
when probably not going to get it I

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:52.930 
when probably not going to get it I
think

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
think

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.870 
think
Dorner<00:03:53.599> who<00:03:53.959> like<00:03:54.169> fom<00:03:54.829> I<00:03:55.069> think<00:03:55.340> they're<00:03:55.849> a

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
Dorner who like fom I think they're a

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.670 
Dorner who like fom I think they're a
little<00:03:56.329> bit<00:03:56.450> better<00:03:56.810> in<00:03:57.079> terms<00:03:57.260> of<00:03:57.500> letting

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
little bit better in terms of letting

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.009 
little bit better in terms of letting
that<00:03:58.069> the<00:03:58.280> team<00:03:58.549> sort<00:03:59.180> of<00:03:59.359> know<00:03:59.480> it<00:03:59.630> seems<00:03:59.870> like

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
that the team sort of know it seems like

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.050 
that the team sort of know it seems like
that<00:04:00.169> the<00:04:00.230> people<00:04:00.530> that<00:04:00.650> make<00:04:00.769> the<00:04:00.919> games<00:04:01.190> let

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
that the people that make the games let

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.569 
that the people that make the games let
you<00:04:02.090> make<00:04:02.359> your<00:04:02.630> own<00:04:02.660> team<00:04:03.049> so<00:04:03.349> it's<00:04:04.220> just<00:04:04.340> you

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
you make your own team so it's just you

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:05.530 
you make your own team so it's just you
know<00:04:04.669> that<00:04:04.790> a<00:04:04.819> little<00:04:05.060> bit<00:04:05.150> of<00:04:05.239> extra

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
know that a little bit of extra

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.360 
know that a little bit of extra
creativity<00:04:06.349> in<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:06.530> game<00:04:06.680> does<00:04:07.010> mean<00:04:07.220> an

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
creativity in the game does mean an

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.580 
creativity in the game does mean an
awful<00:04:07.549> lot<00:04:07.819> it<00:04:08.480> means<00:04:08.720> that<00:04:08.870> the<00:04:08.989> game<00:04:09.139> can<00:04:09.560> be

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
awful lot it means that the game can be

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.650 
awful lot it means that the game can be
played<00:04:09.680> maybe<00:04:10.549> twice<00:04:10.940> as<00:04:11.180> long<00:04:11.329> as<00:04:11.510> you're

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
played maybe twice as long as you're

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.420 
played maybe twice as long as you're
racing<00:04:11.959> for<00:04:12.079> your<00:04:12.200> own<00:04:12.290> team<00:04:12.590> because<00:04:13.219> it<00:04:13.340> just

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
racing for your own team because it just

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.740 
racing for your own team because it just
makes<00:04:13.640> you<00:04:13.760> one<00:04:13.879> actually<00:04:14.150> plug<00:04:14.299> again<00:04:14.569> a<00:04:14.599> bit

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
makes you one actually plug again a bit

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.630 
makes you one actually plug again a bit
more<00:04:14.900> I<00:04:14.930> mean<00:04:15.049> if<00:04:15.170> you<00:04:15.260> go<00:04:15.439> into<00:04:16.370> one<00:04:16.519> of<00:04:16.549> the

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
more I mean if you go into one of the

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.039 
more I mean if you go into one of the
top<00:04:16.820> teams<00:04:17.060> like<00:04:17.299> I<00:04:17.419> had<00:04:17.630> done<00:04:17.659> in<00:04:17.870> my<00:04:17.900> career

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
top teams like I had done in my career

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:18.759 
top teams like I had done in my career
mode

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
mode

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.589 
mode
it<00:04:18.949> sometimes<00:04:19.220> can<00:04:19.400> get<00:04:19.729> a<00:04:19.789> bit<00:04:19.970> boring<00:04:20.239> so<00:04:20.569> I

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:20.599 
it sometimes can get a bit boring so I

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:22.570 
it sometimes can get a bit boring so I
can<00:04:20.900> understand<00:04:21.289> why<00:04:21.739> it's<00:04:21.919> interesting<00:04:22.039> to

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
can understand why it's interesting to

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.430 
can understand why it's interesting to
know<00:04:22.699> develop<00:04:23.210> your<00:04:23.449> own<00:04:23.509> team<00:04:23.810> make<00:04:24.110> it<00:04:24.259> a<00:04:24.319> bit

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
know develop your own team make it a bit

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.650 
know develop your own team make it a bit
more<00:04:24.620> interesting<00:04:24.979> and<00:04:25.370> maybe<00:04:26.330> I'll<00:04:26.509> do<00:04:26.629> that

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
more interesting and maybe I'll do that

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.510 
more interesting and maybe I'll do that
and<00:04:26.900> when<00:04:27.110> I<00:04:27.169> get<00:04:27.229> to<00:04:27.379> MotoGP<00:04:28.129> especially<00:04:28.490> I

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
and when I get to MotoGP especially I
