00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.500

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.530
 objects look at the title because the 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.360
 most will be classic and only 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.040
 you can transfigure if with the character 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.900
 what are you wearing at that moment? 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.030
 you have bought in the classic and 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.590
 this last seller that I am now 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.600
 He is the one who sells us the things that we 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.540
 interest to us that are the sets of 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.040
 the season 1 2 and 3 of pvp so 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.280
 there will be three is per class as I said 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.500
 before a bunch of weapons of all kinds 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.530
 and colors to be of honor the piece of 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.560
 cheaper costs 750 armor of honor 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.360
 thousand masks then two weapons 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.400
 hands and souls at distances cost 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.170
 fifteen hundred honor and are equal both 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.580
 for horde as for alliance I os 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.159
 I recommend that you come with your 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.930
 character and look to see if there is something 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.250
 you like that sure there is to me 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.659
 now they only taught me thirst for witch 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.090
 because I come with the group although I put 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.729
 to show me everything and weapons as you can 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.860
 see there are all kinds more or less pretty 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.690
 sure there is something that you like is a 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.610
 where we can meet is for 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.860
 transfigure and weapons for all of our 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.080
 characters that yes less monk and 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.360
 death knight who stops in the 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.250
 first three if they are from pvp did not exist 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.110
 these classes if there is no set but the 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.690
 weapons can be equal here by 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.360
 example sell one of the states that 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.369
 plus one the one I like the most 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.810
 some video you have seen me the club 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.819
 a hand that I like the most is the one 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.890
 I always carry with my druid that is a 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:00.170
 mace some shiny stone and as I have 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.840
 said before there are three remote weapons 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.300
 three axes two hands three swords a 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.090
 two hands three swords some not swords 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.720
 a hand there are nine or so daggers I think that 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.290
 equal or six 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.420
 there is a lot of sure that if you come something 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.950
 you take it and it 's a very easy way to 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.720
 get things to transfigure because 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.020
 they only ask for honor, we do not depend on going to 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.760
 a dungeon to see if we have the luck 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.620
 that we another piece that we want 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.900
 because it has so much percentage or less 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.300
 percentage or you have to do it in heroic 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.400
 you have to do this is to form the honor 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.770
 come and buy what we like and nothing 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.470
 I hope that as you find something that 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.460
 you like the video to serve you and tomorrow 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.460
 more until tomorrow
