00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
here's a bypass tube

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.619 
here's a bypass tube
most<00:00:57.430> engines<00:00:57.760> don't<00:00:57.909> have<00:00:58.119> these<00:00:58.239> bypass

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
most engines don't have these bypass

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.109 
most engines don't have these bypass
dude<00:00:58.839> there's<00:00:59.049> three<00:00:59.260> on<00:00:59.379> each<00:00:59.500> side<00:01:00.000> three<00:01:01.000> or

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:01.119 
dude there's three on each side three or

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:03.570 
dude there's three on each side three or
kremser<00:01:01.299> yeah<00:01:01.720> six<00:01:02.049> total<00:01:02.320> when<00:01:03.280> they<00:01:03.369> first

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
kremser yeah six total when they first

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.600 
kremser yeah six total when they first
developed<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:04.119> j58<00:01:04.659> they<00:01:05.409> found<00:01:05.799> that<00:01:06.070> a<00:01:06.130> lot

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
developed the j58 they found that a lot

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.240 
developed the j58 they found that a lot
of<00:01:06.750> air<00:01:07.860> was<00:01:08.860> jamming<00:01:09.430> up<00:01:09.549> inside<00:01:10.090> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
of air was jamming up inside the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.100 
of air was jamming up inside the
compressor<00:01:12.250> section<00:01:12.850> so<00:01:13.000> to<00:01:13.060> alleviate<00:01:13.600> that

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
compressor section so to alleviate that

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.320 
compressor section so to alleviate that
they<00:01:14.590> built<00:01:14.890> these<00:01:15.010> tubes<00:01:15.340> to<00:01:15.520> take<00:01:16.030> some<00:01:16.240> of

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
they built these tubes to take some of

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.060 
they built these tubes to take some of
the<00:01:16.390> pressure<00:01:16.600> off<00:01:16.780> instead<00:01:17.680> of<00:01:17.740> just<00:01:17.920> dumping

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
the pressure off instead of just dumping

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.400 
the pressure off instead of just dumping
it<00:01:18.310> overboard<00:01:18.550> Kelly<00:01:19.210> said<00:01:19.540> let's<00:01:20.170> utilize

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
it overboard Kelly said let's utilize

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.680 
it overboard Kelly said let's utilize
that<00:01:20.890> so<00:01:21.010> it<00:01:21.130> goes<00:01:21.280> back<00:01:21.610> it<00:01:21.940> bypasses<00:01:22.480> a

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
that so it goes back it bypasses a

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.660 
that so it goes back it bypasses a
turbine<00:01:23.140> section<00:01:23.500> it<00:01:23.650> reenergized<00:01:24.400> is<00:01:24.550> the

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
turbine section it reenergized is the

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.550 
turbine section it reenergized is the
engine<00:01:24.970> back<00:01:25.090> here<00:01:25.360> and<00:01:25.540> provides<00:01:25.960> a<00:01:26.110> small

this is the working end of it as you

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.570 
this is the working end of it as you
look<00:01:54.759> in<00:01:54.909> here<00:01:55.180> you'll<00:01:55.330> see<00:01:55.509> a<00:01:55.540> lot<00:01:55.840> of<00:01:55.869> ceramic

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
look in here you'll see a lot of ceramic

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.300 
look in here you'll see a lot of ceramic
the<00:01:57.580> ceramics<00:01:58.060> designed<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.630> keep<00:01:58.780> the

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
the thrust comes from the utilization of

the<00:04:21.880> simplest<00:04:22.880> analogy<00:04:23.330> I<00:04:23.450> can<00:04:23.600> tell<00:04:23.960> you

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
the simplest analogy I can tell you

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.900 
the simplest analogy I can tell you
what's<00:04:24.380> happening<00:04:24.740> here<00:04:25.010> very

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
what's happening here very

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.420 
what's happening here very
simplistically<00:04:26.570> if<00:04:27.470> I<00:04:27.620> take<00:04:27.800> a<00:04:27.830> water<00:04:28.130> hose

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
simplistically if I take a water hose

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.210 
simplistically if I take a water hose
but<00:04:29.390> garden<00:04:29.810> moves<00:04:29.990> and<00:04:30.230> I<00:04:30.590> have<00:04:30.740> a<00:04:30.770> water<00:04:31.070> line

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
but garden moves and I have a water line

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.590 
but garden moves and I have a water line
it's<00:04:31.490> going<00:04:31.640> to<00:04:31.700> go<00:04:31.850> out<00:04:31.880> and<00:04:32.120> maybe<00:04:32.210> go<00:04:32.330> out<00:04:32.570> a

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
it's going to go out and maybe go out a

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.090 
it's going to go out and maybe go out a
couple<00:04:32.690> feet<00:04:33.169> in<00:04:33.320> front<00:04:33.560> of<00:04:33.620> me<00:04:33.710> two<00:04:33.890> feet

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
couple feet in front of me two feet

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.670 
couple feet in front of me two feet
maybe<00:04:34.340> three<00:04:34.640> feet<00:04:34.790> I<00:04:35.090> put<00:04:35.930> my<00:04:36.050> finger<00:04:36.530> over

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
maybe three feet I put my finger over

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.170 
maybe three feet I put my finger over
that<00:04:36.800> end<00:04:37.040> of<00:04:37.100> the<00:04:37.160> hose<00:04:37.370> I<00:04:37.580> can<00:04:37.669> have<00:04:37.910> anything

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
that end of the hose I can have anything

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.780 
that end of the hose I can have anything
shoot<00:04:38.330> up<00:04:38.510> 2530<00:04:39.440> feet<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:39.980> that's<00:04:40.280> exactly

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
shoot up 2530 feet and that's exactly

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:41.830 
shoot up 2530 feet and that's exactly
what's<00:04:40.940> happening<00:04:41.270> in<00:04:41.419> the<00:04:41.480> back<00:04:41.630> of<00:04:41.750> this

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
what's happening in the back of this

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.420 
what's happening in the back of this
thing<00:04:41.990> that's<00:04:42.290> it's<00:04:42.620> very<00:04:42.890> simplistic<00:04:43.070> but

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
thing that's it's very simplistic but

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.600 
thing that's it's very simplistic but
that's<00:04:43.700> basically<00:04:44.060> what<00:04:44.240> we're<00:04:44.360> doing
