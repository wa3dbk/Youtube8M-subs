00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.990
 two 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:37.340
 3 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:40.030
 and then that way you're going to feel it and 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.280
 so a gentle low 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.050
 then he grabs and they make 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.850
 balls with which we are going to make up 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.519
 one day you will you put a few drops of 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.410
 butter so they do not stick with 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.930
 others are made so the balls are left 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.100
 rest 20 minutes later we grab the 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:01:02.190
 balls and we're making tortillas 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.190
 but not all so 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:15.850
 this can be done something like that and 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.159
 is going to be doing great and so they are going to 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.320
 the tortillas remain after they are 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:24.090
 we made them and we took them 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.080
 missing the edge we already have it 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.570
 warming up 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.080
 we put the hatch to go 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.080
 spreading 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:39.510
 It has to be golden with both sides and 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.409
 then we pass it to the sugar that we have 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:45.579
 here with cinnamon and so they have to stay 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.549
 golden or golden ones we put them here 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:51.720
 we turn them over so that they hold the sugar 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:55.320
 and so they have to stay 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.960
 I know very well how nice I can be 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.420
 receive the Mexican marcher in the 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.110
 mix of my crazy life that goodbye too 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.110
 bye
