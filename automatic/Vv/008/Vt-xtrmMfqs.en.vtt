project like this is going to be a

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.940 
project like this is going to be a
motorized<00:00:06.420> scooter<00:00:06.649> um<00:00:08.599> this<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:10.349> got

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
motorized scooter um this is a I got

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.459 
motorized scooter um this is a I got
this<00:00:11.130> e<00:00:11.400> two<00:00:11.820> hundred<00:00:12.300> with<00:00:12.630> it<00:00:12.840> as<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.049> seat

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
this e two hundred with it as a seat

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.650 
this e two hundred with it as a seat
annex<00:00:13.860> if<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.070> have<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:14.490> I'm<00:00:15.120> product<00:00:15.509> we<00:00:15.599> use

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
annex if I have that I'm product we use

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.560 
annex if I have that I'm product we use
this<00:00:15.870> you<00:00:16.049> know<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.289> looks<00:00:16.410> pretty<00:00:16.650> stupid<00:00:16.859> and

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
this you know it looks pretty stupid and

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.510 
this you know it looks pretty stupid and
yeah<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.869> got<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.380> bum<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.770> start<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.130> anyway

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
yeah I got a bum to start it anyway

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.230 
yeah I got a bum to start it anyway
because<00:00:20.670> it's<00:00:21.029> gonna<00:00:21.300> be<00:00:21.570> direct<00:00:21.930> drive<00:00:23.119> to<00:00:24.119> me

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
because it's gonna be direct drive to me

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.790 
because it's gonna be direct drive to me
friction<00:00:24.660> drive<00:00:24.840> because<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.380> was<00:00:25.500> going<00:00:25.650> to

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
friction drive because I was going to

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.339 
friction drive because I was going to
change<00:00:26.160> drive<00:00:26.550> like<00:00:26.880> my<00:00:27.029> other<00:00:27.180> one<00:00:27.420> because

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
change drive like my other one because

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.919 
change drive like my other one because
uh<00:00:28.380> other<00:00:28.890> frames<00:00:29.429> engine<00:00:29.939> isn't<00:00:30.210> too<00:00:30.539> good<00:00:30.750> on

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
uh other frames engine isn't too good on

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.040 
uh other frames engine isn't too good on
it<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.380> it's<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.640> it's<00:00:32.820> pretty<00:00:33.239> small<00:00:33.630> like

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
it and it's that it's pretty small like

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.690 
it and it's that it's pretty small like
this<00:00:34.590> one's<00:00:34.770> handlebars<00:00:35.190> are<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.370> lot<00:00:35.520> bigger

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
this one's handlebars are a lot bigger

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.709 
this one's handlebars are a lot bigger
and<00:00:35.910> stuff<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:37.760> pulling<00:00:38.760> up<00:00:38.879> go<00:00:39.090> pad<00:00:39.360> sighs

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
and stuff so pulling up go pad sighs

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.799 
and stuff so pulling up go pad sighs

took<00:00:53.250> all<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.550> off<00:00:53.670> back<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.690> wheel<00:00:54.899> and

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
took all that off back on the wheel and

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.799 
took all that off back on the wheel and
a<00:00:55.350> reattach<00:00:56.070> such<00:00:56.399> as<00:00:56.640> drum<00:00:57.210> brakes<00:00:58.910> see

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.230

should I show come those up um it's not
like<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.570> inner<00:01:07.040> wheel<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.310> mean<00:01:08.670> uh<00:01:08.790> with<00:01:09.299> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
like the inner wheel I mean uh with the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.750 
like the inner wheel I mean uh with the
plastic<00:01:09.960> looking<00:01:10.560> wheel<00:01:10.710> has<00:01:11.189> an<00:01:11.369> inflatable

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
plastic looking wheel has an inflatable

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.200 
plastic looking wheel has an inflatable
rubber<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.479> be<00:01:12.689> good<00:01:12.810> for<00:01:12.960> friction<00:01:13.320> drive<00:01:13.530> um

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
rubber so be good for friction drive um

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.789 
rubber so be good for friction drive um
because<00:01:15.210> all<00:01:15.330> they<00:01:15.479> have<00:01:15.659> right<00:01:15.840> now<00:01:16.110> about<00:01:16.409> an

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
because all they have right now about an

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.330 
because all they have right now about an
18<00:01:17.220> CC<00:01:17.750> like<00:01:18.750> feather-light<00:01:19.140> engine<00:01:19.740> that

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
18 CC like feather-light engine that

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.780 
18 CC like feather-light engine that
issue<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.700> perfect<00:01:21.210> for<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.540> because<00:01:22.790> it's

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
issue is perfect for this because it's

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.080 
issue is perfect for this because it's
pretty<00:01:23.850> small<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.840> fit<00:01:25.140> on<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.380> good<00:01:26.090> it's

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
pretty small so fit on this good it's

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.210 
pretty small so fit on this good it's
only<00:01:27.180> like<00:01:27.420> yeah<00:01:27.720> teamcc<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.650> as<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.009> do<00:01:29.130> the
