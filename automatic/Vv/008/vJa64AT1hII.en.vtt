as<00:02:36.400> you<00:02:36.610> can<00:02:36.640> see<00:02:37.090> I'm<00:02:37.600> making<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:38.170> smaller

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
as you can see I'm making a smaller

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.260 
as you can see I'm making a smaller
batch<00:02:38.650> so<00:02:38.920> I<00:02:38.950> just<00:02:39.160> kind<00:02:39.370> of<00:02:39.400> put<00:02:39.640> it<00:02:39.670> in<00:02:39.940> I

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
batch so I just kind of put it in I

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.740 
batch so I just kind of put it in I
think<00:02:40.690> this<00:02:40.780> like<00:02:40.989> table<00:02:42.360> 14<00:02:43.360> no<00:02:43.510> it's<00:02:43.690> not

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
think this like table 14 no it's not

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.080 
think this like table 14 no it's not
it's<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:44.050> smaller<00:02:44.290> 10<00:02:44.590> by<00:02:44.709> 10<00:02:44.890> or<00:02:45.100> whatever<00:02:45.250> Pam

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
it's a smaller 10 by 10 or whatever Pam

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.030 
it's a smaller 10 by 10 or whatever Pam
