deploying others but my baby is fragile
you'll<00:05:51.680> need<00:05:51.889> to<00:05:52.039> protect<00:05:52.430> it<00:05:52.580> from<00:05:52.610> enemy

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
you'll need to protect it from enemy

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.399 
you'll need to protect it from enemy
fire<00:05:53.419> and<00:05:53.779> when<00:05:54.379> the<00:05:54.500> power<00:05:54.770> cells<00:05:55.129> run<00:05:55.400> out

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:56.409 
fire and when the power cells run out

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:58.959 
fire and when the power cells run out
still<00:05:57.409> it's<00:05:58.099> good<00:05:58.279> to<00:05:58.430> have<00:05:58.550> something<00:05:58.939> that

00:05:58.959 --> 00:05:58.969

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.439 
policy ah yes the carapace defence
system<00:06:13.939> this<00:06:14.569> is<00:06:14.779> is<00:06:15.139> a<00:06:15.289> prototype<00:06:15.889> I<00:06:16.159> pour<00:06:16.849> for

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:17.449 
system this is is a prototype I pour for

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:19.899 
system this is is a prototype I pour for
testing<00:06:18.339> same<00:06:19.339> as<00:06:19.490> always

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:19.909

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
fully charged it creates a temporary

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.679 
fully charged it creates a temporary
energy<00:06:26.150> field<00:06:26.419> which<00:06:26.750> acts<00:06:27.319> like<00:06:27.560> shield<00:06:28.689> this

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:29.689 
energy field which acts like shield this

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:31.300 
energy field which acts like shield this
field<00:06:30.050> blocks<00:06:30.560> bullets<00:06:31.039> and<00:06:31.250> explosions

coming<00:06:32.300> from<00:06:32.479> in<00:06:32.629> front<00:06:32.900> of<00:06:33.080> you<00:06:33.430> don't<00:06:34.430> worry

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:34.669 
coming from in front of you don't worry

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:38.589 
coming from in front of you don't worry
you<00:06:35.210> can<00:06:35.419> still<00:06:35.719> move<00:06:35.990> and<00:06:36.379> shoot<00:06:37.099> back<00:06:37.599> but

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:38.599 
you can still move and shoot back but

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:42.309 
you can still move and shoot back but
you're<00:06:38.779> exposed<00:06:39.319> while<00:06:39.830> you<00:06:39.979> fire<00:06:40.839> plus<00:06:41.839> it

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 
you're exposed while you fire plus it

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.589 
you're exposed while you fire plus it
only<00:06:42.469> has<00:06:42.830> limited<00:06:43.219> energy<00:06:44.000> source<00:06:44.270> but

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:44.599 
only has limited energy source but

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:48.100 
only has limited energy source but
nothing<00:06:45.529> lasts<00:06:45.740> forever<00:06:45.949> right<00:06:47.110> remember

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110 
nothing lasts forever right remember

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.709 
nothing lasts forever right remember

then the carapace only protects you from

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:55.089 
then the carapace only protects you from
the<00:06:51.110> front<00:06:51.469> so<00:06:51.819> watch<00:06:52.819> your<00:06:53.060> back
