obviously using up this last life it was

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.449 
obviously using up this last life it was
a<00:03:36.330> really<00:03:36.540> noisy<00:03:36.870> cackling<00:03:37.590> motor<00:03:37.769> you<00:03:38.310> know

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
a really noisy cackling motor you know

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.009 
a really noisy cackling motor you know
big<00:03:38.720> well<00:03:39.720> base<00:03:41.000> noise<00:03:42.000> like<00:03:42.269> that<00:03:42.420> we're<00:03:42.750> way

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
big well base noise like that we're way

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.259 
big well base noise like that we're way
too<00:03:43.049> noisy<00:03:43.410> for<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:43.739> Blackmun<00:03:44.070> motor<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:45.150> know

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
too noisy for a Blackmun motor you know

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.140 
too noisy for a Blackmun motor you know
sounded<00:03:45.989> him<00:03:46.140> you<00:03:46.410> know<00:03:46.560> I<00:03:46.799> kept<00:03:47.790> thinking

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
sounded him you know I kept thinking

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.970 
sounded him you know I kept thinking
when<00:03:48.630> I<00:03:48.780> was<00:03:48.989> listening<00:03:49.140> when<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.500> first<00:03:49.739> runner

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
when I was listening when I first runner

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.380 
when I was listening when I first runner
listening<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.489> that<00:03:50.610> noisy<00:03:50.970> motor

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
listening to that noisy motor

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.509 
listening to that noisy motor
I<00:03:51.540> kept<00:03:52.530> thinking<00:03:52.650> god<00:03:52.980> I<00:03:53.010> thought<00:03:53.250> Lima

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
I kept thinking god I thought Lima

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.130 
I kept thinking god I thought Lima
motors<00:03:54.000> were<00:03:54.090> noisier<00:03:54.480> for<00:03:54.630> example<00:03:54.900> I've<00:03:54.989> got

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
motors were noisier for example I've got

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.830 
motors were noisier for example I've got
a<00:03:55.170> Lima<00:03:55.470> cross<00:03:55.650> 40<00:03:56.130> it<00:03:57.120> was<00:03:57.330> certain<00:03:57.600> it<00:03:57.690> was

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
a Lima cross 40 it was certain it was

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.860 
a Lima cross 40 it was certain it was
well<00:03:58.560> in<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.739> way<00:03:58.860> sounding<00:03:59.480> sounding<00:04:00.480> even

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
well in a way sounding sounding even

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:09.590 
well in a way sounding sounding even
noisier<00:04:01.200> than<00:04:01.470> that<00:04:05.450> so<00:04:07.970> despite<00:04:08.970> that<00:04:09.000> first

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
noisier than that so despite that first

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.080 
noisier than that so despite that first
notice<00:04:10.019> yet<00:04:10.260> using<00:04:10.500> up<00:04:10.709> its<00:04:10.860> last<00:04:11.070> life<00:04:11.310> she

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
notice yet using up its last life she

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.670 
notice yet using up its last life she
should<00:04:12.120> need<00:04:12.360> one<00:04:12.540> really<00:04:12.720> really<00:04:13.170> smooth<00:04:13.470> but

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
should need one really really smooth but

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.630 
should need one really really smooth but
then<00:04:13.799> all<00:04:13.890> of<00:04:13.920> a<00:04:14.040> sudden<00:04:14.070> I<00:04:14.280> had<00:04:14.400> a<00:04:14.459> few

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
then all of a sudden I had a few

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.759 
then all of a sudden I had a few
incidents<00:04:15.000> of<00:04:15.299> they're<00:04:15.420> not<00:04:15.540> starting<00:04:15.840> you

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
incidents of they're not starting you

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.060 
incidents of they're not starting you
know<00:04:16.799> what<00:04:17.040> to<00:04:17.250> turn<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:17.880> controller<00:04:18.269> up<00:04:18.479> and

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
know what to turn the controller up and

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.550 
know what to turn the controller up and
I<00:04:20.070> gave<00:04:20.910> her<00:04:21.060> a<00:04:21.120> first<00:04:21.870> time<00:04:22.049> she<00:04:22.200> didn't<00:04:22.380> start

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
I gave her a first time she didn't start

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.830 
I gave her a first time she didn't start
I<00:04:22.710> just<00:04:22.890> gave<00:04:23.070> her<00:04:23.190> a<00:04:23.280> little<00:04:23.490> push<00:04:23.789> you<00:04:24.720> know

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
I just gave her a little push you know

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
like that and then she moved off but

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.240 
like that and then she moved off but
I<00:04:27.630> had<00:04:28.080> several<00:04:28.350> instance<00:04:28.710> of<00:04:28.890> that<00:04:29.040> and

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250
