the similar size smaller controllers

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.490 
the similar size smaller controllers
then<00:01:41.160> you<00:01:41.220> have<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.610> XXL<00:01:42.540> version<00:01:43.080> of<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.290> bag

then you have the XXL version of the bag

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.190 
then you have the XXL version of the bag
which<00:01:43.800> is<00:01:43.830> bigger<00:01:44.280> which<00:01:44.970> can<00:01:45.270> hold<00:01:45.540> the

weight so what we're going to do is just

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.540 
weight so what we're going to do is just
take<00:01:57.900> a<00:01:57.960> quick<00:01:58.170> rundown<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.040> bendix<00:01:59.460> you
