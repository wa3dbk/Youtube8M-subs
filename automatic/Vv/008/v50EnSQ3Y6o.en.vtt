squish band

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.990 
squish band
squish<00:00:47.020> band<00:00:47.320> is<00:00:47.800> when<00:00:48.070> the<00:00:48.190> piston<00:00:48.550> comes<00:00:48.790> up

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
squish band is when the piston comes up

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.690 
squish band is when the piston comes up
there's<00:00:49.960> air<00:00:50.230> and<00:00:50.500> gas<00:00:50.650> and<00:00:51.100> the<00:00:51.220> squish<00:00:51.460> band

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.700 
there's air and gas and the squish band

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.170 
there's air and gas and the squish band
area

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
area

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.060 
area
it's<00:00:52.450> squished<00:00:52.990> into<00:00:53.560> the<00:00:53.680> combustion

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
it's squished into the combustion

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.840 
it's squished into the combustion
chamber<00:00:54.790> this<00:00:55.270> creates<00:00:55.660> turbulence<00:00:56.850> which

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
chamber this creates turbulence which

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.750 
chamber this creates turbulence which
creates<00:00:58.270> better<00:00:58.990> mixture<00:00:59.470> of<00:00:59.560> gas<00:01:00.100> and<00:01:00.340> air<00:01:00.520> so

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
creates better mixture of gas and air so

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.420 
creates better mixture of gas and air so
they<00:01:00.910> can<00:01:01.150> burn<00:01:01.390> twin-cam<00:01:02.350> had<00:01:02.680> improved<00:01:03.250> the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
they can burn twin-cam had improved the

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.370 
they can burn twin-cam had improved the
design<00:01:03.579> by<00:01:04.030> having<00:01:04.590> squish<00:01:05.590> band<00:01:05.829> all<00:01:06.040> away

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.319 
evolution had used from 1984 to 1999
this<00:01:15.520> is<00:01:15.819> your<00:01:16.210> squish<00:01:16.509> band<00:01:16.810> right<00:01:17.590> here

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
this is your squish band right here

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:22.469 
this is your squish band right here

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.889 
comes up squeezes the air and gases here
in<00:01:25.960> here<00:01:26.289> creating<00:01:27.069> turbulence<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:28.509> is<00:01:28.719> what

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
in here creating turbulence this is what

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:30.569 
in here creating turbulence this is what
makes<00:01:29.139> this<00:01:29.319> engine<00:01:29.710> more<00:01:29.889> efficient<00:01:30.460> and

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
makes this engine more efficient and

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.510 
makes this engine more efficient and
very<00:01:30.939> much<00:01:31.149> faster<00:01:31.420> than<00:01:31.840> its<00:01:31.990> predecessors

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
very much faster than its predecessors

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.179 
very much faster than its predecessors
and<00:01:33.970> with<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:34.420> twin<00:01:34.659> cam<00:01:34.689> had<00:01:35.320> you'll<00:01:35.950> see

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
and with the twin cam had you'll see

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:37.590 
and with the twin cam had you'll see
that<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.460> squish<00:01:36.700> band<00:01:36.970> goes<00:01:37.210> all<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.420> way

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
that the squish band goes all the way

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.260 
that the squish band goes all the way
around<00:01:38.049> and<00:01:38.350> when<00:01:38.799> the<00:01:38.890> piston<00:01:39.280> comes<00:01:39.490> up<00:01:39.790> it's

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
around and when the piston comes up it's

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.469 
around and when the piston comes up it's
forcing<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.740> air<00:01:41.920> more<00:01:42.430> turbulently<00:01:43.090> than

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
forcing the air more turbulently than

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.289 
forcing the air more turbulently than
its<00:01:43.630> predecessor<00:01:44.229> evolution<00:01:45.009> engine<00:01:45.189> in<00:01:45.490> and

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
its predecessor evolution engine in and

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.420 
its predecessor evolution engine in and
again<00:01:46.659> a<00:01:46.720> higher<00:01:46.990> percentage<00:01:47.560> of<00:01:47.649> burn<00:01:47.860> which

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
again a higher percentage of burn which

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.370 
again a higher percentage of burn which
again<00:01:48.700> relates<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.270> engine<00:01:49.539> efficiency<00:01:49.659> and

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
again relates to engine efficiency and

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.070 
again relates to engine efficiency and
engine<00:01:50.830> speed<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:52.450> here<00:01:52.659> we<00:01:52.780> have<00:01:52.929> an

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
engine speed and here we have an

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.609 
engine speed and here we have an
evolution<00:01:53.619> style<00:01:53.950> engine<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:55.570> wafers<00:01:56.020> are

evolution style engine the wafers are

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.820 
evolution style engine the wafers are
made<00:01:56.890> out<00:01:57.189> of<00:01:57.220> aluminum<00:01:57.369> like<00:01:58.119> the<00:01:58.479> rocker<00:01:59.470> box

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
on the shovel head but a big change

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.469 
on the shovel head but a big change
