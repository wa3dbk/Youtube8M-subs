really I mean I can't read this because
this<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.009> French<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.610> bottle<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.030> have

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
this is in French the bottle that I have

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.660 
this is in French the bottle that I have
but<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.630> says<00:00:33.780> it's<00:00:33.899> made<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.230> UK<00:00:34.440> um<00:00:35.309> but

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
but it says it's made in the UK um but

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.510 
but it says it's made in the UK um but
it<00:00:35.820> makes<00:00:36.059> your<00:00:36.600> Facebook<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.800> good<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.340> glowy

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
and I think it gives you like a self-tan

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.560 
and I think it gives you like a self-tan
but<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.250> don't<00:00:41.399> smell<00:00:41.610> like<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.850> burnt<00:00:42.120> Dorito

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
out on the Sun and because the skin

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.700 
out on the Sun and because the skin
cancer<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.480> not<00:00:48.570> good<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.050> runs<00:00:49.200> my<00:00:49.350> family

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
gonna be so awesome but I didn't have a

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.819 
gonna be so awesome but I didn't have a
real<00:01:26.759> mirror<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.570> we<00:01:27.900> needed<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.259> prop<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
real mirror so we needed to prop the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.319 
real mirror so we needed to prop the
mirror<00:01:29.130> from<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.430> palette<00:01:29.790> up<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.090> could

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
mirror from this palette up so I could

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.210 
mirror from this palette up so I could
see<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.990> they<00:01:31.140> use<00:01:31.290> some<00:01:31.530> gaff<00:01:31.770> tape<00:01:31.799> that's

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
see so they use some gaff tape that's

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.590 
see so they use some gaff tape that's
like<00:01:32.310> what<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.549> filmers<00:01:32.850> use<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.210> they

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.030 
like what the filmers use and they
rigged<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.020> up<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.710> mirror<00:01:34.950> would

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
rigged it up so that the mirror would

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.370 
rigged it up so that the mirror would
stay<00:01:35.340> open<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:35.909> not<00:01:36.060> fall<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.259> my
