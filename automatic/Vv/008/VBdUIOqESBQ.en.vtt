 hy 2020 and in 02 calibration and measurements 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:23.109
 of beat el hy 20 2002 is supplied with 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:26.949
 PH electrode and 11 310 support for 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:30.820
 electrodes wall bracket chargers 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:33.580

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.900
 cleaning sachet calibration 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.570
 electrode and normal operations 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.150
 for the correct operation of the equipment it 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.470
 require buffer solutions of 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:49.260
 calibration storage solution 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.700
 Magnetic stirrer cleaning solution 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.330
 and distilled water 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.070
 the vibration we must make sure that the 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.850
 electrode is completely 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.910
 cleansed 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:06.560
 we turn on the equipment 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:09.260
 when connecting the electrode h and 11 310 the 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.580
 equipment immediately recognizes the mode 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.610
 measuring distance 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.730
 when in ph mode we press the key 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.920
 calm and file and erase the data from 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.740
 previous calibration with the zetas key 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.300
 clear 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.760
 later the team will ask us for the 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.230
 confirmation by pressing the key 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.110
 glp cs 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:35.590
 after the deletion the equipment will exit the 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.720
 calibration mode to return from see 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.140
 again press the calm key of 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.200
 farm at this point the team will ask us 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.800
 the first point of ph to calibrate the 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.470
 buffer ph 7.0 1 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.020
 We immerse the ph electrode in the 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.659
 selected paper and we perform 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.270
 agitation 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.370
 we must wait for it to stabilize 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.370
 reading 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.770
 when the reading has stabilized in 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:08.180
 the screen will appear blinking the 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.180
 confirmation information 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:16.500
 to calibrate this point we press the 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.480
 key cfm glp the team will pass 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.760
 automatically to the next point of 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:26.100
 calibration under ph 4.01 we remove the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.970
 standard electrode and we wash with 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.770
 abundant distilled water if we want 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.160
 we can modify the next point of 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.550
 calibration by pressing the arrow key 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.550
 above 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.650
 or down arrow 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.020
 when we have already selected the second 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.080
 calibration point we submerge the 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.020
 electrode in the standard 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.830
 we perform agitation and wait for 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.950
 the reading stabilize 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.500
 when the reading has stabilized in 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.160
 the screen will appear blinking the 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.500
 confirmation information cs for 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.180
 calibrate this point we press the key 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.180
 and the sp cfm 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.450
 we remove the ph electrode and wash 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:21.730
 with abundant distilled water 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:25.590
 the h and 2020 and 102 can be calibrated 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.590
 up to five different points 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.810
 if we wish we can continue with the 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.450
 calibration of more points or we can 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.080
 calc compress the key again and 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.110
 farc in this way the team will keep 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.660
 the points where we have calibrated and output 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.629
 of calibration on the screen 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.730
 main can be seen immediately 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.390
 the condition indicators and in 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:58.920
 electrode response 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:01.860
 in this way the team h and 2020 and 102 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.810
 is fully enabled and ready 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.810
 to perform pedestrian measurements
