it<00:01:07.470> pretty<00:01:07.740> good

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.460 

so<00:01:50.850> that's<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.119> Hydra<00:01:51.390> weight<00:01:51.539> unit<00:01:51.750> you've

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
so that's a Hydra weight unit you've

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.070 
so that's a Hydra weight unit you've
seen<00:01:52.709> how<00:01:53.580> it<00:01:53.700> operates<00:01:54.149> heard<00:01:54.659> what<00:01:54.899> the

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
seen how it operates heard what the

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.169 
seen how it operates heard what the
sound<00:01:55.289> that<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.590> makes<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:56.130> find<00:01:56.880> out<00:01:57.000> more
