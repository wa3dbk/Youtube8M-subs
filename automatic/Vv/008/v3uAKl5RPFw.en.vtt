00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 soon a video I wanted to go yes 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.620
 and the car was built I am with 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.500
 stuck the car went off today 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.349
 I tell you and were finished 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.440
 I realized that something was wrong 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.720
 I saw that this off 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.970
 and then off I saw that 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.869
 the screw loose they are finally the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.240
 screw fuse 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.910
 it can not be true I have 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.349
 So all parts and screws are secure 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.789
 I just give you that 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.219
 I have not got it court 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.110
 But turn loose escape that I have 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.250
 not knowing that I'm doing this here 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.140
 I can do that with us now 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.219
 off the stream it's so easy 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.180
 and I will now definitely the 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.469
 screw here because the mouth and 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.289
 provided screw fuse 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.890
 quite simply they have become easy 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.050
 solved is really the hammer 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.140
 So I do not believe the engine yet 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.960
 he was happy I know 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.280
 that now no noise 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.130
 really lucky that I did that 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.530
 I'll continue to see that for myself 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:17.090
 Drove and I think we would have then 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.090
 had a beautiful engine damage 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.950
 the moment I take that off and then 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.759
 rises again everything brought out the 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.850
 Motto chose served so I can 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.000
 notice nothing 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.000
 inside 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.130
 oil 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:49.860
 only it is rust or what that is 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:52.780
 I will not tell you now 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:58.720
 in any case, this is like being wet and humid 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:00.840
 it's just that it's because I'm there 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.990
 not really made 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.010
 but I think that's it 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.940
 then I sit back would be here 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.950
 and definitely makes now 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.330
 friendly screw fuse times 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.600
 I would like to open the motto 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.150
 not really anymore so you do 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:23.460
 Now together again and then I test 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.460
 again once works for you 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.570
 because then reset the regulator because 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.880
 he did not really slow down either 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.620
 was the blogger was, although there is also 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.230
 also remembered because I looked 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.090
 but that was the case 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:55.080
 and now that would be tightened but 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.720
 i even have the google was the one 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.300
 brake very different yes that was there immediately 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.410
 grabbed immediately and yes 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.700
 reverse gear and everything works fine 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:08.310
 have now tested five minutes as 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.130
 said nothing to see and how 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.520
 Noises do not matter either 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.170
 will not be extreme but I guess we 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.330
 have not suffered any harm 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.270
 as I said today I have no desire 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.100
 More to build together without joke 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.570
 if you have eliminated something and 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.820
 has corrected something and that again 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.440
 does anything else come to me? 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.800
 I think if I dare completely 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.830
 finished it takes a few more 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.870
 months tells 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.490
 but that's a great guy and always 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.590
 if you notice something and that 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.160
 mending it comes finally again 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.680
 but something else 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:51.090
 So I say I'll go with me now 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:54.110
 my quadrocopter and see you 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:59.330
 maybe tomorrow and the day after tomorrow 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.330
 and many thanks for watching
