00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.410
 hello to all guys here and fanfare for 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.929
 hicks and welcome to the fourth part of the 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.969
 magic tutorial in this part 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.679
 we will see how structured as 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.780
 structured a duel of magic as it is 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.580
 structured a match 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.119
 and while in the next part we will see 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.000
 to the variability of all the cards 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.960
 well then the magic we practically have 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.199
 the grimoire that would be our bat 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:37.700
 and I have pretty much every player fishing 7 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.700
 so we call cards then 23 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.879
 set our opponent equally 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.820
 then or in magic 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.129
 if we for example have the hand we have 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.570
 we don't like it 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.260
 we can do a call operation 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.990
 mulligan which consists of mixing the 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.970
 own hand in the deck and draw one 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.350
 part and less so if we have caught them 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.840
 7 and we will decide 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.330
 we will decide to make mulligan e 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.820
 we will mix the hand in the bunch e 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.470
 we will draw 6 cards this operation can 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.119
 be done as many times as we want 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:27.030
 up to one card so every time you do 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:34.409
 will draw a part less than anyway 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:36.090
 we have fished these cards e 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.939
 our opponent 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:44.430
 this time to start there is for 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.829
 see who the game starts you can 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.259
 you know if you can use any way 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.829
 I'd be rock from paper to scissors 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.380
 instead raise the bunch before pouring ago 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:59.520
 I also see who has the card with a 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.320
 higher mana cost is what it has 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.810
 caught by Article hand most things fall 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.299
 high start you can do we change dispute 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.380
 then let's say for example that I start 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:13.410
 me me 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:17.280
 this creature that needs 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:20.580
 tremble two in color is one by one 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.070
 swamp and this part is instant 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.950
 just one to proceed for years 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:29.340
 creature or target game 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.080
 so in this case since mi 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.420
 it would be better to use this because first 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:38.190
 this when mostafa the anchor and sokol 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.800
 put a land on the stage and play the 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.760
 my lightning that you turn the damage to 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.200
 target player each player has 20 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.640
 life points 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.800
 ok, the goal is to go down in series 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.380
 continuity of the opponent however the 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.810
 our opponent 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.810
 draw a card and its first turn 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:08.570
 will a land he would spend there 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.570
 tour we fish 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.739
 what is another earth at this stage 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.060
 let's put a swamp and spend the shift 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.800
 because we can't do anything yet 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:28.430
 for him the fishing crossing takes 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:31.819
 this glossy paper I said okay mind 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.040
 a swamp for example him now 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.110
 could play this card that says 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.190
 destroys target creature but 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.690
 since I have no creature it would be useless 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:46.099
 the shift goes by 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:48.290
 we fish ok we took another 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.239
 mountain we put it 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:55.310
 and at this point we can evoke this 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:57.709
 creature we know two in color is one 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.010
 swamp we play the creature that for 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.540
 now he can't attack because there 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.440
 remember that you suffer from weakness from 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:12.980
 summon then we pass the turn 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:17.810
 our opponent fishes for what he puts 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:21.950
 a swamp if it has it, here it is and can 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:28.789
 play this creature too then 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:29.830
 stage 2 marshes and play his too 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.830
 creature 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.830
 ok 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.940
 every turn remember to tear yourself away 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.820
 lands before fishing then us 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:47.620
 we know 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:50.770
 we fish we have only earthquake 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.020
 so let's put a swamp and we can a 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:56.170
 decide whether to attack or pass the turn 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:59.350
 in this case we do so I decide to 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.240
 attack my staff decides to 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.540
 or parry could also yield of 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.550
 to spend years and years to him 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.770
 but he decides to parry then vi 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.140
 I remember doing strength 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.600
 with my creature attacking with the 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.150
 his constitution therefore in this case 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.480
 my strength resets its constitution 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.340
 but in turn I have the strength of this 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.680
 creature clears my constitution 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.520
 it would be two then both but from the 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.110
 cemetery and put you here go to the 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.300
 cards to the cemeteries to which the cards go 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.640
 require you if they are the cards they are 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:37.200
 been shown were removed from 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:39.670
 game are no longer recoverable anyway 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.150
 a baby showed more or less 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:46.030
 how a game is structured 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:49.840
 anyway let's move on 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:54.000
 just for demonstration let's see yes 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.000
 find a creature inside 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:06.040
 I caught this part it takes 5 and 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:10.510
 Now, however, four earth lament 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:15.310
 after five lands and I put mine 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:17.040
 creature that does not carry carc passes the 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:24.729
 turn instead to print the lands 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:26.260
 fish and put a land cunningly into 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:29.229
 then opponent who could not play 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:33.760
 no creature decides to use this 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:36.580
 card then stage a swamp is one 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.280
 mountain and use this part on mine 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:43.510
 creature that says destroy live at 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:45.580
 cemetery this card is destroyed o 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.290
 to the cemetery also because of the effect 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:51.310
 be solved 

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:55.690
 and oh well if it continues to attack 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:57.729
 or go up against magic spells until one 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:02.710
 from opponents will not come down will raise 

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:05.710
 continuity and is hurt enough so why 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:08.740
 video today and in the next part 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:12.960
 precisely we will see the variability of the 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:15.550
 of the creatures that are enough and 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.139
 thanks for once again for having 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.539
 watched what he always liked 

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:21.450
 put me like comment if there is 

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:25.500
 some doubt is if you want to sign up 

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:25.500
 thanks to the next bye bye
