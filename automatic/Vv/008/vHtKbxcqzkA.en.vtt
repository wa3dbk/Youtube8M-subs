00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
you know and one of things I just

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.819 
you know and one of things I just
learned<00:01:54.600> about<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:54.840> one<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.229> battery<00:01:55.649> on

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
learned about this one the battery on

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.200 
learned about this one the battery on
this<00:01:55.950> watch<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.490> it's<00:01:56.640> not<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.909> special

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
this watch and it's not a special

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.420 
this watch and it's not a special
battery<00:01:57.600> it's<00:01:58.289> a<00:01:58.409> stand<00:01:58.710> standard<00:01:59.189> battery

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
battery it's a stand standard battery

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.959 
battery it's a stand standard battery
for<00:02:00.090> years<00:02:00.710> that's<00:02:01.710> how<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.340> tells<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.729> how

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
for years that's how it tells you how

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.600 
for years that's how it tells you how
well<00:02:05.060> machined<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.600> movement<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:08.100> what

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
well machined that movement is so what

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.190 
well machined that movement is so what
else<00:02:08.760> you're<00:02:08.910> getting

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
else you're getting

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.080 
else you're getting
this<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.319> 200<00:02:10.799> meter<00:02:10.979> water<00:02:11.579> resistant

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
this is 200 meter water resistant

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.119 
this is 200 meter water resistant
because<00:02:12.239> it's<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.510> claw<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.750> believe<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:13.680> 200

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
because it's the claw I believe so 200

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.619 
because it's the claw I believe so 200
meter<00:02:14.250> water<00:02:14.489> resistant<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.120> everything

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
meter water resistant and everything

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.000 
meter water resistant and everything
about<00:02:15.840> Vostok<00:02:16.290> Europe<00:02:16.560> one<00:02:16.739> of<00:02:16.799> the<00:02:16.890> things

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
about Vostok Europe one of the things

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.530 
about Vostok Europe one of the things
that<00:02:17.129> Tim<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.430> love<00:02:17.610> about<00:02:17.849> it<00:02:17.939> in<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.390> this

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
that Tim and I love about it in and this

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.509 
that Tim and I love about it in and this
were<00:02:18.720> actually<00:02:19.230> taking<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.680> same<00:02:19.950> concept

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
were actually taking the same concept

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:21.770 
were actually taking the same concept
into<00:02:20.879> what<00:02:21.090> we're<00:02:21.180> going<00:02:21.299> to<00:02:21.360> be<00:02:21.420> doing<00:02:21.540> goes
