00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 what's happening more fans today I bring you 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.330
 rumboxing the first impressions of 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.330
 meizu m2 we are not going to see it 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.430
 we already have here the box of this m2 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.619
 we are not going to see what it contains and we pass 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.150
 to see the differences of m2 with 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.820
 with respect to the previous version of meizu 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.529
 the m1 load 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.630
 well we logically open the first thing that 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.250
 we found the terminal on one side 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.980
 we also have the adapter 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.190
 current one more power adapter 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.240
 small of the one who brings the mx-5 and who has 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.540
 an exit let's see 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.270
 2 amps an output that is pretty 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.240
 well we also have the tool by 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.460
 the extraction of tray 7 in this 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.860
 occasion is a sim dual terminal and supports 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.960
 two nano singh in one of the slots 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.330
 to give minus 100 we put in place of 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.490
 include the nano without including a card 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.590
 microsd to expand the memory 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.210
 of the terminal, which includes the 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.430
 package is also a protector of 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.870
 plastic screen and logically the 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.340
 typical instruction manual and 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.340
 mail guarantee let's see the 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.140
 device the m2 does not have some measurements 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.200
 15 centimeters high 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.710
 7.5 centimeters wide and 87 millimeters 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.470
 thick 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.970
 all in 149 grams in terms of 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.400
 technical specifications has a 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.890
 ips 5.5 inch screen and 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.890
 full resolution hd a processor 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.110
 mediatek ota core to 13 gigahertz and 2 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.170
 gb of ram an internal storage of 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.750
 16 or 32 gb expandable by micro sd 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.390
 a 5 megapixel front camera and 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.760
 13 rear and one 3100 battery 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.050
 milliamperios we already have here the m2 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.190
 nou is so let's see how it is 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.200
 physically at the top we have 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.580
 camera notifications and sensors 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.530
 down we find the first 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.290
 difference with respect to mono email and 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.510
 is that they have a physical button 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.210
 physical that in this case does not have the 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.650
 fingerprint function careful with 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.180
 this because I have met several 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.980
 people or I know several people who 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.930
 have bought this mobile thinking that 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.170
 had this function the physical button of the 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.430
 m2 no and it's not like that so take care 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.200
 superior we find the 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.050
 cancellation microphone and connection 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.820
 for headphones left side we 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.770
 we found with the volume buttons and 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.870
 with him the second difference with 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.880
 with respect to m-19 and is that the button 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.610
 off and on we found it 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.830
 also on the left side in the m1 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.480
 note of the off and on button is 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.980
 found in the top thing that 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.650
 It was a bit uncomfortable since the size 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.840
 of the terminals is quite large in the 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.090
 lower part we find the 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.130
 speaker microphone and the connection for the 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.230
 microusb cable and lastly on the side 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.840
 right we find the slot 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.400
 for for the nano sim as I said 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.260
 previously 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.150
 in the back we have up 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.099
 focused on the main camera and we have 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.049
 a double double-tone flash as you see 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.849
 we also have my son's logo and 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.349
 In terms of materials, it must be said that 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.239
 the terminal is completely 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.400
 built in plastic looked like that by 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:03.569
 behind the truth that the terminal is a 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.060
 I trace to the m1 out we already have this here 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.680
 m2 nou is running as I say 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.299
 many times flame and it's a layer 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.500
 pretty light with the light thing me 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.959
 I mean, it has no applications 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.670
 Excessive garbage is true that comes to you 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.310
 the odd one in pre-installed Chinese 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.260
 but the good thing is that you can 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.239
 erase without any problem with or 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.430
 without any kind of problem I mean 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.319
 that it is not necessary to root the terminal 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.900
 nor do weird things to be able to erase 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.670
 the applications that we do not want is 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.739
 true that I did not include any 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.680
 that another application like for example a 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:37.500
 of security but apart from this the 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.569
 layer is pretty clean that I do have to 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.459
 also say that it is very intrusive with 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.859
 what I want to say is that I do not know 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.870
 it seems practically nothing to pure android 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.660
 in the settings you can see it does not have 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.850
 nothing to do with pure android 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.200
 a typical Chinese layer as to what the 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.270
 application drawer since it does not have 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.830
 but good the good thing that you have these 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.290
 Android stuff is that if you do not like it 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.840
 this layer, then you can install the 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.230
 then he will make a chair and everyone is happy not 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.210
 to any kind of problem something that has 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:10.200
 good this mail sleep two new for 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:12.120
 me an improvement over the m1 s the 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.220
 inclusion of this this physical button more 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.870
 that nothing because for example making a 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.330
 Simple touch without pressing 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:22.060
 the button then it makes you button 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:24.160
 recoil which is very very well 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.970
 there are times when the terminal moves 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.970
 it moves pretty well 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.180
 You see it all works very well 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.940
 here you have the application that told us 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.190
 of security that good in a moment 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.010
 determined well then it can be quite 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.650
 useful for example to erase the memory 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.290
 cache and others that good is occupying 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.960
 there is a space that can be true 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.720
 valuable moment for us and good 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.240
 up to here the first look at this made 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.210
 to wear meters know of a very revision 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.190
 minimum for the m1 out that from my point 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.020
 of view has improved certain things like 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.230
 for example with the inclusion of this 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.640
 central physical button with the inclusion of 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.190
 this button off and action of a 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.040
 lateral instead of up and what 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.680
 The only thing I hope is that it has improved 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.060
 speaker sound something that from my 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.400
 view is the only thing 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.380
 failed to m-19 for the price it has 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.990
 it's a terminal that was really worth it 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.240
 but the defect was that the volume of 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.740
 speaker was pretty quite low 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.930
 apart from that the quality was not very 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.510
 good in future videos we will see how it is 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.640
 the quality of this how it unfolds and 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.890
 how is this terminal that good to 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.390
 simple view I think it's worth it 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.870
 that we see nothing in the next video 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.870
 see you later
