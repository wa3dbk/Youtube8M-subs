00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
this gun in the must-have section but

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.400 
this gun in the must-have section but
actually<00:01:46.180> it<00:01:46.270> does<00:01:46.420> not<00:01:46.600> because<00:01:47.050> in<00:01:47.200> later

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
actually it does not because in later

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.380 
actually it does not because in later
waves<00:01:47.710> like<00:01:48.040> wave<00:01:48.220> 20<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:48.760> on<00:01:48.850> it's

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
waves like wave 20 and on it's

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.510 
waves like wave 20 and on it's
completely<00:01:50.020> useless<00:01:50.200> so<00:01:50.740> it<00:01:50.920> is<00:01:51.040> still<00:01:51.280> in<00:01:51.430> the

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
completely useless so it is still in the

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.150 
completely useless so it is still in the
desperate<00:01:51.910> section<00:01:52.270> and<00:01:52.420> it<00:01:52.840> sits<00:01:53.170> at<00:01:53.470> a<00:01:53.530> solid

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
desperate section and it sits at a solid

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.850 
desperate section and it sits at a solid
six<00:01:54.700> and<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:54.910> half<00:01:54.940> now<00:01:55.450> as<00:01:55.960> you<00:01:56.110> previously<00:01:56.320> saw

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
six and a half now as you previously saw

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.380 
six and a half now as you previously saw
in<00:01:56.980> the<00:01:57.070> footage<00:01:57.280> I<00:01:57.490> did<00:01:57.670> purchase<00:01:57.910> the<00:01:58.210> bowie

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
in the footage I did purchase the bowie

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.180 
in the footage I did purchase the bowie
knife<00:01:58.630> just<00:01:58.900> because<00:01:59.170> that<00:01:59.350> does<00:01:59.560> make<00:01:59.800> this<00:01:59.980> a

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
knife just because that does make this a

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.000 
knife just because that does make this a
lot<00:02:00.460> more<00:02:00.520> effective<00:02:01.090> but<00:02:01.690> still<00:02:02.110> after<00:02:02.770> wave

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
lot more effective but still after wave

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.190 
lot more effective but still after wave
13<00:02:03.550> it's<00:02:03.760> no<00:02:03.910> longer<00:02:04.150> a<00:02:04.300> one-hit<00:02:04.660> kill<00:02:04.930> and

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
13 it's no longer a one-hit kill and

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.590 
13 it's no longer a one-hit kill and
then<00:02:05.320> by<00:02:05.500> wave<00:02:05.710> 20<00:02:06.190> it<00:02:06.430> is<00:02:06.460> rendered<00:02:07.270> useless

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
then by wave 20 it is rendered useless

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:34.750 
then by wave 20 it is rendered useless
oh<00:02:08.140> gee<00:02:09.070> sees<00:02:09.280> all<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.729> brave

special<00:03:06.599> weapon<00:03:06.900> is<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.019> crossbow<00:03:07.560> when<00:03:07.739> it's

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
special weapon is the crossbow when it's

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.099 
special weapon is the crossbow when it's
upgraded<00:03:08.069> it<00:03:08.459> becomes<00:03:08.879> the<00:03:09.120> awful<00:03:09.510> often<00:03:09.900> and

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
upgraded it becomes the awful often and

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:11.720 
upgraded it becomes the awful often and
then<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.290> attracts<00:03:10.620> zombies<00:03:11.129> so<00:03:11.310> basically

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
then it attracts zombies so basically

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.000 
then it attracts zombies so basically
it's<00:03:12.239> exactly<00:03:12.750> like<00:03:12.840> monkeys<00:03:13.379> so<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.709> zombies

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
it's exactly like monkeys so the zombies

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.349 
it's exactly like monkeys so the zombies
all<00:03:14.129> swarm<00:03:14.459> around<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.819> arrow<00:03:15.030> when<00:03:15.239> you

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
all swarm around the arrow when you

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.140 
all swarm around the arrow when you
shoot<00:03:15.569> it<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:15.840> then<00:03:16.140> they<00:03:16.290> get<00:03:16.409> blown<00:03:16.650> up<00:03:16.829> and

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
shoot it and then they get blown up and

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.129 
shoot it and then they get blown up and
now<00:03:18.150> this<00:03:18.299> gun<00:03:18.540> I<00:03:18.750> would<00:03:18.989> definitely

now this gun I would definitely

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.379 
now this gun I would definitely
categorize<00:03:19.920> it<00:03:19.950> as<00:03:20.159> they<00:03:20.519> must<00:03:20.760> have<00:03:21.030> if

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
categorize it as they must have if

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.569 
categorize it as they must have if

this<00:03:27.720> is<00:03:27.870> definitely<00:03:28.170> a<00:03:28.200> must-have<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:28.799> I

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
this is definitely a must-have and I

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.339 
this is definitely a must-have and I
would<00:03:28.980> rate<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.280> as<00:03:29.519> a<00:03:29.760> ten<00:03:30.090> just<00:03:30.810> because<00:03:31.109> it's

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
would rate it as a ten just because it's

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:38.720 
would rate it as a ten just because it's
like<00:03:31.620> having<00:03:32.040> 13<00:03:32.609> monkeys<00:03:36.650> pack<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.680> punch<00:03:38.129> just

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.580 

I<00:04:00.970> guess<00:04:01.970> he<00:04:02.150> needs<00:04:02.360> to<00:04:02.510> get<00:04:02.629> blowed<00:04:02.959> up<00:04:02.989> again

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
on the zombie map 5 and what it does is

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.550 
on the zombie map 5 and what it does is
it<00:04:33.280> actually<00:04:33.400> freezes<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:34.180> zombies<00:04:34.600> so<00:04:35.320> that

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
it actually freezes the zombies so that

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.710 
it actually freezes the zombies so that
you<00:04:35.740> can<00:04:35.950> easily<00:04:36.220> shoot<00:04:36.820> them<00:04:37.060> and<00:04:37.390> kill<00:04:37.690> them

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
and it is a ton of damage as well and

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.980 
and it is a ton of damage as well and
then<00:04:39.730> when<00:04:39.820> you<00:04:39.910> upgrade<00:04:40.060> it<00:04:40.360> it<00:04:40.450> becomes<00:04:40.720> the

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
then when you upgrade it it becomes the

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.140 
then when you upgrade it it becomes the
winters<00:04:41.410> fury<00:04:41.860> and<00:04:42.220> the<00:04:42.430> effect<00:04:42.730> gives<00:04:42.880> it<00:04:43.090> a

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
winters fury and the effect gives it a

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.210 
winters fury and the effect gives it a
larger<00:04:43.540> magazine<00:04:44.020> and<00:04:44.260> a<00:04:44.320> longer<00:04:44.560> freeze<00:04:44.950> time

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
so you can freeze the zombies and then

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.650 
so you can freeze the zombies and then
either<00:04:51.220> shoot<00:04:51.520> them<00:04:51.700> with<00:04:51.730> your<00:04:51.820> secondary<00:04:52.360> or

either shoot them with your secondary or

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.230 
either shoot them with your secondary or
just<00:04:52.900> run<00:04:53.320> the<00:04:53.440> hell<00:04:53.560> away<00:04:53.710> on<00:04:54.040> the<00:04:54.910> on<00:04:55.180> the

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
just run the hell away on the on the

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.610 
just run the hell away on the on the
scale<00:04:55.540> i<00:04:55.570> would<00:04:55.840> definitely<00:04:56.020> write<00:04:56.260> this<00:04:56.410> as

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
scale i would definitely write this as

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.220 
scale i would definitely write this as
they<00:04:56.860> must<00:04:57.160> have<00:04:57.460> but<00:04:58.270> i<00:04:58.300> would<00:04:58.510> probably<00:04:59.080> only

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
they must have but i would probably only

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:07.680 
they must have but i would probably only
give<00:04:59.500> it<00:04:59.530> a<00:04:59.800> nine<00:05:05.940> now<00:05:06.940> the<00:05:07.000> fifth<00:05:07.420> and<00:05:07.660> final

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690
