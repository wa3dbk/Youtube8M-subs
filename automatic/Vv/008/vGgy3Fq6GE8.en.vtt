00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
and then what you do is basically go

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.380 
and then what you do is basically go
back<00:01:18.330> with<00:01:18.600> your<00:01:18.750> index<00:01:19.020> finger<00:01:19.140> like<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.590> oh

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
so we have two steps right now one two

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.700 
so we have two steps right now one two
and<00:01:23.729> then<00:01:24.509> third<00:01:24.780> one<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.140> basically<00:01:25.530> with

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
index down again so you have up one time

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.300 
index down again so you have up one time
down<00:01:30.030> one<00:01:30.329> time<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.869> three<00:01:31.229> times<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.680> far<00:01:31.920> one
