here mining mining mining so eventually
I<00:01:05.640> will<00:01:05.700> reach<00:01:06.090> iron<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.810> we<00:01:06.930> will<00:01:07.140> go<00:01:07.350> from

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
I will reach iron and we will go from

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.859 
I will reach iron and we will go from
there<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:09.229> iron<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.920> right<00:01:11.460> about<00:01:11.700> here
