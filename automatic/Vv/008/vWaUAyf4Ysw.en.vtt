architecture I know avocado will know

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.410 
architecture I know avocado will know
what<00:01:25.130> I<00:01:25.190> mean<00:01:25.310> because<00:01:25.700> he<00:01:25.729> first<00:01:25.970> introduced

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
what I mean because he first introduced

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.790 
what I mean because he first introduced
me<00:01:26.479> to<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:26.660> hotel<00:01:26.869> at<00:01:27.110> eating<00:01:27.320> hot<00:01:27.470> springs

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
me to the hotel at eating hot springs

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.880 
me to the hotel at eating hot springs
after<00:01:28.700> that<00:01:28.910> I<00:01:29.179> found<00:01:29.509> this<00:01:29.660> almost<00:01:30.289> identical

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
after that I found this almost identical

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.980 
after that I found this almost identical
hotels<00:01:31.310> across<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.300> country<00:01:32.630> at<00:01:32.720> different

hotels across the country at different

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.630 
hotels across the country at different
springs<00:01:33.229> what<00:01:33.860> I<00:01:33.890> came<00:01:33.979> to<00:01:34.100> understand<00:01:34.520> what

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
springs what I came to understand what

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.609 
springs what I came to understand what
this<00:01:34.820> stuff<00:01:35.030> was<00:01:35.060> common<00:01:35.539> that<00:01:36.140> building

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
this stuff was common that building

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:37.900 
this stuff was common that building
right<00:01:36.649> there<00:01:36.830> if<00:01:37.130> you<00:01:37.220> notice<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.670> copper

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
right there if you notice the copper

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.630 
right there if you notice the copper
spike<00:01:38.270> on<00:01:38.479> the<00:01:38.539> top<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:39.440> six-sided<00:01:39.920> geometry

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
spike on the top the six-sided geometry

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.550 
spike on the top the six-sided geometry
of<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.759> whole<00:01:40.940> building<00:01:41.259> this<00:01:42.259> is<00:01:42.410> like

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
of the whole building this is like

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.870 
of the whole building this is like
sacred<00:01:42.800> young<00:01:43.160> through<00:01:43.399> here<00:01:43.580> in<00:01:43.729> the

sacred young through here in the
hexagonal<00:01:44.270> shape<00:01:44.780> of<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.110> structure<00:01:45.470> of

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
hexagonal shape of the structure of

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.800 
hexagonal shape of the structure of
water<00:01:45.799> so<00:01:46.369> when<00:01:46.610> I<00:01:46.640> first<00:01:47.150> found<00:01:47.329> this<00:01:47.540> just

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
water so when I first found this just

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.450 
water so when I first found this just
the<00:01:47.900> other<00:01:48.020> day<00:01:48.229> and<00:01:48.500> was<00:01:48.920> really<00:01:49.250> blown<00:01:49.400> away

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
the other day and was really blown away

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.100 
the other day and was really blown away
by<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:49.790> Arctic<00:01:50.090> Ocean<00:01:50.150> now<00:01:50.390> they<00:01:50.540> started<00:01:50.960> um

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
by the Arctic Ocean now they started um

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.679 
by the Arctic Ocean now they started um
they<00:01:51.680> rebuilt<00:01:52.159> this<00:01:52.400> recently<00:01:52.970> but<00:01:53.479> that's

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
they rebuilt this recently but that's

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.300 
they rebuilt this recently but that's
the<00:01:53.869> original<00:01:54.049> building<00:01:54.740> sitting<00:01:54.950> on<00:01:55.100> top

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
the original building sitting on top

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.789 
the original building sitting on top
from<00:01:55.670> about<00:01:56.090> a<00:01:56.119> hundred<00:01:56.210> years<00:01:56.810> ago<00:01:57.079> and<00:01:57.380> what

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
from about a hundred years ago and what

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.859 
from about a hundred years ago and what
you<00:01:57.920> see<00:01:58.159> in<00:01:58.280> there<00:01:58.399> has<00:01:58.549> been<00:01:58.700> redone<00:01:59.240> but

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
you see in there has been redone but

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.109 
you see in there has been redone but
it's<00:02:00.020> pretty<00:02:00.320> old<00:02:00.649> and<00:02:01.250> again<00:02:01.490> this<00:02:01.640> water<00:02:01.909> has

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
it's pretty old and again this water has

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.940 
it's pretty old and again this water has
a<00:02:02.180> lot<00:02:02.420> of<00:02:02.450> history<00:02:02.810> they<00:02:03.020> used<00:02:03.320> it<00:02:03.530> they

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
a lot of history they used it they

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.620 
a lot of history they used it they
shipped<00:02:04.280> it<00:02:04.369> out<00:02:04.520> they<00:02:04.820> put<00:02:05.030> it<00:02:05.119> on<00:02:05.240> ships

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
shipped it out they put it on ships

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.389 
shipped it out they put it on ships
because<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.110> water<00:02:06.290> lasted<00:02:06.799> so<00:02:06.979> long<00:02:07.009> as<00:02:07.280> they

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
because the water lasted so long as they

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.639 
because the water lasted so long as they
fresh<00:02:07.640> so<00:02:07.820> long<00:02:08.000> so<00:02:08.509> when<00:02:08.690> you<00:02:08.780> go<00:02:08.929> up<00:02:09.110> you'll

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
fresh so long so when you go up you'll

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.080 
fresh so long so when you go up you'll
notice<00:02:09.829> that<00:02:09.979> there's<00:02:10.280> kind<00:02:10.459> of<00:02:10.549> a<00:02:10.640> sank<00:02:10.910> that

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
notice that there's kind of a sank that

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.789 
notice that there's kind of a sank that
any<00:02:11.209> kind<00:02:11.420> of<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:11.570> vibe<00:02:12.079> in<00:02:12.290> there<00:02:12.440> you'll<00:02:12.560> feel

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
any kind of a vibe in there you'll feel

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.400 
any kind of a vibe in there you'll feel
the<00:02:13.120> sacredness<00:02:14.120> of<00:02:14.239> the<00:02:14.360> place<00:02:14.570> and<00:02:14.900> this

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
the sacredness of the place and this

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.600 
the sacredness of the place and this
