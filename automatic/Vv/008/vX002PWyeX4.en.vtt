00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.490 
that you possibly yeah but on the plate
in<00:00:53.460> these<00:00:53.640> three<00:00:53.820> places<00:00:54.450> and<00:00:54.780> I've<00:00:54.960> only

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
in these three places and I've only

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.080 
in these three places and I've only
taken<00:00:55.739> one<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.040> those<00:00:56.280> places<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:56.910> there's

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
taken one of those places so there's

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.530 
taken one of those places so there's
still<00:00:57.180> two<00:00:57.510> more<00:00:58.640> well<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.970> see<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.210> actually

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
still two more well you see I actually

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.910 
still two more well you see I actually
at<00:01:00.780> your<00:01:00.989> fault<00:01:01.260> because<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.590> last<00:01:01.770> three

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
at your fault because the last three

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.399 
at your fault because the last three
times<00:01:02.160> you've<00:01:02.280> been<00:01:02.310> finishing<00:01:02.730> third<00:01:03.409> so

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
times you've been finishing third so

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.050 
times you've been finishing third so
maybe<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:04.829> you<00:01:04.890> could<00:01:05.040> get<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.399> a<00:01:05.519> second<00:01:05.970> then

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
maybe if you could get is a second then

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.539 
maybe if you could get is a second then
I<00:01:06.149> could<00:01:06.329> get<00:01:06.479> on<00:01:06.540> third<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.020> then<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.549> could

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
I could get on third and then we could

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.810 
I could get on third and then we could
put<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.880> yeah<00:01:09.659> that's<00:01:09.930> true<00:01:10.610> we've<00:01:11.610> got

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
put in yeah that's true we've got

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.669 
put in yeah that's true we've got
souther<00:01:12.240> coming<00:01:12.570> up<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:12.930> how<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.380> feeling

00:01:13.669 --> 00:01:13.679

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:16.160 
souther coming up so how you feeling
about<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:14.069> well<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:14.939> definitely<00:01:15.780> am<00:01:15.899> when<00:01:16.079> I'm

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
about that well I definitely am when I'm

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.459 
about that well I definitely am when I'm
in<00:01:16.289> southwick<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.399> it's<00:01:17.639> your<00:01:17.789> choice<00:01:17.819> to

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469 
in southwick so it's your choice to

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:20.899 
in southwick so it's your choice to
maybe<00:01:19.469> be<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.950> other<00:01:20.069> two<00:01:20.340> steps<00:01:20.639> but

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
maybe be on the other two steps but

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.779 
maybe be on the other two steps but
something's<00:01:21.719> definitely<00:01:21.869> one<00:01:22.380> well<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.130> don't

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
something's definitely one well I don't

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.169 
something's definitely one well I don't
think<00:01:23.939> that's<00:01:24.119> going<00:01:24.329> to<00:01:24.420> happen<00:01:26.179> that's

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
think that's going to happen that's

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:28.699 
think that's going to happen that's
going<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.389> be<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.539> tough<00:01:27.749> one<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:28.170> beat<00:01:28.200> me<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.679> it

00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:28.709 
going to be a tough one to beat me to it

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:32.209 
going to be a tough one to beat me to it
but<00:01:29.659> if<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:31.020> see<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.380> second<00:01:31.829> air<00:01:31.979> then

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
but if I can see you second air then

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.510 
but if I can see you second air then
that'll<00:01:33.179> be<00:01:33.209> pretty<00:01:33.389> good<00:01:33.950> especially<00:01:34.950> for<00:01:35.280> I

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
it could be the added pressure of having

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.020 
it could be the added pressure of having
a<00:02:49.970> really<00:02:50.180> nice<00:02:50.420> African<00:02:51.110> helmet<00:02:51.620> that<00:02:52.520> is<00:02:52.880> the
