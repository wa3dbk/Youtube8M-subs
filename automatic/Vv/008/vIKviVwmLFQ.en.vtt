people they have the natural instinct to
slow<00:00:54.149> down<00:00:54.329> for<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.539> cars<00:00:54.750> ahead<00:00:55.020> if<00:00:55.140> they're

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
slow down for the cars ahead if they're

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.049 
slow down for the cars ahead if they're
breaking<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:55.800> front<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.070> them<00:00:56.160> or<00:00:56.280> whatnot<00:00:56.430> so

breaking in front of them or whatnot so

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.549 
breaking in front of them or whatnot so
all<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.390> fear<00:00:57.690> we<00:00:57.840> know<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.020> get<00:00:58.260> used<00:00:58.469> to

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
all of that fear we know you get used to

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.349 
all of that fear we know you get used to
in<00:00:58.710> couple<00:00:58.980> races<00:00:59.120> eventually<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.270> know

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
in couple races eventually you know

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.470 
in couple races eventually you know
everyone<00:01:00.690> will<00:01:01.289> start<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.739> sweat<00:01:02.270> but<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.300> is

everyone will start to sweat but it is

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.880 
everyone will start to sweat but it is
one<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.750> smaller<00:01:04.409> tracks<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.769> I've

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
one of the smaller tracks that I've

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.590 
one of the smaller tracks that I've
created<00:01:05.100> called<00:01:05.670> visual<00:01:05.820> perception<00:01:06.390> which

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
created called visual perception which

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.690 
created called visual perception which
is<00:01:06.630> our<00:01:06.930> consisting<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.560> four<00:01:08.250> laps<00:01:08.430> I've

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
is our consisting of four laps I've

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.810 
is our consisting of four laps I've
created<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.270> lot<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.510> smaller<00:01:09.840> tracks<00:01:10.610> just<00:01:11.610> to

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
created a lot of smaller tracks just to

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.200 
created a lot of smaller tracks just to
crease<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.930> lap<00:01:13.110> lengths<00:01:13.560> or<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.920> lap<00:01:14.460> amount

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
crease the lap lengths or the lap amount

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.420 
crease the lap lengths or the lap amount
if<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.840> yeah<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.740> makes<00:01:16.860> more<00:01:17.009> sense<00:01:17.070> yeah

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
if that yeah that makes more sense yeah

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.240 
if that yeah that makes more sense yeah
lap<00:01:17.610> amounts<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.350> you<00:01:19.350> know<00:01:19.500> it's<00:01:20.130> just

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
lap amounts so that you know it's just

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.620 
lap amounts so that you know it's just
to<00:01:20.369> see<00:01:20.549> who<00:01:20.729> can<00:01:20.880> keep<00:01:21.030> their<00:01:21.270> composure

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
to see who can keep their composure

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.020 
to see who can keep their composure
throughout<00:01:22.290> every<00:01:23.100> single<00:01:23.369> lap<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
throughout every single lap and the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.570 
throughout every single lap and the
consistency<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.590> lines<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.070> take<00:01:26.340> I

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
consistency of the lines that take I

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.929 
consistency of the lines that take I
fucked<00:01:27.570> up<00:01:27.720> once<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.619> part<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.579> track

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
fucked up once on this part the track

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.120 
fucked up once on this part the track
this<00:01:30.509> my<00:01:30.659> own<00:01:30.780> track<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.380> really<00:01:31.770> shouldn't

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
this my own track so I really shouldn't

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.399 
this my own track so I really shouldn't
be<00:01:32.220> losing<00:01:32.670> these<00:01:33.509> races<00:01:33.960> or<00:01:34.110> one<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
be losing these races or one of the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.740 
be losing these races or one of the
things<00:01:34.650> I've<00:01:34.890> still<00:01:35.460> failed<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.000> understand

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
things I've still failed to understand

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.130 
things I've still failed to understand
is<00:01:37.229> if<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:38.100> get<00:01:38.369> lapped<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.540> non-contact

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
is if you get lapped in a non-contact

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.910 
is if you get lapped in a non-contact
race<00:01:40.530> then<00:01:41.100> something's<00:01:41.909> wrong<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:43.290> actually

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
race then something's wrong I actually

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.580 
race then something's wrong I actually
ended<00:01:44.280> up<00:01:44.369> managing<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:45.240> lap<00:01:46.049> someone<00:01:46.439> and

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
ended up managing to lap someone and

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.469 
ended up managing to lap someone and
this<00:01:46.710> was<00:01:46.979> pretty<00:01:47.189> hilarious<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.820> then<00:01:47.909> at

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
this was pretty hilarious and then at

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.690 
this was pretty hilarious and then at
the<00:01:48.540> same<00:01:48.689> time<00:01:48.899> when<00:01:49.530> people<00:01:49.680> DNF<00:01:50.369> in

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
the same time when people DNF in

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.219 
the same time when people DNF in
non-contact<00:01:51.240> racing<00:01:51.630> which<00:01:51.750> actually

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
non-contact racing which actually

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.960 
non-contact racing which actually
happened<00:01:52.590> today<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.979> promise<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.490> yeah<00:01:53.610> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
happened today I promise you yeah the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.389 
happened today I promise you yeah the
twists<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.329> turns<00:01:54.420> right<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:54.990> there<00:01:55.890> was<00:01:55.979> 60

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
twists and turns right and there was 60

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.179 
twists and turns right and there was 60
I<00:01:56.430> think<00:01:56.700> 15<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.119> us<00:01:57.240> eight<00:01:57.899> people<00:01:58.320> DNF<00:01:58.950> that

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
I think 15 of us eight people DNF that

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.160 
I think 15 of us eight people DNF that
race<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.670> non-contact<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.630> non-contact

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
race in non-contact in non-contact

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.929 
race in non-contact in non-contact
situations<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.799> regardless<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.430> was<00:02:02.520> contact

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
situations and regardless it was contact

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.010 
situations and regardless it was contact
or<00:02:03.060> not<00:02:03.180> they<00:02:03.950> would<00:02:04.950> have<00:02:05.159> DNF<00:02:05.969> anyway<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:06.540> I

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
or not they would have DNF anyway so I

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.809 
or not they would have DNF anyway so I
thought<00:02:07.680> baffles<00:02:08.099> me<00:02:08.250> because<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.729> know

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
thought baffles me because you know

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.130 
thought baffles me because you know
these<00:02:09.030> tracks<00:02:09.390> are<00:02:09.539> straightforward<00:02:09.750> you

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
these tracks are straightforward you

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.600 
these tracks are straightforward you
know<00:02:10.200> they've<00:02:10.530> directed<00:02:11.099> all<00:02:11.520> the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
know they've directed all the

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.550 
know they've directed all the
checkpoints<00:02:11.819> for<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.140> raise<00:02:13.260> properly

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
checkpoints for you to raise properly

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.910 
checkpoints for you to raise properly
people

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920
