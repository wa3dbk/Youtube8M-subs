00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.350
 no 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.920
 the only difficulty that really that 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:42.290
 I was trying to ask for some time 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:44.030
 worked it was certainly and the flora and 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.950
 with his three fingers makes it so 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.950
 to see the bass of the F sharp 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:06.160
 Here I redo good 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.240
 Oh 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.330
 still no 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.930
 no 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.730
 Yes 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:41.319
 me with where the bass myth there and the 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.319
 a thousand little horns are here 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:52.319
 do that with that the base of the back 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.250
 in nice 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:58.170
 not healed 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.530
 with an index of padiÃ¨s m the little finger 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.530
 survey 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.310
 you 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.510
 so that's very pretty if it seems 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.510
 difficult but not at all 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.389
 income 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.289
 I do a little longer than normal 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.889
 or 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.680
 it's clear then 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.790
 but how are judged fair 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.790
 partisan 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.790
 1 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:20.389
 I recommend cash is to arrive at 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:20.389
 do this sequence very well 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:35.340
 ah good 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:48.900
 redo ground 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:51.560
 the minor we will say a minor soil that 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.560
 do not weigh me far 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.070
 I do not like that because it's 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.210
 ok also but I guess it's 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.210
 like that it would be just 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.660
 or 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.790
 we start 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:20.190
 o o 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.090
 good 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.090
 good 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.090
 or 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.639
 again 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.800
 or 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:42.419
 and we start again 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.430
 Oh 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:54.390
 again as highly 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.390
 we have already made his departure 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:05.260
 to say instead where there is a 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:08.010
 variant one strikes the base twice 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.010
 do it huh it does 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.319
 or
