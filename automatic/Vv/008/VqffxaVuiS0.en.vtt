00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
tiles but I'm not talking about that

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.259 
tiles but I'm not talking about that
that's<00:02:49.010> that<00:02:49.310> I'm<00:02:49.519> not<00:02:49.639> reviewing<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.090> tiles

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269

that's that I'm not reviewing the tiles
but<00:02:50.510> that's<00:02:51.019> what<00:02:51.169> these<00:02:51.290> are<00:02:51.469> if<00:02:51.620> you<00:02:51.709> happen

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:51.949 
but that's what these are if you happen

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:54.129 
but that's what these are if you happen
to<00:02:51.980> see<00:02:52.280> them<00:02:52.790> so<00:02:53.419> the<00:02:53.569> problem<00:02:53.810> with<00:02:53.900> this<00:02:53.959> is

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:54.139 
to see them so the problem with this is

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:55.240 
to see them so the problem with this is
you<00:02:54.319> know<00:02:54.439> now<00:02:54.590> you<00:02:54.650> got<00:02:54.769> another<00:02:54.829> tile<00:02:55.129> in

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
you know now you got another tile in

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.589 
you know now you got another tile in
here<00:02:55.280> and<00:02:55.489> that<00:02:55.579> slides<00:02:55.879> around<00:02:56.030> and<00:02:56.510> you

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
here and that slides around and you

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:57.670 
here and that slides around and you
don't<00:02:56.750> really<00:02:56.840> want<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:57.079> use<00:02:57.169> the<00:02:57.260> poster<00:02:57.560> tack

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
don't really want to use the poster tack

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.750 
don't really want to use the poster tack
and<00:02:57.859> then<00:02:57.980> also<00:02:58.099> you<00:02:58.280> don't<00:02:58.370> really<00:02:58.519> want

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
and then also you don't really want

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.360 
and then also you don't really want
corners<00:02:59.150> so<00:02:59.840> we'll<00:02:59.989> use<00:03:00.079> my<00:03:00.379> other<00:03:00.590> favorite

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
corners so we'll use my other favorite

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.949 
corners so we'll use my other favorite
tool<00:03:01.549> that<00:03:01.969> works<00:03:02.120> really<00:03:02.389> well<00:03:02.510> with<00:03:02.689> dungeon

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
tool that works really well with dungeon

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.330 
tool that works really well with dungeon
tiles<00:03:03.199> but<00:03:03.319> also<00:03:03.439> works<00:03:03.709> equally<00:03:04.099> well<00:03:04.189> with

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
tiles but also works equally well with

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.689 
tiles but also works equally well with
poster<00:03:04.849> maps<00:03:05.060> which<00:03:05.870> is<00:03:06.049> the<00:03:06.699> polycarbonate

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
only problem I've seen with this is that

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.110 
only problem I've seen with this is that
the<00:03:39.739> whole<00:03:39.919> thing<00:03:39.949> can<00:03:40.489> kind<00:03:40.699> of<00:03:40.759> move<00:03:40.909> around

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
the whole thing can kind of move around

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.869 
the whole thing can kind of move around
and<00:03:41.799> you<00:03:42.799> know<00:03:43.009> that<00:03:43.129> can<00:03:43.280> be<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:43.400> little<00:03:43.579> bit<00:03:43.790> of

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
and you know that can be a little bit of

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.969 
and you know that can be a little bit of
a<00:03:44.090> little<00:03:44.449> bit<00:03:44.540> of<00:03:44.629> a<00:03:44.689> problem<00:03:44.900> but<00:03:45.470> generally

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:45.979 
a little bit of a problem but generally

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:48.249 
a little bit of a problem but generally
speaking<00:03:46.009> it<00:03:46.609> holds<00:03:46.849> up<00:03:46.939> very<00:03:46.970> well<00:03:47.180> I<00:03:47.509> really

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:48.259 
speaking it holds up very well I really

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:50.920 
speaking it holds up very well I really
like<00:03:48.439> this<00:03:48.590> with<00:03:48.769> poster<00:03:49.129> maps<00:03:49.340> because<00:03:50.269> with

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
like this with poster maps because with

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.689 
like this with poster maps because with
poster<00:03:51.319> maps<00:03:51.500> it<00:03:51.739> keeps<00:03:51.949> the<00:03:52.099> map<00:03:52.250> perfectly

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:52.699 
poster maps it keeps the map perfectly

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.159 
poster maps it keeps the map perfectly
flat<00:03:52.970> and<00:03:53.030> makes<00:03:53.540> sure<00:03:53.599> that<00:03:53.689> there<00:03:53.959> are<00:03:54.079> no

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:54.169 
flat and makes sure that there are no

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:56.800 
flat and makes sure that there are no
corners<00:03:54.439> to<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:54.829> map<00:03:55.009> whatsoever

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
corners to the map whatsoever

with<00:03:57.319> dungeon<00:03:57.620> tiles<00:03:57.859> it's<00:03:57.979> nice<00:03:58.129> but<00:03:58.699> you

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
with dungeon tiles it's nice but you

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.479 
with dungeon tiles it's nice but you
don't<00:03:58.969> always<00:03:59.120> have<00:03:59.389> to<00:03:59.509> do<00:03:59.599> it<00:03:59.769> so<00:04:00.769> the

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
don't always have to do it so the

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:02.709 
don't always have to do it so the
polycarbonate<00:04:01.939> sheet<00:04:02.269> is<00:04:02.359> I<00:04:02.449> think<00:04:02.509> between
