for<00:04:30.860> ghosts<00:04:31.070> I<00:04:31.370> think<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.240> extinction<00:04:32.840> mode

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
for ghosts I think the extinction mode

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.050 
for ghosts I think the extinction mode
looks<00:04:33.290> pretty<00:04:33.560> badass<00:04:33.830> the<00:04:34.580> only<00:04:34.760> thing<00:04:34.940> I

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
looks pretty badass the only thing I

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.490 
looks pretty badass the only thing I
have<00:04:35.240> a<00:04:35.270> really<00:04:35.540> you<00:04:35.660> know<00:04:35.780> big<00:04:35.990> problem<00:04:36.410> with

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
on it's not big problem the only thing

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.870 
on it's not big problem the only thing
I'm<00:04:38.300> kind<00:04:38.480> of<00:04:38.510> concerned<00:04:38.930> about<00:04:39.230> is<00:04:39.470> how<00:04:40.310> fun

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
I'm kind of concerned about is how fun

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.970 
I'm kind of concerned about is how fun
that<00:04:41.240> or<00:04:41.660> how<00:04:41.870> long<00:04:42.080> that<00:04:42.350> game<00:04:42.530> mode<00:04:42.710> will<00:04:42.860> be

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
that or how long that game mode will be

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.650 
that or how long that game mode will be
fun<00:04:43.220> like<00:04:43.430> you<00:04:43.730> know<00:04:43.820> because<00:04:44.030> it<00:04:44.240> seems<00:04:44.540> like

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
fun like you know because it seems like

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.300 
fun like you know because it seems like
the<00:04:44.840> way<00:04:44.960> you<00:04:45.020> get<00:04:45.380> to<00:04:45.410> progression<00:04:45.860> once<00:04:46.190> you

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
the way you get to progression once you

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.010 
the way you get to progression once you
get<00:04:46.430> to<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.640> end<00:04:46.820> you're<00:04:47.030> done<00:04:47.270> right<00:04:47.570> it's

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
get to the end you're done right it's

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.390 
get to the end you're done right it's
not<00:04:48.110> like<00:04:48.260> zombies<00:04:48.710> where<00:04:48.860> it<00:04:48.950> could<00:04:49.070> like<00:04:49.220> go

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
not like zombies where it could like go

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.610 
not like zombies where it could like go
on<00:04:49.550> forever<00:04:49.790> is<00:04:50.120> what<00:04:50.300> it<00:04:50.420> seems<00:04:50.600> like<00:04:50.780> so<00:04:51.590> I

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
on forever is what it seems like so I

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.110 
on forever is what it seems like so I
don't<00:04:51.830> really<00:04:51.920> know<00:04:52.130> how<00:04:52.160> that's<00:04:52.820> going<00:04:53.000> to<00:04:53.060> go

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
don't really know how that's going to go

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.780 
don't really know how that's going to go
over<00:04:53.270> like<00:04:53.780> how<00:04:53.960> long<00:04:54.230> it's<00:04:54.650> gonna<00:04:54.740> last<00:04:54.860> like

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
over like how long it's gonna last like

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.280 
over like how long it's gonna last like
once<00:04:56.030> you<00:04:56.150> beat<00:04:56.360> it<00:04:56.510> like<00:04:56.690> how<00:04:56.840> fun<00:04:57.110> is<00:04:57.230> it

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
once you beat it like how fun is it
