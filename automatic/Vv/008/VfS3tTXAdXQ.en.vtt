got a move your camera very slowly up

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.200 
got a move your camera very slowly up
all<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.140> time<00:00:34.380> when<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.280> dropship<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.940> trying

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
all the time when the dropship is trying

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.160 
all the time when the dropship is trying
to<00:00:36.329> go<00:00:36.510> outside<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.530> map<00:00:37.770> basically<00:00:38.989> it<00:00:39.989> will

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
to go outside a map basically it will

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.639 
to go outside a map basically it will
basically<00:00:40.710> push<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.219> outside<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.879> map<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.719> yeah

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
basically push you outside a map so yeah

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:57.480 
basically push you outside a map so yeah
then<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.070> could<00:00:44.219> go<00:00:44.370> wherever<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:45.120> want

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.490 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.550 

so<00:00:58.490> now<00:00:58.820> take<00:00:59.180> your<00:00:59.300> camera<00:00:59.780> to<00:01:00.020> the<00:01:00.050> pillar

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
so now take your camera to the pillar

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.500 
so now take your camera to the pillar
bottom<00:01:03.100> then<00:01:04.100> you<00:01:04.129> simply<00:01:04.489> gotta<00:01:04.640> wait<00:01:04.879> until

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
bottom then you simply gotta wait until

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.140 
bottom then you simply gotta wait until
it<00:01:06.140> disappears<00:01:06.830> because<00:01:07.130> you're<00:01:07.580> running<00:01:07.820> and

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
it disappears because you're running and

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.660 
it disappears because you're running and
then<00:01:08.300> it<00:01:08.450> disappears<00:01:09.020> because<00:01:09.410> you're<00:01:10.280> inside

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
then it disappears because you're inside

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.350 
then it disappears because you're inside
a<00:01:10.700> building

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
a building

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.100 
a building
I<00:01:11.390> guess<00:01:12.729> so<00:01:13.729> move<00:01:14.090> your<00:01:14.210> camera<00:01:14.450> inside<00:01:14.990> of

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
I guess so move your camera inside of

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.340 
I guess so move your camera inside of
Kuler<00:01:15.229> broaden<00:01:15.770> or<00:01:16.900> it's<00:01:17.900> not<00:01:18.110> there<00:01:18.380> yet<00:01:18.530> but

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
Kuler broaden or it's not there yet but

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.760 
Kuler broaden or it's not there yet but
and<00:01:21.350> then<00:01:21.920> it<00:01:22.100> will<00:01:22.310> come<00:01:23.300> back<00:01:23.450> when<00:01:23.750> you<00:01:23.900> keep

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
and then it will come back when you keep

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:33.880 
and then it will come back when you keep
moving<00:01:26.950> and<00:01:28.240> there<00:01:29.240> it<00:01:29.360> is<00:01:30.910> and<00:01:32.590> by<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.649> way

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
moving and there it is and by the way

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.010 
moving and there it is and by the way
it's<00:01:34.130> quite<00:01:34.790> hard<00:01:35.149> to<00:01:35.240> have<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.660> camera

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
it's quite hard to have the camera

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.400 
it's quite hard to have the camera
inside<00:01:36.350> pillar<00:01:36.680> bottom<00:01:37.130> because<00:01:38.140> it<00:01:39.140> always

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
inside pillar bottom because it always

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.370 
inside pillar bottom because it always
wants<00:01:39.979> you<00:01:40.100> to<00:01:40.600> it<00:01:41.600> wants<00:01:41.899> to<00:01:42.020> push<00:01:42.200> you<00:01:42.350> out

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
wants you to it wants to push you out

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.320 
wants you to it wants to push you out
all<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:42.770> time<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:43.399> you<00:01:43.460> can't<00:01:43.790> have<00:01:44.180> the

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
all the time so you can't have the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.560 
all the time so you can't have the
camera<00:01:44.690> still<00:01:48.070> as<00:01:49.070> you<00:01:49.340> see<00:01:49.520> it's<00:01:49.670> got<00:01:50.149> quite

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
camera still as you see it's got quite

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.520 
camera still as you see it's got quite
strange<00:01:51.140> armor<00:01:52.390> it's<00:01:53.390> full<00:01:53.720> black<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.320> colour

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
strange armor it's full black the colour

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.100 
strange armor it's full black the colour
you<00:01:54.710> can't<00:01:55.009> have<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:56.090> chest<00:01:56.360> piece<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:56.899> can't

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
you can't have the chest piece you can't

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.910 
you can't have the chest piece you can't
have<00:01:57.289> that<00:01:57.500> either

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
have that either

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:13.589 
have that either

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
and you see there's four other hangers

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.350 
and you see there's four other hangers
that<00:02:21.650> fund<00:02:22.040> you<00:02:22.130> have<00:02:22.280> copy<00:02:22.580> pasted<00:02:23.150> all<00:02:23.330> over

that fund you have copy pasted all over

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.990 
that fund you have copy pasted all over
killer<00:02:23.959> bottom<00:02:24.410> but<00:02:25.099> there's<00:02:25.459> nothing<00:02:25.880> in

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000
