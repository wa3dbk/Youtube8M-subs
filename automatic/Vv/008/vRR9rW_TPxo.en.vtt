00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
it's very functional now you start I'm

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.230 
it's very functional now you start I'm
the<00:01:54.270> 360<00:01:54.899> role<00:01:55.500> tree<00:01:55.939> mechanism<00:01:56.939> there<00:01:57.119> you

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
the 360 role tree mechanism there you

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.209 
the 360 role tree mechanism there you
got<00:01:57.420> eight<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:58.500> can<00:01:58.530> lock<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.040> eight

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
got eight you can lock it to eight

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.280 
got eight you can lock it to eight
different<00:01:59.340> positions<00:01:59.969> as<00:02:00.270> well<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:01.079> it

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290
