good luck as well the basic idea of the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.640 
good luck as well the basic idea of the
horseshoe<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.510> shape<00:01:03.840> allows<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.470> to

horseshoe is that the shape allows it to

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.039 
horseshoe is that the shape allows it to
collect<00:01:05.250> luck<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.060> by<00:01:06.420> turning<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.900> upside

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
collect luck and by turning it upside

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.200 
collect luck and by turning it upside
down<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.799> are<00:01:07.979> allowing<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.610> spill<00:01:09.060> out

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
down you are allowing it to spill out

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.870 
down you are allowing it to spill out
but<00:01:09.810> according<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.439> old<00:01:10.590> tales<00:01:10.950> many<00:01:11.580> homes

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
but according to old tales many homes

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.179 
but according to old tales many homes
would<00:01:12.210> nail<00:01:12.540> them<00:01:12.840> upside<00:01:13.350> down<00:01:13.380> above<00:01:13.950> their

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
would nail them upside down above their

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.429 
would nail them upside down above their
doorways<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.240> belief<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:16.080> spilt

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
doorways in the belief that the spilt

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.469 
doorways in the belief that the spilt
luck<00:01:16.830> would<00:01:17.189> then<00:01:17.369> gather<00:01:17.670> around<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.270> home

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
luck would then gather around the home

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.539 
luck would then gather around the home
so<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.170> possible<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.890> symbol<00:01:20.250> was<00:01:20.369> meant

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
so it is possible the symbol was meant

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.969 
so it is possible the symbol was meant
to<00:01:20.640> be<00:01:20.729> used<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.210> both<00:01:21.509> positions<00:01:22.290> like<00:01:22.920> a

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
to be used in both positions like a

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.490 
to be used in both positions like a
bucket<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.670> water<00:01:24.000> at<00:01:24.299> first<00:01:24.540> collects<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.320> lock

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
bucket of water at first collects a lock

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.499 
bucket of water at first collects a lock
and<00:01:25.740> then<00:01:26.040> must<00:01:26.340> be<00:01:26.430> reversed<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.090> allow<00:01:27.450> to

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
and then must be reversed to allow to

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.840 
and then must be reversed to allow to
drain<00:01:28.049> out<00:01:28.290> another<00:01:28.979> reason<00:01:29.369> for<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.579> belief

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
drain out another reason for the belief

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.210 
drain out another reason for the belief
of<00:01:30.119> luck<00:01:30.509> based<00:01:30.840> horseshoes<00:01:31.500> was<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.070> they
