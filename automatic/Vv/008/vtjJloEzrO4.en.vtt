00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020
 land 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.020
 demands of its 20 and masters in development 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:15.360
 I open the happy new year 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:19.140
 christmas kings and everything that involves 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:23.189
 this date of arrimón is yes darling 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.009
 to the point we are testing a car that 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.910
 and really brought back raring is the 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:32.160
 peyote 301 and tell them a little bit 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.720
 of this car this car is a car the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.820
 global armed in europe and brought 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.550
 urgently for the Mexican market 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.550
 a great maneuver of the brand because 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:48.540
 It was a bit harder to gain credibility and this 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:52.050
 car is the good one to achieve it not as 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:55.379
 I told them in a car gun where Spain 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.650
 it feels sturdy you see that the hand of 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.600
 work 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:05.140
 with bean strength and for her if 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.120
 they have the strength to tighten the nano round 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.180
 but good 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.510
 on the outside is a clear example that as 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.330
 a car that can be economical is not 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.530
 fought that is nice or pretty the 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.960
 grill the shape of the headlights 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.080
 quite aggressive the general line the 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.590
 aluminum wheels looks pretty 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.790
 pleasant to the eye exceeded my 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.800
 expectations for the car by fher looks 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:41.320
 very very very good 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:44.050
 and in the car that you see 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.960
 it also comes assembled that although 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.020
 has hard plastics that feel 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.110
 cheap at the time of being well 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.670
 assembled as they disguise a little is 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.800
 is this economy of materials not 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.729
 Let's talk a little more about what it brings in 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.340
 the instruments are simple and 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.819
 you know 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.790
 and speedometer and tachometer meter 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.959
 gasoline and to tell what it is 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.959
 that the center console 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.870
 brings everything integrated into the controls of the 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.140
 weather 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.659
 the bluetooth controls the memories 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.330
 of the radio the travel computer all 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:34.900
 centralized to make it easier to 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.160
 use it and in the end this lowers the 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.440
 costs 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:44.710
 the mechanics we go a bit to the mechanics 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:48.730
 it's a car that has a 1.6 115 engine 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:51.760
 horses nothing spectacular but all the 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.310
 engine is quite flexible because 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.370
 notice that the red line of the tachometer 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.790
 starts at 5 thousand revolutions and you 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.250
 you can go to 5 506 and the car 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.820
 keeps pushing obviously without so much 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.500
 torque that the car good if it is obvious 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.960
 that is not to run or high 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.410
 speeds is a car for city use 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:18.850
 but in the end it feels good not 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:24.000
 you need more travel cruise have 120 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.000
 130 140 descent is not so bad 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.230
 inside the interior space is 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:33.440
 pretty big pretty big 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.750
 in fact it is the same 208 platform 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:40.530
 but it 's longer between axes 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:45.630
 that allowed to expand the space and lay 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:47.880
 five people well in comfortable and not 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.090
 we talk about french pettitte we talk 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.070
 of panxón is like me and talking about 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.680
 panxón is think that we also see that 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.600
 brings one that I think cupholders 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.620
 a gringo would never allow it 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.350
 he wants four giant glasses 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:08.790
 for his 47-liter shakes and here 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.130
 not very Frenchified a single cup holder and 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.500
 small 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:16.010
 but speaking of French I think that 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.830
 the bourgeoisie and the aristocracy remain in 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.270
 second term this battle cars 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:23.210
 comes to compete hard against the bird 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:25.880
 or against the bersa the segment that is a 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.100
 car that requires reliability that 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.470
 it requires that you forget that it is a 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.810
 car so very delicate your car use 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.360
 rough and this car does not have very good for 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:39.890
 I pey very well for the prices that 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:43.310
 it starts at 180 to 200 4 900 I think 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:47.740
 but value equipment price is very 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.740
 good to compete very well 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:54.500
 it does not feel bad brake very well with everything 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:59.470
 and that nothing else has the drum 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:02.230
 back but it really meets 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:05.260
 with the purpose of this car and I believe 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:09.130
 awaits a promising future 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:11.560
 mexico and in latin america we are at 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:16.370
 report more cars and we continue 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:20.110
 enjoying this franchute 301 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.110
