00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:11.860
 good to all of us because we're going to make 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:14.230
 is the vague 360 or volley in 360 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.849
 and explain how it's done I'm friends 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.470
 I will explain it completely in Spanish and 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.220
 then things will explain it completely 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.199
 in English 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.349
 the first thing to start learning this 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.390
 jump is that you know how to do the lazy 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.949
 baladrón as you want to call it what 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.840
 we leave on the wall if you do not know how to do 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.369
 when they keep watching the video first 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.369
 learn that and then come back here 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:41.800
 Well now it's the jump but 360 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.920
 a serious departure 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.420
 it's quite simple to do a lazy and in 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.370
 the moment you're in the air lying 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.949
 do the 360 ​​turn then basically 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.940
 is you do the lady and the important things 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.260
 from here are the legs the arm and the 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.869
 another arm are the three things 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.339
 important of this jump the first thing is 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:06.940
 do the leis and when you have this 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.580
 Leg up 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.130
 in a normal way you would simply pass the 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.540
 another leg to the given then in this jump 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.000
 what they do is this leg 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.030
 to the other as if the stitches for 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.240
 catch the turn this way 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.510
 then another thing to catch more spin is 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.900
 the arm when you open leidy in the air 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.690
 besides joining this leg to turn 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.360
 here you close your arm that way you're 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.060
 straight and you take enough spin as 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.170
 to be able to do the whole 360 ​​that would be 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.780
 thus 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.509
 and from there you do the whole turn and what 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.899
 last is this hand that is no longer normal 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.840
 only left is in the thief sometimes 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.260
 put on the other one because you only leave one 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.120
 hand 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.580
 you have to take the fence to a wall 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.970
 because when you go to turn so 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.100
 that would throw jce would do is the turn and 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.050
 when it is already at this moment you have 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.970
 to let go because your hand no longer 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.970
 tour more then it would be basically 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.030
 at the last moment when you already do the 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.830
 turn is loose hand and blind too 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.790
 with your body so that you are straight and 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.070
 you travel faster in that way and good 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.110
 this is a pretty good jump for 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.630
 do fluently if you do various tricks 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.240
 followed and then that for example you can 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.270
 do not go and do 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.190
 the jump of how you stay with your feet 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.190
 it really is not something that is very 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.570
 but simply it is more important 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.610
 comfortable to do with the two clear with 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.010
 the two locals with one you have to 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.590
 try that when you do you are 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.960
 straight in the air at the time of the turn 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.370
 a rather common failure is instead of 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.799
 Do it this way 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.840
 and do the spin in the air people do 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.819
 a law if it does vertical applies 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.160
 and that's when you do not pick up speed 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.110
 enough and the spin gets out of control 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.019
 then also to make it more 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.090
 nice to try to do it in the air and not 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:12.220
 make the mistake of doing the lazy and then 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:14.860
 already the turn because it is not controlled and you 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.640
 you can go in the other is access turn and 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:21.810
 you fall where you wanted to fall 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.130
 that way and well then this more than 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.680
 nothing is being done by the tutorial 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.810
 I hope it helps you that you liked it 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.330
 the last light video subscribe to yes no 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.319
 you are and this is all cards 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.319
 will explain completely in English 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:23.290
 Yes Yes 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:40.639
 I had an explanation 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:43.820
 I was sixth down 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.820
 many ways 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:56.650
 I am intuitive and end of the world 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.849
 efe of brooklyn outs to the popular 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.419
 the 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.419
 I 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:11.039
 the wall street 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.490
 ah 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:09.130
 yes 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.130
 you give 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.130
 or 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.780
 d

 Y 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.100
