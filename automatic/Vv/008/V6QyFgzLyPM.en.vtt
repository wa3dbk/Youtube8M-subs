00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.750
 need seeks to build relationships with 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.580
 us based on new agenda one 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.200
 of its items should be closing all 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.810
 US military bases in the territory 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.110
 South American Sampir called them 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.580
 the existence of a relic of the cold war 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.619
 according to us ministry of defense 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.210
 in countries of central and south america 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.970
 there are about 40 American 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.670
 military facilities they are on 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.590
 territories of more than 20 countries exist 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.360
 suspicion that washington is using 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.890
 fight against drug trafficking as 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.420
 excuse to save his 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.180
 presence on the continent 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.250
 geopolitical reasons expert on 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.560
 Latin America finds its Bollinger 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.250
 that the us will not give up their bases without 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.049
 struggle and stand hard to make peace and 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.159
 stability in the region when there 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.920
 there is an impressive amount 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.350
 foreign military bases in various 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.640
 moments of history including the newest they 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.100
 used under various pretexts 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.079
 for the invasion of the region setting 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.929
 dictatorship holding state 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.810
 coups aiming to change the ruling regime 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.180
 so the United States could not 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.980
 just so take and leave these bases have 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.050
 important geopolitical importance 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.510
 annually through southern command 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.250
 usa pentagon invests 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.020
 they have a lot of money besides 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.080
 the united states are in the process 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.610
 expanding your military presence 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.620
 through small operational bass 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.050
 However, in my opinion Latin America 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.250
 need to take a tough stance 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.590
 the region has the right to get rid of 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.830
 US military bases the only question is 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.510
 Tom 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.310
 whether south american unite 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.060
 strange around this goal and is there enough 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.060
 they are forces
