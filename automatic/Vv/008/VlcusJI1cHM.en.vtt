 live and sting everything optimally that does 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.530
 a lot to me means I have eight 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.070
 learned japanese and then got me 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.270
 in relation to it and as the first tattoo have 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.070
 I then made that something 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.120
 that 's how it was with the family 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.520
 I have a beginner story now 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.840
 I connect everything and then 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.130
 I came to that completely 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.229
 make simple without much frills 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.010
 and then I let that sting as 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.290
 the 18th 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.350

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.360

 Jesus tattooed her on the arm like that 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.910
 a little bit more times this is the customer's 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.670
 Religious motives are done relatively often 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.220
 because it's not even a reason of religion 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.140
 the world is simply beautiful motives 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.590
 now such a huge buddha on the 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.979
 move 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.300
 what he means for you 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.220
 my life's actually mother me 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.530

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.150
 broadcast where there is a plump mine 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.489

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.660
 it already tattooed me personally 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.280

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.989
 where I have some today very much 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.920

 for example, such a wish appel 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.200
 Maybe I have to do that again 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.590
