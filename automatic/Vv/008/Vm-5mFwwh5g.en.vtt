00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.890
 the place not a minute wants to drown then sniff 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.050
 flowers then kiss then perch 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.939

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.650
 lives only on the third floor but with such 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.750
 restless housekeeping of open windows 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.550
 afraid of panic especially after 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.859
 viewing the heat news better 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.349

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.329
 flee the fan conditioner 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.540
 ways to take care of the safety of the child

 what about how about your health 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.809
 let's therefore we prefer better 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.320
 closed windows will be better stuck 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.329
 side as we protect the child but 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.250
 parents ready to give up the masstige 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.680
 open windows in Orenburg can be seen quite 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.300
 a bit because every week reports 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.059
 at least one child 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.219
 collapsed high-rises to their last 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.930
 four here it is the most insidious element 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.100
 all plastic construction is designed 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.229
 protect from annoying insects 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.420
 mosquito nets window opening is fixed 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.960
 four weak plastic clips 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.400
 which break from the slightest pressure 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.320
 plastic window manufacturers can already be seen 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.150
 decided to think for their parents invented 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.130
 several horse locks and even made 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.259
 special point agreement which would 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.840
 recommend them to moms and dads small 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:26.369
 children in the closed position the child can 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.920
 either open on the pan or close 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.619
 i.e. sash opening function 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.659
 fully child 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.460
 unavailable that is, it is blocked 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.170
 special installation mechanism 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.409
 windows for such a thing to pay will have 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.490
 2000 rubles is protection and cheaper for 700 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.149
 sen child castle 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.100
 it is set down the frame thanks 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.380
 what are blocking the very opening of the sash 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.759
 however, even such smart locks will not be 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.460
 100% security guarantee 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.950
 your child a month ago, two year old baby 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.659
 coped with such a bolt collapsed tenth 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.620
 floor and crashed to death 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.510
 Well , we are all people home we dressed mother 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.360
 what is not the strain the child does not know 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:12.010
 clearly presented the table and 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.870
 works equally in the flesh and see 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.250
 explain to the little ones what 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.470
 open window is not only mass 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.690
 curious but also a lot of danger you need 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.700
 carefully choosing the words sure and 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.320
 child psychologists can not speak 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.390
 and bully the baby 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.660
 for he is the forbidden fruit of necessary 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.209
 want to bite is very important to do it 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.430
 friendly and show not just here 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.380
 not all 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.630
 I'm worried about speaking 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.390
 show your own reaction 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.690
 emotional and the stronger the barriers to 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.670
 more here the desire to cheat there somehow 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.239
 wait until they see seize the moment 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.190
 and now do such a thing but crumbs to 4 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.410
 years barely react even to the most 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.820
 literate warning kids in such 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.340
 they just donâ€™t believe that they can 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.470
 get in trouble because avoid scary 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.480
 tragedies can be kept so simple 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.370
 it would seem the rule do not open windows 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.680
 masstige spend money on locks and not 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.690
 leave children unattended on the Internet 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.690
