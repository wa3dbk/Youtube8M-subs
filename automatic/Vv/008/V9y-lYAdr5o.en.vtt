00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
to do this to donate your hair well I

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.780 
to do this to donate your hair well I
thought<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:30.560> it<00:00:31.560> would<00:00:31.710> be<00:00:31.890> something<00:00:32.279> easy

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
thought that it would be something easy

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.930 
thought that it would be something easy
for<00:00:33.120> me<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.300> do<00:00:33.690> because<00:00:34.020> my<00:00:34.440> hair<00:00:34.800> grows<00:00:35.550> long

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
for me to do because my hair grows long

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.510 
for me to do because my hair grows long
I<00:00:36.329> used<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.870> work<00:00:37.050> with<00:00:37.230> somebody<00:00:37.440> who<00:00:37.860> cut<00:00:38.340> her

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
I used to work with somebody who cut her

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.910 
I used to work with somebody who cut her
hair<00:00:38.730> on<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> regular<00:00:39.210> basis<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.960> donate<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.770> as

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
hair on a regular basis to donate it as

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.500 
hair on a regular basis to donate it as
well<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.700> thought<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.800> can<00:00:43.800> do<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.300> all<00:00:45.300> it

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
well and I thought I can do that all it

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.600 
well and I thought I can do that all it
takes<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.960> some<00:00:46.640> time<00:00:48.680> and<00:00:49.680> just<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.219> little<00:00:50.370> bit

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
takes is some time and just a little bit

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.049 
takes is some time and just a little bit
of<00:00:50.700> effort<00:00:51.649> so<00:00:52.649> what<00:00:53.280> do<00:00:53.399> they<00:00:53.489> do<00:00:53.550> with<00:00:53.850> your

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
of effort so what do they do with your

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.560 
of effort so what do they do with your
hair<00:00:54.210> once<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.870> once<00:00:55.260> they<00:00:55.440> cut<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:56.539> well<00:00:57.539> I

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
hair once that once they cut it well I

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.590 
hair once that once they cut it well I
believe<00:00:58.079> what<00:00:58.680> they<00:00:58.829> do<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.399> they<00:00:59.670> process<00:01:00.390> it

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600
