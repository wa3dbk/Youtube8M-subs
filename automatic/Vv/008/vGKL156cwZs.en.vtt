about how to heat stroke out here here's

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.190 
about how to heat stroke out here here's
our<00:01:25.960> second<00:01:27.660> Confederate<00:01:28.660> button<00:01:28.960> that<00:01:29.050> we

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
our second Confederate button that we

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.130 
our second Confederate button that we
found<00:01:29.410> out<00:01:29.619> of<00:01:29.740> here<00:01:29.950> can<00:01:30.250> you<00:01:30.369> see<00:01:30.550> that

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
found out of here can you see that

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.710 
found out of here can you see that
Confederate<00:01:32.140> Calvary<00:01:32.619> button<00:01:33.509> really<00:01:34.509> nice

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
Confederate Calvary button really nice

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.340 
Confederate Calvary button really nice
but<00:01:35.679> anyway<00:01:36.069> I<00:01:36.340> think<00:01:36.550> that<00:01:36.970> maybe<00:01:37.179> the<00:01:37.959> troops

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
but anyway I think that maybe the troops

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.230 
but anyway I think that maybe the troops
that<00:01:38.590> had<00:01:38.740> halted<00:01:38.979> here<00:01:39.280> maybe<00:01:39.520> set<00:01:39.759> up<00:01:39.789> crates

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
that had halted here maybe set up crates

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.240 
that had halted here maybe set up crates
maybe<00:01:40.630> took<00:01:40.869> some<00:01:41.050> target<00:01:41.380> practice<00:01:41.410> I<00:01:41.950> think

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
maybe took some target practice I think

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.800 
maybe took some target practice I think
that<00:01:42.459> might<00:01:42.610> explain<00:01:43.000> why<00:01:43.119> we<00:01:43.420> found<00:01:43.450> although

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
that might explain why we found although

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.440 
that might explain why we found although
many<00:01:44.289> fired<00:01:44.920> many<00:01:45.250> bottles<00:01:45.550> around<00:01:45.670> we've

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450
