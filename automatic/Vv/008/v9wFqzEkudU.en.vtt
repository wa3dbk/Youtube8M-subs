00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 Hello youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.540
 new video vt country I have noses beer 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:12.360
 just the review for nano frutti 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:15.660
 energy drink turned but then that 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.699
 video in a fit biggest noses 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.650
 equity deleted and already with 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.590
 dubbed another video and 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.510
 that's why there is no live cost now 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.990
 Unfortunately, not a single drop anymore 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.119
 in it 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.800
 a bit of smell is still there and 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.560
 That's why I just have to do something 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.940
 I just filmed and live 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.040
 commented on it now 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.870
 to repeat memory I'm sorry 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.239
 why i was not a new video with one 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.010
 new cans well I have the thing off 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.410
 Luxembourg and they come so fast 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.020
 do not look at a new copy again 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.320
 So in a row the thing is called nano 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.770
 frutti energizer and totally turns on the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.050
 is totally on the fruit rail 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.870
 Caffeine from green coffee ground stands 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.620
 here on it on the edge but that's what 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.229
 the drink is old that he is 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.920
 completely on a colorful fruit juice 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.880
 Mixture puts everyone on top of it 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:15.509
 pineapple apple kiwi and mango then number 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.820
 two that there is here with low canary 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.580
 on it and yes that's right we have 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.950
 here just 20 kilocalories to 100 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.310
 milliliter makes it the whole dose 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.020
 with 250 milliliters has 50 kilocalories 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.710
 So our normal drink has yes 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.090
 Something about the 120th 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.770
 that already suggests that there is not 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.360
 especially a lot of sugar is in it 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.509
 maybe that compensates for the whole 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.159
 fruit juice in there then back naturally 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.990
 a nice language confusion the whole 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.420
 Comes from Belgium but that has me 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.450
 not so much surprised as that 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.170
 the one coca cola product is the whole 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.590
 So coca cola is now also in alu 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:58.110
 the can beautiful tropical green against forest 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.530
 moderately designed when I opened it 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.960
 have already arrived with green flap up there 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.390
 dirt the fruit juice of the pjak but the 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.750
 fruit nothing smell there is still one 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.510
 little smell left over and yes one smells 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.970
 still pineapple so different 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.799
 what the book came out directly then 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.390
 represents the time you now before I pack 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.159
 I also said it into the glass 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.590
 if that is not green and what was it 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.599
 was of course green so far that goes 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.180
 through the side and then came to was 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.610
 taste test and then it really comes 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.780
 so I tell the fruit cocktail where 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.360
 but clearly pineapple and kiwis in the 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.310
 the taste dominate my case was 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.560
 the whole thing so not the taste 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.870
 well who is on pineapple kiwi 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.500
 maybe it would be okay for that 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.970
 but what disturbed me much more is 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.680
 that with the 50 kilocalories you 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.829
 noticed there is not much sugar 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.720
 in there and for someone who I say 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:57.500
 times the standard drinks is used 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.840
 is or may be thinking at once 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.879
 where i have no lead product here 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.549
 normal disgusting taste is 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.079
 not there but the stuff is very strong 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.959
 diluted that is more like such a 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:10.670
 fruit juice with sparkling water so in the 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.370
 The direction is that the thing is not 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.160
 really sweet so very light fruit sweetness 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.049
 yes, but who really is this now 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.879
 normal sweet is I say now 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.280
 direction monster or even the normal 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.169
 red bull dinger gets here first 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.500
 Tasting withdrawal for that tastes 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:29.150
 Do not stop really intense after that 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.160
 I then back to the camera 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.769
 I've drunk whole tin empty 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.049
 which is too lax to me so I guess 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.549
 if that was just fruit juice or 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.290
 if it does not dilute that much 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.120
 I think that would be probable 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.010
 a very interesting thing if I am 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.730
 because of pineapple and kiwi taste 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.680
 would stand 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.299
 this typical gummi bear juice is 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.639
 not at all easy 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.500
 maybe you notice this but this 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:52.280
 fruit components are clearly in the 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.230
 foreground 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.090
 I would not buy it again now 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.590
 and quite as dilute as that 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.709
 I would not be here either 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.120
 Recommend 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.849
 maybe there is evidence of this nano 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.830
 yes, a normal variant without local 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.840
 orie but 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.190
 I do not know as a normal product 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.110
 I have not found out yet 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.540
 Let's see if it should have been 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.299
 its finally my energy drink test video 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.010
 without me giving you so many 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.150
 thanks for watching to do it well and to 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.150
 bye video bye
