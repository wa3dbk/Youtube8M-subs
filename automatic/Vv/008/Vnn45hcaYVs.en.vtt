00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
cheaper in the future and thirdly you

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.499 
cheaper in the future and thirdly you
get<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.829> game<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.670> they<00:01:29.820> say<00:01:30.000> three<00:01:30.329> days

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
get the game that they say three days

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.090 
get the game that they say three days
earlier<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:30.900> some<00:01:31.170> things<00:01:31.200> but<00:01:31.530> i<00:01:31.650> wasn't

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
earlier on some things but i wasn't

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.190 
earlier on some things but i wasn't
checked<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.490> actual<00:01:32.850> universe<00:01:33.659> cream<00:01:33.960> for

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
checked the actual universe cream for

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.440 
checked the actual universe cream for
the<00:01:34.229> fifa<00:01:34.439> very<00:01:35.189> release<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.119> i<00:01:36.150> was<00:01:36.270> saying

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
the fifa very release and i was saying

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.810 
the fifa very release and i was saying
the<00:01:36.540> 22nd<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.409> 20<00:01:37.680> years<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.070> i<00:01:38.310> think<00:01:38.520> we

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
the 22nd to the 20 years so i think we

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.069 
the 22nd to the 20 years so i think we
actually<00:01:38.909> make<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.240> like<00:01:39.390> six<00:01:39.600> days<00:01:39.750> earlier

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
actually make it like six days earlier

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.319 
actually make it like six days earlier
so<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.409> my<00:01:40.500> opinion<00:01:40.619> my<00:01:41.579> season<00:01:41.939> ticket<00:01:42.210> is

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
so in my opinion my season ticket is

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.210 
so in my opinion my season ticket is
well<00:01:42.720> worth<00:01:42.930> with<00:01:43.110> never<00:01:43.560> once<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.860> get<00:01:44.070> it

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
well worth with never once you get it

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.859 
well worth with never once you get it
but<00:01:44.579> moving<00:01:44.880> on<00:01:44.939> from<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.180> season<00:01:45.509> ticket<00:01:45.810> a

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
but moving on from the season ticket a

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.389
