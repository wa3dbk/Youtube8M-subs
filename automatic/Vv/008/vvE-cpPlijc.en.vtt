00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
questions or you pre prepped so what you

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.450 
questions or you pre prepped so what you
could<00:03:15.870> do<00:03:16.020> is<00:03:16.200> whenever<00:03:16.680> you've<00:03:17.160> got<00:03:17.340> the

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460

question<00:03:17.760> in<00:03:17.820> front<00:03:18.000> of<00:03:18.060> you<00:03:18.120> read<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.630> out

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
question in front of you read it out

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.140 
question in front of you read it out
loud<00:03:19.190> answer<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.310> question<00:03:20.340> as<00:03:20.940> though

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
loud answer the question as though

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.600 
loud answer the question as though
you're<00:03:21.330> doing<00:03:21.570> interview<00:03:21.959> with<00:03:22.110> someone<00:03:22.440> and

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
you're doing interview with someone and

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.000 
you're doing interview with someone and
basically<00:03:23.610> go<00:03:24.209> through<00:03:24.239> that<00:03:24.540> step<00:03:24.780> up<00:03:25.080> step

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
basically go through that step up step

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.250 
basically go through that step up step
one<00:03:26.340> step<00:03:26.489> two<00:03:26.640> of<00:03:26.790> each<00:03:27.000> question<00:03:27.300> so<00:03:28.080> as<00:03:28.140> you

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
one step two of each question so as you

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.660 
one step two of each question so as you
can<00:03:28.350> see<00:03:28.530> that<00:03:28.739> wasn't<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:29.100> hard<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.550> could

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
can see that wasn't that hard you could

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.610 
can see that wasn't that hard you could
just<00:03:29.700> stand<00:03:30.000> in<00:03:30.090> front<00:03:30.150> of<00:03:30.300> the<00:03:30.390> camera<00:03:30.720> facing

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
just stand in front of the camera facing

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.770 
just stand in front of the camera facing
it<00:03:31.890> at<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.040> different<00:03:32.280> angle<00:03:32.520> and<00:03:32.910> get<00:03:33.690> an

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
it at a different angle and get an

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.510 
it at a different angle and get an
interview<00:03:33.989> type<00:03:34.350> of<00:03:34.500> style<00:03:34.650> so<00:03:35.220> that<00:03:35.340> was<00:03:35.489> my

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
interview type of style so that was my

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.930 
interview type of style so that was my
third<00:03:36.480> tip<00:03:36.690> there<00:03:36.959> and<00:03:37.220> really<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.400> mean

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
third tip there and really I mean

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.550 
third tip there and really I mean
there's<00:03:39.330> not<00:03:39.480> much<00:03:39.630> more<00:03:39.660> that<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:40.050> can<00:03:40.320> give

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
there's not much more that I can give

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.040 
there's not much more that I can give
you<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:40.860> terms<00:03:40.890> of<00:03:41.280> how<00:03:41.820> to<00:03:41.880> overcome<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.810> fear

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
you in terms of how to overcome the fear

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.630 
you in terms of how to overcome the fear
of<00:03:43.080> that<00:03:43.290> but<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:43.709> think<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.160> main<00:03:44.310> thing<00:03:44.370> is

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
of that but I think the main thing is

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
of that but I think the main thing is
practice<00:03:45.630> and<00:03:46.400> over<00:03:47.400> time<00:03:47.610> once<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:48.300> become

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
practice and over time once you become

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.840 
practice and over time once you become
confident<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:49.650> get<00:03:50.310> in<00:03:50.400> front<00:03:50.520> of<00:03:50.610> a<00:03:50.670> camera

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
confident to get in front of a camera

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.400 
confident to get in front of a camera
and<00:03:51.030> just<00:03:51.180> talk<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:51.630> share<00:03:51.840> ideas<00:03:51.900> like<00:03:52.380> this

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
and just talk and share ideas like this

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.620 
and just talk and share ideas like this
it<00:03:52.890> becomes<00:03:53.010> much<00:03:53.580> much<00:03:53.910> easier<00:03:53.970> I<00:03:54.480> can

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
it becomes much much easier I can

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.600 
it becomes much much easier I can
guarantee<00:03:55.050> you<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.500> because<00:03:55.770> personally
