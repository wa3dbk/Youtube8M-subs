00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:14.789
 when you talk about smartphone 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.130
 you soon think of android or iphone already 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.619
 It's good, I'll have it on Douz phone too. 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.390
 now when it comes to black berry logo 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.939
 comes to mind the image of those devices 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.160
 large 2 with keyboards the staff of the 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.450
 office liked the black berry 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.899
 decided to enter the 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.550
 smartphones with 11 10 z10 that our 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.500
 friend renan ribeiro nicknamed 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.860
 fondly of black bear moleque 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.020
 Calm down , calm down, you're not a brat. 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:46.470
 Bad sense of the word, you're a brat. 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:49.650
 Do you think the lake is young, you see? 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:53.160
 that's it more kid the meaning of 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:56.730
 slang same right that is more stripped one 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.040
 coolest system compared to 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.190
 previous versions of the system 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.720
 blackberry is because it was more aimed 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.659
 for the corporate market is one of the 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.360
 less knows how annoying to navigate 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.500
 then this version of the blackberry 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.460
 blackberry 10 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.630
 is also friendlier and more intuitive 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.610
 That's it. 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.350
 Good. Let's go there first. 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.659
 characteristic of it we soon see 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.650
 face is a black berry without physical keyboard 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:30.000
 such as the 4.2-inch screen sensitive to 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.880
 touch and resolution of 1280 by 768 points 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.159
 the screen has a tempered glass that does not 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.560
 It is the gorilla glass but it guarantees good 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.689
 resistance, the device can cope 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.500
 keys and coins in your pocket without suffering 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.020
 scratches 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.030
 his body has rounded corners is 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.460
 all made of fine plastic resin 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.920
 resistant cover to bring warmth 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.259
 this battery and to the card slot 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.170
 micro sd and micro sd it has a 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.170
 texture for not slipping oz 10 or a 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.259
 1.5 ghz dual core processor 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.509
 the maggi by adriano 22 5 and 2 gb of 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.939
 Ram memory has 16 GB for 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.290
 storage and has a slot 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.269
 micro sd card 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.099
 the power on button stays up here 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.930
 together with the headphone jack 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.909
 heard from the right side we have the 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.530
 volume control and a button to 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.930
 to trigger the voice command 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.630
 below we have the loudspeaker and the side 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.500
 left side we have the micro usb 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.630
 mini hd 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:30.690
 10 min has a complete package 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:32.700
 Connections 4g wifi bluetooth gps and nfc 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.500
 looking like this looks like the smartphone 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.750
 like any other but is linking the 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.610
 apparatus we have a surprise the 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.520
 operating system was black berry 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.330
 refurbished we have here the black berry 10 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.940
 bbb 10 it is based on qnx a system 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.610
 focused and multitasking 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.850
 from the very confusing unix kernel 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.400
 because it is but only to have a notion systems 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.100
 qnx are widely used missions 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.220
 where you can not have flaws like 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.600
 traffic signs hospitals 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.270
 Flight controllers mats 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.640
 plants and even nuclear power plants 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.590
 black berry got this system that is 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.630
 much broader than those in the 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.489
 majority of smartphones and put a 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.320
 nice interface that means that 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.570
 it's all innovative not 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.610
 it takes some points that worked 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.130
 well in competing systems such as 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.230
 application layout and power 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.209
 organize your applications into folders by 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.860
 example but we have some good functions 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.320
 interesting things that help 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.400
 productivity, for example the ranking of 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.070
 Notifications 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.930
 it brings together all the contact and 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.489
 mails and social networks 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.920
 when you receive any notification 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.290
 in any of these services is only the 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.940
 slide your finger across the screen so for 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.590
 show new messages 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.600
 This is interesting because you do not 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.549
 need to open the message if it is not 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.430
 important at the moment if you do not want to 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.590
 To read, just repeat the movement and you're done. 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.660
 back where you were to switch 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.940
 between open applications is just the 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.720
 slide your finger up and it will stay 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.130
 there minimized open and close applications 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.200
 slide between the screens all works 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.299
 very well for talking about apps 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.299
 blackberry world still has a 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.950
 limited list of available applications 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.079
 especially the free ones 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.540
 we have some games and we have the 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.350
 social networking applications but still 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.350
 a lot is missing 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.310
 another item that works very well is the 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.379
 virtual keyboard 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.759
 it recognizes that we are typing 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:51.259
 insert the words 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:54.259
 the most impressive is that he 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:56.389
 hardly misses the suggested word 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:57.740
 appears on the keyboard itself and it is only 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:59.539
 play up there 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.729
 the suggestion of words the up to three 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:03.620
 languages ​​at the same time and the 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.900
 most of the time what 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.330
 we wanted to write this helps a lot in the 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.879
 clear productivity that the applications of 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.379
 office could not be left out and the 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:14.240
 It is best to separate the 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:17.539
 application work applications 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.729
 with blackberry shake camera 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:22.610
 of the g10 also brings news 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.860
 she takes photos with up to 8 megapixels and 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.669
 full HD videos with stabilization 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.069
 images 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.199
 images look great in well- 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:33.169
 illuminated and already in environments with little 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:35.449
 light and the led flash and still saves it 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:38.029
 has some features like filters 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:39.949
 Color Correction Mode Online Shift 

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:41.509
 take multiple pictures at once to 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.520
 we can choose the best 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:45.770
 You can change your face, just the camera. 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.930
 front makes 2 megapixel photos and 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.849
 720p videos 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.900
 it also has the resources of the 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.719
 back camera 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:56.180
 his battery does not bring anything new 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:59.150
 with 1,800 thousand amps we made our 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.180
 pattern and z 10 held 15 hours 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.400
 away from the wall outlet 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.259
 black berry took a while but finally entered 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.569
 to the top smartphone market of 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:10.819
 line with the hardware similar to the 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:12.080
 main competitors is differentiated 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:15.529
 bbb 10 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:18.020
 a stable agile system night tasks 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:21.289
 with the very smart virtual keyboard 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:23.810
 good performance and robust hardware that 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:25.669
 ensures optimum productivity but 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.039
 black berry store still has 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:29.089
 few applications for more information 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:30.560
 on the r 10 

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:32.930
 click the link that is in the 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.270
 video description, do not forget to 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.960
 sign up for our channel to enjoy the 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.900
 our video 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:43.180
 and not following on twitter, thanks for 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:50.630
 I'm going to tell your director there 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:53.720
 brat who already sponsors with me 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:55.160
 jeci cuddles I speak giant agreement passes 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.250
 four 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:01.280
 he is saying yes in the 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:04.509
 stripped down a more funky system 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:09.110
 because before that system 

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:11.349
 bbb10 receives the 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:22.419
 they have managed to make a system 

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:22.419
 so more moody the giant woke up
