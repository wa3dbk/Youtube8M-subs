when I explain the printmaking
techniques<00:00:14.099> on<00:00:14.340> how<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.639> hold<00:00:14.910> your<00:00:15.000> squeeze

techniques on how to hold your squeeze

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:28.260 
techniques on how to hold your squeeze
you<00:00:15.509> don't<00:00:15.719> do<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:15.990> all<00:00:16.080> properly

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.040 

a<00:00:28.500> cup<00:00:29.500> of<00:00:29.620> squeegees<00:00:30.130> here<00:00:30.600> wouldn't<00:00:31.600> handle

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
a cup of squeegees here wouldn't handle

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.840 
a cup of squeegees here wouldn't handle
feels<00:00:32.980> nice<00:00:33.250> in<00:00:33.490> the<00:00:33.580> hand<00:00:35.220> we've<00:00:36.220> got<00:00:36.250> here

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
feels nice in the hand we've got here

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.500 
feels nice in the hand we've got here
this<00:00:37.360> one's<00:00:37.650> got<00:00:38.650> that<00:00:38.800> so<00:00:38.950> that<00:00:39.250> gray<00:00:39.610> rubbery

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
this one's got that so that gray rubbery

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.870 
this one's got that so that gray rubbery
stuff<00:00:40.870> on<00:00:41.110> which<00:00:41.290> is<00:00:41.380> a<00:00:41.410> bit<00:00:41.560> softer<00:00:42.100> and

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 
stuff on which is a bit softer and

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.850 
stuff on which is a bit softer and
where's<00:00:43.180> that<00:00:43.480> this<00:00:43.840> is<00:00:44.020> all<00:00:44.200> rounded<00:00:44.940> now<00:00:46.860> it

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
where's that this is all rounded now it

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.250 
where's that this is all rounded now it
should<00:00:48.190> start<00:00:49.150> it<00:00:49.330> off<00:00:49.450> it's<00:00:49.629> life<00:00:49.870> sort<00:00:50.200> of

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
should start it off it's life sort of

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.920 
should start it off it's life sort of
being<00:00:50.590> very<00:00:51.070> square<00:00:52.030> like<00:00:52.360> this<00:00:52.390> one<00:00:52.780> here

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
being very square like this one here

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.840 
being very square like this one here
this<00:00:55.930> is<00:00:56.110> still<00:00:56.320> of<00:00:56.470> use<00:00:56.710> if<00:00:57.280> your<00:00:57.460> t-shirt

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
this is still of use if your t-shirt

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.270 
this is still of use if your t-shirt
printing<00:00:58.360> what<00:00:58.570> this<00:00:58.750> does<00:00:59.040> being<00:01:00.040> a<00:01:00.129> bit

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
printing what this does being a bit

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.370 
printing what this does being a bit
rounded<00:01:00.760> it's<00:01:00.940> going<00:01:01.120> to<00:01:01.180> lead<00:01:01.480> a<00:01:01.720> lot<00:01:02.110> more

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
rounded it's going to lead a lot more

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:09.210 
rounded it's going to lead a lot more
ink<00:01:02.770> on<00:01:03.100> tooth<00:01:04.140> with<00:01:05.140> each<00:01:05.350> print<00:01:08.220> sharper

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
ink on tooth with each print sharper

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.760 
ink on tooth with each print sharper
ones<00:01:09.460> here<00:01:09.940> these<00:01:10.270> ones<00:01:10.540> look<00:01:10.720> like<00:01:11.320> if<00:01:11.500> I<00:01:11.590> made

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
ones here these ones look like if I made

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.499 
ones here these ones look like if I made
out<00:01:11.979> like<00:01:12.250> a<00:01:12.280> a<00:01:12.869> ruby<00:01:13.869> orangey<00:01:14.500> type<00:01:15.160> of<00:01:15.509> rubber

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
out like a a ruby orangey type of rubber

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.960 
out like a a ruby orangey type of rubber
which<00:01:16.750> is<00:01:16.899> really<00:01:17.410> really<00:01:17.590> hard<00:01:18.009> it<00:01:18.550> keeps<00:01:18.850> a

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
which is really really hard it keeps a

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.630 
which is really really hard it keeps a
sharp<00:01:19.300> edge<00:01:19.540> for<00:01:19.869> many<00:01:20.229> many<00:01:20.530> prints<00:01:20.979> really

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
sharp edge for many many prints really

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.719 
sharp edge for many many prints really
good<00:01:21.790> for<00:01:21.970> getting<00:01:22.090> that<00:01:22.270> fine<00:01:22.600> detail<00:01:22.840> in

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.969 

right<00:01:27.729> what<00:01:28.180> I<00:01:28.210> usually<00:01:28.540> do<00:01:28.840> is<00:01:28.960> put<00:01:29.440> masking

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
right what I usually do is put masking

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.950 
right what I usually do is put masking
tape<00:01:30.250> all<00:01:30.580> the<00:01:30.700> way<00:01:30.820> around<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.420> corners

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
tape all the way around the corners

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.499 
tape all the way around the corners
making<00:01:32.410> sure<00:01:32.649> that<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:33.340> ink<00:01:33.610> can't<00:01:34.179> get

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
making sure that the ink can't get

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.160 
making sure that the ink can't get
through<00:01:35.369> packing<00:01:36.369> tape<00:01:36.610> I<00:01:36.819> use<00:01:37.119> that's<00:01:37.959> gonna

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
through packing tape I use that's gonna

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.930 
through packing tape I use that's gonna
take<00:01:38.410> packing<00:01:38.860> tape<00:01:39.009> really<00:01:39.399> doesn't<00:01:39.789> matter

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
take packing tape really doesn't matter

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.820 
take packing tape really doesn't matter
just<00:01:40.300> take<00:01:40.509> the<00:01:40.690> remove<00:01:41.050> afterwards<00:01:43.830> yeah

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
just take the remove afterwards yeah

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.100 
just take the remove afterwards yeah
also<00:01:45.100> like<00:01:45.459> to<00:01:45.550> go<00:01:45.700> on<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:45.970> inside<00:01:46.240> here<00:01:46.929> to

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
also like to go on the inside here to

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.010 
also like to go on the inside here to
stop<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.670> ink<00:01:48.670> from<00:01:48.880> sneaking<00:01:49.450> in<00:01:49.539> under<00:01:49.720> the

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
stop the ink from sneaking in under the

stop the ink from sneaking in under the
wood<00:01:51.600> there's<00:01:52.600> a<00:01:52.690> whole<00:01:53.200> little<00:01:53.679> perspective

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
wood there's a whole little perspective

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.980 
wood there's a whole little perspective
dust<00:01:54.970> or<00:01:55.209> something<00:01:55.479> that's<00:01:55.569> gone<00:01:55.720> on<00:01:55.899> the

dust or something that's gone on the

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.260 
dust or something that's gone on the
screen<00:01:56.319> use<00:01:56.649> for<00:01:57.009> that<00:01:57.190> but<00:01:57.490> after<00:01:58.090> holding

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
screen use for that but after holding

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.520 
screen use for that but after holding
your<00:01:58.450> screen<00:01:58.720> up<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.080> light<00:01:59.289> you<00:01:59.500> can

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
your screen up to the light you can

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.710 
your screen up to the light you can
still<00:01:59.770> see<00:01:59.979> where<00:02:00.130> all<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.399> pinholes<00:02:01.270> are<00:02:01.509> and

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
still see where all the pinholes are and

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.580 
still see where all the pinholes are and
you<00:02:01.810> cover<00:02:02.110> them<00:02:02.319> up<00:02:03.840> anything<00:02:04.840> this<00:02:05.140> into

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
you cover them up anything this into

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.020 
you cover them up anything this into
place<00:02:07.170> using<00:02:08.170> some<00:02:08.500> spray<00:02:08.800> adhesive<00:02:08.890> on<00:02:09.880> the
