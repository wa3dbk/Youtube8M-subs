fine copper wire some great dubbing and
one<00:00:24.509> dun-colored<00:00:25.509> hackle<00:00:26.519> it's<00:00:27.519> a<00:00:27.640> really

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
one dun-colored hackle it's a really

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.179 
one dun-colored hackle it's a really
simple<00:00:28.029> fly<00:00:28.390> but<00:00:29.140> I<00:00:29.170> fish<00:00:29.439> it<00:00:29.589> quite<00:00:29.740> a<00:00:29.769> bit<00:00:30.039> I

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
simple fly but I fish it quite a bit I

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:31.980 
simple fly but I fish it quite a bit I
find<00:00:30.550> it<00:00:30.669> really<00:00:31.060> effective<00:00:31.660> when<00:00:31.810> the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
find it really effective when the

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.200 
find it really effective when the
blue-winged<00:00:32.590> olives<00:00:32.890> are<00:00:33.010> on<00:00:33.160> and<00:00:33.430> I<00:00:33.910> fish<00:00:34.090> it

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
blue-winged olives are on and I fish it

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.810 
blue-winged olives are on and I fish it
two<00:00:34.360> different<00:00:34.480> ways<00:00:34.690> during<00:00:34.990> that<00:00:35.230> hatch

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
two different ways during that hatch

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.830 
two different ways during that hatch
first<00:00:36.820> way<00:00:37.000> I<00:00:37.030> fish<00:00:37.239> it<00:00:37.360> is<00:00:37.420> actually<00:00:37.690> as<00:00:37.750> a

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
first way I fish it is actually as a

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.540 
first way I fish it is actually as a
nymph<00:00:38.050> I'll<00:00:38.379> fish<00:00:38.649> it<00:00:38.770> behind<00:00:39.070> a<00:00:39.160> bead<00:00:39.340> head

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
nymph I'll fish it behind a bead head

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.110 
nymph I'll fish it behind a bead head
fly<00:00:40.239> and<00:00:40.570> just<00:00:41.200> upstream<00:00:41.579> with<00:00:42.579> it<00:00:42.699> under<00:00:42.969> an

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
fly and just upstream with it under an

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.060 
fly and just upstream with it under an
indicator<00:00:43.510> and<00:00:43.750> the<00:00:44.110> second<00:00:44.469> way<00:00:44.559> I<00:00:44.590> find<00:00:44.949> is

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
indicator and the second way I find is

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.310 
indicator and the second way I find is
official<00:00:45.489> refusing<00:00:46.000> your<00:00:46.120> Duns<00:00:46.360> I'll<00:00:47.050> take

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
official refusing your Duns I'll take

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.869 
official refusing your Duns I'll take
this<00:00:47.469> fly<00:00:47.739> and<00:00:47.860> I'll<00:00:47.949> grease<00:00:48.190> my<00:00:48.399> leader<00:00:48.640> all

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
this fly and I'll grease my leader all

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.490 
this fly and I'll grease my leader all
the<00:00:49.030> way<00:00:49.149> up<00:00:49.300> to<00:00:49.449> the<00:00:49.539> fly<00:00:49.780> so<00:00:50.079> that<00:00:50.109> the<00:00:50.289> fly

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
the way up to the fly so that the fly

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.080 
the way up to the fly so that the fly
just<00:00:50.739> hangs<00:00:51.010> in<00:00:51.219> the<00:00:51.309> surface<00:00:51.670> film<00:00:51.879> and

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
just hangs in the surface film and

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.299 
just hangs in the surface film and
actually<00:00:52.390> fish<00:00:52.629> it<00:00:52.780> to<00:00:52.899> rising<00:00:53.289> fish<00:00:53.559> and<00:00:53.800> I

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
actually fish it to rising fish and I

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.000 
actually fish it to rising fish and I
find<00:00:54.550> that<00:00:54.579> to<00:00:54.670> be<00:00:54.760> particularly<00:00:55.180> effective

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
find that to be particularly effective

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.490 
find that to be particularly effective

I'm<00:01:57.880> just<00:01:58.030> gonna<00:01:58.149> put<00:01:58.390> two<00:01:58.540> turns<00:01:58.780> of<00:01:58.930> thread

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
I'm just gonna put two turns of thread

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.219 
I'm just gonna put two turns of thread
on<00:01:59.170> that<00:01:59.409> just<00:01:59.649> to<00:01:59.770> hold<00:01:59.920> it<00:02:00.070> for<00:02:00.280> now<00:02:01.229> then

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
then I'll just bring my thread forward I

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.770 
then I'll just bring my thread forward I
do<00:02:27.580> build<00:02:27.910> up<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.150> body<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:28.450> little<00:02:28.599> bit

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
do build up the body a little bit

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.540 
do build up the body a little bit
because<00:02:28.900> where<00:02:29.080> I<00:02:29.140> doubled<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.650> pheasant

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
because where I doubled that pheasant

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.010 
because where I doubled that pheasant
tail<00:02:30.700> back<00:02:30.940> over<00:02:31.270> itself<00:02:31.599> it's<00:02:31.720> gonna<00:02:31.840> be<00:02:31.989> a

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
tail back over itself it's gonna be a

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.120 
tail back over itself it's gonna be a
little<00:02:32.200> bit<00:02:32.290> thicker<00:02:32.530> so<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:32.830> just<00:02:33.010> try<00:02:33.099> and

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
little bit thicker so I just try and

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.850 
little bit thicker so I just try and
even<00:02:33.430> it<00:02:33.550> out<00:02:33.640> with<00:02:33.849> thread<00:02:34.560> stop<00:02:35.560> about<00:02:35.800> a

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
even it out with thread stop about a

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.880 
even it out with thread stop about a
third<00:02:36.160> of<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.310> way<00:02:36.430> back<00:02:36.670> from<00:02:36.849> the<00:02:36.940> hook<00:02:37.150> I

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
third of the way back from the hook I

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.640 
third of the way back from the hook I
then<00:02:38.890> I<00:02:38.950> take<00:02:39.130> my<00:02:39.160> pheasant<00:02:39.640> tail<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:41.500> I'll

build<00:02:41.860> my<00:02:42.010> body<00:02:47.280> just<00:02:48.280> wrap<00:02:48.459> that<00:02:48.670> forward

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:03.440 

tie<00:02:56.100> it<00:02:56.160> off<00:03:01.190> I'll<00:03:02.190> take<00:03:02.340> my<00:03:02.490> copper<00:03:02.880> wire<00:03:03.060> and

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
tie it off I'll take my copper wire and

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.420 
tie it off I'll take my copper wire and
I'll<00:03:03.570> counter<00:03:03.960> wrap<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.410> just<00:03:05.130> for<00:03:05.280> some

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
I'll counter wrap that just for some

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.220 
I'll counter wrap that just for some
added<00:03:05.550> flash<00:03:06.000> as<00:03:06.300> well<00:03:06.450> as<00:03:06.540> some<00:03:06.690> durability

want a whole lot of hackle so two turns

00:04:51.729 --> 00:05:09.260 
want a whole lot of hackle so two turns
at<00:04:51.909> the<00:04:51.939> most<00:04:52.740> tie<00:04:53.740> that<00:04:53.949> off

and<00:05:13.420> just<00:05:13.480> hold<00:05:13.900> that<00:05:13.990> hackle<00:05:14.590> towards<00:05:14.920> the

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
and just hold that hackle towards the

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.320 
and just hold that hackle towards the
rear<00:05:15.250> of<00:05:15.280> the<00:05:15.430> hook<00:05:15.610> towards<00:05:15.910> the<00:05:16.000> bend<00:05:16.180> of<00:05:16.300> the

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
rear of the hook towards the bend of the

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.010 
rear of the hook towards the bend of the
hook<00:05:16.390> take<00:05:17.320> a<00:05:17.350> couple<00:05:17.860> of<00:05:17.950> turns<00:05:18.190> back<00:05:18.520> over

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
hook take a couple of turns back over

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.540 
hook take a couple of turns back over
just<00:05:20.020> so<00:05:20.140> that<00:05:20.350> hackle<00:05:20.800> is<00:05:20.890> angled<00:05:21.310> towards

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
just so that hackle is angled towards

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:43.959 
just so that hackle is angled towards
the<00:05:21.700> back<00:05:25.140> put<00:05:26.140> my<00:05:26.260> lip<00:05:26.440> finish<00:05:26.740> in

00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:43.969 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:47.600 

and<00:05:44.969> then<00:05:45.150> I<00:05:45.210> can<00:05:45.360> cut<00:05:45.569> my<00:05:45.599> thread<00:05:46.050> I<00:05:46.610> think

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
and then I can cut my thread I think

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.939 
and then I can cut my thread I think
what<00:05:47.759> happens<00:05:48.150> when<00:05:48.300> this<00:05:48.500> hackle<00:05:49.500> gets<00:05:49.710> wet

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:52.189 
what happens when this hackle gets wet
it<00:05:50.099> almost<00:05:50.340> forms<00:05:50.699> an<00:05:50.819> air<00:05:50.969> bubble<00:05:51.210> between

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 
it almost forms an air bubble between

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:57.679 
it almost forms an air bubble between
the<00:05:52.490> thorax<00:05:53.490> and<00:05:53.789> the<00:05:54.620> hackle<00:05:56.479> so<00:05:57.479> you<00:05:57.569> can

00:05:57.679 --> 00:05:57.689 
the thorax and the hackle so you can

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:59.839 
the thorax and the hackle so you can
take<00:05:57.840> a<00:05:57.870> look<00:05:58.020> and<00:05:58.259> see<00:05:58.409> 360<00:05:59.340> degree<00:05:59.610> view<00:05:59.819> of

00:05:59.839 --> 00:05:59.849 
take a look and see 360 degree view of

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:02.330 
take a look and see 360 degree view of
that<00:06:00.060> and<00:06:00.780> that's<00:06:01.469> a<00:06:01.590> real<00:06:01.770> good<00:06:01.949> imitation

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
that and that's a real good imitation

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.930 
that and that's a real good imitation
for<00:06:02.669> a<00:06:02.729> beta<00:06:03.360> so<00:06:03.569> merger
