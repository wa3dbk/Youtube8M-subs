scratching if you do it slow you can

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.980 
scratching if you do it slow you can
promote<00:01:11.549> certain<00:01:11.939> principles<00:01:12.420> like<00:01:12.630> pitch

and frequency and force and the speed at

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.660 
and frequency and force and the speed at
which<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.140> do<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.500> produces<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.130> certain<00:01:17.369> sound

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
up this guy is actually a rocket

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.459 
up this guy is actually a rocket
scientist<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.600> tell<00:01:57.600> us<00:01:57.719> about<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.200> and

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
scientist to tell us about that and

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.999 
scientist to tell us about that and
that's<00:01:59.189> when<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.460> gather<00:01:59.700> that's<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:01.409> me<00:02:01.560> one<00:02:01.890> of
