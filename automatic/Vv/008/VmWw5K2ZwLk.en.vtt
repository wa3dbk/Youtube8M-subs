00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
coming back from the NBA Draft I felt

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.060 
coming back from the NBA Draft I felt
like<00:00:38.300> even<00:00:39.020> though<00:00:39.320> it<00:00:39.410> was<00:00:39.530> a<00:00:39.560> huge

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
like even though it was a huge

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.530 
like even though it was a huge
temptation<00:00:40.370> at<00:00:40.700> the<00:00:40.760> time<00:00:41.000> it<00:00:41.210> was<00:00:41.240> the<00:00:41.390> best

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
temptation at the time it was the best

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.960 
temptation at the time it was the best
decision<00:00:41.690> for<00:00:42.050> me<00:00:42.260> to<00:00:42.290> come<00:00:42.530> back<00:00:42.560> it<00:00:43.190> was<00:00:43.700> a

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
decision for me to come back it was a

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.570 
decision for me to come back it was a
difficult<00:00:44.870> decision<00:00:45.140> but<00:00:45.680> as<00:00:46.010> in<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.370> long

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
difficult decision but as in the long

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.150 
difficult decision but as in the long
run<00:00:46.780> it'll<00:00:47.780> be<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.050> best<00:00:48.230> for<00:00:48.470> my<00:00:48.590> cow<00:00:48.830> team

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
run it'll be the best for my cow team

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.500 
run it'll be the best for my cow team
it'll<00:00:49.490> be<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:49.730> best<00:00:49.880> for<00:00:50.090> me<00:00:50.240> and<00:00:50.270> my<00:00:50.480> family

personally<00:00:51.290> so<00:00:51.830> I<00:00:52.309> believe<00:00:53.270> that<00:00:53.420> that<00:00:53.870> was<00:00:54.050> a

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080 
personally so I believe that that was a

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.750 
personally so I believe that that was a
good<00:00:54.380> decision<00:00:54.500> for<00:00:54.800> me<00:00:55.010> to<00:00:55.100> come<00:00:55.250> back<00:00:55.280> and

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
good decision for me to come back and

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.460 
good decision for me to come back and
the<00:00:56.300> thing

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.200 

the<00:01:00.650> things<00:01:00.890> that<00:01:01.070> drew<00:01:01.220> me<00:01:01.250> back<00:01:01.370> about<00:01:01.700> cow

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210

defense and make it make a difference in
the<00:02:59.050> game<00:02:59.200> that<00:02:59.470> way

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.060 

getting<00:03:05.240> a<00:03:05.330> big<00:03:05.540> block<00:03:05.780> in<00:03:05.960> the<00:03:06.020> game<00:03:06.290> is<00:03:06.590> I

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
getting a big block in the game is I

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.490 
getting a big block in the game is I
feel<00:03:07.730> like<00:03:07.910> it's<00:03:08.150> it's<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:08.960> same<00:03:09.200> as<00:03:09.230> getting

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
feel like it's it's the same as getting

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.710 
feel like it's it's the same as getting
a<00:03:09.710> dunk<00:03:10.010> or<00:03:10.310> you<00:03:10.670> know<00:03:10.820> or<00:03:11.300> getting<00:03:11.660> the

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
a dunk or you know or getting the

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.330 
a dunk or you know or getting the
interception<00:03:12.230> in<00:03:12.320> a<00:03:12.410> football<00:03:12.650> game<00:03:12.830> it's

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
interception in a football game it's

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.750 
interception in a football game it's
it's<00:03:13.970> pretty<00:03:14.270> much<00:03:14.950> it's<00:03:15.950> a<00:03:16.100> motivation<00:03:16.730> for

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
it's pretty much it's a motivation for

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.010 
it's pretty much it's a motivation for
your<00:03:16.940> team<00:03:17.240> that's<00:03:17.480> kind<00:03:17.660> of<00:03:17.720> demoralizing

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
your team that's kind of demoralizing

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.930 
your team that's kind of demoralizing
for<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.590> other<00:03:18.710> team<00:03:18.920> like<00:03:19.190> man<00:03:19.550> I<00:03:19.670> thought<00:03:19.850> we

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
for the other team like man I thought we

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.900 
for the other team like man I thought we
had<00:03:19.970> that<00:03:20.360> you<00:03:20.900> know<00:03:20.960> so<00:03:21.320> I'm<00:03:21.640> getting<00:03:22.640> a<00:03:22.730> big

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
had that you know so I'm getting a big

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.090 
had that you know so I'm getting a big
block<00:03:23.120> is<00:03:23.330> is<00:03:23.570> I<00:03:23.930> think<00:03:23.990> it's<00:03:24.260> a<00:03:24.320> very<00:03:24.440> big<00:03:24.950> part

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
block is is I think it's a very big part

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.259 
block is is I think it's a very big part
of<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.310> game

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.240 

some<00:03:31.269> of<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:31.420> skills<00:03:31.599> is<00:03:32.230> timing<00:03:32.560> and<00:03:32.920> I

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
some of the skills is timing and I

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.780 
some of the skills is timing and I
haven't<00:03:33.970> always<00:03:34.090> been<00:03:34.329> good<00:03:34.540> with<00:03:34.599> timing<00:03:35.170> uh

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
haven't always been good with timing uh

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.860 
haven't always been good with timing uh
especially<00:03:36.790> if<00:03:36.849> you<00:03:36.939> look<00:03:37.090> back<00:03:37.239> some<00:03:37.480> high

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
especially if you look back some high

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.220 
especially if you look back some high
school<00:03:38.140> films<00:03:39.000> yeah<00:03:40.000> definitely<00:03:40.329> you<00:03:40.930> need<00:03:41.049> to

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
school films yeah definitely you need to

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.050 
school films yeah definitely you need to
have<00:03:41.560> timing<00:03:41.860> and<00:03:42.189> control<00:03:42.549> of<00:03:42.790> your<00:03:42.879> body

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
have timing and control of your body

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.610 
have timing and control of your body
because<00:03:43.569> there<00:03:43.720> have<00:03:43.810> been<00:03:43.930> certain<00:03:44.230> times

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
because there have been certain times

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.949 
because there have been certain times
where<00:03:44.890> you<00:03:45.549> jump<00:03:45.939> as<00:03:46.120> high<00:03:46.150> as<00:03:46.329> you<00:03:46.450> can<00:03:46.540> and

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
where you jump as high as you can and

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.660 
where you jump as high as you can and
fall<00:03:47.440> into<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:47.769> person<00:03:48.040> to<00:03:48.099> get<00:03:48.220> that<00:03:48.370> foul

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
fall into the person to get that foul

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.069 
fall into the person to get that foul
but<00:03:49.200> definitely<00:03:50.370> timing<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:52.840> got<00:03:52.959> to<00:03:52.989> be

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
but definitely timing and you got to be

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:58.240 
but definitely timing and you got to be
able<00:03:53.140> to<00:03:53.260> jump

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.430
