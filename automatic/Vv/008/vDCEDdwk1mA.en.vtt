00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
I always like to make sure the batteries

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.620 
I always like to make sure the batteries
are<00:01:48.350> fresh<00:01:48.590> before<00:01:48.830> I<00:01:49.010> put<00:01:49.190> them<00:01:49.310> in<00:01:49.450> this<00:01:50.450> is

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.200 
are fresh before I put them in this is
the<00:01:50.720> best<00:01:50.930> way<00:01:51.050> to<00:01:51.080> do<00:01:51.290> it<00:01:51.440> of<00:01:51.530> course<00:01:52.090> let<00:01:53.090> that

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
the best way to do it of course let that

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:26.119 
the best way to do it of course let that
run<00:01:53.450> for<00:01:53.630> a<00:01:53.690> little<00:01:53.780> while<00:02:19.989> Sonic

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:03:05.289 

know<00:02:27.129> about<00:02:27.189> the<00:02:27.370> Panasonic

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.539 

yeah<00:03:06.409> all<00:03:07.409> right<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:07.769> this<00:03:07.890> top<00:03:08.129> rocket

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
yeah all right so this top rocket

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.100 
yeah all right so this top rocket
doesn't<00:03:08.700> exactly<00:03:09.030> fit<00:03:09.390> perfectly<00:03:09.780> onto<00:03:09.959> that

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
doesn't exactly fit perfectly onto that

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.960 
doesn't exactly fit perfectly onto that
battery<00:03:10.500> it's<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.709> little<00:03:10.890> bit<00:03:10.980> bigger<00:03:11.189> so<00:03:11.939> you

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
battery it's a little bit bigger so you

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.250 
battery it's a little bit bigger so you
got<00:03:12.269> to<00:03:12.360> do<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.450> little<00:03:12.540> bit<00:03:12.720> of<00:03:12.750> modifying

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
got to do a little bit of modifying

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.809 
got to do a little bit of modifying
which<00:03:13.709> is<00:03:13.829> no<00:03:13.980> big<00:03:14.010> deal<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:14.400> really<00:03:14.640> there's<00:03:14.790> a

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
which is no big deal it really there's a

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.059 
which is no big deal it really there's a
couple<00:03:15.120> spot<00:03:15.329> welds<00:03:15.720> I'm<00:03:16.590> just<00:03:16.739> going<00:03:16.860> to<00:03:16.920> bust

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
couple spot welds I'm just going to bust

00:03:17.069 --> 00:04:04.990 
couple spot welds I'm just going to bust
those<00:03:17.250> little<00:03:17.780> 90-degree<00:03:18.780> angles<00:03:19.079> off

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.160 

relatively<00:04:06.000> simple<00:04:06.300> it's<00:04:06.720> just<00:04:06.750> a<00:04:06.960> battery

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
relatively simple it's just a battery

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.950 
relatively simple it's just a battery
swap<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:08.060> little<00:04:09.060> modification<00:04:09.300> on<00:04:09.870> the

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
swap a little modification on the

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.900 
swap a little modification on the
hold-down<00:04:10.760> she's<00:04:11.760> good<00:04:11.910> to<00:04:12.030> go<00:04:12.060> I<00:04:13.730> guess<00:04:14.730> the

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
hold-down she's good to go I guess the

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.039 
hold-down she's good to go I guess the
last<00:04:15.030> thing<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.360> do<00:04:15.510> is<00:04:15.660> to<00:04:15.720> make<00:04:15.870> sure<00:04:15.900> that

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
last thing to do is to make sure that

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.449 
last thing to do is to make sure that
the<00:04:16.170> car<00:04:16.350> still<00:04:16.650> starts<00:04:17.010> and<00:04:17.220> everything

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
the car still starts and everything

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:57.940 
the car still starts and everything
still<00:04:17.700> works<00:04:17.730> so<00:04:19.010> let's<00:04:20.010> see

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.200 

I<00:04:59.200> don't
