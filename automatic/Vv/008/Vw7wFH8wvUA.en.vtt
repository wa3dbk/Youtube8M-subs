00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello everyone good today we are going to talk 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.799
 of the word halo game look at those who 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.590
 we send a big hug and nothing we are going to 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.590
 make a boxing that is with the plastic 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.100
 we'll see 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:29.780
 it's a short instruction book 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.300
 rites 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:35.570
 the electronic push button 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:40.210
 colored pawns a box of 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.210
 score and a board without 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:47.409
 a wad of cards quite like a clairvoyant 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:48.969
 and below we have nothing to put 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:51.429
 and well these are the components 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.829
 been a first look now let's see 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:56.320
 how to play the game mechanics well 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:59.890
 it's very simple that we have to put a 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:03.030
 pillar in the electronic scoreboard a 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.159
 screwdriver store it 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.890
 and we have it ready here we will have a 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.690
 little eyelash sound off as you can 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.380
 see is wearing at any time 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.770
 it may sound we lower the vegetables 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.590
 meanwhile explaining this 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.979
 for that would be at the end of the shift is a 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.060
 time to the stream I explain the rest 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.820
 we would take this mini board and 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.130
 we would put the theme letters 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.649
 in theme and letters letters does not have 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.619
 much more mystery for we wanted that 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.869
 we could like that on the side we would put 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:40.329
 this board marker and each player 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.329
 would take a pawn and in the box 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.609
 but then the game is very simple 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.530
 at the beginning each player takes a card 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:51.530
 of topic then we would look at our 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.689
 letter we simply reserve it then 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.420
 one of the random players then 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.890
 lift this letter and leave the letter m and 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.780
 we all the players each 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.569
 look at its category if we can think of something 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.520
 we put it on and say things like things 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:07.789
 in this situation with the table 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.500
 then press the button then 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.090
 these players have to say the most 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.180
 fast possible words with the letter m 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.579
 on wood table a microwave 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.870
 you see this has a time oratorios 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.609
 then the one who has said the last 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.829
 valid word in this case microwave 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:25.290
 for example this one would take his pawn and 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:28.189
 would advance a box the grace of this 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.230
 is that there are no turns 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:33.810
 it is simply said in words each 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.129
 the one that can and the unit that is worth is the 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.200
 last therefore we can follow the 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.879
 obvious strategy to shut up and let go 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.189
 when we always see salt 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.480
 Random time or style 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.189
 possible fast so that the rest of 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.560
 blocking players 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:48.780
 then this letter would be discarded and 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.459
 I would steal another letter and 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.560
 we would do the same process again 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.889
 first that comes to the end is the one that 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.290
 you win there is also a small alternative 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:01.200
 which is with the juan potter card and all 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.000
 hot potato that is acts the same only 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.909
 that this time it's done with turns 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.489
 example I say things that pushes mango 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:11.010
 of the tip is worth it then 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.290
 press the button and in the turn without equal 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.510
 but making a chain a watch the 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.030
 server clockwise this and other 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.340
 word in another of another and again until 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.959
 that that on the clock while the same on 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.970
 to say the last word life has been 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.829
 advanced course is allowed 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.540
 cheating say false words or 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.010
 that are not in this category if the 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.980
 rest of players do not realize and 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.719
 sneak 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.849
 if they catch us then the word would not be 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:37.140
 a penalty and that's the grace of 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.260
 game that does not have any kind of 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.709
 strategy the time salazar themes you see 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.760
 that there are a lot and letters there are a lot 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.370
 take out the combinations are 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.109
 practically infinite is simply 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.060
 that these games I always the 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.920
 I recommend with large groups of people to 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.290
 23 players do not work as well as 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.269
 we are 7 people and that is all 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.700
 I will try to put together a large group and make 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.069
 a good video split 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.329
 thank you very much to falomir for everything and nothing 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.329
 see you in the next see you later
