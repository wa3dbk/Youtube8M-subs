it<00:03:14.230> around<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:15.430> don't<00:03:15.550> need<00:03:15.790> a<00:03:15.819> whole<00:03:16.390> lot

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
it around you don't need a whole lot

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.350 
it around you don't need a whole lot

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
because you've already got the maple

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.820 
because you've already got the maple
syrup<00:03:19.720> on<00:03:20.020> there<00:03:20.610> and<00:03:21.610> I<00:03:21.880> only<00:03:22.060> do<00:03:22.360> one<00:03:22.630> side<00:03:22.959> if

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
syrup on there and I only do one side if

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.380
