00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.859
 the story of the little girl with 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.550
 The sulfurwood is common 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:23.560
 known as one of the basic map he 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.050
 marked by a great sadness 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.379
 it's about this little girl that's there 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.840
 huddles in the ground and waits for that 

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:34.960
 can sell their streichhÃ¶lzer 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.739
 and all around it the world takes place 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.149
 the everyday 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:42.129
 She is looking through the window 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.610
 People pull them over completely 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:48.370
 Ignore and she is a symbol of 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.540
 the little human suffering that we 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.670
 they all know each other 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.960
 I think that's the dimension of this 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.470
 makes fairy tales so human and also 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.470
 Timeless valid 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:12.810
 it will last forever for a long time 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.250
 of just under 40 minutes a story too 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.330
 tell with very reduced 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.580
 musical means 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.040
 this is on the one hand new music 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.450
 but not one to be afraid of 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.060
 but on the contrary it has to be one 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.580
 a musical language like me 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.600
 find very close to the 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.180
 sentiment is written even though she is in 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.780
 a way away from the world 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.430
 text is also that means one 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.800
 compositional style of the year is fair 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.800
 by reducing to these four 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.390
 singers and very few 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.160
 percussion blades always room 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.649
 also gives in to hear 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:54.990
 and through the many repetitions the 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.850
 the text also contains the text 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.030
 slow history of history around it 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.030
 going 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.239
 this piece has been in america for furore 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.510
 taken care of and now comes from 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.980
 Scandinavia inevitably to us and 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.349
 I am very happy that we in Vienna 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.440
 to play music for the first time in 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.440
 Austria
