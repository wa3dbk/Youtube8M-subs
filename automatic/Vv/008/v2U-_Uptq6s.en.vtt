00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.680 

let's<00:00:08.160> cover<00:00:08.340> how<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.580> write<00:00:08.880> some<00:00:09.150> effective

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
let's cover how to write some effective

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.580 
let's cover how to write some effective
stealth<00:00:10.080> macros<00:00:11.630> okay<00:00:12.630> here<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.019> stealth

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
stealth macros okay here is a stealth

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.890 
stealth macros okay here is a stealth
macro<00:00:14.160> for<00:00:14.610> hunters<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:14.969> are<00:00:15.150> making<00:00:15.450> use<00:00:15.870> of

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
macro for hunters that are making use of

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.130 
macro for hunters that are making use of
the<00:00:16.230> glyph<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.740> camouflage<00:00:17.720> as<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:18.900> can<00:00:18.990> see

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
the glyph of camouflage as you can see

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.290 
the glyph of camouflage as you can see
here<00:00:19.439> at<00:00:19.560> cast<00:00:19.800> camouflage<00:00:20.490> if<00:00:20.789> we're<00:00:20.939> not<00:00:21.090> in

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
here at cast camouflage if we're not in

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.840 
here at cast camouflage if we're not in
combat<00:00:21.510> were<00:00:21.960> not<00:00:22.170> stealth<00:00:22.609> otherwise<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
combat were not stealth otherwise the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.720 
combat were not stealth otherwise the
cast<00:00:24.060> kill<00:00:24.359> shot<00:00:24.740> also<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:26.099> will<00:00:26.160> place<00:00:26.400> us<00:00:26.430> in

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
cast kill shot also it will place us in

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.870 
cast kill shot also it will place us in
auto<00:00:26.970> attack<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.510> we're<00:00:27.660> stealth<00:00:28.880> let's

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
auto attack that we're stealth let's

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.780 
auto attack that we're stealth let's
move<00:00:30.029> on<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.689> rogue<00:00:31.050> stealth<00:00:31.500> macro<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
move on to the rogue stealth macro the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.459 
move on to the rogue stealth macro the
rogue<00:00:33.030> macro<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.630> just<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.930> little<00:00:34.140> bit<00:00:34.350> more

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
rogue macro is just a little bit more

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.889 
rogue macro is just a little bit more
complicated<00:00:35.030> let's<00:00:36.030> say<00:00:36.149> we<00:00:36.300> start<00:00:36.510> off<00:00:36.690> at

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
complicated let's say we start off at

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.950 
complicated let's say we start off at
this<00:00:37.079> mackerel<00:00:37.910> it<00:00:38.910> has<00:00:39.120> stealth<00:00:39.540> if<00:00:39.780> we're

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
this mackerel it has stealth if we're

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.470 
this mackerel it has stealth if we're
not<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.260> combat<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.920> not<00:00:41.160> stealth<00:00:41.520> kick<00:00:42.270> ass

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
not in combat and not stealth kick ass

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.740 
not in combat and not stealth kick ass
garrote<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.649> was<00:00:43.860> stealth<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:45.149> cast<00:00:45.390> slice

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
garrote it was stealth and a cast slice

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.810 
garrote it was stealth and a cast slice
and<00:00:45.989> dice<00:00:46.200> at<00:00:46.770> bryn<00:00:47.039> combat

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.420 

now<00:00:52.820> let's<00:00:52.969> say<00:00:53.120> that<00:00:53.300> we<00:00:53.390> want<00:00:53.600> to<00:00:54.100> kill<00:00:55.100> a<00:00:55.129> mob

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
now let's say that we want to kill a mob

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.540 
now let's say that we want to kill a mob
leave<00:00:56.210> combat<00:00:56.780> mode<00:00:57.019> and<00:00:57.320> then<00:00:57.980> we<00:00:58.129> want<00:00:58.370> to

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
leave combat mode and then we want to

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.490 
leave combat mode and then we want to
refresh<00:00:58.969> our<00:00:59.149> a<00:00:59.210> slice<00:00:59.510> and<00:00:59.719> dice<00:00:59.930> duration

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
refresh our a slice and dice duration

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.729 
refresh our a slice and dice duration
the<00:01:01.339> problem<00:01:01.820> is<00:01:02.149> we<00:01:02.600> can't<00:01:02.899> cast<00:01:03.079> slice<00:01:03.469> and

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
the problem is we can't cast slice and

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.100 
the problem is we can't cast slice and
dice<00:01:03.890> because<00:01:04.460> we're<00:01:04.580> out<00:01:04.729> of<00:01:04.759> combat<00:01:05.180> so<00:01:06.020> the

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
dice because we're out of combat so the

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.430 
dice because we're out of combat so the
macro<00:01:06.500> will<00:01:06.860> only<00:01:07.100> let<00:01:07.399> us<00:01:07.520> gas<00:01:07.759> stealth<00:01:08.440> this

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
macro will only let us gas stealth this

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.800 
macro will only let us gas stealth this
is<00:01:09.619> why<00:01:09.800> we<00:01:09.979> want<00:01:10.159> to<00:01:10.250> avoid<00:01:10.550> using<00:01:11.149> self

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
is why we want to avoid using self

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.690 
is why we want to avoid using self
buffing<00:01:12.229> finishers<00:01:12.680> like<00:01:12.979> slice<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:13.549> dice

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
buffing finishers like slice and dice

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.660 
buffing finishers like slice and dice
and<00:01:14.000> recuperate<00:01:14.600> in<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:15.680> combat<00:01:16.220> condition

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
and recuperate in the combat condition

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.060 
and recuperate in the combat condition
of<00:01:16.759> the<00:01:16.850> macro<00:01:17.290> let's<00:01:18.290> see<00:01:18.440> if<00:01:18.530> we<00:01:18.619> can<00:01:18.740> fix

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
of the macro let's see if we can fix

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.370 
of the macro let's see if we can fix
this<00:01:19.190> macro<00:01:19.580> by<00:01:20.149> using<00:01:20.390> rupture<00:01:21.080> in<00:01:21.320> the

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
this macro by using rupture in the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.820 
this macro by using rupture in the
combat<00:01:21.799> condition<00:01:23.020> so<00:01:24.020> we're<00:01:24.170> testing<00:01:24.740> the

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
combat condition so we're testing the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.950 
combat condition so we're testing the
macro<00:01:25.160> right<00:01:25.369> now<00:01:25.550> let's<00:01:26.270> say<00:01:26.390> we<00:01:26.420> just<00:01:26.720> killed

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
macro right now let's say we just killed

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.040 
macro right now let's say we just killed
the<00:01:27.080> mob<00:01:27.320> left<00:01:28.190> combat<00:01:28.700> mode<00:01:28.909> and<00:01:29.179> instead<00:01:30.020> of

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
the mob left combat mode and instead of

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.560 
the mob left combat mode and instead of
casting<00:01:30.320> stealth<00:01:30.920> we<00:01:31.399> want<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:31.820> redirect<00:01:32.240> our

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
casting stealth we want to redirect our

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.690 
casting stealth we want to redirect our
combo<00:01:32.990> points<00:01:33.200> to<00:01:33.500> another<00:01:33.740> target<00:01:34.280> and<00:01:34.429> then

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
combo points to another target and then

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.300 
combo points to another target and then
open<00:01:35.060> with<00:01:35.179> rupture<00:01:35.600> as<00:01:36.289> you<00:01:36.500> can<00:01:36.619> see<00:01:36.860> we<00:01:37.100> run

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
open with rupture as you can see we run

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.669 
open with rupture as you can see we run
into<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:37.670> same<00:01:37.940> problem<00:01:38.140> you<00:01:39.140> can<00:01:39.289> only<00:01:39.409> cast

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
into the same problem you can only cast

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.340 
into the same problem you can only cast
stealth<00:01:40.069> as<00:01:40.369> we're<00:01:40.700> out<00:01:40.729> of<00:01:40.819> combat<00:01:41.170> so<00:01:42.170> this

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
stealth as we're out of combat so this

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.260 
stealth as we're out of combat so this
disqualify<00:01:43.009> is<00:01:43.069> using<00:01:43.399> both<00:01:43.550> rupture<00:01:44.060> and

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
disqualify is using both rupture and

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.109 
disqualify is using both rupture and
kidney<00:01:44.630> shot<00:01:44.899> and<00:01:45.200> combat<00:01:45.800> condition<00:01:46.220> here<00:01:46.909> is

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
kidney shot and combat condition here is

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.880 
kidney shot and combat condition here is
the<00:01:47.270> final<00:01:47.600> version<00:01:47.899> of<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.200> rogue<00:01:48.409> macro

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
the final version of the rogue macro

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.430 
the final version of the rogue macro
that<00:01:49.220> has<00:01:49.399> worked<00:01:49.640> pretty<00:01:49.880> well<00:01:50.119> for<00:01:50.179> me<00:01:50.539> as

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
that has worked pretty well for me as

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.800 
that has worked pretty well for me as
you<00:01:51.649> can<00:01:51.740> see<00:01:51.920> it<00:01:52.069> uses<00:01:52.460> gouge<00:01:52.789> in<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:53.360> combat

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
you can see it uses gouge in the combat

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.590 
you can see it uses gouge in the combat
condition<00:01:54.290> I<00:01:54.670> typically<00:01:55.670> use<00:01:55.790> gouge<00:01:56.240> as<00:01:56.570> a

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
condition I typically use gouge as a

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.420 
condition I typically use gouge as a
spell<00:01:56.990> interrupt<00:01:57.439> if<00:01:57.619> kick<00:01:57.920> is<00:01:58.040> on<00:01:58.189> cooldown

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
spell interrupt if kick is on cooldown

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.240 
spell interrupt if kick is on cooldown
as<00:01:59.060> you<00:01:59.180> can<00:01:59.299> see<00:01:59.479> in<00:01:59.570> this<00:01:59.659> clip

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.190 

the<00:02:05.250> feral<00:02:05.580> druid<00:02:05.970> stealth<00:02:06.300> macro<00:02:06.720> is<00:02:06.870> a<00:02:06.900> lot

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
the feral druid stealth macro is a lot

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.990 
the feral druid stealth macro is a lot
easier<00:02:07.470> than<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.009> rogue<00:02:08.250> stealth<00:02:08.580> macro

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
easier than the rogue stealth macro

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.969 
easier than the rogue stealth macro
because<00:02:09.360> druids<00:02:09.810> can't<00:02:10.110> redirect<00:02:10.350> combo

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
because druids can't redirect combo
