now some of this may be a little
unnecessary<00:02:43.590> because<00:02:44.590> I<00:02:45.100> don't<00:02:45.760> really<00:02:46.180> I

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
unnecessary because I don't really I

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.830 
unnecessary because I don't really I
can't<00:02:47.380> really<00:02:47.440> imagine<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:48.250> why<00:02:48.910> you<00:02:48.970> put<00:02:49.690> him

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
can't really imagine a why you put him

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.949 
can't really imagine a why you put him
in<00:02:49.959> some<00:02:50.170> crazy<00:02:50.350> poses<00:02:50.739> like<00:02:51.100> that<00:02:51.630> but<00:02:52.630> it's

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
in some crazy poses like that but it's

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.360 
in some crazy poses like that but it's
kind<00:02:53.230> of<00:02:53.290> nice<00:02:53.440> just<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.799> have<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.130> extra

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
kind of nice just to have the extra

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.360 
kind of nice just to have the extra
articulation<00:02:55.950> but<00:02:56.950> uh<00:02:57.150> not<00:02:58.150> really<00:02:58.420> necessary

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
articulation but uh not really necessary

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.300 
articulation but uh not really necessary
but<00:03:00.370> I<00:03:00.430> always<00:03:00.940> a<00:03:00.970> nice<00:03:01.209> addition<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.950> more

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310

articulation<00:03:03.820> the<00:03:04.060> better<00:03:04.239> I<00:03:04.329> say<00:03:04.769> even<00:03:05.769> if

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
articulation the better I say even if

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.050 
articulation the better I say even if
the<00:03:05.950> Figge<00:03:06.220> doesn't<00:03:06.549> need<00:03:06.670> it<00:03:08.610> but<00:03:09.610> if<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:09.970> can
