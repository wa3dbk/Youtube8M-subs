00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
because as well as all the things I've

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.819 
because as well as all the things I've
written<00:01:44.360> up<00:01:44.540> to<00:01:44.659> now<00:01:44.810> I<00:01:45.079> have<00:01:45.290> to<00:01:45.380> say<00:01:45.560> that

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
written up to now I have to say that

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.749 
written up to now I have to say that
books<00:01:46.490> that<00:01:46.700> deal<00:01:46.880> with<00:01:46.939> time<00:01:47.479> travel<00:01:47.960> and

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
just slipping about in time probably

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.910 
just slipping about in time probably
exactly<00:01:52.460> more<00:01:52.729> than<00:01:52.820> anything<00:01:53.119> so<00:01:53.689> it's<00:01:54.380> I

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
exactly more than anything so it's I
