while he's playing music alright so

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.080 
while he's playing music alright so
we're<00:04:10.020> just<00:04:10.050> going<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.410> level<00:04:10.860> it<00:04:10.950> up<00:04:11.100> into<00:04:11.400> it

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
we're just going to level it up into it

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.950 
we're just going to level it up into it
level<00:04:12.540> 15<00:04:13.080> so<00:04:13.410> we'll<00:04:13.740> have<00:04:13.980> him<00:04:14.880> at<00:04:15.120> level<00:04:15.480> 15

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
level 15 so we'll have him at level 15

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.620 
level 15 so we'll have him at level 15
so<00:04:16.230> we<00:04:16.410> can<00:04:16.560> actually<00:04:16.770> go<00:04:17.220> into<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:18.060> training

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
so we can actually go into the training

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.530 
so we can actually go into the training
center<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.260> take<00:04:19.440> a<00:04:19.470> look<00:04:19.770> at<00:04:20.010> his<00:04:20.670> battling

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
center and take a look at his battling

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.950 
center and take a look at his battling
skills<00:04:21.780> and<00:04:22.260> I<00:04:22.980> think<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:24.030> dragon<00:04:24.510> is<00:04:24.660> going

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
skills and I think the dragon is going

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.260 
skills and I think the dragon is going
to<00:04:25.050> have<00:04:25.200> one<00:04:25.530> of<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.830> most<00:04:26.280> unique<00:04:26.669> battle

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
to have one of the most unique battle

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.350 
to have one of the most unique battle
skills<00:04:27.449> because<00:04:28.400> he's<00:04:29.400> already<00:04:29.580> really<00:04:30.000> fun

skills because he's already really fun
in<00:04:30.599> my<00:04:30.870> opinion<00:04:31.289> he's<00:04:31.800> probably<00:04:32.039> one<00:04:32.370> of<00:04:32.400> the

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520
