00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 So world six honestly believe 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.779
 I do not mean that the game from 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.820
 Difficulty here again 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.320
 neat increase will bring out there 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.580
 the type of not I have on the 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.580
 strike still pressed 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.980
 but maybe here on the wall 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.529
 That 's not the easier way 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.960
 can not be serious 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:39.030
 You did not die now , it was said 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:45.000
 fucking circles here we have the gold 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:47.129
 Anoki result let me find it 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.850
 just bad game is the first 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.050
 simplest example of this pop there 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.300
 when it comes to the hardest or most difficult 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.039
 I honestly do not believe that 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.960
 the game of difficulty 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.960
 will increase again so neat 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:22.310
 welcome to let's play super-mario 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:26.530
 peace forest no one may however 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:29.360
 touch anything because then it will break down 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.140
 I think I changed something there 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.030
 Out on the jerk does not have it now 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:42.470
 so it goes a bit up 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:44.869
 With webcrypt this is the way to go 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.030
 end and therefore second death 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.130
 100 seconds around the fire brothers 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.410
 defeat 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.780
 he killed his friend idiot 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:57.229
 Thanks for your help 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.920
 sunburn on the tropic beach there I am 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.920
 very hot 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:15.890
 no, stupid that maybe 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:18.550
 shit lucy made that was a death like 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.550
 he is in the book 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:29.810
 maybe the power part where you are 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.320
 stupid as bread 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.320
 No 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:56.580
 why that can not be true 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.580
 you need two bottles of suicide 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.280
 I have even missed that often 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.280
 offer them with the golden turn key 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.030
 but I will not take it guaranteed 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.349
 I mean I had a child as well 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.840
 carnivorous plant somehow 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:32.019
 I had to think and I have them 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:38.860
 Astrid is not so loved 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:49.750
 have done extremely hurt from the needs and 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:51.819
 again Euro-rescue, rescue the flower 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.950
 providers who are used to it 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:04:00.400
 below what comes in but in this way 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:01.480
 and he does not say the day I say 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:09.430
 know more about it 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:12.519
 well , and indeed the second oh so it 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.660
 So far, I've been up there 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.440
 But I 'm not me 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.609
 want to introduce 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.180
 but actually that was a star for 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:21.729
 The hammer guy in Bowser's castle 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.610
 in the lava you can make the final who is 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:31.270
 mario schmidt is even better 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:35.340
 I have to chance for a no no 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:45.940
 but it takes up the trapezoidal to overlap 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:48.460
 start it can break it no yes 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:53.920
 Did you know what happens when you aim at dust? 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:55.630
 no, but how evil is this 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.280
 your serious I am right now 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:03.460
 why did he roll? 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:07.120
 Swiss railway spokesman spoke what is 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.950
 I'll be standing on the spot 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.460
 just recently an age just has to be 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:23.140
 not because that brings what 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:29.710
 He said emphatically that you are not 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:32.130
 yu do not do anything to me yes that was good that was 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.130
 bad 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.800
 just come by and o 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.520
