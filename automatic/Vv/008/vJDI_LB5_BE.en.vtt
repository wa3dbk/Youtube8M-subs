dies<00:01:08.780> for<00:01:09.020> two<00:01:09.170> shots<00:01:09.470> my<00:01:10.220> strategy<00:01:10.640> here<00:01:10.820> is

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
dies for two shots my strategy here is

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.969 
dies for two shots my strategy here is
just<00:01:11.119> go<00:01:11.270> after<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:11.600> middle<00:01:11.960> turrets<00:01:12.380> I<00:01:12.590> can

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
just go after the middle turrets I can

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.560 
just go after the middle turrets I can
kind<00:01:13.190> of<00:01:13.310> avoid<00:01:13.580> the<00:01:13.759> guy<00:01:13.880> at<00:01:13.940> the<00:01:14.090> top<00:01:14.299> this

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
kind of avoid the guy at the top this

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.480 
kind of avoid the guy at the top this
helps<00:01:14.810> to<00:01:14.990> save<00:01:15.170> some<00:01:15.380> time<00:01:15.409> go<00:01:16.159> at<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.340> bottom

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
helps to save some time go at the bottom

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
the gun in the middle there it's

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.100 
the gun in the middle there it's
actually<00:04:59.700> a<00:04:59.730> little<00:05:00.000> bit<00:05:00.180> higher<00:05:00.510> than<00:05:00.840> ground

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.990 
actually a little bit higher than ground
level<00:05:01.410> so<00:05:01.590> if<00:05:01.680> you<00:05:01.770> want<00:05:01.980> to<00:05:02.160> destroy<00:05:02.550> you<00:05:02.760> have

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.910 
takes four bullies or shots to get to
the<00:05:43.050> boss<00:05:43.230> stage<00:05:45.230> again<00:05:46.230> you<00:05:46.410> only<00:05:46.500> need<00:05:46.800> to

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:46.920 
the boss stage again you only need to

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.380 
the boss stage again you only need to
gather<00:05:47.070> the<00:05:47.220> three<00:05:47.490> sensors<00:05:47.880> but<00:05:48.090> I<00:05:48.120> always

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
gather the three sensors but I always

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.120 
gather the three sensors but I always
recommend<00:05:48.600> getting<00:05:49.050> rifka<00:05:49.530> done<00:05:49.680> on<00:05:49.800> the<00:05:49.920> top

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
recommend getting rifka done on the top

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:56.960 
recommend getting rifka done on the top
so<00:05:50.340> you<00:05:50.430> don't<00:05:50.460> have<00:05:50.760> to<00:05:50.910> talk<00:05:51.060> so<00:05:51.390> many

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.670 

this<00:05:57.450> boss<00:05:57.660> shoot<00:05:57.930> some<00:05:58.140> bubbles<00:05:58.320> that<00:05:58.620> are

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
this boss shoot some bubbles that are

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.590 
this boss shoot some bubbles that are
kind<00:05:58.980> of<00:05:59.040> hard<00:05:59.280> to<00:05:59.460> dodge<00:05:59.670> so<00:06:00.300> you<00:06:00.390> can<00:06:00.510> either

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
kind of hard to dodge so you can either

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.020 
kind of hard to dodge so you can either
destroy<00:06:01.110> them<00:06:01.350> or<00:06:01.620> try<00:06:01.830> to<00:06:01.860> move<00:06:02.130> around<00:06:02.280> the

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
destroy them or try to move around the

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.820 
destroy them or try to move around the
heads<00:06:03.270> are<00:06:03.420> only<00:06:03.570> vulnerable<00:06:04.260> when<00:06:04.530> they<00:06:04.620> join

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
heads are only vulnerable when they join

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.060 
heads are only vulnerable when they join
together<00:06:05.010> just<00:06:05.460> like<00:06:05.640> that<00:06:06.710> so<00:06:07.710> once<00:06:07.890> you<00:06:07.950> get

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
together just like that so once you get

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.710 
together just like that so once you get
rid<00:06:08.220> of<00:06:08.250> once<00:06:08.520> a<00:06:08.640> lot<00:06:08.760> easier<00:06:09.150> just<00:06:09.360> go<00:06:09.450> on<00:06:09.540> to

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
rid of once a lot easier just go on to

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.900 
rid of once a lot easier just go on to
the<00:06:09.840> second<00:06:10.200> one<00:06:10.290> get<00:06:11.010> some<00:06:11.190> bubbles<00:06:11.520> here<00:06:11.760> and

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
the second one get some bubbles here and

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:19.900 
the second one get some bubbles here and
there

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:19.910 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.190 

that's<00:06:20.450> on<00:06:20.600> to<00:06:20.750> stage<00:06:20.960> 5<00:06:21.230> snow<00:06:21.830> fields
