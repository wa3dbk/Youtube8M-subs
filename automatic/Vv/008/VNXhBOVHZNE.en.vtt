00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
you but basically it's the startup and

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.940 
you but basically it's the startup and
then<00:04:38.320> you<00:04:38.800> know<00:04:38.950> startup<00:04:39.820> it<00:04:40.680> you<00:04:41.680> know<00:04:41.800> it

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
then you know startup it you know it

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.760 
then you know startup it you know it
launches<00:04:42.340> whatever<00:04:42.700> is<00:04:42.880> in<00:04:43.030> it<00:04:43.180> which<00:04:44.020> we<00:04:44.530> want

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
launches whatever is in it which we want

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.520 
launches whatever is in it which we want
this<00:04:44.950> to<00:04:45.250> be<00:04:45.540> so<00:04:46.540> you<00:04:46.630> get<00:04:46.780> a<00:04:46.810> update<00:04:47.140> at

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
this to be so you get a update at

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.440 
this to be so you get a update at
Microsoft<00:04:47.980> and<00:04:48.190> they'll<00:04:48.340> start<00:04:48.760> menu

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
Microsoft and they'll start menu

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.890 
Microsoft and they'll start menu
programs<00:04:50.050> start<00:04:50.560> up<00:04:50.790> pretty<00:04:51.790> nice<00:04:52.060> and<00:04:52.300> simple

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.190 

so<00:04:55.900> then<00:04:56.890> it's<00:04:57.370> up<00:04:57.790> it's<00:04:58.690> not<00:04:58.810> really<00:04:59.050> much

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
so then it's up it's not really much

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.220 
so then it's up it's not really much

this is one of the best apps and most
useful<00:05:21.940> ones<00:05:22.330> I've<00:05:22.510> seen<00:05:22.540> because<00:05:22.810> I<00:05:23.050> like<00:05:23.350> to

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
useful ones I've seen because I like to

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.160 
useful ones I've seen because I like to
make<00:05:23.860> it<00:05:24.040> more<00:05:24.220> console<00:05:24.850> like<00:05:25.000> for<00:05:25.300> me<00:05:25.420> the

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.170 
make it more console like for me the

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.570 
make it more console like for me the
only<00:05:26.350> thing<00:05:26.530> that<00:05:26.650> can<00:05:26.770> make<00:05:26.890> it<00:05:27.040> better<00:05:27.220> is<00:05:27.400> if

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
only thing that can make it better is if

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.840 
only thing that can make it better is if
you<00:05:27.700> run<00:05:27.910> steam<00:05:28.450> with<00:05:28.810> a<00:05:28.840> big<00:05:29.500> picture<00:05:29.740> mode<00:05:30.070> so

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850 
you run steam with a big picture mode so

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.000 
you run steam with a big picture mode so
that<00:05:31.000> whenever<00:05:31.180> you<00:05:31.360> press<00:05:31.660> one<00:05:31.960> then<00:05:32.560> you

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
that whenever you press one then you

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.190 
that whenever you press one then you
know<00:05:33.190> steam<00:05:34.060> starts<00:05:34.450> up<00:05:34.600> and<00:05:34.780> then<00:05:34.900> you<00:05:35.050> could

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
know steam starts up and then you could

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.940 
know steam starts up and then you could
basically<00:05:35.560> have<00:05:36.280> everything<00:05:36.660> run<00:05:37.660> 3<00:05:38.320> 360
