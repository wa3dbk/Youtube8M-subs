the<00:00:11.330> new<00:00:11.480> shakey<00:00:12.019> snake<00:00:12.820> what<00:00:13.820> we're<00:00:13.969> doing<00:00:14.269> is

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
the new shakey snake what we're doing is

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.620 
the new shakey snake what we're doing is
we're<00:00:14.539> basically<00:00:14.870> just<00:00:15.139> taking<00:00:15.379> a<00:00:15.530> screw<00:00:15.829> lock

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
we're basically just taking a screw lock

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.720 
we're basically just taking a screw lock
weight<00:00:17.630> system<00:00:18.020> and<00:00:18.410> we're<00:00:19.160> actually<00:00:19.310> putting

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
weight system and we're actually putting

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.540 
weight system and we're actually putting
this<00:00:19.960> in<00:00:20.960> the<00:00:21.020> head<00:00:21.470> of<00:00:21.530> the<00:00:21.680> bait<00:00:21.920> and<00:00:22.160> the

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
this in the head of the bait and the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.680 
this in the head of the bait and the
reason<00:00:22.850> why<00:00:22.940> I'm<00:00:23.060> going<00:00:23.120> to<00:00:23.270> screw<00:00:23.480> it<00:00:23.570> into

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:23.690 
reason why I'm going to screw it into

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.180 
reason why I'm going to screw it into
the<00:00:23.810> head<00:00:24.050> is<00:00:24.260> what<00:00:24.740> I'm<00:00:24.830> trying<00:00:24.980> to

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.190 
the head is what I'm trying to

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.340 
the head is what I'm trying to
accomplish<00:00:25.490> is<00:00:25.940> I<00:00:26.420> want<00:00:26.600> this<00:00:26.750> head<00:00:27.080> to

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.350 
accomplish is I want this head to

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.830 
accomplish is I want this head to
actually<00:00:27.890> drag<00:00:28.220> on<00:00:28.400> the<00:00:28.490> bottom<00:00:28.850> on<00:00:29.420> this<00:00:29.630> Niko

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
actually drag on the bottom on this Niko

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.409 
actually drag on the bottom on this Niko
rig<00:00:30.170> and<00:00:30.350> have<00:00:30.500> this<00:00:30.680> tail<00:00:30.980> up<00:00:31.250> so<00:00:32.119> the<00:00:32.239> whole

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
rig and have this tail up so the whole

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.930 
rig and have this tail up so the whole
concept<00:00:32.689> is<00:00:33.260> is<00:00:33.499> is<00:00:33.679> not<00:00:33.739> to<00:00:34.399> let<00:00:34.519> this<00:00:34.699> bait

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
concept is is is not to let this bait

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.630 
concept is is is not to let this bait
basically<00:00:35.629> leave<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:36.050> bottom<00:00:36.440> you<00:00:36.949> can<00:00:37.129> lift

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
basically leave the bottom you can lift

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.459 
basically leave the bottom you can lift
it<00:00:37.760> up<00:00:37.910> a<00:00:37.999> little<00:00:38.120> bit<00:00:38.359> but<00:00:38.839> your<00:00:38.960> notice<00:00:39.260> the

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
it up a little bit but your notice the

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:41.020 
it up a little bit but your notice the
1/2<00:00:39.890> is<00:00:40.039> going<00:00:40.159> to<00:00:40.219> be<00:00:40.280> obviously<00:00:40.429> heavier

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
1/2 is going to be obviously heavier

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.880 
1/2 is going to be obviously heavier
than<00:00:41.210> the<00:00:41.300> other<00:00:41.329> and<00:00:41.659> this<00:00:42.109> is<00:00:42.170> constantly

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
than the other and this is constantly

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.049 
than the other and this is constantly
going<00:00:43.010> to<00:00:43.070> be<00:00:43.190> moving<00:00:43.550> and<00:00:43.699> that's<00:00:43.850> what's

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
going to be moving and that's what's

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:45.910 
going to be moving and that's what's
going<00:00:44.210> to<00:00:44.269> trigger<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.690> bite<00:00:44.870> so<00:00:45.260> I'm

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
going to trigger the bite so I'm

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.470 
going to trigger the bite so I'm
actually<00:00:46.039> going<00:00:46.309> to<00:00:46.370> tie<00:00:46.550> it<00:00:46.609> with<00:00:47.030> a<00:00:47.089> fiber

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
actually going to tie it with a fiber

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.049 
actually going to tie it with a fiber
weed<00:00:47.749> guard<00:00:48.050> and<00:00:48.429> that'll<00:00:49.429> allow<00:00:49.609> us<00:00:49.640> to<00:00:49.879> drag

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
weed guard and that'll allow us to drag

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.389 
weed guard and that'll allow us to drag
it<00:00:50.210> through<00:00:50.239> a<00:00:50.600> lot<00:00:50.899> of<00:00:50.929> weed<00:00:51.170> growth<00:00:51.469> now

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
it through a lot of weed growth now

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.579 
it through a lot of weed growth now
we're<00:00:52.550> just<00:00:52.670> going<00:00:52.789> to<00:00:52.819> take<00:00:52.999> our<00:00:53.179> hook<00:00:53.589> we're

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
we're just going to take our hook we're

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:55.840 
we're just going to take our hook we're
actually<00:00:54.739> going<00:00:54.949> to<00:00:55.010> slide<00:00:55.219> it<00:00:55.339> right<00:00:55.609> into

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
actually going to slide it right into

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.029 
actually going to slide it right into
that<00:00:56.030> Center<00:00:56.420> core<00:00:56.659> section<00:00:57.170> feed<00:00:57.890> it<00:00:58.010> through

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
that Center core section feed it through

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.250 
that Center core section feed it through
and<00:00:58.879> then<00:00:58.999> just<00:00:59.210> take<00:00:59.359> this<00:00:59.510> fiber<00:00:59.749> weed<00:00:59.989> yard

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
and then just take this fiber weed yard

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.169 
and then just take this fiber weed yard
you<00:01:00.949> know<00:01:00.979> the<00:01:01.219> neat<00:01:01.370> thing<00:01:01.519> about<00:01:01.609> this<00:01:01.940> rig

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:02.179 
you know the neat thing about this rig

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:03.520 
you know the neat thing about this rig
is<00:01:02.329> it<00:01:02.479> gives<00:01:02.629> you<00:01:02.780> basically<00:01:03.199> the<00:01:03.319> wacky

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
is it gives you basically the wacky

is it gives you basically the wacky
style<00:01:04.040> with<00:01:04.969> the<00:01:05.089> shaky<00:01:05.509> head<00:01:05.689> design<00:01:11.500> there's

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
style with the shaky head design there's

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.200 
style with the shaky head design there's
a<00:01:12.590> good<00:01:12.799> one

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.510 

you<00:01:16.140> know<00:01:16.230> finesse<00:01:16.590> fishing<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:17.010> probably<00:01:17.400> the

you know finesse fishing is probably the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.190 
you know finesse fishing is probably the
most<00:01:17.700> fun<00:01:18.150> way<00:01:18.300> to<00:01:18.330> fish<00:01:18.660> but<00:01:18.930> it's<00:01:19.050> also

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
most fun way to fish but it's also

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.720 
most fun way to fish but it's also
probably<00:01:19.620> one<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.890> most<00:01:20.040> productive<00:01:20.220> ways

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730

these<00:02:01.680> natural<00:02:01.890> impoundments<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:02.940> two<00:02:03.690> things

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
these natural impoundments is two things

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.920 
these natural impoundments is two things
number<00:02:04.920> one<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.430> lot<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.850> weed<00:02:06.000> growth<00:02:06.300> the

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
number one a lot of weed growth the

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.660 
number one a lot of weed growth the
other<00:02:07.050> thing<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.440> we're<00:02:07.560> constantly<00:02:07.800> fishing

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
other thing is we're constantly fishing

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.510 
other thing is we're constantly fishing
and<00:02:09.149> looking<00:02:09.660> for<00:02:09.899> those<00:02:10.110> deep<00:02:10.440> weed<00:02:10.770> edges<00:02:11.280> or

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
and looking for those deep weed edges or

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.180 
and looking for those deep weed edges or
deep<00:02:11.790> weed<00:02:12.060> lines<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.780> one<00:02:13.739> of<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.920> things

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
deep weed lines and one of the things

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.150 
deep weed lines and one of the things
that<00:02:14.610> you'll<00:02:14.760> find<00:02:14.820> is<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:16.380> we<00:02:16.800> have<00:02:17.010> to

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
that you'll find is that we have to

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.520 
that you'll find is that we have to
figure<00:02:17.459> out<00:02:17.489> our<00:02:17.940> target<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.690> look<00:02:19.260> for

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
figure out our target and look for

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.070 
figure out our target and look for
specific<00:02:20.220> spots<00:02:20.549> a<00:02:20.910> lot<00:02:21.360> of<00:02:21.480> times<00:02:21.690> it's<00:02:21.870> not<00:02:21.959> a

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
specific spots a lot of times it's not a

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.620 
specific spots a lot of times it's not a
big<00:02:22.650> flat<00:02:22.980> or<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.340> ledge<00:02:23.760> or<00:02:24.090> something<00:02:24.450> like

rocky structure a harder bottom you know
a<00:02:37.410> lot<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.650> times<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.340> can<00:02:38.489> look<00:02:39.299> at<00:02:39.450> my<00:02:39.540> lake<00:02:39.750> map

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
a lot of times I can look at my lake map

a lot of times I can look at my lake map
relate<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:42.209> contour<00:02:42.750> lines<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.410> how

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
relate to the the contour lines and how

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.620 
relate to the the contour lines and how
that<00:02:43.769> weed<00:02:43.950> line<00:02:44.160> is<00:02:44.340> going<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.549> run<00:02:44.760> if<00:02:45.209> I<00:02:45.390> see

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
that weed line is going to run if I see

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.199 
that weed line is going to run if I see
an<00:02:45.720> inside<00:02:46.170> turn<00:02:46.410> or<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:46.980> see<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.310> point<00:02:47.640> rooting

an inside turn or I see a point rooting

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.449 
an inside turn or I see a point rooting
out<00:02:48.330> I<00:02:48.570> know<00:02:48.660> that<00:02:49.080> that<00:02:49.260> weed<00:02:49.470> line<00:02:49.709> is<00:02:49.920> going

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
out I know that that weed line is going

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.280 
out I know that that weed line is going
to<00:02:50.519> come<00:02:50.760> out<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:50.940> that<00:02:51.269> point<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:51.989> lot<00:02:52.110> of

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
to come out to that point and a lot of

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.960 
to come out to that point and a lot of
times<00:02:52.470> what<00:02:52.680> I'll<00:02:52.799> find<00:02:52.950> is<00:02:53.190> harder<00:02:53.489> structure

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
times what I'll find is harder structure

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.240 
times what I'll find is harder structure
there<00:02:54.150> on<00:02:54.330> those<00:02:54.840> points<00:02:55.320> and<00:02:55.470> that's<00:02:56.040> where

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
there on those points and that's where

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.979 
there on those points and that's where
those<00:02:56.370> fish<00:02:56.519> are<00:02:56.670> going<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.880> set<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.299> weed<00:02:57.720> line

those fish are going to set a weed line

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.740 
those fish are going to set a weed line
with<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.260> little<00:02:58.560> bit<00:02:58.680> of<00:02:58.769> harder<00:02:59.070> bottom<00:02:59.480> is<00:03:00.480> a

with a little bit of harder bottom is a

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.750 
with a little bit of harder bottom is a
great<00:03:01.200> ambush<00:03:01.650> point<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:02.070> lot<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.280> times<00:03:02.400> it'll

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
great ambush point a lot of times it'll

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.350 
great ambush point a lot of times it'll
open<00:03:02.940> up<00:03:03.239> it'll<00:03:03.690> be<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:04.260> little<00:03:04.860> less<00:03:05.010> dense<00:03:05.459> and

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
open up it'll be a little less dense and

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.970 
open up it'll be a little less dense and
I'll<00:03:06.510> give<00:03:06.720> those<00:03:06.870> fish<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.200> great<00:03:07.560> ambush

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
I'll give those fish a great ambush

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.370 
I'll give those fish a great ambush
point<00:03:08.329> locations<00:03:09.329> like<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:09.930> definitely
