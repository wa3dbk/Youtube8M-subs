 Maker section of the Apple 5 channel 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.960
 x 1 in which good seen the seen and 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:21.429
 seen as last week 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:24.640
 that I have my mac came up good many 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:28.599
 requests for me to put some 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.390
 how would you put the ps3 program this 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.680
 it's worth half server that was for 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.879
 reproduce all your content 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.239
 multimedia on televisions 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.890
 smart on the smart tv is worth 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.629
 I was checking it and it's possible that 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.129
 this configuration of this program is 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.640
 a little complicated then we are 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:49.120
 looking for a program that is 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.730
 call icon &amp; it's ok to mark and 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.739
 you can find it in this url is a 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:59.129
 is a dotcom and cat application 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.620
 you will see that when you download this 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.590
 executable according or you generate that 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.880
 good to the typical dmg and one thing that yes 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.330
 I do not want you to be deceived 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.850
 when you can install is this is not going 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.100
 appear here nothing is worth it because good 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.110
 because it is a service that is 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.429
 is running appears in the part of 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.189
 system preferences if you look 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:22.270
 here you have connectors when you 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:27.490
 install is generated 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:30.039
 this little good shield short good 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.590
 It costs paper papers did not forgive a 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.270
 direct access and it's worth within 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.569
 option of system preferences here 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.610
 in there is correct it is very good what it does 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:42.490
 this good there is connect what we 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.799
 allows agreement is to publish everything 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.610
 your multimedia content in a network 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.319
 so that he by means of dlna power 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.789
 play it on your smart tv 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:54.219
 normally the same thing everyone is 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:58.539
 like a television are smrtv and it brings 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:02:00.549
 for sure this dlna support these 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.259
 acronyms you've seen them in a lot of a 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.000
 Lots of sites in a lot of gadget 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.950
 as for how can they be 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.860
 televisions 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.980
 disks network consoles including the ps4 that 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.069
 have the ps 4 the ps4 the ps3 or even 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.700
 an xbox you can play this kind of 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.519
 services through these consoles 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.500
 well as the xbox goes with a little program 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.620
 which are called media link 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.790
 and it's also a half link and there 's a 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.650
 very application 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.220
 similar they work for where the same 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.750
 OK 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.990
 it means it's good first of all if 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.330
 you hear from lma yes that you know that it is digital 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.580
 living network alliance is a way of 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.960
 protocol by which all the content 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.600
 multimedia that is in our computers 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.580
 for example here in this folder I the 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.670
 I can play on my computer how 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.110
 configure there is with it is very simple to 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.550
 that's why I've chosen you this 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.890
 application because the other one is pretty 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.270
 more cumbersome there is correct the first 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.120
 what you have to do is you have to 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.350
 achieve them as administrators of the 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.390
 system because if it is not going to leave us 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.190
 do not you see the 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.620
 candadito therefore alavesa el 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.210
 candadito means that I can in 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.060
 a given moment and retouching to do 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.250
 contain make changes to the content 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.850
 well let's go here if you look at the 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.450
 content you will see what I have 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.330
 shared 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.980
 I can share this that is here is 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.440
 what from the television from the menu 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.880
 of television is going to look good if I 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.410
 I would like to add a module that is 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.690
 imagine this folder is worth I have 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.860
 here videos in this folder and what 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.860
 I want to add is that this server 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.390
 dna relays it to me where it is broadcast 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.540
 all over the network of my house is worth then 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.120
 if I have some kind of smrtv that is 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.850
 able to reduce dlna worth I'll be able to 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.210
 see in an xbox console or if I have a 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.640
 ps3 or ps4 I'll be able to see those 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.040
 movies through this this 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.350
 application I would give you modules worth you see 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.870
 is a folder of agreement I would touch 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.120
 modules the unit more because because 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.370
 I want to add that middle folder 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.970
 desktop to this folder that has 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.970
 put a shtick 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:16.160
 Ready, okay, and let's see, we're going to forgive, 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:18.470
 down here folder we add vale the 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:23.090
 I'm looking for where this folder was 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:25.730
 on my desk, set the selection and 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.669
 automaton I want to put I can 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.290
 share it with a name for example 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.120
 for example these as a content of 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.210
 a wedding is worth then I put a wedding and 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.590
 automatically notice that here has 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.390
 created a new entry 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.980
 you will see in good options then in a 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:46.520
 given time you can change it as 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.520
 you want the name wedding pp pp pp 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.600
 by the fall of pepe would stay 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.169
 then shared from the computer 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.630
 from the television or xbox ps3 it would be 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:05:00.259
 this folder to play from is 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:03.820
 use from your software to rebound or 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:06.370
 multimedia nuance these is fine martÃ­n 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.560
 what more simple things you just know 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.940
 that the first time you see when I'm 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.370
 making retouching about this application 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.200
 about icon he must be the service 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.590
 lying down for that right now you see tell me 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:20.040
 that is raised this is my ps4 and this 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.900
 It's my television, it's worth it if I pick it up 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.300
 I was a little bit start to lift it 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.010
 on devices 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.020
 mp can make this computer like 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.090
 impacts is then valid when it starts 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.680
 recognize things things you see has already 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.230
 recognized television yes that has 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.440
 realized that ps4 takes a little bit 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.790
 more and sometimes I do not know here you do not see the ip 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.630
 because until I do not enter from the 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:46.120
 ps4 to see what service and through dlna 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.580
 there is no ip but good 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.980
 it's the same is perfectly configurable 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:54.730
 if I went to the ps4 from multimedia 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.080
 I could have access and nothing else is 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.400
 pretty easy that's why it has not 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.640
 brought this application the other 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.380
 application is a bit more cumbersome the 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.440
 of ps3 media server is a little bit more 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.560
 complex voucher 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.230
 nothing else from here you can gossip and 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.690
 such is an application worth I already have 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:16.350
 I have bought it is an application that 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:18.720
 allows us 30 days of 30 days of 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:22.050
 demo is a 30 day demo as 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:24.420
 a complete content is worth if at all 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.980
 like nothing, you know, you can take it or not 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:29.010
 you know everyone who will know very 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:30.930
 well what it does is worth then nothing else 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.570
 This is an application you already know for 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:36.630
 deploy content via line 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.920
 for your home internet and all 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.470
 those devices that 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.670
 compatible with this type of technology 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.250
 that are almost all devices 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:46.410
 modern all the content that I have 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:49.110
 in my mac on my mac it will look like 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:51.120
 through that device and to make a 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:54.569
 hard drive or be a console be a 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:57.240
 television whatever it is according to 

00:06:54.569 --> 00:07:00.180
 there is also a lot of 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.610
 of apps for iphone for ipad 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.860
 even compatible with windows be 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:07.139
 to play and you know here always what 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.030
 We say what the rod it will 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:10.860
 we teach what is everything and you 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.620
 you already have to investigate any 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.569
 ask that you have below and always and 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.370
 always keep in mind that this must 

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:19.620
 be with the button to have that wants 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.270
 say he 's up if he does not 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.220
 to be will not be visible from your 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:26.639
 response television or are or what 

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.979
 be one every time you have finished you see 

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:30.900
