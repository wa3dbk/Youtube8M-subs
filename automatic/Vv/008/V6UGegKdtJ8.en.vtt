00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.750
 as for competitors of these colliders 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.099
 with the most powerful early is not in itself 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.340
 spider ford explorer 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.940
 mazda cx-9 honda pilot volkswagen 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.349
 touareg 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.320
 some even compare with infinitive 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.539
 extreme from my practice not 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.640
 the most frequent competitors are mazda 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.410
 cx-9 ford explorer and not the call 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.210
 let's talk about them in more detail 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.609
 photo disputes with this machine have spleen what 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.119
 pluses in the first 249 horsepower 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.040
 power 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.600
 go there to the den limit at home 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.730
 taxes of about 18 thousand 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.829
 if we consider the photo from the parade he 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.070
 all motors over 220 horsepower 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.230
 let's tax more than 40 thousand rubles that 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.230
 not very nice when it comes yet 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.719
 analogue if we consider the spaces 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.060
 salon ford and disputes in length more 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.600
 the differences 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.450
 15 centimeters dimensions we run much 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.010
 larger and accordingly parking 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.500
 especially urban conditions are not the most 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.610
 comfortable but with all this 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.880
 the interior of the cabin and 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.400
 Weller's luggage compartment even higher 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.860
 there previously said Kalander total 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.660
 2300 liters is the largest volume 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:17.780
 among all the competitors with regards to yet 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.830
 I wanted to say about multimedia fact of controversy 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.510
 before there are a lot of complaints about the paint 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.740
 multimedia system earth on itself 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.140
 It does not work very well with everything 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.340
 hunting arrow 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:37.070
 gives done multimedia 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.600
 the lesson that is always used 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.450
 works enough 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.860
 reliable zeman eric they don't arise or 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.630
 concerning 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:51.500
 mazda cx-9 is also the main thing that's fine then 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.479
 which is higher tax design principle she has 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.340
 even resembles si very often 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.930
 strange rear criticism but again 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:03.770
 bones choose what costaki and 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.670
 its own salon transformation here 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.619
 very well 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.789
 not at all you look much more 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.470
 painfully and 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:13.700
 that is, in relation to a very specific 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.170
 can say the following three teams 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.010
 considered the most popular 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.930
 the machine itself in its segment that is from 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.319
 year on year was the best selling 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.850
 Again, this is even the previous reporter 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:29.690
 Now the advanced words of the new generation 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.670
 and hand power machines 150 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.519
 played a huge role and the demand for 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.400
 cars went up very much now 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:40.299
 in the queue reach for the car more 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.579
 half a year and thinking speaks for itself 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:46.190
 if you compare the specially built new 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:50.150
 which just needs to go out now 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:53.360
 the market is our main things 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.900
 first it is also the look of its 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.110
 fools 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.600
 enough 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.590
 doubtful because earlier if 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.050
 was practically 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.610
 SUVs are now drawn from it 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.830
 perfect car now it's just 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.280
 question many fans on with you to 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.060
 of this 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.700
 pushing and already starting some 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:16.230
 disagreements plus u not with me like 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.820
 It is known that the variator box also goes if 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.160
 in terms of reliability hardly 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.620
 performs six step and normal 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.010
 machine can say here young people and 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.310
 conchita network chaotic automaton for 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.380
 the fact that the variator is smooth acceleration 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.350
 works more gentle mode disappear 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.640
 this feeling powerful cars as possible 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.380
 and which can get there 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:43.320
 brought skates and because on 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:45.810
 the machine in no way is not my merit 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.010
 other cars all cars have 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.489
 I advise there 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.459
 but the advantages of highlander let's again with 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.790
 you will start this 240 very different forces 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.650
 this is a huge cabin space when 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.239
 most modest dimensions of the country by these 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.170
 The options are excellent finish and 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.250
 due to the fact that the cars are the most 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.090
 popular and 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.620
 toyota companies at reliable liquidity 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.350
 given car at the highest level 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.049
 Toyota companies for more than 10 years 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.120
 maintains its position on the Russian market 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.630
 spring liquidity secondary market 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.430
 very good nikita 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.580
 even from the car after 5 years 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.580
 operation
