question<00:00:48.620> for<00:00:48.830> us<00:00:48.920> now<00:00:49.160> is<00:00:49.460> whether<00:00:49.670> that<00:00:49.970> was

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
question for us now is whether that was

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.060 
question for us now is whether that was
the<00:00:50.210> beginning<00:00:50.450> of<00:00:50.840> something<00:00:51.080> or<00:00:51.590> the<00:00:51.650> end<00:00:51.920> of

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
the beginning of something or the end of

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.520 
the beginning of something or the end of
something<00:00:52.280> I<00:00:52.520> choose<00:00:53.210> to<00:00:53.360> believe<00:00:53.510> it<00:00:54.380> was

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
something I choose to believe it was

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.439 
something I choose to believe it was
only<00:00:54.650> to<00:00:54.860> begin

that's<00:01:14.290> what<00:01:14.470> I<00:01:14.500> want<00:01:14.710> to<00:01:14.799> do<00:01:14.920> how<00:01:15.700> did<00:01:15.850> this

idea come about for you well I'm

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:19.740 
idea come about for you well I'm
interested<00:01:18.250> in<00:01:18.490> space<00:01:18.670> for<00:01:19.030> for<00:01:19.390> a<00:01:19.420> long<00:01:19.539> time

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
interested in space for for a long time

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.800 
interested in space for for a long time
basically<00:01:20.939> from<00:01:21.939> when<00:01:22.119> I<00:01:22.149> was<00:01:22.360> in<00:01:22.420> college

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
basically from when I was in college

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.510 
basically from when I was in college
there<00:01:23.649> were<00:01:23.740> three<00:01:23.950> areas<00:01:24.130> that<00:01:24.250> I<00:01:24.310> thought

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
there were three areas that I thought

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.910 
there were three areas that I thought
would<00:01:24.640> most<00:01:24.880> affect<00:01:25.149> the<00:01:25.299> future<00:01:25.450> humanity

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
would most affect the future humanity

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.050 
would most affect the future humanity
one<00:01:26.920> was<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.159> Internet<00:01:27.490> another<00:01:27.759> one<00:01:27.909> was

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
one was the Internet another one was

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.820 
one was the Internet another one was
sustainable<00:01:28.780> energy<00:01:29.080> and<00:01:29.320> the<00:01:29.409> third<00:01:29.619> was

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
sustainable energy and the third was

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.070 
sustainable energy and the third was
space<00:01:30.159> exploration<00:01:30.789> practically<00:01:31.509> making

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
space exploration practically making

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.080 
space exploration practically making
life<00:01:32.200> multiplanetary<00:01:32.369> as<00:01:33.369> a<00:01:33.429> result<00:01:33.759> of<00:01:33.909> some

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
life multiplanetary as a result of some

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.969 
life multiplanetary as a result of some
success<00:01:34.300> I<00:01:34.539> had<00:01:34.690> in<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.869> internet<00:01:35.440> world<00:01:35.619> it

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
success I had in the internet world it

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.740 
success I had in the internet world it
gave<00:01:36.190> you<00:01:36.280> a<00:01:36.340> capital<00:01:36.729> to<00:01:36.880> start<00:01:37.479> off<00:01:37.659> the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
gave you a capital to start off the

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.180 
gave you a capital to start off the
company<00:01:38.110> which<00:01:38.259> is<00:01:38.409> obviously<00:01:38.740> a<00:01:38.830> pretty<00:01:39.069> high

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
company which is obviously a pretty high

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.950 
company which is obviously a pretty high
capital<00:01:39.520> endeavor<00:01:39.880> so<00:01:40.450> some<00:01:40.659> of<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:40.780> things

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
capital endeavor so some of the things

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.969 
capital endeavor so some of the things
you<00:01:41.049> guys<00:01:41.170> have<00:01:41.229> developed<00:01:41.470> here<00:01:41.799> would<00:01:41.920> be

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
you guys have developed here would be

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.590 
you guys have developed here would be
the<00:01:42.069> Falcon<00:01:42.250> rocket<00:01:42.580> and<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.209> Dragon

spacecraft how are these different and
better<00:01:45.880> than<00:01:46.000> what<00:01:46.209> we<00:01:46.330> had<00:01:46.450> before<00:01:46.649> compared

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
better than what we had before compared

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.169 
better than what we had before compared

not<00:01:59.770> as<00:01:59.920> much<00:02:00.069> cargo<00:02:00.369> but<00:02:00.789> now<00:02:01.209> that<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.479> space

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
not as much cargo but now that the space

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.929 
not as much cargo but now that the space
station<00:02:02.020> is<00:02:02.140> is<00:02:02.560> assembled<00:02:03.369> there's<00:02:03.640> no<00:02:03.759> need

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
station is is assembled there's no need

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.539 
station is is assembled there's no need
to<00:02:04.060> carry<00:02:04.600> Space<00:02:05.109> Station<00:02:05.439> modules<00:02:05.560> up<00:02:06.009> so<00:02:06.490> it

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
to carry Space Station modules up so it

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.520 
to carry Space Station modules up so it
represents<00:02:06.939> a<00:02:07.299> huge<00:02:07.539> cost<00:02:07.810> savings<00:02:08.140> relative

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
represents a huge cost savings relative

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.469 
represents a huge cost savings relative
to<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:08.739> shuttle<00:02:09.039> dollars<00:02:09.609> wise<00:02:09.820> you<00:02:10.149> guys<00:02:10.299> are

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
to the shuttle dollars wise you guys are

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.090 
to the shuttle dollars wise you guys are
going<00:02:10.600> to<00:02:10.660> be<00:02:10.780> looking<00:02:11.079> at<00:02:11.230> about<00:02:11.380> a<00:02:11.440> thousand

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
going to be looking at about a thousand

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.280 
going to be looking at about a thousand
dollars<00:02:12.579> per<00:02:12.880> pound<00:02:13.150> what<00:02:13.840> does<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:13.959> dollar

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
dollars per pound what does that dollar

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.009 
dollars per pound what does that dollar
figure<00:02:14.620> mean<00:02:14.799> yeah<00:02:15.609> for<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.060> long<00:02:16.180> time<00:02:16.420> people

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
figure mean yeah for a long time people

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.229 
figure mean yeah for a long time people
have<00:02:17.170> thought<00:02:17.410> of<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.760> thousand<00:02:18.760> dollars<00:02:19.030> a

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
have thought of a thousand dollars a

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.840 
have thought of a thousand dollars a
pound<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.959> orbit<00:02:19.989> has<00:02:20.380> been<00:02:20.560> kind<00:02:20.799> of<00:02:20.859> this<00:02:20.980> in

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
pound to orbit has been kind of this in

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.160 
pound to orbit has been kind of this in
the<00:02:21.970> equivalent<00:02:22.329> like<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.540> four-minute<00:02:23.019> mile

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
the equivalent like the four-minute mile

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.560 
the equivalent like the four-minute mile
gonna<00:02:23.470> say<00:02:23.650> yeah<00:02:23.829> yeah<00:02:24.670> typically<00:02:25.390> people

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
gonna say yeah yeah typically people

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.840 
gonna say yeah yeah typically people
have<00:02:25.750> thought<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:26.250> access<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.280> space<00:02:27.459> we're

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
have thought of access to space we're

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.009 
have thought of access to space we're
depending<00:02:28.150> on<00:02:28.239> where<00:02:28.450> you're<00:02:28.600> going<00:02:28.870> it's

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
depending on where you're going it's

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.539 
depending on where you're going it's
more<00:02:29.230> like<00:02:29.350> ten<00:02:29.680> thousand<00:02:30.040> dollars<00:02:30.250> pound

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
more like ten thousand dollars pound

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.729 
more like ten thousand dollars pound
with<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.150> Falcon<00:02:31.540> Heavy<00:02:31.720> rocket<00:02:32.260> that<00:02:32.560> we

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
with the Falcon Heavy rocket that we

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.370 
with the Falcon Heavy rocket that we
plan<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.160> launch<00:02:33.280> in<00:02:33.609> 2013<00:02:34.329> that<00:02:34.870> rocket<00:02:35.230> will

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
plan to launch in 2013 that rocket will

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.690 
plan to launch in 2013 that rocket will
actually<00:02:35.709> break<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.130> thousand<00:02:36.459> dollars<00:02:36.670> a

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
actually break the thousand dollars a

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.400 
actually break the thousand dollars a
pound<00:02:36.880> barrier<00:02:37.299> that'll<00:02:37.810> be<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:37.959> huge

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
pound barrier that'll be a huge

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:45.640 
pound barrier that'll be a huge
milestone<00:02:38.620> in<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.040> history<00:02:39.070> of<00:02:39.370> space

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.559 

the<00:02:46.190> holy<00:02:46.370> grail<00:02:46.610> of<00:02:46.640> rocketry<00:02:47.180> is<00:02:47.299> to<00:02:47.420> have<00:02:47.540> a

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
the holy grail of rocketry is to have a

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.899 
the holy grail of rocketry is to have a
rapid<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:48.680> completely<00:02:49.099> reusable<00:02:49.220> rocket

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 
rapid and completely reusable rocket

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:51.850 
rapid and completely reusable rocket
system<00:02:50.209> reusability<00:02:51.110> is<00:02:51.290> incredibly

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
system reusability is incredibly

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.680 
system reusability is incredibly
important<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.549> invent<00:02:53.030> but<00:02:53.180> I<00:02:53.360> want<00:02:53.569> to<00:02:53.629> be

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
important to invent but I want to be

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:54.610 
important to invent but I want to be
precise<00:02:53.959> about<00:02:54.260> that

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
precise about that

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.220 
precise about that
what<00:02:55.069> matters<00:02:55.370> is<00:02:55.400> rapid<00:02:56.330> and<00:02:56.450> completes

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
what matters is rapid and completes

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.649 
what matters is rapid and completes
reusability<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.970> know<00:02:59.060> you<00:02:59.150> change<00:02:59.420> the

00:02:59.649 --> 00:02:59.659 
reusability you know you change the

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:01.180 
reusability you know you change the
wings<00:02:59.810> out<00:03:00.019> on<00:03:00.200> an<00:03:00.290> aircraft<00:03:00.709> in<00:03:00.920> between

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
wings out on an aircraft in between

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.770 
wings out on an aircraft in between
flight<00:03:01.430> there<00:03:01.940> are<00:03:02.000> normal<00:03:02.209> flight<00:03:02.420> you<00:03:02.629> don't

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
flight there are normal flight you don't

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.869 
flight there are normal flight you don't
expect<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.379> do<00:03:03.560> anything<00:03:03.769> except<00:03:04.159> refuel<00:03:04.730> and

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
expect to do anything except refuel and

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.670 
expect to do anything except refuel and
had<00:03:05.000> to<00:03:05.390> change<00:03:05.690> passengers<00:03:06.140> and<00:03:06.409> they'll<00:03:06.530> add

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
had to change passengers and they'll add

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.710 
had to change passengers and they'll add
more<00:03:06.920> pretzels<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:07.670> crackers<00:03:08.060> right<00:03:08.269> exactly

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
more pretzels and crackers right exactly

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.259 
more pretzels and crackers right exactly
the<00:03:09.230> snacks<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:09.739> passenger<00:03:10.129> fuel<00:03:10.640> and<00:03:10.879> if<00:03:11.180> you

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
the snacks and passenger fuel and if you

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.569 
the snacks and passenger fuel and if you
go<00:03:11.390> yeah<00:03:11.599> yeah<00:03:11.870> we<00:03:12.409> need<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.560> get<00:03:12.829> to<00:03:13.220> something

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
go yeah yeah we need to get to something

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.220 
go yeah yeah we need to get to something
like<00:03:13.670> that<00:03:13.879> for<00:03:14.120> rocketry<00:03:14.599> we've<00:03:15.140> got

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
like that for rocketry we've got

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.509 
like that for rocketry we've got
something<00:03:15.500> that<00:03:15.620> works<00:03:15.829> math<00:03:16.280> work

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
something that works math work

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.069 
something that works math work
simulation<00:03:17.030> works<00:03:17.209> yeah<00:03:17.450> but<00:03:17.750> this<00:03:17.870> is<00:03:17.989> an

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
simulation works yeah but this is an

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.569 
simulation works yeah but this is an
incredibly<00:03:18.530> difficult<00:03:18.680> thing<00:03:18.950> so<00:03:19.400> we're<00:03:19.519> not

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
incredibly difficult thing so we're not

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.640 
incredibly difficult thing so we're not
saying<00:03:19.849> definitively<00:03:20.840> we<00:03:21.079> will<00:03:21.200> achieve<00:03:21.290> it

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
saying definitively we will achieve it

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.960 
saying definitively we will achieve it
but<00:03:21.769> we<00:03:21.920> are<00:03:21.950> saying<00:03:22.280> definitively<00:03:22.430> we<00:03:22.849> will

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
but we are saying definitively we will

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.089 
but we are saying definitively we will
attempt<00:03:23.540> it<00:03:23.629> and<00:03:23.780> that<00:03:23.959> we<00:03:24.079> think<00:03:24.379> we've<00:03:25.040> got

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
attempt it and that we think we've got

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:34.750 
attempt it and that we think we've got
something<00:03:25.430> that'll<00:03:25.640> work<00:03:33.069> so<00:03:34.069> as<00:03:34.430> far<00:03:34.579> as<00:03:34.640> a

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
something that'll work so as far as a

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.069 
something that'll work so as far as a
lot<00:03:34.879> of<00:03:34.909> the<00:03:35.030> stuff<00:03:35.209> that's<00:03:35.390> around<00:03:35.510> here<00:03:35.900> you

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
lot of the stuff that's around here you

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.199 
lot of the stuff that's around here you
guys<00:03:36.170> manufacture<00:03:36.829> a<00:03:37.069> majority<00:03:37.670> of<00:03:37.790> it<00:03:37.909> the

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
guys manufacture a majority of it the

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.089 
guys manufacture a majority of it the
main<00:03:38.390> reason<00:03:38.720> that<00:03:38.750> we've<00:03:38.989> done<00:03:39.200> so<00:03:39.560> much<00:03:39.739> of

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
main reason that we've done so much of

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.399 
main reason that we've done so much of
the<00:03:40.549> rocket<00:03:40.879> internally<00:03:41.420> is<00:03:41.599> that<00:03:41.629> you<00:03:42.200> can't

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:42.409 
the rocket internally is that you can't

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:44.589 
the rocket internally is that you can't
really<00:03:42.560> advance<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.579> technology<00:03:44.180> if<00:03:44.480> you're

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
really advance the technology if you're

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:45.849 
really advance the technology if you're
just<00:03:44.750> using<00:03:45.049> the<00:03:45.140> same<00:03:45.319> bits<00:03:45.560> and<00:03:45.709> pieces

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
just using the same bits and pieces

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.619 
just using the same bits and pieces
everybody<00:03:46.340> else's<00:03:46.700> well<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:47.120> other<00:03:47.269> Rockets

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
everybody else's well the other Rockets

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.420 
everybody else's well the other Rockets
were<00:03:47.810> designed<00:03:48.140> in<00:03:48.260> the<00:03:48.319> 90s<00:03:48.650> 80s<00:03:48.890> or<00:03:49.220> the

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
were designed in the 90s 80s or the

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.460 
were designed in the 90s 80s or the

I<00:05:02.850> mean<00:05:03.120> that's<00:05:03.300> sort<00:05:03.450> of<00:05:03.570> a<00:05:03.660> best-case

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
I mean that's sort of a best-case

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.140 
I mean that's sort of a best-case
scenario<00:05:04.440> but<00:05:04.980> I'd<00:05:05.070> say<00:05:05.280> worst-case<00:05:05.820> scenario

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
scenario but I'd say worst-case scenario

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.240 
scenario but I'd say worst-case scenario
would<00:05:06.270> be<00:05:06.330> 20<00:05:06.660> years<00:05:06.780> okay<00:05:07.080> are<00:05:07.530> you<00:05:07.710> first<00:05:07.950> or

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
would be 20 years okay are you first or

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.520 
would be 20 years okay are you first or
the<00:05:08.310> Russians<00:05:08.670> first<00:05:09.110> who's<00:05:10.110> getting<00:05:10.350> there

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
the Russians first who's getting there

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.930 
the Russians first who's getting there
well<00:05:11.040> it's<00:05:11.160> definitely<00:05:11.340> not<00:05:11.460> the<00:05:11.580> Russian

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
well it's definitely not the Russian

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.760 
well it's definitely not the Russian
Russians<00:05:12.570> aren't<00:05:12.720> really<00:05:13.020> even<00:05:13.260> trying

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
Russians aren't really even trying

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.860 
Russians aren't really even trying
the<00:05:14.370> Russians<00:05:14.700> really<00:05:14.850> have<00:05:15.180> not<00:05:15.360> developed<00:05:15.600> a

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
the Russians really have not developed a

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.450 
the Russians really have not developed a
new<00:05:16.020> rocket<00:05:16.290> since<00:05:16.710> the<00:05:16.890> fall<00:05:17.070> of<00:05:17.100> the<00:05:17.250> Soviet

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
new rocket since the fall of the Soviet

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.340 
new rocket since the fall of the Soviet
Union<00:05:17.730> as<00:05:18.120> possible<00:05:18.540> if<00:05:18.660> China<00:05:18.990> wolff<00:05:19.260> with

China's making good progress and from a

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
SpaceX standpoint long term we sort of

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.890 
SpaceX standpoint long term we sort of
see<00:05:23.310> China<00:05:23.640> as<00:05:23.790> our<00:05:24.240> only<00:05:24.390> potential

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
see China as our only potential

couldn't come up with the stuff that

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.640 
couldn't come up with the stuff that
