around the console and the movies all
that<00:00:48.809> stuff<00:00:49.050> I'm<00:00:49.350> pretty<00:00:49.829> sure<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.579> more

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
that stuff I'm pretty sure this more

that stuff I'm pretty sure this more
than<00:00:51.210> likely<00:00:51.390> confirms<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.110> fact<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.379> venom

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
than likely confirms the fact that venom

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.670 
than likely confirms the fact that venom
is<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.100> actual<00:00:53.280> game<00:00:53.930> if<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.170> doesn't<00:00:55.559> I

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
is in the actual game if it doesn't I

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.090 
is in the actual game if it doesn't I
really<00:00:56.219> don't<00:00:56.399> know<00:00:56.550> what<00:00:56.789> does<00:00:57.379> if<00:00:58.379> I'm<00:00:58.859> wrong

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.030 
I said this practically does confirm
that<00:01:42.780> venom<00:01:43.020> will<00:01:43.259> be<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.649> console

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
that venom will be in the console

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.219 
that venom will be in the console
version<00:01:44.430> if<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:45.149> doesn't<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.630> am<00:01:45.869> going<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.170> be

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
version if it doesn't I am going to be

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.889 
version if it doesn't I am going to be
incredibly<00:01:47.040> surprised<00:01:47.579> but<00:01:48.329> what<00:01:48.750> do<00:01:48.810> you

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
incredibly surprised but what do you

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.810 
incredibly surprised but what do you
think<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.350> Venom's<00:01:49.770> design<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.490> mobile

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
think of Venom's design in the mobile

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.010 
think of Venom's design in the mobile
game<00:01:51.060> do<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.270> think<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.630> console

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
game do you think that the console

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.139 
game do you think that the console
version<00:01:52.320> will<00:01:52.860> be<00:01:52.979> anything<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:53.850> or

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
version will be anything like this or

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.749 
version will be anything like this or
better<00:01:54.619> for<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.680> most<00:01:55.829> part<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.189> really<00:01:56.369> enjoy

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
better for the most part I really enjoy

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.219 
better for the most part I really enjoy
it<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.060> know<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.299> webbing<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.810> kind<00:01:58.170> of

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
it I know the webbing is kind of

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.100 
it I know the webbing is kind of
annoying<00:01:58.590> but<00:01:59.399> at<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.549> same<00:01:59.729> time<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.659> kind<00:02:01.049> of

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
annoying but at the same time it kind of

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.600 
annoying but at the same time it kind of
adds<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.740> fact<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.100> it's<00:02:02.250> its<00:02:02.399> own

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
adds to the fact that it's its own

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.850 
adds to the fact that it's its own
unique<00:02:03.210> design<00:02:03.390> rather<00:02:03.930> than<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.409> going<00:02:04.590> off

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
unique design rather than just going off

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.789 
unique design rather than just going off
comic<00:02:05.640> books<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.180> which<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.290> should<00:02:07.590> it

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
comic books and which it should it

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.919 
comic books and which it should it
should<00:02:07.829> base<00:02:08.190> itself<00:02:08.640> off<00:02:08.789> comic<00:02:09.119> books<00:02:09.330> but

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
should base itself off comic books but

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.690 
should base itself off comic books but
have<00:02:10.259> its<00:02:10.440> own<00:02:10.560> spin<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.280> think<00:02:11.520> that's

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
have its own spin to it I think that's

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.520 
have its own spin to it I think that's
that's<00:02:12.150> respectable<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:13.050> that

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
that's respectable and that

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.199 
that's respectable and that
kind<00:02:13.770> of<00:02:13.830> what<00:02:13.980> movies<00:02:14.280> do<00:02:14.400> anyways<00:02:14.760> nowadays

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
kind of what movies do anyways nowadays

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.230 
kind of what movies do anyways nowadays
right<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:16.050> why<00:02:16.319> not<00:02:16.470> Games<00:02:16.790> venom<00:02:17.790> looks<00:02:17.940> great

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
right so why not Games venom looks great

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.780
