Jamie can we do it of course we can
yeah<00:00:18.119> I've<00:00:18.210> got<00:00:18.240> no<00:00:18.480> doubt<00:00:18.510> so<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:18.930> mean<00:00:19.170> if<00:00:19.560> you

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
yeah I've got no doubt so I mean if you

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.140 
yeah I've got no doubt so I mean if you
look<00:00:19.830> at<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.039> German<00:00:20.400> side<00:00:20.609> compared<00:00:21.119> to

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
look at the German side compared to

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.750 
look at the German side compared to
England<00:00:21.570> player<00:00:22.260> for<00:00:22.529> player<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:23.039> don't<00:00:23.640> think

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
England player for player I don't think

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.679 
England player for player I don't think
there's<00:00:23.880> too<00:00:24.000> much<00:00:24.119> difference<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.600> it

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
there's too much difference and it

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.570 
there's too much difference and it
seemed<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.990> little<00:00:25.080> amiss<00:00:25.350> when<00:00:25.920> Steiger<00:00:26.400> might

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
seemed a little amiss when Steiger might

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.670 
seemed a little amiss when Steiger might
have<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.699> bit<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.939> hamstring<00:00:27.330> injury<00:00:27.680> that

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
have a bit of a hamstring injury that

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.679 
have a bit of a hamstring injury that
the<00:00:28.859> player<00:00:29.070> I'm<00:00:29.369> obviously<00:00:29.760> very<00:00:30.029> wary<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.539> is

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
the player I'm obviously very wary of is

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.659 
the player I'm obviously very wary of is
Oziel<00:00:31.170> scored<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.560> goal<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.920> got<00:00:32.550> another

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
Oziel scored the goal that got another

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.150 
Oziel scored the goal that got another
against<00:00:33.120> Ghana<00:00:33.450> got<00:00:33.630> tremendous<00:00:34.320> left<00:00:34.950> foot

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
against Ghana got tremendous left foot

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.590 
against Ghana got tremendous left foot
is<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.550> probably<00:00:35.760> start<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.210> tournament

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
is that the probably start of tournament

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.869 
is that the probably start of tournament
so<00:00:36.750> far<00:00:36.780> alongside<00:00:37.230> Messi<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.950> think<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.670> he's

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
so far alongside Messi I think that he's

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.540 
so far alongside Messi I think that he's
gonna<00:00:39.059> be<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.500> real<00:00:40.500> player<00:00:40.739> we<00:00:40.829> have<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.160> sort

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
gonna be a real player we have to sort

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.069 
gonna be a real player we have to sort
of<00:00:41.579> lock<00:00:41.790> down<00:00:42.059> stop<00:00:42.450> him<00:00:42.600> dictate<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
of lock down stop him dictate in the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.869 
of lock down stop him dictate in the
game<00:00:43.320> but<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.190> look<00:00:44.370> at<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.520> know<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.670> look<00:00:44.789> at

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
game but I look at you know I look at

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.729 
game but I look at you know I look at
the<00:00:44.940> price<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.329> where<00:00:45.450> England<00:00:45.750> 64<00:00:46.289> yeah

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
the price of it where England 64 yeah

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.979 
the price of it where England 64 yeah
Germany<00:00:47.280> 74<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:47.969> think<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.840> will

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
Germany 74 I think that that will

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.150 
Germany 74 I think that that will
probably<00:00:49.260> be<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.350> fair<00:00:49.590> reflection<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:50.070> this

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
probably be a fair reflection of this

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.799 
probably be a fair reflection of this
game<00:00:50.370> because<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:50.940> pretty<00:00:51.270> much<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.480> pick

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
game because it is pretty much a pick

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.990 
game because it is pretty much a pick
and<00:00:52.020> match<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.980> chances<00:00:53.430> are<00:00:53.579> could<00:00:53.850> see

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
and match and the chances are could see

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.479 
and match and the chances are could see
a<00:00:54.030> draw<00:00:54.719> at<00:00:54.870> full<00:00:55.050> time<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.530> even<00:00:56.250> got<00:00:56.399> no

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
a draw at full time and even got no

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.639 
a draw at full time and even got no
penalties<00:00:56.879> again<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.180> really<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.500> have

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
penalties again I really can I just have

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.930 
penalties again I really can I just have
a<00:00:58.680> look<00:00:58.829> at<00:00:58.890> max<00:00:59.070> prices<00:00:59.489> there<00:00:59.609> Jamie

to<00:01:03.449> 2<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.840> draw<00:01:04.110> 7<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.040> 4<00:01:05.309> for<00:01:05.519> Germany<00:01:05.850> now

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
let's not forget this is the 90 minutes

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.590 
let's not forget this is the 90 minutes

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
betting so there's a big difference

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.510 
betting so there's a big difference
obviously<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> draw<00:01:10.710> still<00:01:11.010> comes<00:01:11.250> into<00:01:11.460> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
obviously the draw still comes into the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.100 
obviously the draw still comes into the
equation<00:01:11.610> but<00:01:12.299> it's<00:01:12.450> who's<00:01:12.600> gonna<00:01:12.810> qualify

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
to play the same defensive partnership

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.600 
to play the same defensive partnership
the<00:01:37.409> first<00:01:37.650> game<00:01:37.890> we<00:01:37.979> worked<00:01:38.130> with<00:01:38.250> King<00:01:38.460> and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
the first game we worked with King and

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.370 
the first game we worked with King and
Thierry<00:01:38.850> anyone<00:01:39.570> with<00:01:39.720> Carragher<00:01:40.140> Thierry

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
Thierry anyone with Carragher Thierry

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.050 
Thierry anyone with Carragher Thierry
for<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.619> second<00:01:40.950> game<00:01:41.040> against<00:01:41.310> Algeria<00:01:41.700> and

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
for the second game against Algeria and

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.120 
for the second game against Algeria and
in<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.659> lot<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.170> last<00:01:43.380> game<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:43.710> had<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.979> go

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
in a lot and the last game we had to go

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.609 
in a lot and the last game we had to go
with<00:01:44.340> at<00:01:44.640> Arian<00:01:45.030> Upson<00:01:45.420> against<00:01:46.079> Slovenia<00:01:46.380> so

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
with at Arian Upson against Slovenia so

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.679 
with at Arian Upson against Slovenia so
it<00:01:46.740> has<00:01:46.950> been<00:01:47.189> difficult<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.880> think<00:01:48.450> we<00:01:48.540> need

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
it has been difficult I think we need

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.359 
it has been difficult I think we need
continuity<00:01:48.960> now<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.530> think<00:01:49.590> his<00:01:49.860> turret<00:01:50.250> got

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
continuity now I think his turret got

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.710 
continuity now I think his turret got
ripped<00:01:50.610> literally<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.090> we've<00:01:51.240> got<00:01:51.329> our<00:01:51.450> number

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
ripped literally so we've got our number

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.240 
ripped literally so we've got our number
one<00:01:51.899> we<00:01:52.110> know<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.439> which<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.710> also<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:53.040> big

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
one we know that which is also a big

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.469 
one we know that which is also a big
help<00:01:53.460> David<00:01:53.759> Jones<00:01:53.939> has<00:01:54.090> performed

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
help David Jones has performed

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.730 
help David Jones has performed
brilliantly<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.140> two<00:01:55.320> games

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
brilliantly in the two games

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.830 
brilliantly in the two games
David<00:01:56.189> James<00:01:56.399> will<00:01:56.579> start<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.090> would<00:01:57.570> stick

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
David James will start I would stick

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.870 
David James will start I would stick
with<00:01:57.869> upstanding<00:01:58.439> captain<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.460> Terry<00:01:59.670> I

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
with upstanding captain and Terry I

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.370 
with upstanding captain and Terry I
think<00:02:00.360> we<00:02:00.450> played<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.750> last<00:02:00.899> game<00:02:01.079> you've<00:02:01.350> got

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
think we played the last game you've got

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.940 
think we played the last game you've got
in<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.590> win

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
in the win

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.830 
in the win
I<00:02:01.979> think<00:02:02.490> they<00:02:02.549> need<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.000> boost<00:02:03.240> now<00:02:03.540> because

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
I think they need that boost now because

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.749 
I think they need that boost now because
you<00:02:03.930> take<00:02:04.200> ups<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.740> out<00:02:04.860> or<00:02:05.040> if<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.219> take<00:02:05.399> for

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
you take ups and out or if you take for

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.249 
you take ups and out or if you take for
instance<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.479> made<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.750> foul<00:02:06.930> out<00:02:07.049> it'll<00:02:07.200> be

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
instance you made the foul out it'll be

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.380 
instance you made the foul out it'll be
a<00:02:07.320> real<00:02:07.560> real<00:02:08.129> blow<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.429> him<00:02:08.729> give<00:02:09.179> them<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
a real real blow to him give them the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.460 
a real real blow to him give them the
game<00:02:09.599> now<00:02:09.780> they've<00:02:09.959> got<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.110> little<00:02:10.289> bit<00:02:10.410> of

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
game now they've got a little bit of

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.229 
game now they've got a little bit of
confidence<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.400> team<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.819> think<00:02:12.060> there's

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
confidence and that team I think there's

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.370 
confidence and that team I think there's
another<00:02:12.629> game<00:02:12.870> when

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
another game when

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.230 
another game when
at<00:02:13.470> Wayne<00:02:13.680> Rooney<00:02:14.100> weed<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.580> still<00:02:14.970> on<00:02:15.120> the

at Wayne Rooney weed is still on the

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.850 
at Wayne Rooney weed is still on the
edge<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.570> things<00:02:15.720> isn't<00:02:16.080> he<00:02:16.170> still<00:02:16.470> not<00:02:16.650> really

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
edge of things isn't he still not really

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.290

bouncing<00:02:17.460> yet<00:02:17.640> no<00:02:17.850> you're<00:02:18.030> right<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.210> think

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
bouncing yet no you're right I think

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.370 
bouncing yet no you're right I think
that's<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.540> good<00:02:18.690> description<00:02:18.870> he's<00:02:19.200> not

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
that's a good description he's not

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.050 
that's a good description he's not
bouncing<00:02:19.830> yet<00:02:20.010> he's<00:02:20.130> really<00:02:20.520> struggled<00:02:20.910> since

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
bouncing yet he's really struggled since

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.580 
bouncing yet he's really struggled since
the<00:02:21.240> Bayern<00:02:21.540> Munich<00:02:21.900> game<00:02:22.050> when<00:02:22.200> he<00:02:22.290> scored

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
the Bayern Munich game when he scored

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.310 
the Bayern Munich game when he scored
against<00:02:22.920> them<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:23.220> mean<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.760> was<00:02:23.850> 85<00:02:24.420> 86<00:02:24.810> days<00:02:25.020> ago

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
against them I mean I was 85 86 days ago

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.590 
against them I mean I was 85 86 days ago
something<00:02:25.560> at<00:02:25.740> 87<00:02:26.190> days<00:02:26.310> ago<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:27.270> seemed<00:02:27.510> a

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
something at 87 days ago it seemed a

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.210 
something at 87 days ago it seemed a
long<00:02:27.810> time<00:02:28.080> ago<00:02:28.320> that<00:02:28.440> he<00:02:28.530> was<00:02:28.650> absolutely

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
long time ago that he was absolutely

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.640 
long time ago that he was absolutely
flying<00:02:29.700> in<00:02:29.880> everything<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.810> he<00:02:30.960> did<00:02:31.170> turn<00:02:31.440> to

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
flying in everything that he did turn to

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.990 
flying in everything that he did turn to
go<00:02:31.800> I<00:02:31.830> remember<00:02:32.040> him<00:02:32.280> wearing<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.610> gloves<00:02:32.850> all

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
go I remember him wearing the gloves all

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.210 
go I remember him wearing the gloves all
the<00:02:33.030> time<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.330> think<00:02:33.600> it<00:02:33.660> gloves<00:02:33.930> back<00:02:34.140> on<00:02:34.290> get

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
the time I think it gloves back on get

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.380 
the time I think it gloves back on get
the<00:02:35.310> gloves<00:02:35.520> back<00:02:35.760> on<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:36.060> could<00:02:36.210> be<00:02:36.300> the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
the gloves back on that could be the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.730 
the gloves back on that could be the
difference<00:02:36.720> because<00:02:36.990> well<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.260> had<00:02:37.380> those<00:02:37.500> on

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
difference because well you had those on

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.320 
difference because well you had those on
he<00:02:37.830> can't<00:02:38.040> stop<00:02:38.190> scoring<00:02:38.640> but<00:02:38.880> we've<00:02:39.030> just<00:02:39.060> got

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
he can't stop scoring but we've just got

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.210 
he can't stop scoring but we've just got
to<00:02:39.420> make<00:02:39.570> sure<00:02:39.630> that<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.200> confidence<00:02:40.950> now

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
to make sure that the confidence now

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.440 
to make sure that the confidence now
will<00:02:41.430> flow<00:02:41.760> out<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:42.060> know<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.180> should<00:02:42.420> really

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
will flow out you know I should really

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.320 
will flow out you know I should really
be<00:02:42.810> oozing<00:02:43.620> out<00:02:44.070> of<00:02:44.220> us<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.580> we<00:02:44.700> have<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:44.940> belief

we went through on penalties the

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.120 
we went through on penalties the
confidence<00:04:51.440> that<00:04:51.500> would<00:04:51.680> give<00:04:51.830> us<00:04:51.920> for<00:04:52.070> the

confidence that would give us for the
next<00:04:52.370> one<00:04:52.520> because<00:04:52.880> it's<00:04:53.060> we<00:04:53.720> need<00:04:53.930> to<00:04:54.080> almost

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
next one because it's we need to almost

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.810 
next one because it's we need to almost
get<00:04:54.590> that<00:04:54.740> monkey<00:04:54.950> off<00:04:55.130> our<00:04:55.310> back<00:04:55.520> because

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.220 
get that monkey off our back because
it's<00:04:56.000> been<00:04:56.150> too<00:04:56.390> long<00:04:56.420> going<00:04:56.930> out<00:04:57.140> and

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
it's been too long going out and

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.960 
it's been too long going out and
penalties<00:04:57.530> ever<00:04:57.710> eternam<00:04:58.280> every<00:04:58.790> major

penalties ever eternam every major
tournament<00:04:59.510> it<00:04:59.570> hurts<00:05:00.050> too<00:05:00.290> much<00:05:00.320> I<00:05:00.470> think<00:05:00.710> the

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
tournament it hurts too much I think the

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.190 
tournament it hurts too much I think the
nation<00:05:01.250> can<00:05:01.550> take<00:05:01.760> it<00:05:01.970> yeah<00:05:02.390> I'm<00:05:02.690> afraid<00:05:02.960> I've

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
nation can take it yeah I'm afraid I've

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.320 
nation can take it yeah I'm afraid I've
seen<00:05:03.410> our<00:05:03.560> penalty<00:05:03.830> record<00:05:04.400> I<00:05:04.550> think<00:05:04.610> it's<00:05:04.970> six

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
seen our penalty record I think it's six

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.380 
seen our penalty record I think it's six

game<00:05:24.590> and<00:05:24.650> the<00:05:24.890> one<00:05:25.040> thing<00:05:25.250> before<00:05:25.430> we<00:05:25.730> go<00:05:25.910> I

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
game and the one thing before we go I

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.420 
game and the one thing before we go I
must<00:05:26.180> ask<00:05:26.420> Jamie<00:05:26.810> one<00:05:27.410> bit<00:05:27.710> what<00:05:28.070> would<00:05:28.250> your

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
must ask Jamie one bit what would your

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.150 
must ask Jamie one bit what would your
one<00:05:28.700> bit<00:05:28.970> beyond<00:05:29.300> the<00:05:29.420> game<00:05:29.600> I<00:05:29.810> would<00:05:30.680> go<00:05:30.860> draw

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
one bit beyond the game I would go draw

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.980 
one bit beyond the game I would go draw
okay<00:05:31.790> I<00:05:31.820> will<00:05:32.120> go<00:05:32.210> to<00:05:32.390> or<00:05:32.510> not<00:05:32.630> being<00:05:32.810> negative

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
okay I will go to or not being negative

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.630 
okay I will go to or not being negative
I<00:05:33.290> just<00:05:33.500> think<00:05:33.650> it's<00:05:33.740> gonna<00:05:33.830> be<00:05:33.980> such<00:05:34.250> a<00:05:34.280> cagey

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
I just think it's gonna be such a cagey

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.570 
I just think it's gonna be such a cagey
game<00:05:34.970> I<00:05:35.150> think<00:05:35.840> because<00:05:36.140> people<00:05:36.350> we<00:05:37.250> were<00:05:37.370> all

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
game I think because people we were all

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.010 
game I think because people we were all
waxing<00:05:38.090> lyrical<00:05:38.450> back<00:05:38.570> journey<00:05:38.810> but<00:05:38.990> I

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
waxing lyrical back journey but I

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.570 
waxing lyrical back journey but I
remember<00:05:39.290> saying<00:05:39.470> to<00:05:39.590> doubt<00:05:39.950> don't<00:05:40.280> take<00:05:40.490> the

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
remember saying to doubt don't take the

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.190 
remember saying to doubt don't take the
Australia<00:05:41.000> game<00:05:41.150> that<00:05:41.330> was<00:05:41.720> it<00:05:41.870> I<00:05:41.930> think<00:05:42.110> it

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
Australia game that was it I think it

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.990 
Australia game that was it I think it
was<00:05:42.260> a<00:05:42.320> one-off<00:05:42.560> game<00:05:42.920> well<00:05:43.460> not<00:05:43.610> too<00:05:43.790> sure

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
was a one-off game well not too sure

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.520 
was a one-off game well not too sure
about<00:05:44.120> them<00:05:44.390> I<00:05:44.450> think<00:05:44.510> it<00:05:44.690> looked<00:05:44.840> good<00:05:45.020> but

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
about them I think it looked good but

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:46.750 
about them I think it looked good but
they<00:05:45.620> still<00:05:45.830> have<00:05:45.920> their<00:05:46.040> problems<00:05:46.310> they're

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
they still have their problems they're

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.000 
they still have their problems they're
frail<00:05:47.000> at<00:05:47.180> the<00:05:47.240> back<00:05:47.450> but<00:05:48.020> I<00:05:48.110> think<00:05:48.140> that<00:05:48.470> we're

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
frail at the back but I think that we're

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.130 
frail at the back but I think that we're
it<00:05:49.460> will<00:05:49.580> be<00:05:49.670> a<00:05:49.700> really<00:05:50.090> edgy<00:05:50.300> game<00:05:50.720> I<00:05:50.930> think

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:51.140 
it will be a really edgy game I think

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.110 
it will be a really edgy game I think
five<00:05:51.350> to<00:05:51.530> two<00:05:51.710> to<00:05:51.860> draw<00:05:52.130> and<00:05:52.370> then<00:05:52.850> maybe

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
five to two to draw and then maybe

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.880 
five to two to draw and then maybe
you're<00:05:53.390> either<00:05:53.600> a<00:05:53.780> winner<00:05:54.050> and<00:05:54.290> in<00:05:54.440> extra<00:05:54.860> time

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
you're either a winner and in extra time

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.970 
you're either a winner and in extra time
or<00:05:56.080> penalties<00:05:57.080> at<00:05:57.230> the<00:05:57.320> end<00:05:57.440> of<00:05:57.530> it<00:05:57.620> but<00:05:57.680> I<00:05:57.740> just

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980 
or penalties at the end of it but I just

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.390 
or penalties at the end of it but I just
I<00:05:58.100> don't

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
I don't

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.860 
I don't
it's<00:05:58.730> very<00:05:58.910> difficult<00:05:59.210> to<00:05:59.360> separate<00:05:59.690> by<00:05:59.810> the

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
it's very difficult to separate by the

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.060 
it's very difficult to separate by the
