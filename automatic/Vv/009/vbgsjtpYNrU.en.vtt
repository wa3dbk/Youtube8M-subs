flight simulator versions the water

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.209 
flight simulator versions the water
especially<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.469> absolutely<00:00:34.469> beautiful<00:00:34.739> when

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
especially is absolutely beautiful when

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.680 
especially is absolutely beautiful when
you're<00:00:35.340> flying<00:00:35.579> in<00:00:35.819> the<00:00:35.909> Caribbean<00:00:36.449> and

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
you're flying in the Caribbean and

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.529 
you're flying in the Caribbean and
you'll<00:00:37.679> notice<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.219> flaps<00:00:38.489> are<00:00:38.730> down<00:00:38.940> we've

00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:39.539 
you'll notice the flaps are down we've

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.779 
you'll notice the flaps are down we've
begun<00:00:39.809> our<00:00:39.870> takeoff<00:00:40.409> roll<00:00:40.710> one<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.729> the

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:41.789 
begun our takeoff roll one of the

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:43.849 
begun our takeoff roll one of the
challenges<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.539> taking<00:00:42.899> off<00:00:43.019> in<00:00:43.229> this<00:00:43.350> airport

00:00:43.849 --> 00:00:43.859 
challenges of taking off in this airport

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:45.860 
challenges of taking off in this airport
is<00:00:43.979> that<00:00:44.219> there<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.640> mountain<00:00:45.089> near<00:00:45.569> the<00:00:45.719> end

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
is that there is a mountain near the end

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.540 
is that there is a mountain near the end
of<00:00:46.019> the<00:00:46.140> runway<00:00:46.350> there<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.829> some<00:00:47.100> water<00:00:47.339> in

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
of the runway there is some water in

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.459 
of the runway there is some water in
between<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.659> not<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.839> difficult<00:00:49.229> to

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
between it it's not that difficult to

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.590 
between it it's not that difficult to
clear<00:00:49.800> but<00:00:50.159> you<00:00:50.429> do<00:00:50.699> have<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.179> aware<00:00:51.539> that

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
clear but you do have to be aware that

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.959 
clear but you do have to be aware that
it<00:00:51.929> is<00:00:51.989> there<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.190> do<00:00:53.399> need<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.639> have<00:00:53.940> a

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
it is there and you do need to have a

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.770 
it is there and you do need to have a
decent<00:00:54.350> ascent<00:00:55.350> angle<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:55.949> order<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.280> clear<00:00:56.519> it

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.410 

as<00:00:59.199> we<00:00:59.559> continue<00:01:00.219> our<00:01:00.370> takeoff<00:01:00.820> roll<00:01:01.149> we're

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
as we continue our takeoff roll we're

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.500 
as we continue our takeoff roll we're
about<00:01:01.690> and<00:01:01.930> takeoff<00:01:02.320> speed<00:01:02.530> here<00:01:02.980> we<00:01:03.100> go<00:01:03.510> we're

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
about and takeoff speed here we go we're

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.780 
about and takeoff speed here we go we're
off<00:01:04.659> the<00:01:04.869> ground<00:01:05.140> the<00:01:05.440> gear<00:01:05.650> goes<00:01:05.860> up<00:01:06.190> full

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
off the ground the gear goes up full

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.050 
off the ground the gear goes up full
flaps<00:01:07.030> are<00:01:07.360> retracted<00:01:08.049> and<00:01:08.670> we're<00:01:09.670> on<00:01:09.820> our<00:01:09.850> way

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
flaps are retracted and we're on our way

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.149 
flaps are retracted and we're on our way
now<00:01:10.930> this<00:01:11.140> is<00:01:11.290> going<00:01:11.350> to<00:01:11.470> be<00:01:11.590> a<00:01:11.619> short<00:01:11.799> flight

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
now this is going to be a short flight

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.680 
now this is going to be a short flight
we're<00:01:12.490> just<00:01:12.640> going<00:01:12.820> to<00:01:12.850> clear<00:01:13.090> this<00:01:13.240> mountain

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
we're just going to clear this mountain

one<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.240> interesting<00:01:21.390> things<00:01:21.960> about

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
one of the interesting things about

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.109 
one of the interesting things about
flight<00:01:22.590> simulator<00:01:23.100> 10<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.610> actual

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
flight simulator 10 is the actual

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
add-ons that are available for it there

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.640 
add-ons that are available for it there
is<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.760> company<00:01:27.240> called<00:01:27.420> just<00:01:27.869> light<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.530> has

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
is a company called just light that has

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.130 
is a company called just light that has
created<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.280> space<00:01:29.640> shuttle<00:01:30.150> simulator<00:01:30.630> for

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
created a space shuttle simulator for

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.800 
created a space shuttle simulator for
this<00:01:31.259> game<00:01:31.700> in<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.030> can<00:01:33.060> actually<00:01:33.360> launch

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
this game in it you can actually launch

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.460 
this game in it you can actually launch
go<00:01:34.590> into<00:01:34.860> orbit<00:01:35.450> reenter<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.659> land<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.350> I've

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
go into orbit reenter and land and I've

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.700 
go into orbit reenter and land and I've
seen<00:01:37.649> some<00:01:37.710> videos<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.670> looks<00:01:39.000> really<00:01:39.240> cool

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
seen some videos of it looks really cool

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.889 
seen some videos of it looks really cool
so<00:01:40.710> we're<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.190> our<00:01:41.220> ascent<00:01:42.210> phase<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
so we're on our ascent phase of the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.899 
so we're on our ascent phase of the
flight<00:01:42.930> as<00:01:43.440> you<00:01:44.159> can<00:01:44.280> see<00:01:44.430> we've<00:01:44.670> gained

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
flight as you can see we've gained

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.690 
flight as you can see we've gained
enough<00:01:45.210> altitude<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.780> clear<00:01:46.080> that<00:01:46.290> mountain

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.290 

we're<00:01:49.880> beginning<00:01:50.030> our<00:01:50.329> left<00:01:50.719> turn

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.399 

now<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:53.870> very<00:01:54.110> sharp<00:01:54.440> left<00:01:54.710> turn

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
now the very sharp left turn

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.499 
now the very sharp left turn
turn<00:01:56.710> right<00:01:56.979> we<00:01:57.219> come<00:01:57.460> up<00:01:57.640> semi<00:01:58.149> you<00:01:58.420> know

turn right we come up semi you know

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:10.029 
turn right we come up semi you know
fairly<00:01:58.899> aligned<00:01:59.859> with<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.219> runway

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.349 

now<00:02:10.579> this<00:02:10.789> is<00:02:10.849> a<00:02:11.060> direct<00:02:11.360> x<00:02:11.840> 10<00:02:12.200> game<00:02:13.090> you<00:02:14.090> do

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:14.359 
now this is a direct x 10 game you do

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:16.630 
now this is a direct x 10 game you do
need<00:02:14.569> Vista<00:02:15.019> to<00:02:15.200> run<00:02:15.379> directx<00:02:15.980> 10<00:02:16.189> you<00:02:16.459> also

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
need Vista to run directx 10 you also

it runs this game fine so the frame rate
isn't<00:02:33.859> all<00:02:34.069> that<00:02:34.099> great<00:02:34.459> because<00:02:34.700> as<00:02:35.090> an<00:02:35.239> older

shortly<00:03:33.110> i'm<00:03:33.290> going<00:03:33.410> to<00:03:33.500> cut<00:03:33.680> my<00:03:33.800> throttle

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
shortly i'm going to cut my throttle

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.760 
shortly i'm going to cut my throttle
back<00:03:34.490> drop<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:35.120> gear<00:03:35.300> and<00:03:35.480> flaps<00:03:35.770> the

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
throttle is now been cut back we want to

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.130 
throttle is now been cut back we want to
bleed<00:03:43.850> off<00:03:44.030> a<00:03:44.060> lot<00:03:44.420> of<00:03:44.540> speed<00:03:44.810> and<00:03:44.930> a<00:03:44.989> lot<00:03:45.110> of

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
bleed off a lot of speed and a lot of

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.630 
bleed off a lot of speed and a lot of
altitude<00:03:45.709> get<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:46.040> kids<00:03:46.280> we're<00:03:46.430> getting

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
altitude get the kids we're getting

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.350 
altitude get the kids we're getting
pretty<00:03:46.790> close<00:03:46.910> to<00:03:47.239> their<00:03:47.360> runway

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.160 

and<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.960> gear<00:03:52.200> is<00:03:52.290> going<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.590> drop<00:03:53.810> there<00:03:54.810> goes

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
and the gear is going to drop there goes

and the gear is going to drop there goes
the<00:03:55.560> flaps<00:03:56.520> are<00:03:56.700> coming<00:03:56.970> down<00:03:57.650> flaps<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:59.040> need

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
the flaps are coming down flaps I need

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.670 
the flaps are coming down flaps I need
to<00:03:59.460> be<00:03:59.580> down<00:03:59.790> for<00:04:00.030> takeoff<00:04:00.420> and<00:04:00.630> landing<00:04:01.500> they

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
to be down for takeoff and landing they

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.630 
to be down for takeoff and landing they
essentially<00:04:02.300> increase<00:04:03.300> lift<00:04:04.220> and<00:04:05.220> they<00:04:05.460> help

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
essentially increase lift and they help

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.610 
essentially increase lift and they help
to<00:04:05.790> stabilize<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.480> airplane<00:04:06.870> especially<00:04:07.470> on

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
to stabilize the airplane especially on

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.850 
to stabilize the airplane especially on
takeoff<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:08.520> landing

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.470 

I<00:04:14.980> got<00:04:15.640> a<00:04:15.670> crappy<00:04:16.120> joystick<00:04:16.660> here<00:04:16.930> so<00:04:17.230> the<00:04:18.480> trim

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
I got a crappy joystick here so the trim

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.810 
I got a crappy joystick here so the trim
doesn't<00:04:20.320> work<00:04:20.470> very<00:04:20.500> well<00:04:20.829> so<00:04:21.070> you'll<00:04:21.489> notice

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
doesn't work very well so you'll notice

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.200 
doesn't work very well so you'll notice
I'm<00:04:21.970> not<00:04:22.180> very<00:04:22.780> good<00:04:22.900> at<00:04:23.170> flying<00:04:23.440> it<00:04:24.210> not

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
I'm not very good at flying it not

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.120 
I'm not very good at flying it not
trying<00:04:25.570> that<00:04:25.690> hard<00:04:26.050> i<00:04:26.350> am<00:04:26.500> just<00:04:26.650> going<00:04:26.860> to<00:04:26.920> land

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
trying that hard i am just going to land

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.820 
trying that hard i am just going to land
this<00:04:27.280> on<00:04:27.430> the<00:04:27.520> right<00:04:27.700> side<00:04:27.970> of<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.120> runway

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.870 

throttle<00:04:32.830> is<00:04:32.980> all<00:04:33.160> the<00:04:33.250> way<00:04:33.370> back<00:04:33.610> for

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
throttle is all the way back for

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.020 
throttle is all the way back for
basically<00:04:34.210> gliding<00:04:34.750> this<00:04:34.870> into<00:04:35.230> the

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
basically gliding this into the

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.129 
basically gliding this into the
airport's<00:04:37.030> runway

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:48.410 

and<00:04:41.590> we're<00:04:41.800> on<00:04:41.860> final<00:04:42.189> approach

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.360 

I<00:04:48.540> won't<00:04:49.170> pitch<00:04:49.380> from<00:04:49.590> those<00:04:49.800> up<00:04:50.070> just

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
I won't pitch from those up just

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.260 
I won't pitch from those up just
slightly<00:04:52.340> it's<00:04:53.340> not<00:04:53.460> going<00:04:53.610> to<00:04:53.700> be<00:04:53.760> that<00:04:53.790> soft

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
slightly it's not going to be that soft

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.420 
slightly it's not going to be that soft
of<00:04:54.540> landing<00:04:54.990> but<00:04:55.140> it<00:04:55.260> you<00:04:55.680> know<00:04:55.800> any<00:04:56.040> landing

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
of landing but it you know any landing

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.310 
of landing but it you know any landing
you<00:04:56.490> can<00:04:56.610> walk<00:04:56.730> away<00:04:56.910> from<00:04:57.180> is<00:04:57.870> a<00:04:58.080> good<00:04:58.170> one

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
you can walk away from is a good one

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.290 
you can walk away from is a good one
according<00:04:58.650> to<00:04:59.040> a<00:04:59.070> lot<00:04:59.250> of<00:04:59.280> air<00:04:59.460> force<00:04:59.730> pilots<00:05:00.180> I

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
according to a lot of air force pilots I

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.850 
according to a lot of air force pilots I
worked<00:05:00.540> with

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:11.890 

and<00:05:05.310> we're<00:05:05.490> down
