00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.310 

seeing<00:00:23.850> that<00:00:23.970> got<00:00:24.269> me<00:00:24.390> thinking<00:00:24.570> about<00:00:24.930> other

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
seeing that got me thinking about other

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.589 
seeing that got me thinking about other
unusual<00:00:26.189> camera<00:00:26.580> angles<00:00:26.849> here's<00:00:27.090> my<00:00:27.210> top<00:00:27.390> 9

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
unusual camera angles here's my top 9

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.269 
unusual camera angles here's my top 9
first<00:00:27.960> up<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.199> foot<00:00:28.500> mounted<00:00:28.769> cam<00:00:28.980> on<00:00:29.250> a

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
first up a foot mounted cam on a

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.160 
first up a foot mounted cam on a
skydiver<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.150> foot<00:00:30.330> mount<00:00:30.510> was<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.689> good<00:00:30.869> idea

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
skydiver the foot mount was a good idea

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.990 
skydiver the foot mount was a good idea
but<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.740> just<00:00:31.949> get<00:00:32.099> forward<00:00:32.430> like<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.579> minute<00:00:32.850> or

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
but I just get forward like a minute or

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.240 
but I just get forward like a minute or
two<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.510> avoid<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.050> awkward<00:00:34.469> camera<00:00:34.829> angle

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
two to avoid the awkward camera angle

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:43.360 
two to avoid the awkward camera angle
that<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.610> starts<00:00:35.910> off<00:00:36.030> at

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.460 

next<00:00:44.120> is<00:00:44.210> a<00:00:44.240> great<00:00:44.510> angle<00:00:44.840> on<00:00:45.080> a<00:00:45.140> ping-pong

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
next is a great angle on a ping-pong

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.080 
next is a great angle on a ping-pong
ball<00:00:45.650> shot<00:00:46.100> now<00:00:46.370> I<00:00:46.430> don't<00:00:46.550> think<00:00:46.820> these<00:00:46.910> guys

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.730 
ball shot now I don't think these guys
are<00:00:47.150> nearly<00:00:47.660> excited<00:00:48.230> enough<00:00:48.440> for<00:00:48.680> how

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:48.740 
are nearly excited enough for how

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:56.350 
are nearly excited enough for how

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
since most or all of these cams are

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.310 
since most or all of these cams are
GoPros<00:00:58.910> it<00:00:59.120> makes<00:00:59.360> sense<00:00:59.570> that<00:00:59.840> the<00:00:59.930> company

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320
