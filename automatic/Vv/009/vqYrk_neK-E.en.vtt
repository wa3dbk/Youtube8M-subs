hello<00:00:01.650> everybody<00:00:01.920> RC<00:00:02.520> tech<00:00:02.760> guy<00:00:02.970> here<00:00:03.419> I<00:00:03.689> just

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
hello everybody RC tech guy here I just

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.639 
hello everybody RC tech guy here I just
wanted<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.710> make<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.730> video<00:00:06.359> because<00:00:07.290> I've

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
wanted to make a video because I've

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.060 
wanted to make a video because I've
actually<00:00:08.179> ran<00:00:09.179> into<00:00:09.389> this<00:00:09.690> with<00:00:10.080> newcomers<00:00:10.889> to

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
actually ran into this with newcomers to

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.930 
actually ran into this with newcomers to
the<00:00:11.219> field<00:00:11.460> who<00:00:11.870> maybe<00:00:12.870> are<00:00:13.700> just<00:00:14.700> getting

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
the field who maybe are just getting

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.570 
the field who maybe are just getting
used<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.269> their<00:00:15.450> new<00:00:15.480> radio<00:00:16.190> spectrum<00:00:17.190> radio

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
used to their new radio spectrum radio

Futaba jr. one of those top radios and
they're<00:00:28.439> not<00:00:28.529> used<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.980> everything<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.789> a

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
they're not used to everything that a

they're not used to everything that a
computer<00:00:30.390> radio<00:00:30.779> can<00:00:31.080> do<00:00:31.260> some<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.279> newer

computer radio can do some of the newer

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.580 
computer radio can do some of the newer
features<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:34.520> actually<00:00:35.520> had<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:36.600> person<00:00:37.469> at

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
features and actually had a person at

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.650 
features and actually had a person at
the<00:00:37.680> flying<00:00:37.950> field<00:00:38.250> who<00:00:38.610> just<00:00:38.910> received<00:00:39.210> radio

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
the flying field who just received radio

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.799 
the flying field who just received radio
and<00:00:39.989> they<00:00:40.110> swore<00:00:40.770> up<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.160> down<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.460> they<00:00:42.030> had

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
and they swore up and down that they had

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.360 
and they swore up and down that they had
set<00:00:44.329> exponential<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:46.469> ailerons<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
set exponential on the ailerons of the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.869 
set exponential on the ailerons of the
particularly<00:00:47.879> never<00:00:48.510> flying<00:00:49.550> however<00:00:50.550> they

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
particularly never flying however they

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.000 
particularly never flying however they
said<00:00:51.300> they<00:00:51.420> looked<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.050> there<00:00:52.649> was<00:00:52.680> no

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
said they looked and there was no

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.130 
said they looked and there was no
exponential<00:00:53.730> set<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.270> they<00:00:54.420> had<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.629> spectrum

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
exponential set and they had a spectrum

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.170 
exponential set and they had a spectrum
chopper<00:00:55.379> radio<00:00:55.710> similar<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.280> DX<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.030> might

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
chopper radio similar to DX a that might

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.260 
chopper radio similar to DX a that might
have<00:00:57.300> even<00:00:57.420> been<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.719> DX<00:00:58.079> 8<00:00:58.320> or<00:00:58.469> DX<00:00:58.800> 7<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.460> can't

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
have even been a DX 8 or DX 7 I can't

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.939 
have even been a DX 8 or DX 7 I can't
remember<00:01:01.699> but<00:01:03.290> come<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.409> find<00:01:04.619> out<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
remember but come to find out the

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.340 
remember but come to find out the
problem<00:01:05.430> was<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.939> they<00:01:06.570> didn't<00:01:06.869> realize

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
problem was that they didn't realize

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.000 
problem was that they didn't realize
that<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.100> actually<00:01:08.130> set<00:01:09.060> up<00:01:09.090> your

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
that you can actually set up your

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.649 
that you can actually set up your
switches<00:01:11.240> actually<00:01:12.240> control<00:01:13.250> which

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
switches actually control which

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.560 
switches actually control which
selection<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:16.909> exponential<00:01:17.909> as<00:01:18.119> well<00:01:18.360> as

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
selection of exponential as well as

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.830 
selection of exponential as well as
travel<00:01:19.130> that<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.490> have<00:01:20.729> with<00:01:21.659> your

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
travel that you can have with your

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.810 
travel that you can have with your
servos<00:01:22.820> so<00:01:24.770> what<00:01:25.770> they<00:01:25.950> didn't<00:01:26.369> realize<00:01:26.400> is

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
servos so what they didn't realize is

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.960 
servos so what they didn't realize is
that<00:01:27.119> maybe<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.780> putting<00:01:28.080> their<00:01:28.640> radio<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.850> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
that maybe in putting their radio in the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.940 
that maybe in putting their radio in the
bag<00:01:30.210> or<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.630> carrying<00:01:31.049> case<00:01:31.290> or<00:01:31.500> whatnot

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
bag or a carrying case or whatnot

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.280 
bag or a carrying case or whatnot
they<00:01:32.759> their<00:01:33.150> switch<00:01:33.479> may<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:34.020> gotten

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
they their switch may have gotten

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.469 
they their switch may have gotten
switched<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.189> different<00:01:35.250> position<00:01:35.729> well

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
switched to a different position well

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.210 
switched to a different position well
they<00:01:37.290> didn't<00:01:37.530> realize<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:37.920> that

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
they didn't realize that that

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.670 
they didn't realize that that
exponential<00:01:38.939> setting<00:01:39.630> did<00:01:39.810> not<00:01:39.990> carry<00:01:40.320> over

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
exponential setting did not carry over

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.200 
exponential setting did not carry over
between<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.369> switch<00:01:41.579> settings<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.150> I'll

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
between the switch settings and I'll

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.109 
between the switch settings and I'll
demonstrate<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.470> again<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.759> know<00:01:44.880> all

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
demonstrate that and again you know all

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.030 
demonstrate that and again you know all
you<00:01:45.329> advanced<00:01:45.630> guys<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.290> beginner<00:01:46.649> stuff

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
you advanced guys this is beginner stuff

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.840 
you advanced guys this is beginner stuff
but<00:01:47.399> definitely<00:01:48.240> want<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.439> cover<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:50.549> is

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
but definitely want to to cover this is

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.359 
but definitely want to to cover this is
you<00:01:51.299> know<00:01:51.420> myself<00:01:51.840> included<00:01:52.320> when<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.890> was

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
you know myself included when I was

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.240 
you know myself included when I was
beginning<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.970> know<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.360> ran<00:01:54.930> into<00:01:54.960> just<00:01:55.470> little

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
beginning I know I ran into just little

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.130 
beginning I know I ran into just little
things<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.700> this<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.479> wish<00:01:57.840> someone

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
things like this that you wish someone

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.170 
things like this that you wish someone
would<00:01:58.590> have<00:01:58.619> been<00:01:59.070> able<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.399> tell<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.850> instead

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
would have been able to tell you instead

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.459 
would have been able to tell you instead
of<00:02:00.270> having<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.570> have<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.930> figure<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.320> out

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
of having to have to figure it out

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.090 
of having to have to figure it out
yourself

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
yourself

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.569 
yourself
so<00:02:03.500> basically<00:02:04.500> I'm<00:02:04.770> going<00:02:05.070> back<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.430> main

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
so basically I'm going back to the main

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.419 
so basically I'm going back to the main
screen<00:02:05.759> I'm<00:02:06.119> going<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.360> go<00:02:07.110> into<00:02:07.259> my<00:02:07.409> setup

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
screen I'm going to go into my setup

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:17.759 
screen I'm going to go into my setup
in<00:02:09.519> actually<00:02:10.149> dr<00:02:10.689> and<00:02:11.579> expo<00:02:12.579> and<00:02:16.769> basically

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
in actually dr and expo and basically

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.670 
in actually dr and expo and basically
what<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.459> have<00:02:18.489> here<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:19.000> look<00:02:19.390> we<00:02:19.569> have<00:02:20.260> the

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
what you have here and look we have the

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.630 
what you have here and look we have the
aileron<00:02:21.189> selected<00:02:21.849> so<00:02:22.090> up<00:02:23.079> on<00:02:23.379> the<00:02:23.650> dx8<00:02:24.459> I've

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
aileron selected so up on the dx8 I've

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.149 
aileron selected so up on the dx8 I've
got<00:02:24.909> the<00:02:25.090> aileron<00:02:25.629> switch<00:02:26.079> set<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.829> zero

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
got the aileron switch set to the zero

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.209 
got the aileron switch set to the zero
position<00:02:27.599> so<00:02:28.599> you<00:02:28.689> look<00:02:29.319> at<00:02:29.439> my<00:02:29.590> dual<00:02:29.859> rates

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:30.219 
position so you look at my dual rates

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:33.990 
position so you look at my dual rates
set<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.269> fifty<00:02:32.049> percent<00:02:32.200> basically<00:02:32.799> of<00:02:33.340> what

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
set to fifty percent basically of what

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.789 
set to fifty percent basically of what
the<00:02:34.150> ailerons<00:02:34.569> can<00:02:34.840> do<00:02:34.959> some<00:02:35.260> on<00:02:35.409> switch

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
the ailerons can do some on switch

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.420 
the ailerons can do some on switch
position<00:02:36.489> zero<00:02:36.939> I<00:02:37.349> go<00:02:38.349> to<00:02:38.409> switch<00:02:38.739> position

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
position zero I go to switch position

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.569 
position zero I go to switch position
one<00:02:39.930> look<00:02:40.930> what<00:02:41.109> happens<00:02:41.530> so<00:02:41.769> switch<00:02:42.040> position

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
one look what happens so switch position

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.710 
one look what happens so switch position
zero<00:02:42.909> switch<00:02:43.870> position<00:02:44.799> one<00:02:45.419> dual<00:02:46.419> rates

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
zero switch position one dual rates

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.740 
zero switch position one dual rates
changes<00:02:47.349> and<00:02:47.620> then<00:02:48.400> also<00:02:48.549> the<00:02:48.879> expo<00:02:49.359> setting

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
changes and then also the expo setting

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.479 
changes and then also the expo setting
changes<00:02:50.260> if<00:02:50.439> you<00:02:50.470> notice<00:02:51.510> so<00:02:53.159> basically<00:02:54.159> what

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
changes if you notice so basically what

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.550 
changes if you notice so basically what
that<00:02:54.519> means<00:02:54.969> is<00:02:55.419> that<00:02:55.450> if<00:02:56.169> someone

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
that means is that if someone

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.909 
that means is that if someone
accidentally<00:02:57.900> puts<00:02:58.900> their<00:02:59.169> radio<00:02:59.469> on<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.739> bag

00:02:59.909 --> 00:02:59.919 
accidentally puts their radio on the bag

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.099 
accidentally puts their radio on the bag
in<00:03:00.189> the<00:03:00.219> switch<00:03:00.579> position<00:03:01.150> gets<00:03:01.359> changed<00:03:01.750> and

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
in the switch position gets changed and

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.229 
in the switch position gets changed and
let's<00:03:02.739> say<00:03:02.919> they<00:03:03.129> didn't<00:03:03.430> understand<00:03:03.969> that

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
let's say they didn't understand that

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.569 
let's say they didn't understand that
hey<00:03:04.689> you<00:03:04.750> can<00:03:04.989> have<00:03:05.489> different<00:03:06.489> settings<00:03:06.819> on

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
hey you can have different settings on

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.429 
hey you can have different settings on
dual<00:03:09.579> rates<00:03:09.849> and<00:03:10.060> expo<00:03:10.389> on<00:03:10.419> all<00:03:11.109> of<00:03:11.319> these

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
switch positions so they may have had

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.869

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
the switch gets it set to switch

no expo or anything and your plainness

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.129 
no expo or anything and your plainness
is<00:04:08.370> maybe<00:04:09.370> doing<00:04:09.699> things<00:04:09.939> that<00:04:10.239> you're<00:04:11.109> not

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
is maybe doing things that you're not

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:14.280 
is maybe doing things that you're not

expecting it to do so it could

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.659 
expecting it to do so it could

potentially be something that could

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:17.279 
potentially be something that could
bring<00:04:15.849> your<00:04:16.120> plane<00:04:16.359> down<00:04:16.630> or<00:04:16.840> put<00:04:17.019> you<00:04:17.109> in<00:04:17.229> a

bring your plane down or put you in a

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.279 
bring your plane down or put you in a
position<00:04:17.440> that<00:04:17.769> you<00:04:18.310> don't<00:04:18.340> want<00:04:18.760> to<00:04:18.820> be<00:04:18.969> in<00:04:19.289> so

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
position that you don't want to be in so

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:21.150

again

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
again

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.320 
again
just<00:04:21.610> to<00:04:21.700> reiterate<00:04:21.910> that<00:04:22.510> switch<00:04:23.080> position

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
just to reiterate that switch position

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.120 
just to reiterate that switch position
changes<00:04:25.330> those<00:04:25.660> settings<00:04:26.170> and<00:04:26.410> then<00:04:26.590> if<00:04:26.920> you

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
changes those settings and then if you

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.940 
changes those settings and then if you
notice<00:04:27.460> you<00:04:27.640> also<00:04:27.850> have<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:29.170> same<00:04:29.410> thing<00:04:29.680> for

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
notice you also have the same thing for

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.950 
notice you also have the same thing for

really weird things in essence all that

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.390 
really weird things in essence all that
was<00:05:27.580> going<00:05:27.850> on<00:05:28.000> was<00:05:28.330> his<00:05:29.200> switch<00:05:29.710> position<00:05:30.220> was

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
was going on was his switch position was

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.090 
was going on was his switch position was
was<00:05:30.790> different<00:05:31.300> so<00:05:32.020> he<00:05:32.290> would<00:05:32.530> he<00:05:32.920> had

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
was different so he would he had

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.950 
was different so he would he had
actually<00:05:33.490> gone<00:05:33.670> through<00:05:34.060> and<00:05:34.240> said<00:05:34.420> okay<00:05:34.720> well

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
actually gone through and said okay well

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.020 
actually gone through and said okay well
I<00:05:34.990> I<00:05:35.290> know<00:05:35.770> I<00:05:35.800> said<00:05:36.250> my<00:05:36.280> Expo<00:05:36.910> to<00:05:37.350> 70%<00:05:38.350> and<00:05:39.130> so<00:05:39.880> he

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
I I know I said my Expo to 70% and so he

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.630 
I I know I said my Expo to 70% and so he
did<00:05:40.210> that<00:05:40.360> on<00:05:40.740> not<00:05:41.740> realizing<00:05:42.310> the<00:05:42.400> switch

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
did that on not realizing the switch

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.320 
did that on not realizing the switch
position<00:05:42.820> was<00:05:43.300> different<00:05:43.780> and<00:05:45.030> when<00:05:46.030> all<00:05:46.180> he

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
position was different and when all he

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.060 
position was different and when all he
would<00:05:46.450> have<00:05:46.570> had<00:05:46.720> to<00:05:46.840> do<00:05:47.020> was<00:05:47.350> just<00:05:47.620> make<00:05:47.740> sure

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
would have had to do was just make sure

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.490 
would have had to do was just make sure
the<00:05:48.669> position<00:05:48.880> was<00:05:49.390> where<00:05:49.630> he<00:05:49.900> thought<00:05:50.140> it<00:05:50.290> was

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
the position was where he thought it was

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.640 
the position was where he thought it was
or<00:05:50.830> had<00:05:51.700> the<00:05:51.850> settings<00:05:52.180> that<00:05:52.270> he<00:05:52.390> thought<00:05:52.650> so

positions to put those settings into

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.440 
positions to put those settings into
