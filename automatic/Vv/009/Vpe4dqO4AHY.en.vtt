 I'm in the election for months, this is a 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.920
 slap in the face of Brazilian adolescence 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.290
 and the treasury is already prepared to pay 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.689
 the default that will come because it is not 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.930
 possible for someone to buy in the 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:40.530

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.700

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:12.679
