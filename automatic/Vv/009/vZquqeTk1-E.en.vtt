it sounds all very science and scary
it's<00:01:01.840> just<00:01:02.290> the<00:01:02.440> thing<00:01:02.620> for<00:01:02.650> making<00:01:03.160> desserts

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
specific dish our popcorn gelato is

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.620 
specific dish our popcorn gelato is
taking<00:01:21.310> popcorn<00:01:21.729> which<00:01:21.909> we<00:01:22.060> know<00:01:22.150> is<00:01:22.270> crunchy

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
taking popcorn which we know is crunchy

taking popcorn which we know is crunchy
salty<00:01:22.840> a<00:01:23.020> hot<00:01:23.290> and<00:01:23.590> making<00:01:24.250> it<00:01:24.400> creamy<00:01:25.060> cold

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
salty a hot and making it creamy cold

salty a hot and making it creamy cold
and<00:01:26.260> smooth<00:01:26.560> and<00:01:26.800> then<00:01:27.130> we<00:01:27.400> repairing<00:01:27.880> that

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
and smooth and then we repairing that

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.130 
and smooth and then we repairing that
with<00:01:28.860> caviar<00:01:29.860> and<00:01:30.159> cucumbers<00:01:30.790> and<00:01:31.140> watercress

with caviar and cucumbers and watercress
and<00:01:32.560> what<00:01:32.830> we're<00:01:32.950> doing<00:01:33.220> is<00:01:33.460> we're<00:01:34.240> taking<00:01:34.360> the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
and what we're doing is we're taking the

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.570 
and what we're doing is we're taking the
idea<00:01:34.810> of<00:01:34.930> using<00:01:35.229> popcorn<00:01:35.799> with<00:01:35.950> with<00:01:36.280> ceviche

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
idea of using popcorn with with ceviche

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.360 
idea of using popcorn with with ceviche
and<00:01:37.330> instead<00:01:38.320> we're<00:01:38.500> using<00:01:38.530> popcorn<00:01:39.280> ice

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
and instead we're using popcorn ice

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.719 
and instead we're using popcorn ice
cream<00:01:39.640> with<00:01:40.060> fish<00:01:40.900> rounds<00:01:41.310> when<00:01:42.310> we<00:01:42.400> develop

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
cream with fish rounds when we develop

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.550 
cream with fish rounds when we develop
in<00:01:42.820> the<00:01:42.880> popcorn<00:01:43.060> gelato<00:01:43.450> we<00:01:44.170> were<00:01:44.260> working<00:01:44.500> a

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
in the popcorn gelato we were working a

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.660 
in the popcorn gelato we were working a
lot<00:01:44.650> with<00:01:44.710> liquid<00:01:45.010> nitrogen

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
lot with liquid nitrogen

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.940 
lot with liquid nitrogen
I<00:01:46.700> think<00:01:47.600> what's<00:01:47.750> fascinating<00:01:47.930> about<00:01:48.410> liquid

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
I think what's fascinating about liquid

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.940 
I think what's fascinating about liquid
nitrogen<00:01:49.340> is<00:01:49.760> that<00:01:50.360> it<00:01:50.510> allows<00:01:50.900> you<00:01:51.260> to<00:01:51.800> get

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
nitrogen is that it allows you to get

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.790 
nitrogen is that it allows you to get
very<00:01:52.280> low<00:01:52.490> temperatures<00:01:53.120> hence<00:01:54.020> very

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
very low temperatures hence very

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.880 
very low temperatures hence very
different<00:01:55.370> textures<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:55.910> forms<00:01:56.390> this<00:01:57.350> recipe

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
different textures and forms this recipe

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.250 
different textures and forms this recipe
started<00:01:58.340> when<00:01:58.580> Alex<00:01:59.000> said<00:01:59.240> to<00:01:59.360> himself<00:01:59.510> why

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
started when Alex said to himself why

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.500 
started when Alex said to himself why
not<00:02:00.590> why<00:02:01.040> not<00:02:01.070> make<00:02:01.340> popcorn<00:02:01.580> ice<00:02:01.820> cream<00:02:02.120> look

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
not why not make popcorn ice cream look

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.820 
not why not make popcorn ice cream look
like<00:02:02.720> popcorn<00:02:04.450> let's<00:02:05.450> get<00:02:05.660> some<00:02:05.780> milk<00:02:05.960> we're

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
like popcorn let's get some milk we're

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.469 
like popcorn let's get some milk we're
gonna<00:02:06.920> bring<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.250> milk<00:02:07.400> to<00:02:07.430> a<00:02:07.550> simmer<00:02:07.760> just

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
gonna bring the milk to a simmer just

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.780 
gonna bring the milk to a simmer just
gonna<00:02:08.690> pour<00:02:08.960> that<00:02:08.990> over<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.380> popcorn<00:02:09.790> once

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
gonna pour that over the popcorn once

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.460 
gonna pour that over the popcorn once
