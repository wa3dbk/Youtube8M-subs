00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:08.835
The robbers are accompanied by
bigger robbers who control them.

00:00:08.835 --> 00:00:15.835
They don't wear a mask, move around
at night, or go into hiding.

00:00:21.044 --> 00:00:22.419
Get it out!

00:00:27.835 --> 00:00:30.835
Why are you taking my ox?

00:00:31.877 --> 00:00:37.835
Oh, my ox! My ox!

00:00:40.835 --> 00:00:45.835
Hey! What's this commotion about?

00:00:46.836 --> 00:00:50.835
Aren't you a little darling?

00:00:50.835 --> 00:00:56.835
Hey, you look delicious!
Let's have some fun.

00:00:56.835 --> 00:00:59.753
Let go!

00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:06.835
That was good.

00:01:11.503 --> 00:01:18.835
You can haggle with Heo Nam-Oh,
but don't bother the innocent people.

00:01:18.835 --> 00:01:22.835
Then why don't you chip in?

00:01:22.835 --> 00:01:26.795
Or you can persuade Heo Nam-Oh.

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:29.877
I'm not leaving without buying the land.

00:01:29.877 --> 00:01:33.586
You can't do this!

00:01:33.586 --> 00:01:34.835
Yes, I can.

00:01:34.835 --> 00:01:39.835
- Why, you…
- This old man is too naive.

00:01:39.835 --> 00:01:42.002
- Teach him a thing or two.
- Yes, Sir.

00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:43.835
Let go!

00:01:48.835 --> 00:01:50.835
Stop!

00:01:51.835 --> 00:01:56.253
Hey! Stop it!
I'll sell the land.

00:01:57.835 --> 00:02:00.086
- Really?
- Yes.

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:04.336
No, don't do that.

00:02:04.336 --> 00:02:09.253
I can't let the neighbors suffer
because of my property.

00:02:09.253 --> 00:02:14.835
But that land is…

00:02:14.835 --> 00:02:20.835
Give me 50 nyang each like you said.

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:23.835
No, this isn't right.

00:02:23.835 --> 00:02:26.835
- I'll give you 5 nyang each.
- That's absurd!

00:02:26.835 --> 00:02:27.835
What?

00:02:27.835 --> 00:02:30.835
That's my final offer.

00:02:31.835 --> 00:02:37.835
The law is only on the elite's side.

00:02:47.378 --> 00:02:50.961
- Give him an IOU.
- Yes, Sir.

00:02:55.835 --> 00:03:01.835
Bring this to my house to get your money.

00:03:12.503 --> 00:03:13.835
Here.

00:03:19.336 --> 00:03:22.919
Nice ass.

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.835
- Where are you going?
- She's flirting.

00:03:26.835 --> 00:03:28.836
What a shame.

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:35.336
- Hey, listen up.
- Quiet. Boss is speaking.

00:03:35.336 --> 00:03:39.211
Who did the most work today?

00:03:39.211 --> 00:03:43.253
Me, of course.

00:03:43.253 --> 00:03:47.753
I hurt my hand while breaking the jar.

00:03:47.835 --> 00:03:55.835
I'm the one who followed
that woman around the house!

00:03:55.835 --> 00:03:58.835
What? I'm the one
who beat that old man.

00:03:58.835 --> 00:04:01.835
That's enough.

00:04:01.835 --> 00:04:06.044
Everyone wants to take credit.

00:04:06.044 --> 00:04:11.711
I'll give everyone a reward.
Let's drink.

00:04:12.835 --> 00:04:15.835
Sir, you're a great man!

00:04:21.253 --> 00:04:23.835
Sorry I'm late.

00:04:27.835 --> 00:04:28.835
What the?

00:04:29.378 --> 00:04:32.835
Is there someone here?

00:04:40.835 --> 00:04:43.835
Isn't that a girl?

00:04:44.044 --> 00:04:47.336
You're leaving already?

00:04:51.835 --> 00:04:54.711
It's a guy.

00:04:55.586 --> 00:04:58.628
But he's fine.

00:04:58.835 --> 00:05:04.545
- He must be popular with the girls.
- He's different from thugs like us.

00:05:04.545 --> 00:05:08.795
That's enough. Let's go.

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:15.086
We'll get sober after walking.
Then we can drink again.

00:05:16.002 --> 00:05:20.211
- Let's empty our cups!
- Sir, you're the best!
