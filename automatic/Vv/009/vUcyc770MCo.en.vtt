 a little bit have to go after one 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.479
 so you have to solve it reliably but just make it to your destination 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:03.009
 it's not nice 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.449

 APA several times would have come to that now at 180 degrees 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.360
 and then you sit down in the oven and we'll wait for the culprit 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.870
 After weeks of waiting, the list had to be canceled 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.870
 after that, the helpers could 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.150
