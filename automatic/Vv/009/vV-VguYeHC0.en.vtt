00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.900
Hello ! i am Guido from Football Tricks Online

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.600
and today i will teach you the following trick

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.560
we had this trick on our channel already...

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.955
but it was explained with text only

00:00:35.955 --> 00:00:38.215
today i will do a spoken tutorial so you understand better

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.160
mostly because we will do harder tricks in the future

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.820
and we need to know how to perform this trick before that...

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.540
in freestyle you got to start by the really basics

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.560
and then combine them to achieve harder tricks

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.460
if you wanna start with the hard with out knowing the basics... that wont work

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.480
before we start...

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.180
you got to know how to juggle the ball perfectly

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.680
 as done in Freestyle

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.000
if you know how to juggle but you dont got that perfect control...

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.040
as freestylers...

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.680
click on the video on screen

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.580
and learn how to juggle as a perfect Freestyler

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.720
there you will learn some special techniques

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.980
for perfect juggling

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.660
So... click on the video or link will also be in description

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.220
To start you need to dominate the Outside Around The World trick

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.480
You can learn this by clicking the video on screen

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.760
there will also be a link in the description

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.420
once you learned the Outside Around The world, we can move on

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.320
You will also need to learn the following trick on screen

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.320
click on the video to watch the tutorial

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.540
and link to the video will aslo be in description

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.800
Once you dominate this trick as well... we can move on

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.960
Dont try to learn todays trick in a rush...

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.000
learn those 2 tricks we talked about then try it, dont rush

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.300
ok, start by juggling the ball

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.620
when you are ready...

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.380
try to make a precise hit with NON-Dominant

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.300
to perfectly set the ball to your Dominant

00:02:04.308 --> 00:02:06.308
as it it falls on your Dominant...

00:02:06.308 --> 00:02:08.868
get ready to perform an Outside Around the World

00:02:08.868 --> 00:02:12.888
as i said... as the ball is falling we perform an Outside Around The World

00:02:12.888 --> 00:02:16.308
but don't rush on performing the Around The World...

00:02:16.308 --> 00:02:19.008
most people rush because they think you got to do it fast... and then fail

00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:23.008
but itÂ´s not performing it fast but at the exact time

00:02:23.737 --> 00:02:28.337
wait for the ball to be almost at floor level

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.760
then ! try to perform the Outside Around The World

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.760
This way we will get a low height Around The World

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.620
that is exactly what we want, we don't want a high Around The World

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.920
we need a really low Around The World

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.580
Like this...

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.440
As you can see, it is a low Around The World

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.200
so perform the Low Height Around The World

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.180
So... hit it and pass your leg over (ATW)

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.620
BUT... don't jump until you foot is right next to the ball

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.400
So perform Around The World (ATW)

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.580
When you foot in position (next to the ball) we do step 2

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.420
which is hitting the ball under

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.840
 and passing your other leg over

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.780
like this...

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.540
hit and pass leg over

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.720
 it is important to wait for the correct time to jump

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.000
correct time is when foot is next to the ball

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.620
to then perform the jump

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.980
and pass your leg over

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.800
that is the most frequent error...

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.780
people perform the Around The world

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.040
and as they do it they jump right after

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.600
thats when they fail

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.200
So perform the Around The World and wait for the right moment

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.360
which is when your foot is next to the ball

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.673
just then... you make jump

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.760
like this...

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.822
low height Around The World

00:03:43.822 --> 00:03:45.232
wait for perfect timing...

00:03:45.232 --> 00:03:46.573
and perform the jump and hit

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.840
okey that is basically it !

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.000
The most important is to wait for the exact time

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.660
to perform the trick perfectly

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.600
that is used a lot in Freestyle, "Perfect timing" so keep in it in mind

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.320
it looks complex but if you follow the steps it is not that hard

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.180
and you will get it with some training

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.120
