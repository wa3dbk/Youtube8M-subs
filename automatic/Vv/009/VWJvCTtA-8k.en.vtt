00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
this one is actually the x-ray glitch

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.450 
this one is actually the x-ray glitch
now<00:00:19.750> in<00:00:19.990> past<00:00:20.290> versions<00:00:20.500> of<00:00:20.800> Minecraft<00:00:20.980> on<00:00:21.310> the

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
now in past versions of Minecraft on the

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.890 
now in past versions of Minecraft on the
console<00:00:21.820> there<00:00:21.970> have<00:00:22.090> been<00:00:22.240> a<00:00:22.420> ton<00:00:22.869> of

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
console there have been a ton of

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.750 
console there have been a ton of
different<00:00:23.260> x-ray<00:00:23.650> glitches<00:00:23.980> and<00:00:24.160> this<00:00:24.610> is

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
different x-ray glitches and this is

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.390 
different x-ray glitches and this is
probably<00:00:25.119> the<00:00:25.360> simplest<00:00:25.869> one<00:00:26.230> thus<00:00:26.560> far<00:00:26.829> so

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
probably the simplest one thus far so

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.800 
probably the simplest one thus far so
literally<00:00:27.820> all<00:00:28.000> you<00:00:28.029> have<00:00:28.270> to<00:00:28.360> do<00:00:28.480> for<00:00:28.689> the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
literally all you have to do for the

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.150 
literally all you have to do for the
extra<00:00:29.079> glitch<00:00:29.259> to<00:00:29.439> work<00:00:29.619> is<00:00:29.770> you<00:00:29.829> just<00:00:29.950> want<00:00:30.099> to

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
extra glitch to work is you just want to

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.249 
extra glitch to work is you just want to
find<00:00:30.460> wherever<00:00:31.029> you<00:00:31.300> want<00:00:31.480> to<00:00:31.570> x-ray<00:00:31.899> the<00:00:31.930> land

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
find wherever you want to x-ray the land

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.110 
find wherever you want to x-ray the land
and<00:00:32.439> dig<00:00:32.680> a<00:00:32.710> hole<00:00:33.070> down<00:00:33.310> into<00:00:33.579> the<00:00:33.670> ground<00:00:33.700> of

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
and dig a hole down into the ground of

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.060 
and dig a hole down into the ground of
me<00:00:34.360> I<00:00:34.390> don't<00:00:34.480> know<00:00:34.810> however<00:00:35.470> deep<00:00:35.680> you<00:00:35.800> want<00:00:35.920> to

me I don't know however deep you want to

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.380 
me I don't know however deep you want to
go<00:00:36.190> however<00:00:36.430> do<00:00:36.700> you<00:00:36.730> think<00:00:36.970> the<00:00:37.030> caves<00:00:37.239> are

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
go however do you think the caves are

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.880 
go however do you think the caves are
going<00:00:37.510> to<00:00:37.570> be<00:00:37.690> and<00:00:37.930> get<00:00:38.140> the<00:00:38.200> best<00:00:38.470> view<00:00:38.710> of<00:00:38.770> the

your friends post place your block of

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.290 
your friends post place your block of
redstone<00:00:51.670> and<00:00:51.790> Wham<00:00:52.360> now<00:00:53.230> you<00:00:53.290> can<00:00:53.680> see<00:00:53.980> all

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
redstone and Wham now you can see all

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.100 
redstone and Wham now you can see all
kinds<00:00:55.300> of<00:00:55.390> good<00:00:55.510> stuff<00:00:55.540> so<00:00:55.810> you<00:00:55.870> can<00:00:55.960> see<00:00:56.080> right

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
kinds of good stuff so you can see right

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.170 
kinds of good stuff so you can see right
over<00:00:56.230> there<00:00:56.440> there's<00:00:56.590> a<00:00:56.620> lava<00:00:56.860> pool<00:00:57.190> obviously

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
over there there's a lava pool obviously

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.850 
over there there's a lava pool obviously
if<00:00:58.270> you<00:00:58.420> and<00:00:58.930> you<00:00:59.050> had<00:00:59.230> your<00:00:59.350> gamma<00:00:59.590> up<00:00:59.770> a

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
if you and you had your gamma up a

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.930 
if you and you had your gamma up a
little<00:01:00.040> bit<00:01:00.130> higher<00:01:00.280> than<00:01:00.310> I<00:01:00.579> do<00:01:00.640> you<00:01:00.760> could

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
little bit higher than I do you could

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.010 
little bit higher than I do you could
probably<00:01:01.090> see<00:01:01.270> a<00:01:01.300> little<00:01:01.480> bit<00:01:01.570> more<00:01:01.690> clearly

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
probably see a little bit more clearly

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.870 
probably see a little bit more clearly
but<00:01:02.560> you<00:01:02.710> can<00:01:02.890> see<00:01:03.070> here<00:01:03.280> obviously<00:01:03.460> now<00:01:03.820> you

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
but you can see here obviously now you

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.999 
but you can see here obviously now you
can<00:01:04.119> just<00:01:04.299> see<00:01:04.390> all<00:01:04.629> around<00:01:05.019> underground<00:01:05.650> you

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
can just see all around underground you

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:07.499 
can just see all around underground you
can<00:01:06.130> see<00:01:06.310> all<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:06.490> different<00:01:06.670> cave<00:01:07.030> systems

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
can see all the different cave systems

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:09.420 
can see all the different cave systems
and<00:01:07.720> you<00:01:08.079> can<00:01:08.320> see<00:01:08.590> you<00:01:08.799> know<00:01:08.890> where<00:01:09.100> different

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
and you can see you know where different

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.859 
and you can see you know where different
ores<00:01:09.610> are<00:01:09.880> if<00:01:10.030> you<00:01:10.119> look<00:01:10.299> close<00:01:10.479> enough<00:01:10.509> like

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
ores are if you look close enough like

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:11.850 
ores are if you look close enough like
if<00:01:10.960> I<00:01:11.020> look<00:01:11.200> close<00:01:11.350> enough<00:01:11.380> you<00:01:11.530> can<00:01:11.680> probably

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
if I look close enough you can probably

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.980 
if I look close enough you can probably
see<00:01:12.070> some<00:01:12.220> ores<00:01:12.400> down<00:01:12.640> there<00:01:12.880> around<00:01:13.299> the<00:01:13.719> lava

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
see some ores down there around the lava

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.499 
see some ores down there around the lava
and<00:01:14.409> it's<00:01:15.399> just<00:01:15.579> a<00:01:15.670> super<00:01:16.090> super<00:01:16.359> useful

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
and it's just a super super useful

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.630 
and it's just a super super useful
glitch<00:01:16.929> for<00:01:17.530> mining<00:01:18.069> and<00:01:18.219> doing<00:01:18.490> different

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
glitch for mining and doing different

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.919 
glitch for mining and doing different
things<00:01:18.789> now<00:01:18.999> obviously<00:01:19.420> if<00:01:19.509> you<00:01:19.600> wanted<00:01:19.840> to

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
things now obviously if you wanted to

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:21.630 
things now obviously if you wanted to
see<00:01:20.109> in<00:01:20.229> a<00:01:20.319> different<00:01:20.590> location<00:01:20.679> since<00:01:21.520> this

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
see in a different location since this

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.279 
see in a different location since this
is<00:01:21.700> just<00:01:21.819> so<00:01:22.329> simple<00:01:22.719> all<00:01:22.869> you<00:01:22.929> have<00:01:23.079> to<00:01:23.140> do<00:01:23.229> is

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
is just so simple all you have to do is

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.770 
is just so simple all you have to do is
like<00:01:23.409> I<00:01:23.499> said<00:01:23.710> dig<00:01:23.890> down<00:01:24.069> wham<00:01:24.909> right<00:01:25.420> here

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
like I said dig down wham right here

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.929 
like I said dig down wham right here
right<00:01:26.109> there<00:01:26.409> right<00:01:26.679> there<00:01:27.069> and<00:01:27.310> now<00:01:27.340> you<00:01:27.609> can

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
right there right there and now you can

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.809 
right there right there and now you can
get<00:01:28.060> yet<00:01:28.329> another<00:01:28.359> perspective<00:01:29.049> of<00:01:29.670> from<00:01:30.670> the

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:30.819 
get yet another perspective of from the

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:32.190 
get yet another perspective of from the
x-ray<00:01:31.119> glitch<00:01:31.329> right<00:01:31.569> so<00:01:31.719> now<00:01:31.840> we<00:01:31.899> can<00:01:32.079> see

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
x-ray glitch right so now we can see
