00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
see it's getting excessively dirty this

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.930 
see it's getting excessively dirty this
was<00:01:20.619> starting<00:01:21.069> to<00:01:21.100> get<00:01:21.250> somewhat<00:01:21.580> dirty<00:01:21.729> but

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
was starting to get somewhat dirty but

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.309 
was starting to get somewhat dirty but
it<00:01:22.030> still<00:01:22.209> got<00:01:22.360> quite<00:01:22.599> a<00:01:22.630> bit<00:01:22.780> of<00:01:22.869> clean<00:01:23.020> spots

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:23.319 
it still got quite a bit of clean spots

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:26.520 
it still got quite a bit of clean spots
in<00:01:23.530> it<00:01:23.619> so<00:01:24.069> it's<00:01:24.190> perfectly<00:01:24.490> fine<00:01:24.700> to<00:01:24.759> use<00:01:25.530> or

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
in it so it's perfectly fine to use or

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.040 
in it so it's perfectly fine to use or
when<00:01:26.890> you<00:01:26.979> drop<00:01:27.160> it<00:01:27.280> on<00:01:27.369> the<00:01:27.459> ground<00:01:27.869> don't<00:01:28.869> use

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
when you drop it on the ground don't use

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.389 
when you drop it on the ground don't use
it<00:01:29.140> over<00:01:29.349> again<00:01:29.440> that<00:01:29.860> is<00:01:30.009> my<00:01:30.160> recommendation

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
it over again that is my recommendation

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.460 
it over again that is my recommendation
because<00:01:31.030> what<00:01:31.390> can<00:01:31.479> happen<00:01:31.539> is<00:01:31.899> it's<00:01:32.080> sticky

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
because what can happen is it's sticky

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.350 
because what can happen is it's sticky
and<00:01:32.649> it<00:01:33.160> can<00:01:33.250> pick<00:01:33.369> up<00:01:33.490> actually<00:01:33.789> dirt<00:01:33.970> from

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
and it can pick up actually dirt from

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.400 
and it can pick up actually dirt from
the<00:01:34.479> ground<00:01:34.509> even<00:01:34.959> though<00:01:35.050> you<00:01:35.110> think<00:01:35.349> the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
the ground even though you think the

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.169 
the ground even though you think the
ground<00:01:35.590> is<00:01:35.770> if<00:01:36.490> you're<00:01:36.640> working<00:01:36.819> in<00:01:36.940> a<00:01:37.000> clean

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
ground is if you're working in a clean

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:38.460 
ground is if you're working in a clean
spot<00:01:37.420> you<00:01:37.660> think<00:01:37.869> there's<00:01:38.020> nothing<00:01:38.289> there

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
spot you think there's nothing there

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.990 
spot you think there's nothing there
something<00:01:39.130> might<00:01:39.250> land<00:01:39.399> in<00:01:39.550> the<00:01:39.610> paint<00:01:39.849> what

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
something might land in the paint what

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.070 
something might land in the paint what
can<00:01:40.119> happen<00:01:40.240> considering<00:01:40.660> you<00:01:40.720> are<00:01:40.780> rubbing

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
can happen considering you are rubbing

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.080 
can happen considering you are rubbing
this<00:01:41.170> in<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.410> paint<00:01:41.590> you<00:01:41.740> can<00:01:41.920> do<00:01:42.160> some<00:01:42.970> pretty

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
this in the paint you can do some pretty

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.910 
this in the paint you can do some pretty
excessive<00:01:43.569> damage<00:01:43.750> with<00:01:44.050> it<00:01:44.229> rather<00:01:44.470> than<00:01:44.590> any

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
excessive damage with it rather than any

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.219 
excessive damage with it rather than any
repairs<00:01:45.429> as<00:01:46.119> for<00:01:46.360> storage<00:01:46.630> purposes<00:01:46.660> here

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
repairs as for storage purposes here

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:48.930 
repairs as for storage purposes here
what<00:01:47.380> are<00:01:47.470> you<00:01:47.560> do<00:01:47.679> is<00:01:47.860> I<00:01:48.369> basically<00:01:48.580> just<00:01:48.700> use

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
what are you do is I basically just use

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.880 
what are you do is I basically just use
some<00:01:49.119> parchment<00:01:49.300> paper<00:01:49.509> make<00:01:50.380> sure<00:01:50.410> it's<00:01:50.679> damp

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
some parchment paper make sure it's damp

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.260 
some parchment paper make sure it's damp
when<00:01:51.069> I<00:01:51.099> put<00:01:51.250> it<00:01:51.340> away<00:01:51.429> so<00:01:51.580> it<00:01:51.700> doesn't<00:01:51.910> dry<00:01:52.060> and

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
when I put it away so it doesn't dry and

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.059 
when I put it away so it doesn't dry and
then<00:01:52.360> just<00:01:52.599> seal<00:01:52.780> it<00:01:52.810> up<00:01:53.020> in<00:01:53.200> a<00:01:53.229> ziplock<00:01:53.860> bag

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
then just seal it up in a ziplock bag

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:56.580 
then just seal it up in a ziplock bag
now<00:01:54.459> before<00:01:54.819> you<00:01:54.940> do<00:01:55.090> this<00:01:55.869> procedure<00:01:56.050> you

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
now before you do this procedure you

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
now before you do this procedure you
want<00:01:56.739> to<00:01:56.830> make<00:01:56.920> sure<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.160> vehicle<00:01:57.459> is

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
want to make sure the vehicle is

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.100 
want to make sure the vehicle is
perfectly<00:01:58.239> clean<00:01:58.479> so<00:01:58.630> you<00:01:58.690> want<00:01:58.869> to<00:01:58.989> go

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
perfectly clean so you want to go

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.130 
perfectly clean so you want to go
through<00:01:59.440> and<00:01:59.619> give<00:01:59.709> it<00:01:59.800> a<00:01:59.890> good<00:02:00.039> thorough<00:02:00.459> wash

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
through and give it a good thorough wash

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.630 
through and give it a good thorough wash
and<00:02:02.140> make<00:02:02.500> sure<00:02:02.679> there<00:02:02.800> is<00:02:02.890> no<00:02:03.039> contaminants

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
and make sure there is no contaminants

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.919 
and make sure there is no contaminants
that<00:02:03.910> are<00:02:04.090> on<00:02:04.239> the<00:02:04.360> paint<00:02:04.539> that<00:02:04.660> anything

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
that are on the paint that anything

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.949 
that are on the paint that anything
that's<00:02:05.080> loose<00:02:05.319> or<00:02:05.560> even<00:02:05.800> just<00:02:05.979> a<00:02:06.130> road<00:02:06.399> debris

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
that's loose or even just a road debris

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.059 
that's loose or even just a road debris
up<00:02:07.959> by<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.229> fenders<00:02:08.590> or<00:02:08.709> anything<00:02:08.830> like<00:02:09.009> that

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
up by the fenders or anything like that

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.770 
up by the fenders or anything like that
now<00:02:09.550> what<00:02:09.700> can<00:02:09.789> happen<00:02:09.970> is<00:02:10.149> you<00:02:10.209> contaminants

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
now what can happen is you contaminants

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.479 
now what can happen is you contaminants
can<00:02:10.810> get<00:02:11.050> in<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:11.170> clay<00:02:11.319> bar<00:02:11.560> and<00:02:11.800> again<00:02:12.250> as<00:02:12.400> I

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
can get in the clay bar and again as I

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:13.740 
can get in the clay bar and again as I
mentioned<00:02:12.760> early<00:02:12.970> even<00:02:13.120> with<00:02:13.270> dropping<00:02:13.480> the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
mentioned early even with dropping the

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.250 
mentioned early even with dropping the
bar<00:02:14.650> on<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.250> ground<00:02:15.659> basically<00:02:16.659> the<00:02:16.870> cam<00:02:17.079> is

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
bar on the ground basically the cam is

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.539 
bar on the ground basically the cam is
getting<00:02:17.469> the<00:02:17.530> bar<00:02:17.709> they<00:02:17.950> stick<00:02:18.159> to<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:18.430> and

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
getting the bar they stick to it and

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:19.080 
getting the bar they stick to it and
then<00:02:18.610> when<00:02:18.819> you<00:02:18.879> rub

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
then when you rub

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.670 
then when you rub
on<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.269> paint<00:02:19.510> then<00:02:19.750> it<00:02:19.870> creates<00:02:20.110> more<00:02:20.170> damage

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
on the paint then it creates more damage

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.460 
on the paint then it creates more damage
than<00:02:20.920> you're<00:02:21.190> actually<00:02:21.340> doing<00:02:21.879> any<00:02:22.000> repairs

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
than you're actually doing any repairs

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.259 
than you're actually doing any repairs
next<00:02:23.470> once<00:02:23.620> you've<00:02:23.769> made<00:02:24.700> sure<00:02:24.849> the<00:02:24.940> vehicle

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
next once you've made sure the vehicle

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:26.910 
next once you've made sure the vehicle
is<00:02:25.390> nice<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.690> clean<00:02:25.870> you'll<00:02:26.470> go<00:02:26.620> ahead<00:02:26.739> and

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
is nice and clean you'll go ahead and

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.729 
is nice and clean you'll go ahead and
you'll<00:02:27.160> have<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:28.000> bucket<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:28.930> just<00:02:29.290> soap<00:02:29.620> and

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
you'll have a bucket of just soap and

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.710 
you'll have a bucket of just soap and
water<00:02:29.830> basically<00:02:30.280> what<00:02:30.489> I<00:02:30.519> use<00:02:30.790> is<00:02:31.090> just<00:02:31.390> a

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
water basically what I use is just a

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.540 
water basically what I use is just a
regular<00:02:31.840> car<00:02:32.290> wash<00:02:32.470> soap<00:02:32.709> but<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:33.069> can<00:02:33.310> use<00:02:33.430> it

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
regular car wash soap but you can use it

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.309 
regular car wash soap but you can use it
for<00:02:33.640> lubricant<00:02:34.090> if<00:02:34.690> you<00:02:34.810> do<00:02:34.930> buy<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.110> kit

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
for lubricant if you do buy the kit

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.509 
for lubricant if you do buy the kit
sometimes<00:02:35.650> it<00:02:35.739> does<00:02:35.860> come<00:02:36.040> with<00:02:36.069> lubricant

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
sometimes it does come with lubricant

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.589 
sometimes it does come with lubricant
itself<00:02:36.819> and<00:02:38.040> for<00:02:39.040> soap<00:02:39.280> I<00:02:39.459> wouldn't<00:02:40.420> recommend

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
itself and for soap I wouldn't recommend

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:41.970 
itself and for soap I wouldn't recommend
using<00:02:40.840> dish<00:02:41.049> soap<00:02:41.230> either<00:02:41.470> because<00:02:41.709> it<00:02:41.860> can

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
using dish soap either because it can

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.259 
using dish soap either because it can
harm<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.280> paint<00:02:42.489> now<00:02:42.640> first<00:02:42.849> we'll<00:02:43.030> start<00:02:43.090> by

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
harm the paint now first we'll start by

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:44.280 
harm the paint now first we'll start by
doing<00:02:43.450> here<00:02:43.660> just<00:02:43.840> taking<00:02:44.019> it<00:02:44.110> from<00:02:44.170> the

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
doing here just taking it from the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.740 
doing here just taking it from the
package<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:44.890> just<00:02:45.040> give<00:02:45.190> it<00:02:45.280> a<00:02:45.340> little<00:02:45.750> squish

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
package and just give it a little squish

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.089 
package and just give it a little squish
back<00:02:46.989> and<00:02:47.230> forth<00:02:47.440> where<00:02:47.620> you<00:02:47.680> want<00:02:47.830> to<00:02:47.920> knead

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
back and forth where you want to knead

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.520 
back and forth where you want to knead
it<00:02:48.129> just<00:02:48.489> to<00:02:48.840> has<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:49.870> work<00:02:50.080> it<00:02:50.200> a<00:02:50.230> little<00:02:50.290> bit

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
it just to has to work it a little bit

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.630 
it just to has to work it a little bit
if<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:50.709> need<00:02:50.739> to<00:02:50.920> fold<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.280> then<00:02:51.340> you<00:02:51.430> can<00:02:51.549> go

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
if you need to fold it then you can go

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.170 
if you need to fold it then you can go
ahead<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:51.819> do<00:02:51.970> that

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
ahead and do that

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.729 
ahead and do that
what<00:02:52.930> I'll<00:02:52.989> do<00:02:53.110> is<00:02:53.200> make<00:02:53.380> sure<00:02:53.410> it's<00:02:53.530> well

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
what I'll do is make sure it's well

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.380 
what I'll do is make sure it's well
lubricated<00:02:53.980> well<00:02:54.400> we're<00:02:54.579> doing<00:02:54.819> this<00:02:54.940> because

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
lubricated well we're doing this because

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.850 
lubricated well we're doing this because
in<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.540> moisture<00:02:55.840> content<00:02:55.989> does<00:02:56.349> stain<00:02:56.590> and

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
in the moisture content does stain and

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.080 
in the moisture content does stain and
we'll<00:02:56.980> just<00:02:57.099> keep<00:02:57.280> doing<00:02:57.549> that<00:02:57.579> until<00:02:57.730> it's

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
we'll just keep doing that until it's

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.400 
we'll just keep doing that until it's
well<00:02:58.239> moisturized<00:02:58.450> want<00:02:59.019> to<00:02:59.079> make<00:02:59.200> sure<00:02:59.319> it

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
well moisturized want to make sure it

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.319 
well moisturized want to make sure it
doesn't<00:02:59.530> stick<00:02:59.769> to<00:02:59.890> our<00:02:59.980> hands<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:00.459> then<00:03:01.180> one

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
doesn't stick to our hands and then one

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:02.670 
doesn't stick to our hands and then one
can<00:03:01.480> go<00:03:01.630> ahead<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:02.049> then<00:03:02.140> apply<00:03:02.410> it<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.620> the

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
can go ahead and then apply it to the

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.630 
can go ahead and then apply it to the
paint<00:03:02.860> now<00:03:03.130> we<00:03:03.220> just<00:03:03.310> want<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:03.519> make<00:03:03.610> sure

paint now we just want to make sure

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.280 
paint now we just want to make sure
there's<00:03:03.849> a<00:03:03.940> flat<00:03:04.120> spot<00:03:04.390> on<00:03:04.569> here<00:03:04.780> we'll<00:03:05.019> do<00:03:05.170> it

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
there's a flat spot on here we'll do it

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.360 
there's a flat spot on here we'll do it
just<00:03:05.319> stick<00:03:05.590> it<00:03:05.680> on<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:05.860> pan<00:03:06.010> here<00:03:06.190> you<00:03:06.250> can

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
just stick it on the pan here you can

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.680 
just stick it on the pan here you can
see<00:03:06.519> I<00:03:06.549> have<00:03:06.760> already<00:03:06.910> well<00:03:07.150> lubed<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.510> area

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
see I have already well lubed the area

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.660 
see I have already well lubed the area
if<00:03:07.750> you<00:03:07.810> do<00:03:07.900> find<00:03:08.049> the<00:03:08.200> areas<00:03:08.470> drying<00:03:08.890> you<00:03:09.610> can

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
if you do find the areas drying you can

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.220 
if you do find the areas drying you can
go<00:03:09.849> ahead<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.209> apply<00:03:10.269> more<00:03:10.629> lubricant<00:03:11.079> what

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
go ahead and apply more lubricant what

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.330 
go ahead and apply more lubricant what
we<00:03:11.319> want<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:11.530> make<00:03:11.620> sure<00:03:11.680> is<00:03:11.950> there's<00:03:12.129> enough

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
we want to make sure is there's enough

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.740 
we want to make sure is there's enough
lubricant<00:03:12.700> on<00:03:12.790> here<00:03:12.970> so<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.329> bar<00:03:13.510> doesn't

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
lubricant on here so the bar doesn't

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.350 
lubricant on here so the bar doesn't
actually<00:03:14.579> stick<00:03:15.579> to<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:15.730> surface<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.299> it

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
actually stick to the surface and it

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.759 
actually stick to the surface and it
kind<00:03:16.510> of<00:03:16.569> glides<00:03:16.810> over<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.140> surface<00:03:17.530> we<00:03:17.650> will

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
kind of glides over the surface we will

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.640 
kind of glides over the surface we will
feel<00:03:18.340> it<00:03:18.370> dragging<00:03:18.849> at<00:03:18.940> times<00:03:19.180> because<00:03:20.019> there

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
feel it dragging at times because there

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.160 
feel it dragging at times because there
is<00:03:20.799> the<00:03:21.129> debris<00:03:21.459> on<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:22.000> paint<00:03:22.209> itself<00:03:22.540> but

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
is the debris on the paint itself but

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.809 
is the debris on the paint itself but
then<00:03:23.290> after<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.980> debris<00:03:24.250> is<00:03:24.340> removed<00:03:24.370> you<00:03:24.760> can

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
then after the debris is removed you can

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.729 
then after the debris is removed you can
feel<00:03:25.060> it<00:03:25.180> does<00:03:25.359> go<00:03:25.900> over<00:03:25.930> quite<00:03:26.290> smoothly<00:03:28.739> then

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
feel it does go over quite smoothly then

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.289 
feel it does go over quite smoothly then
see<00:03:30.010> you<00:03:30.280> can<00:03:30.459> see<00:03:30.609> there's<00:03:30.790> a<00:03:30.850> little<00:03:31.000> bit<00:03:31.209> of

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
see you can see there's a little bit of

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.479 
see you can see there's a little bit of
dirt<00:03:31.480> within<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.290> bar<00:03:32.859> itself<00:03:33.130> so<00:03:33.280> we<00:03:33.340> can<00:03:33.430> see

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
dirt within the bar itself so we can see

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:34.949 
dirt within the bar itself so we can see
there's<00:03:33.639> a<00:03:33.730> little<00:03:33.880> bit<00:03:33.970> dirt<00:03:34.150> on<00:03:34.510> there<00:03:34.840> what

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
there's a little bit dirt on there what

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.770 
there's a little bit dirt on there what
we<00:03:35.049> can<00:03:35.200> do<00:03:35.349> is<00:03:35.500> go<00:03:35.620> ahead<00:03:35.739> like<00:03:35.980> this<00:03:36.780> again

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
we can do is go ahead like this again

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.949 
we can do is go ahead like this again
find<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.319> clean<00:03:38.530> spot<00:03:39.000> make<00:03:40.000> a<00:03:40.030> flat<00:03:40.299> area<00:03:40.690> go

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
find a clean spot make a flat area go

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.319 
find a clean spot make a flat area go
ahead<00:03:41.200> remoisturize<00:03:41.769> the<00:03:42.160> surface<00:03:42.549> and<00:03:42.760> then

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
ahead remoisturize the surface and then

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.660 
ahead remoisturize the surface and then
go<00:03:43.810> ahead<00:03:44.109> and<00:03:44.349> continue<00:03:44.560> rubbing<00:03:45.069> it<00:03:45.190> to

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
go ahead and continue rubbing it to

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.909 
go ahead and continue rubbing it to
remove<00:03:45.880> any<00:03:46.000> of<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.359> debris<00:03:46.810> on<00:03:46.989> there<00:03:47.230> now<00:03:47.709> if

to<00:03:49.690> do<00:03:49.780> this<00:03:49.900> in<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.139> shade<00:03:50.290> as<00:03:50.470> well<00:03:50.620> because

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
to do this in the shade as well because

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.089 
to do this in the shade as well because
the<00:03:51.010> sunlight<00:03:51.220> can<00:03:51.880> dry<00:03:52.209> any<00:03:52.419> the<00:03:53.099> lubricant

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
the sunlight can dry any the lubricant

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.770 
the sunlight can dry any the lubricant
you<00:03:54.160> do<00:03:54.250> have<00:03:54.370> on<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.519> surface<00:03:54.880> now<00:03:55.569> if<00:03:55.690> you

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.620 
come with the clay bar kit you just go
ahead<00:03:59.709> and<00:04:00.040> keep<00:04:00.250> spraying<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.209> surface<00:04:01.540> to

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
ahead and keep spraying the surface to

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.020 
ahead and keep spraying the surface to
ensure<00:04:01.750> it<00:04:01.989> is<00:04:02.079> well<00:04:02.230> lubricated<00:04:02.910> whenever<00:04:03.910> it

ensure it is well lubricated whenever it
is<00:04:04.120> required<00:04:04.989> I<00:04:05.560> just<00:04:05.889> to<00:04:05.950> ensure<00:04:06.130> that<00:04:06.250> it

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
is required I just to ensure that it

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.409 
is required I just to ensure that it
doesn't<00:04:06.519> stick<00:04:06.730> to<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:06.910> paint<00:04:07.090> and<00:04:07.209> glides

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:07.419 
doesn't stick to the paint and glides

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:08.520 
doesn't stick to the paint and glides
over<00:04:07.510> service<00:04:07.930> quite<00:04:08.079> nicely

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
over service quite nicely

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.289 
over service quite nicely
now<00:04:08.620> when<00:04:08.769> rubbing<00:04:09.069> the<00:04:09.160> bar<00:04:09.340> on<00:04:09.579> the<00:04:09.940> panels

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
now when rubbing the bar on the panels

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.000 
now when rubbing the bar on the panels
here<00:04:10.450> you<00:04:10.989> just<00:04:11.079> have<00:04:11.260> to<00:04:11.380> apply<00:04:11.440> very<00:04:11.799> light

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
here you just have to apply very light

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.699 
here you just have to apply very light
pressure<00:04:12.250> maybe<00:04:13.209> even<00:04:13.510> medium<00:04:13.870> pressure<00:04:14.079> you

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
pressure maybe even medium pressure you

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.080 
pressure maybe even medium pressure you
wanted<00:04:14.919> to<00:04:14.980> be<00:04:15.099> too<00:04:15.220> excessive<00:04:15.669> with<00:04:15.819> it<00:04:15.970> and

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
wanted to be too excessive with it and

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.670 
wanted to be too excessive with it and
it<00:04:16.150> just<00:04:16.299> glides<00:04:16.419> over<00:04:16.840> the<00:04:16.959> surface<00:04:17.380> and<00:04:17.470> will

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
it just glides over the surface and will

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.800 
it just glides over the surface and will
remove<00:04:18.400> any<00:04:18.639> of<00:04:18.789> the<00:04:18.940> contaminants<00:04:19.660> that<00:04:19.720> are

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
hood you do have to be careful with a

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.210 
hood you do have to be careful with a
clay<00:04:36.820> bar<00:04:37.000> because<00:04:37.180> it<00:04:37.270> can<00:04:37.390> stick<00:04:37.630> to<00:04:37.720> it<00:04:37.750> and

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
clay bar because it can stick to it and

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.620 
clay bar because it can stick to it and
what<00:04:39.220> can<00:04:39.340> happen<00:04:39.490> just<00:04:39.790> get<00:04:39.910> cut<00:04:40.060> stuck<00:04:40.510> in

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
what can happen just get cut stuck in

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.850 
what can happen just get cut stuck in
these<00:04:40.690> little<00:04:40.870> grooves<00:04:41.200> here<00:04:41.470> and<00:04:41.590> then<00:04:41.680> it

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
these little grooves here and then it

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.620 
these little grooves here and then it
can<00:04:42.040> be<00:04:42.130> very<00:04:42.310> hard<00:04:42.520> to<00:04:42.550> clean<00:04:42.790> afterwards<00:04:43.330> so

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
can be very hard to clean afterwards so

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.870 
can be very hard to clean afterwards so
even<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.440> same<00:04:44.650> goes<00:04:44.860> for<00:04:44.890> even<00:04:45.460> stone<00:04:45.640> chips

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
even the same goes for even stone chips

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.700 
even the same goes for even stone chips
or<00:04:46.000> rough<00:04:46.270> spots<00:04:46.540> if<00:04:47.170> you<00:04:47.290> do<00:04:47.380> find<00:04:47.500> that's

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
or rough spots if you do find that's

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.840 
or rough spots if you do find that's
happening<00:04:47.980> what<00:04:48.100> you<00:04:48.160> can<00:04:48.340> do<00:04:48.460> is<00:04:48.580> just<00:04:48.700> go

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
happening what you can do is just go

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:49.890

stick it on the surface and it'll pull

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.470 
stick it on the surface and it'll pull
it<00:04:51.580> out<00:04:51.640> all<00:04:51.760> those<00:04:51.850> cracks<00:04:52.120> and<00:04:52.300> you<00:04:52.360> should
