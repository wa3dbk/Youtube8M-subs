00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.889
 yes we make riding space clearly shows how they 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.900
 see here and we do too 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.509
 borders for ride places you 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.779
 can also see here, yes , long before 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.760
 Things bothered me so much 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.130
 My daughter who says paper makes 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.260
 but what the riding place works 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.680
 not at that time there were only sands or 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.590
 sand mixed and well in spring 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.000
 Autumn filled with puddles in the summer 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.680
 and in winter it was not at all 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.030
 possible 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.370
 and as a civil engineer I wanted 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.000
 actually just improve the sand and 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.309
 after some try and agree 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.300
 I then search in the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.140
 automotive industry 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.140
 this carpet found this material 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:56.699
 What I'm working on finally 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.750
 to it then as an account on the riding field 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.590
 bring to 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.769
 on one of me also in the whole system 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:07.020
 developed under construction we 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.500
 have different than before we only have 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.590
 another layer of one 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.780
 gravel a mineral mixture age and 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.259
 right there we pack our us 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.470
 ground so that got the next 15 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.049
 years and much to the delight of course 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.939
 horses and riders the riders do not have 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.979
 more work to do in this place 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.189
 r does not freeze in the summer 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.630
 winter not very important yes and the 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.509
 Of course, horses feel very much the same 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.790
 Flat on this elastic material 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.869
 You just realize that the 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.270
 horses go better 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.020
 beautiful run more momentum unfolding 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.700
 have and are healthy longer 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.009
 I actually have that feedback 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.619
 I actually joined in these 15 years 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.420
 all my former also newer 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.189
 customers would like to see again and again 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.320
 and hello he thinks I'm glad 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.810
 just my horses, I'm fine 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.640
 feel good on it and also the 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.220
 feedback in the internet are getting 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.500
 actually all the people are positive 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.740
 really satisfied with the material and 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.990
 I think also endangers that was one of the 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.370
 the premises had to have big premises 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.890
 be environmentally friendly 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.010
 it is also we keep up with this 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.280
 Material documented by analysis 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.650
 an environmental laboratory that is extremely strict 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.490
 Conditions of drinking water protection 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.160
 Ordinance a 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.930
 that means the material is less 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.150
 pollutants than the drinking water 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.650
 protection ordinance permits it and that 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.260
 we document through this analysis 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.420
 we also on the internet to the internet 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.850
 and in the field of 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.100
 Environmental compatibility also belongs to the 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.430
 Compatibility with humans and 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.220
 animal the dusts in quotes 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.930
 which gives off this material are so big 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.700
 that they hang in the outer clouds 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.540
 stay or believe again 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.270
 come out 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.250
 in contrast to sand, they die very much 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.330
 are much finer and ultimately up 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.700
 in the last lung 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.310
 go in there and still lie there 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.489
 So we stay that way too 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.549
 a much healthier material than 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.910
 a conventional sand yard yes account 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.980
 our second product is actually out 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.799
 born of a situation 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.959
 I am always asked outside what 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.120
 let's go for our riding lessons 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.940
 limit and there I had line 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.110
 satisfactory answer but the best 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.330
 Constructions seen from 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.860
 railway sleepers to breastfeeding 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.840
 guardrails and if you look 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.760
 Imagine what happens if there someone 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.450
 On it falls the thought I want 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.940
 Do not play to the end and there is nothing 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.190
 gave what you could really do what 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.320
 also my safety requirements 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.750
 I sat down and said something 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.260
 developed and invented patent 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.690
 to let 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.110
 yes, and now we have with us today 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.090
 surround the material and the border 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.690
 as I imagined 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:08.530
 simple system of so walking is 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.810
 The two parts of the foot will be on the 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.880
 raw soil put the gravel of the 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.470
 riding field will be applied then will 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.840
 the riding sheet flooring applied 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.720
 And last but not least, you put one 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.620
 just the hoods on top 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.430
 yes and then we have one 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.650
 appealing to you 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.960
 a responsive and secure border 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.810
 on this border may also quiet times 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.430
 the girl of the horse fall without 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.650
 that it is clavicle or 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.419
 worse breaks that will get up 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.340
 laugh and get on the horse again 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.650
 and that's exactly what I wanted 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.500
 safety for horse and rider that 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.380
 material gives after first of all 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.910
 click it up and give anyway 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:52.550
 because it is in the core of styrofoam so 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.960
 so soft is set so no 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.289
 cause injury 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.370
 The horses recognize this blog as 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.490
 obstacle 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.680
 they stay so do not turn over 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.479
 railway sleepers on top and can 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.759
 hurt yourself but turn 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:11.270
 actually want to flee over it 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:14.180
 actually do not jump 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:17.120
 scheduled contact with horse yes ours 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.870
 company we distribute the lining and the 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:24.919
 bordering the lining again so that 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:26.960
 We currently have enormous delivery times 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:29.060
 the result is that we do not 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.690
 can get enough raw material 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:36.710
 because the time will remedy created 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:39.409
 We currently deliver about two places per person 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:43.010
 week of two normal places per week 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:46.669
 and actually want that to about 3 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.889
 to increase 4 demand is there so 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:53.599
 insofar we will reach that there 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:57.039
 the round the border we have 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:06:01.599
 since then nine months in the program and 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:06.009
 since the first about 5000 meters 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:08.240
 delivered increasing trend 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:11.030
 maybe not quite as blatantly rising 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.340
 as with account but I think that we 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.330
 as well as a significant increase rates 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.330
 to be experienced
