00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
anymore you're guarding it quits but

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.449 
anymore you're guarding it quits but
you've<00:01:52.200> only<00:01:52.409> had<00:01:52.740> one<00:01:53.009> day<00:01:54.200> know<00:01:55.200> what<00:01:56.159> ran

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459 
you've only had one day know what ran

you've only had one day know what ran
means<00:01:57.000> i<00:01:57.240> think<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.140> might<00:01:58.679> be<00:01:58.920> best<00:01:59.129> if<00:01:59.399> the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
means i think is it might be best if the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.380 
means i think is it might be best if the
two<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.539> us<00:02:01.489> didn't<00:02:02.489> go<00:02:02.640> out<00:02:02.789> with<00:02:03.829> well<00:02:04.829> you
