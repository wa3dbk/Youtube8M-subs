anything other than optical zoom at all
but<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.150> way<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.450> clear<00:01:28.719> image<00:01:28.960> zoom<00:01:29.200> works

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.340 
but the way the clear image zoom works
is<00:01:29.890> that<00:01:30.250> it<00:01:30.429> creates<00:01:30.700> new<00:01:31.060> pixels<00:01:31.659> based<00:01:32.140> on

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
is that it creates new pixels based on

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.590 
is that it creates new pixels based on
