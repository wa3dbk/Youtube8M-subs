00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.319
 and when guys girls here foxconn a 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.690
 new analysis 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:09.580
 this time we will obviously analyze the two 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.799
 live action trailers that we could see the 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.289
 which yesterday to see 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.539
 completely subtitled to Spanish 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:19.599
 click on the images that appear 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:22.210
 Let 's start with the screen trailer 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.980
 loc the first one that came out and the first 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.539
 what we see in this trailer is that the 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.570
 scenario that surrounds it is 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:32.259
 completely destroyed and what to 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.820
 walk says the conquering hero this 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.510
 refers to the image you want 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.789
 keep it or in s / c the master boss 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.890
 also while what this phrase says 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:44.680
 we can see a statue of the master chief 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.230
 later on and in front of this we can 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.809
 see the boss lying on the ground with a 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.699
 serious injury to his armor almost to the 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.280
 end of the trailer we can see that what 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:57.340
 try to protect the boss's reputation 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.550
 teacher since this one when turning towards the 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.679
 statue says let's see it always like you and 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.300
 then he flips the boss lying on the ground 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:07.820
 and says no 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.340
 the interesting thing here is that what seems 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.350
 have a bitter hatred against the boss and what 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.050
 see as a traitor so probably 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.500
 whoever is firing the bullet in the 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.870
 trailer bullet is what also having 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.880
 consider the events of the iphone these 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.830
 They transformed to loc through those 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.870
 who betrayed him this implies 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.720
 that the look will not show any 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.180
 compassion with the boss now well 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.630
 while what is getting closer to the boss 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.540
 we can see a scene where you see the hd 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.450
 of loc and we see that the armor of this one 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.700
 It is halfway and bullets from his of 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.310
 m &amp; r that by the way in the picture they put 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.430
 a green but good we see that the bullets 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.230
 of this rifle are very few this wants 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.800
 say that there was obviously a battle 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:57.050
 between him and the boss recently a 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.940
 parentheses once we finish 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.460
 analyze the two trailers we will do some 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.920
 how many comparisons and we'll talk about 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.370
 scenario where they are now yes 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.619
 let's continue with the master boss's trailer 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.020
 once again we see the same city the 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.200
 same 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.320
 and the same characters just now 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.870
 the boss and the agent changed his role 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.810
 the boss is the victor and what is 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.090
 on the ground defeated in this trailer the 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.880
 master boss says everything you've done 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.250
 committed everything you've done was worth 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.220
 it's worth it that means that what 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.340
 is misinformed and cheated of some 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.350
 way in any way the boss is 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.060
 as determined to kill him as what 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.400
 I was about to kill the boss in the previous 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.640
 trailer this means that one sees the 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.260
 another as an enemy as an obstacle or 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.480
 as a traitor 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.849
 in this trailer we also got a 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.189
 better view of the statue of the boss and 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.860
 we see that it is falling apart 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:57.989
 it could mean that the boss does not 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.989
 it matters what people think of him and 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.310
 has decided to be his own person 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.860
 considering that at the end of halo 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.530
 4 the master teacher realizes that he does not 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.560
 is a machine then the answer 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.450
 would be that in effect if like the 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.609
 trailer of what when we see the viewer 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.890
 of the boss we can see that his shield is 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:20.250
 down and that also your assault rifle 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.870
 does not have many bullets this only reinforces 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.500
 the theory that there was a fight between 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:28.530
 the 2 spartan recently at the end of the 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.170
 boss's trailer this says his mission 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.209
 just started what mission you are referring to 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.000
 bring back to cortana to destroy 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.849
 some installation four runner that still 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.769
 it is not known now that we have analyzed the 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.950
 content of the two trailers is 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.530
 analyze the scene remember the art 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.470
 conceptual of 3-4-3 published long ago 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.540
 time in the trailer what we can 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.720
 see a structure that is practically 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.680
 equal to that of conceptual art judge 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.930
 for yourselves 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.370
 also to have two theories of 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.829
 scenario where the 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.200
 characters in the trailer of the loc and the 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:08.140
 boss we can see what seem to be two 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.439
 moons remember that planet nen universe 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.719
 of halo has two moons so is the 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:16.600
 natal planet of the Felix chang helios 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:19.060
 this should be the stage where 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.609
 find the boss and what finally 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.380
 another detail that we see on stage 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.300
 as such is that we can see what 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.509
 it seems to be the infinite and totally 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.210
 destroyed in flames will be that the boss 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:33.970
 teacher will be the cause of it and for 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.220
 that what you want to kill him who knows 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.310
 leave your theories in the box 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.169
 comments now that we're done 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.610
 analyze the scenario where 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.620
 find these characters 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.930
 we go with the setting of the 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.690
 trailers the main difference between 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.449
 the two is that in the log trailer the 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.820
 environment is much clearer blue co 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:58.120
 just like your viewer plus the 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:01.150
 Boss statue has no harm in 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.610
 change in the master boss's trailer the 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.830
 atmosphere is much 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.990
 orange like your viewer with a lot 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.330
 haze besides the statue of the 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:14.470
 master boss is a lot more 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:16.150
 destroyed the most reasonable theory is that 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.760
 in the video of what the statue of the 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.150
 boss is intact because that's how the 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.770
 ong is wanted to be the image of the boss 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:27.010
 perfect as a nerve without any 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.290
 defect in the boss's video instead 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:32.470
 the statue is much more destroyed 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:35.320
 because that's how it really is like what 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.150
 sees the un as a traitor the reputation 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.760
 of the boss and is on the floor in 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.400
 reality is for this reason that is 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.529
 much more destroyed or it may be 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.439
 other 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:48.239
 finally as data the two trailers 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:51.719
 they end up revealing the departure date 

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:54.419
 of the five which is the next 27 of 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:56.579
 October with this I finish my analysis of 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.679
 the live action trailers I hope that they 

00:05:56.579 --> 00:06:00.659
 have liked already know how to put their 

00:05:58.679 --> 00:06:02.729
 opinions in the comments boxes 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:04.799
 also apologize that there was no 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:07.049
 Yesterday I answered many of you but 

00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:09.329
 I was somewhat stressed with all this and 

00:06:07.049 --> 00:06:11.699
 all the news but good as it is 

00:06:09.329 --> 00:06:13.889
 all your comments are very good 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:18.199
 received already know that my name is fox 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:18.199
 and see you until the next kicks
