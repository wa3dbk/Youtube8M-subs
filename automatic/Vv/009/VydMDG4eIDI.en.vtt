I<00:00:26.390> think<00:00:26.900> I'll<00:00:26.990> be<00:00:27.109> more<00:00:27.289> anxious<00:00:27.500> at<00:00:28.070> the

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
I think I'll be more anxious at the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.950 
I think I'll be more anxious at the
Olympics<00:00:28.550> than<00:00:28.820> nervous<00:00:29.179> and<00:00:29.419> the<00:00:29.480> stakes<00:00:29.749> are

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
Olympics than nervous and the stakes are

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.470 
Olympics than nervous and the stakes are
a<00:00:30.140> lot<00:00:30.349> higher<00:00:30.410> because<00:00:31.220> it's<00:00:32.119> a<00:00:32.150> tournament

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
a lot higher because it's a tournament

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.080 
a lot higher because it's a tournament
that<00:00:32.689> happens<00:00:33.260> every<00:00:33.469> four<00:00:33.680> years<00:00:33.950> so<00:00:34.760> you<00:00:34.820> get

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
that happens every four years so you get

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.510

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
them and if you do them right your first

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.969 
them and if you do them right your first
two<00:01:22.759> steps<00:01:22.970> are<00:01:23.180> really<00:01:23.420> explosive<00:01:23.979> and

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
two steps are really explosive and

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
pressure when it comes to them

it a lot easier I think you lose a match
and<00:01:49.979> your<00:01:50.520> kids<00:01:50.760> are<00:01:50.909> there<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.210> then<00:01:51.299> come<00:01:51.479> on
