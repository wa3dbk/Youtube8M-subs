you<00:03:02.200> can<00:03:02.410> make<00:03:02.650> it<00:03:02.800> a<00:03:02.890> game<00:03:03.100> and<00:03:03.370> have<00:03:03.580> them

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
you can make it a game and have them

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.640 
you can make it a game and have them
move<00:03:03.970> around<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.420> cage<00:03:04.690> looking<00:03:05.230> for<00:03:05.440> food

for different devices inquisitive pieces
that<00:03:09.730> they<00:03:09.880> have<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.270> determine<00:03:10.780> how<00:03:11.080> they

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
that they have to determine how they

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.449 
that they have to determine how they
work<00:03:11.530> there<00:03:11.770> are<00:03:11.830> some<00:03:11.980> of<00:03:12.070> them<00:03:12.160> are<00:03:12.340> quite

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
work there are some of them are quite

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:13.400 
work there are some of them are quite
mechanical

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
mechanical

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.890 
mechanical
and<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:14.280> birds<00:03:14.520> some<00:03:15.120> of<00:03:15.180> them<00:03:15.270> are<00:03:15.390> Houdini's

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
and the birds some of them are Houdini's

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.600 
and the birds some of them are Houdini's
they<00:03:16.200> can<00:03:16.590> get<00:03:16.710> out<00:03:16.860> of<00:03:16.890> their<00:03:17.070> cage<00:03:17.280> you<00:03:17.460> don't

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
they can get out of their cage you don't

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.040 
they can get out of their cage you don't
even<00:03:17.790> know<00:03:18.000> how<00:03:18.240> they<00:03:18.360> got<00:03:18.480> out<00:03:18.540> of<00:03:18.690> that<00:03:18.840> cage

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
even know how they got out of that cage

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.190 
even know how they got out of that cage
so<00:03:19.410> they<00:03:20.100> are<00:03:20.340> very<00:03:20.670> very<00:03:20.910> inclusive<00:03:21.870> and

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
a regular basis that they should be

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.300 
a regular basis that they should be
doing<00:03:41.359> one<00:03:41.989> thing<00:03:42.019> it<00:03:42.290> should<00:03:42.439> be<00:03:42.560> rotating

the profit of toys at the birds have

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.349 
the profit of toys at the birds have
they<00:03:45.530> get<00:03:45.739> they<00:03:46.040> get<00:03:46.189> forward<00:03:46.639> so<00:03:47.150> it<00:03:47.329> is

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
they get they get forward so it is

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.509 
they get they get forward so it is
important<00:03:47.900> to<00:03:47.989> have<00:03:48.170> a<00:03:48.500> group<00:03:48.889> of<00:03:49.010> toys<00:03:49.250> in<00:03:49.459> the
