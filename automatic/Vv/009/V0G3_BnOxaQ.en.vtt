there's a little rock shelf right there
under<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.060> water<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:56.390> that<00:01:56.930> current<00:01:57.170> is

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
under the water and that current is

under the water and that current is
washing<00:01:57.800> over<00:01:58.039> the<00:01:58.130> top<00:01:58.340> of<00:01:58.490> that<00:01:58.610> little

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
washing over the top of that little

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.370 
washing over the top of that little
shelf<00:01:59.090> and<00:01:59.330> they<00:01:59.360> got<00:01:59.539> a<00:01:59.570> nice<00:01:59.780> already<00:02:00.140> down

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380

there<00:02:00.410> that<00:02:01.340> they<00:02:01.460> can<00:02:01.610> sit<00:02:01.820> in<00:02:01.970> and<00:02:02.149> wait<00:02:02.270> on

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
there that they can sit in and wait on

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.779 
there that they can sit in and wait on
bait<00:02:02.630> to<00:02:02.840> wash<00:02:03.110> by<00:02:03.350> so<00:02:04.220> that's<00:02:04.399> kind<00:02:04.610> of<00:02:04.640> what
