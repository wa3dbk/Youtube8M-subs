barrier and then shoots at our I mean

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.920 
barrier and then shoots at our I mean
I'm<00:01:38.159> happy<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.640> he<00:01:38.939> wasn't<00:01:39.150> no<00:01:39.360> submissive

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930

them but I felt like that entire tray of

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.590 
them but I felt like that entire tray of
his<00:01:43.860> characters<00:01:44.340> did<00:01:44.579> not<00:01:44.759> sit<00:01:45.240> right<00:01:45.450> with<00:01:45.540> me
