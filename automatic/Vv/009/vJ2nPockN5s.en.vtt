00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.150
 hello to everyone so I wish you 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.670
 present the pro borders filter of 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.309
 at acqua mira a filter very very 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.900
 known whose reputation is no longer 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.790
 make 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.470
 so a very very very ingenious filter 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.730
 and performing of course it goes without saying 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.359
 since it's still what we tell him 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.580
 ask then this one is mine so 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.010
 he has already served and in addition he is of 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.760
 gray color and the one that will be present 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.520
 on my site and the exactly the same 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:38.719
 if they enthrall the pro border but 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.719
 khaki color sees the only difference 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.410
 so very ingenious filter for 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.560
 various reasons 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.870
 so he comes with an adapter that goes 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:52.310
 allow I'll show you that all to 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:57.800
 time to plug the filter on various 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:01:02.600
 bottleneck so that's first thing in 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:06.530
 besides on this adapter if we can 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:11.140
 connect a straw that will allow 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.700
 drink directly at water points or 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:18.229
 well of a container whatever they are 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:22.210
 of course then every filter is 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.210
 delivered with 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.800
 four pre cotton filter like like 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.770
 this one so 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.500
 Brazil trance mimetic pre filter 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.000
 water which increases on the one hand 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.980
 the filtration power and secondly 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.700
 prevents the main element of 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:47.140
 filter clogs up our astros centers 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:50.580
 so then an adapter and a second 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:54.580
 adapter always with after filter 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.100
 which will allow him to connect the 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.890
 filter either on a classic trio or 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.729
 on water pocket systems such as 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.860
 camel bag source 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.660
 she's embarrassing etc etc so since 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.620
 these systems varies slightly from one 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.930
 pocket to another we have here a little 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:23.569
 another small penon adapter can 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:26.120
 remove for the filter to adapt to 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.079
 plugging the water pouch and therefore 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.099
 Once plug them into the skin in 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:33.139
 they will have the opportunity either through 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:36.709
 the end to the beautiful beard with a ball 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:39.499
 vafc or beat are worth for those who 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.549
 do not understand my accent this is it 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:44.080
 a city ​​you probably know 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:46.360
 very well who does that when we 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.800
 dead at this place if or in any case 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.380
 apply pressure and it's in 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.740
 this place so well at that moment we 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.310
 see you the water flows otherwise it's 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:02.230
 impossible 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:10.110
 so now here is small 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:10.110
 demonstration with a bottle 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.620
 so here I am the dap simply to 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.620
 my job 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.920
 and there it will suffice me 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:41.980
 to bite the size of bullets and 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:41.980
 drink so very very ingenious besides 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.140
 in addition and it's interesting 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:52.360
 especially with the next ones to 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:54.640
 of two substantial volumes and with 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.180
 your adapter or not we will be able 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.650
 use the filter by gravitation and 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.530
 to do this 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:08.230
 so that they are free flowing 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:10.960
 we will remove the ball and that's the 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.730
 filtration this alone and we recover 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.940
 so then in a container etc 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.190
 you understood the principle 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:25.630
 then it will simply be enough 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:29.230
 give it back and so here 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:34.169
 our borders takes a super filter 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:36.430
 super super ingenious and especially 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.500
 recognized and used by 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.850
 professionals since already very 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.240
 a long time and besides in this case 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.160
 by some weapons and that's fine 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.630
 listen 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.390
 thank you for your attention I think 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.900
 you have a balanced jazz overview 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:58.590
 psychological seeds of spirit 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.590
 so see you soon ciao
