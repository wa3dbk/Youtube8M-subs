third measure we're going to start to

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.490 
third measure we're going to start to
see<00:03:43.640> a<00:03:44.090> theme<00:03:44.480> that's<00:03:44.720> going<00:03:44.870> to<00:03:45.019> happen<00:03:45.349> for

see a theme that's going to happen for
the<00:03:45.650> next<00:03:46.269> probably<00:03:47.269> eight<00:03:47.510> to<00:03:48.140> twelve<00:03:48.410> bars

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
the next probably eight to twelve bars

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.479 
the next probably eight to twelve bars
and<00:03:49.160> that's<00:03:49.280> kind<00:03:49.549> of<00:03:49.610> a<00:03:50.410> legato<00:03:51.410> which<00:03:52.280> just

means<00:03:52.730> smooth<00:03:53.500> sliding<00:03:54.500> type<00:03:55.040> technique<00:03:55.879> so

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
means smooth sliding type technique so

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.620 
means smooth sliding type technique so
let's<00:03:56.269> look<00:03:56.420> their<00:03:56.599> measure<00:03:56.870> three<00:03:57.349> it<00:03:57.890> starts

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
let's look their measure three it starts

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.900 
let's look their measure three it starts
with<00:03:59.630> just<00:03:59.900> that<00:04:00.200> and<00:04:00.739> D<00:04:01.040> note<00:04:01.310> down<00:04:01.519> there<00:04:01.730> the

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
with just that and D note down there the

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.720 
with just that and D note down there the
D<00:04:02.060> string<00:04:02.329> and<00:04:02.690> then<00:04:03.500> I'm<00:04:03.950> going<00:04:04.370> to<00:04:04.400> slide

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
D string and then I'm going to slide
