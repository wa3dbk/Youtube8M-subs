reason for that is to have our second

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:19.650 
reason for that is to have our second
battery<00:00:15.340> so<00:00:16.340> there<00:00:17.330> are<00:00:17.420> four<00:00:18.170> connection

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
battery so there are four connection

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:27.160 
battery so there are four connection
this<00:00:20.660> one<00:00:20.900> is<00:00:21.019> the<00:00:21.670> ignition<00:00:22.670> wire<00:00:23.210> see

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.560 

ignition

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
so one is from the Ignatian second one

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:40.270 
so one is from the Ignatian second one
is<00:00:34.340> the<00:00:34.489> ground<00:00:35.030> goes<00:00:35.750> to<00:00:35.960> your<00:00:36.079> chassis<00:00:39.280> this

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
is the ground goes to your chassis this

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.560 
is the ground goes to your chassis this
cable

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
cable

starter car and in case the main battery

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.000 
starter car and in case the main battery
is<00:01:44.610> dead<00:01:45.920> so<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:47.960> use<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.260> battery<00:01:49.560> to

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010
