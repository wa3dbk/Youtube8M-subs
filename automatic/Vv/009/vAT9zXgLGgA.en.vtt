it's<00:00:10.500> been<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.650> couple<00:00:10.830> of<00:00:10.950> days<00:00:11.099> since<00:00:11.309> the

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
it's been a couple of days since the

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.089 
it's been a couple of days since the
patch<00:00:11.849> actually<00:00:12.059> came<00:00:12.389> out<00:00:12.509> so<00:00:12.889> like<00:00:13.889> I've<00:00:14.009> had

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
patch actually came out so like I've had

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.530 
patch actually came out so like I've had
a<00:00:14.160> little<00:00:14.309> bit<00:00:14.519> more<00:00:14.670> experience<00:00:15.179> with<00:00:15.330> it

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
a little bit more experience with it

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.109 
a little bit more experience with it
although<00:00:15.960> there's<00:00:16.230> really<00:00:16.410> not<00:00:16.619> much<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:17.119> have

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
although there's really not much to have

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.000 
although there's really not much to have
experience<00:00:18.720> with<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:20.390> yeah<00:00:23.300> basically<00:00:24.300> though

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
experience with it yeah basically though

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.679 
experience with it yeah basically though
the<00:00:26.010> boss<00:00:26.189> arena<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.670> actually<00:00:27.090> really<00:00:27.420> good

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
the boss arena is actually really good

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.960 
the boss arena is actually really good
for<00:00:27.869> classes<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.349> don't<00:00:28.980> already<00:00:29.340> have<00:00:29.519> a

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
for classes that don't already have a

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.569 
for classes that don't already have a
emblem<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:31.080> class<00:00:31.439> specific<00:00:31.980> emblem<00:00:32.340> and

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
emblem a class specific emblem and

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.750 
emblem a class specific emblem and
that's<00:00:33.510> because<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.829> boss<00:00:35.160> arena<00:00:35.460> will

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
that's because the boss arena will

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.880 
that's because the boss arena will
actually<00:00:36.090> get<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:37.670> emblem<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.890> although

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
actually get you a emblem so although

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.299 
actually get you a emblem so although
it's<00:00:41.160> only<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.670> level<00:00:41.790> 60<00:00:43.010> it's<00:00:44.010> still<00:00:44.190> pretty

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
it's only a level 60 it's still pretty

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.190 
it's only a level 60 it's still pretty
good<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:44.640> because<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.390> can<00:00:45.629> still<00:00:45.870> cube

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
good to have because you can still cube

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.770 
good to have because you can still cube
it<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.649> believe<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.520> at<00:00:47.850> least<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.510> can

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
it I believe so at least and you can

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.340 
it I believe so at least and you can
also<00:00:48.989> level<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.530> up<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:50.000> various<00:00:51.000> ranks<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:52.199> I

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
also level it up in various ranks and I

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.470 
also level it up in various ranks and I
believe<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.829> first<00:00:53.309> rank<00:00:53.699> when<00:00:54.390> you

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
believe that the first rank when you

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.099 
believe that the first rank when you
actually<00:00:54.600> get<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.230> rank<00:00:55.770> see<00:00:56.960> don't<00:00:57.960> quote

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
actually get it is rank see don't quote

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.200 
actually get it is rank see don't quote
me<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:59.010> then<00:00:59.280> they<00:00:59.370> can<00:00:59.550> get<00:00:59.640> up<00:00:59.789> or

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
me on that and then they can get up or

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.319 
me on that and then they can get up or
go<00:01:00.480> all<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.719> way<00:01:00.750> up<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.020> s+<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:01.980> believe<00:01:02.329> so

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
go all the way up to s+ I believe so

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.719 
go all the way up to s+ I believe so
with<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:05.479> at<00:01:06.479> least<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.930> was<00:01:07.200> thinking<00:01:07.470> that

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
with that at least I was thinking that

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.250 
with that at least I was thinking that
the<00:01:08.729> level<00:01:09.060> would<00:01:09.180> actually<00:01:09.510> go<00:01:09.630> up<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:10.080> or

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the level would actually go up to or

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.520 
the level would actually go up to or
something<00:01:10.680> but<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.430> guess<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.450> was<00:01:12.540> wrong

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
something but I guess I was wrong

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.090 
something but I guess I was wrong
so<00:01:14.240> I<00:01:15.240> was<00:01:15.960> kind<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.140> weird<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:17.689> I<00:01:18.830> think<00:01:19.830> I'm

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
so I was kind of weird but I think I'm

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.940 
so I was kind of weird but I think I'm
pretty<00:01:20.159> sure<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.750> stats<00:01:22.259> actually<00:01:22.770> just

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
pretty sure that the stats actually just

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.399 
pretty sure that the stats actually just
go<00:01:23.040> up<00:01:23.159> with<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.640> rank<00:01:23.880> at<00:01:24.119> least<00:01:24.330> so

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.850 

yeah<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:29.810> level<00:01:30.110> won't<00:01:30.259> go<00:01:30.409> up

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
yeah the level won't go up

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.940 
yeah the level won't go up
pretty<00:01:31.159> pretty<00:01:31.549> sure<00:01:31.789> pretty<00:01:32.450> sure<00:01:32.890> but<00:01:33.890> uh

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
pretty pretty sure pretty sure but uh

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.859 
pretty pretty sure pretty sure but uh
it's<00:01:34.820> still<00:01:35.030> worth<00:01:35.180> getting<00:01:35.570> because

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
it's still worth getting because

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.569 
it's still worth getting because
although<00:01:36.140> it's<00:01:36.350> level<00:01:36.590> 60<00:01:36.979> you<00:01:37.220> can<00:01:37.369> still

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
although it's level 60 you can still

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.359 
although it's level 60 you can still
cube<00:01:37.880> it<00:01:38.000> to<00:01:38.329> like<00:01:38.509> unique<00:01:39.289> or<00:01:39.590> legendary<00:01:40.130> or

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
cube it to like unique or legendary or

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.310 
cube it to like unique or legendary or
whatever<00:01:41.000> potentially<00:01:41.689> you<00:01:41.750> want<00:01:41.960> it<00:01:42.049> to<00:01:42.170> be

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
whatever potentially you want it to be

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.700 
whatever potentially you want it to be
and<00:01:42.590> of<00:01:43.399> course<00:01:43.810> it'll<00:01:44.810> still<00:01:45.140> be<00:01:45.259> better<00:01:45.409> than

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
and of course it'll still be better than

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.580 
and of course it'll still be better than
not<00:01:46.100> having<00:01:46.159> an<00:01:46.579> emblem<00:01:46.880> at<00:01:47.000> all<00:01:47.149> so<00:01:47.590> it's

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
not having an emblem at all so it's

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.940 
not having an emblem at all so it's
definitely<00:01:48.920> worth<00:01:49.069> getting<00:01:49.280> do<00:01:50.149> it<00:01:50.770> you<00:01:51.770> need

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
definitely worth getting do it you need

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.230 
definitely worth getting do it you need
to<00:01:51.979> do<00:01:52.220> it<00:01:52.369> ten<00:01:52.700> times

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
to do it ten times

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.480 
to do it ten times
not<00:01:53.659> not<00:01:54.170> in<00:01:54.229> a<00:01:54.439> single<00:01:54.710> day<00:01:54.829> just<00:01:55.130> ten<00:01:55.310> times

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
not not in a single day just ten times

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:05.800 
not not in a single day just ten times
total<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:56.590> you<00:01:58.149> should<00:01:59.590> get<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:04.270> and<00:02:05.270> I

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
total and you should get it and I

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.630 
total and you should get it and I
believe<00:02:06.170> that<00:02:06.200> leveling<00:02:06.740> it<00:02:06.920> up<00:02:07.069> we're

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
believe that leveling it up we're

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.949 
believe that leveling it up we're
ranking<00:02:07.970> it<00:02:08.149> up<00:02:08.269> or<00:02:08.450> whatever<00:02:08.690> you<00:02:08.750> want<00:02:08.929> to

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
ranking it up or whatever you want to

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.600 
ranking it up or whatever you want to
call<00:02:09.110> it<00:02:09.880> you<00:02:10.880> can<00:02:11.030> do<00:02:11.120> that<00:02:11.269> every<00:02:12.610> boss

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
call it you can do that every boss

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.650 
call it you can do that every boss
arenas<00:02:14.180> after<00:02:14.660> you<00:02:14.780> get<00:02:14.989> it<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:16.450> every<00:02:17.450> third

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
arenas after you get it so every third

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.750 
arenas after you get it so every third
one<00:02:18.049> should<00:02:18.799> give<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.099> scroll<00:02:19.489> thing

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
have to rank it up unless of course you

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.559 
have to rank it up unless of course you
want<00:02:35.600> added<00:02:35.900> stats<00:02:36.230> but<00:02:37.090> it's<00:02:38.090> definitely<00:02:38.209> fun

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
want added stats but it's definitely fun

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.030 
want added stats but it's definitely fun
to<00:02:38.600> do<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.459> do<00:02:40.459> of<00:02:40.790> course<00:02:40.819> check<00:02:41.239> it<00:02:41.390> out<00:02:41.540> and

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
to do and do of course check it out and

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.210 
to do and do of course check it out and
regarding<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.239> six<00:02:44.239> bosses<00:02:44.840> there<00:02:45.220> I've

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
regarding the six bosses there I've

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.099 
regarding the six bosses there I've
really<00:02:46.940> only<00:02:46.970> fought<00:02:47.480> Cygnus<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:49.930> dragon<00:02:50.930> or

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
really only fought Cygnus and dragon or

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:55.900 
really only fought Cygnus and dragon or
and<00:02:52.299> arkarium<00:02:53.299> I<00:02:53.690> fought<00:02:54.019> Cygnus<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.769> lot<00:02:55.609> more

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
and arkarium I fought Cygnus a lot more

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.390 
and arkarium I fought Cygnus a lot more
than<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.720> other<00:02:56.750> bosses<00:02:57.109> and<00:02:57.650> I've<00:02:58.190> actually

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
than the other bosses and I've actually

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
than the other bosses and I've actually
never<00:02:58.670> seen<00:02:59.000> anyone<00:02:59.329> use<00:02:59.660> Magnus<00:03:00.650> Annie<00:03:00.920> or

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
never seen anyone use Magnus Annie or

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.300 
never seen anyone use Magnus Annie or
von<00:03:02.420> Leon<00:03:02.780> so<00:03:03.260> that's<00:03:03.560> that<00:03:03.980> was<00:03:04.130> kind<00:03:04.280> of

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
von Leon so that's that was kind of

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.090 
von Leon so that's that was kind of
strange<00:03:04.549> but<00:03:05.060> I<00:03:05.420> think<00:03:06.319> it's<00:03:06.799> definitely

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
strange but I think it's definitely

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.460 
strange but I think it's definitely
worth<00:03:07.340> doing<00:03:07.910> and<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.690> Cygnus<00:03:09.079> is<00:03:09.200> pretty

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
worth doing and the Cygnus is pretty

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.390 
worth doing and the Cygnus is pretty
opaque<00:03:09.829> so<00:03:10.100> I<00:03:10.160> should<00:03:10.310> know<00:03:10.489> how<00:03:10.579> to<00:03:10.639> use<00:03:10.880> her

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
opaque so I should know how to use her

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.319 
opaque so I should know how to use her
go<00:03:13.400> with<00:03:13.519> the<00:03:13.609> right<00:03:13.760> boss

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
go with the right boss

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.770 
go with the right boss
try<00:03:14.569> to<00:03:14.630> win<00:03:14.900> get<00:03:15.500> those<00:03:15.709> wins<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:16.819> get<00:03:17.630> that

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
try to win get those wins and get that

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.559 
try to win get those wins and get that
emblem<00:03:18.049> so<00:03:18.560> I<00:03:18.920> guess<00:03:19.579> I<00:03:19.670> really<00:03:19.940> concludes<00:03:20.420> the

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
emblem so I guess I really concludes the

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.559 
emblem so I guess I really concludes the
video<00:03:21.160> if<00:03:22.160> it<00:03:22.370> wasn't<00:03:22.639> too<00:03:22.730> long<00:03:22.910> just<00:03:22.970> kind<00:03:23.540> of

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
video if it wasn't too long just kind of

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.410 
video if it wasn't too long just kind of
wanted<00:03:23.840> to<00:03:23.870> make<00:03:23.989> it<00:03:24.609> specific<00:03:25.609> and<00:03:26.209> just

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
wanted to make it specific and just

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.140 
wanted to make it specific and just
straight<00:03:26.630> to<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.900> points<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:27.590> well<00:03:28.250> thanks

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
straight to the points and well thanks

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
there will be more videos I promise

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.430 
there will be more videos I promise
and<00:03:35.310> there's<00:03:35.700> actually<00:03:36.270> gonna<00:03:36.780> be<00:03:36.960> videos<00:03:37.260> on

and there's actually gonna be videos on
my<00:03:37.620> other<00:03:38.100> channel<00:03:38.340> too<00:03:38.910> I<00:03:39.150> guess<00:03:39.330> I<00:03:39.540> should

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
my other channel too I guess I should

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.200 
my other channel too I guess I should
probably<00:03:39.870> talk<00:03:40.200> about<00:03:40.500> that<00:03:40.740> I<00:03:41.190> actually<00:03:42.000> have

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
probably talk about that I actually have

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.030 
probably talk about that I actually have
a<00:03:42.240> gaming<00:03:42.510> channel<00:03:42.660> similar<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.770> Ark<00:03:43.980> but<00:03:44.340> I
