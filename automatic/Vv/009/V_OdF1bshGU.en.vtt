 I see here is the most 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.640
 important

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.830

 If you leave it there flat, you're in the box. 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:42.010
 he ends up charging there with him 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.860

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.340

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.340
 now I just have to want to leave 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.060

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:12.850
 Oh my god, I tried to see everything. 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:15.130

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.490

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.120

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.390
 packaging 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:52.120

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.830
 O 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.740
 the wireless headset and playstation 3 is 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:03.550
 pretty well the same is not only that 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:06.700
 nec heard the building and that is to 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:10.030
 where you recognize such a league and 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:12.180
 the support that sees the movie as 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:18.270
 is that business that's how it works 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:18.270
 like until I see Dad fit me in here 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:28.240
 there is so tha 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.520
 our campaign is enough that the businesses that 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.560
 there box since I will not fit 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.970
 which has complicated but is here at 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.940
 support right? 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:39.310
 if he left then he had to 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.960
 charge the charging cable and a 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:45.100
 headset is the symbol here of 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:49.080
