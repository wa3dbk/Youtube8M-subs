00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
I know it's also very similar to the

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.240 
I know it's also very similar to the
ji-hae<00:02:17.450> method<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.690> greenhouse<00:02:19.170> effect<00:02:19.250> but

I seal with this a lot because it's

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.680 
I seal with this a lot because it's
really<00:03:01.769> light<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:02.910> doesn't<00:03:03.330> weigh<00:03:03.480> my

this oil I also put in coconut oil and
this<00:03:11.640> is<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:12.000> unrefined<00:03:12.830> organic<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:14.670> the

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
this is the unrefined organic and the

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.759 
this is the unrefined organic and the
brand<00:03:15.060> is<00:03:15.360> spectrum<00:03:15.959> but<00:03:16.080> it<00:03:16.230> doesn't<00:03:16.590> really

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
brand is spectrum but it doesn't really

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.250 
brand is spectrum but it doesn't really
matter<00:03:17.130> so<00:03:17.549> I<00:03:17.579> just<00:03:17.850> melted<00:03:18.780> this<00:03:18.989> down<00:03:19.230> a

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
matter so I just melted this down a

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.380 
matter so I just melted this down a
little<00:03:19.410> bit<00:03:19.769> and<00:03:20.040> poured<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.579> in<00:03:20.730> my<00:03:20.910> bottle

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
little bit and poured it in my bottle

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:28.280 
little bit and poured it in my bottle
and<00:03:22.160> then<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:23.190> use<00:03:23.780> grapeseed<00:03:24.780> oil<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:27.290> there's

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
and then I use grapeseed oil and there's

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.930 
and then I use grapeseed oil and there's
not<00:03:28.440> much<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.709> say<00:03:28.860> about<00:03:28.980> that<00:03:29.130> but<00:03:29.489> grapeseed

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
not much to say about that but grapeseed

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.830 
not much to say about that but grapeseed
oil<00:03:30.360> has<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:31.049> lot<00:03:31.620> of<00:03:31.769> benefits<00:03:32.220> too<00:03:32.610> I<00:03:33.450> also

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
oil has a lot of benefits too I also

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.920 
oil has a lot of benefits too I also
like<00:03:34.350> using<00:03:34.680> this<00:03:35.190> as<00:03:35.549> a<00:03:35.610> heat<00:03:36.239> protectant

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
like using this as a heat protectant

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.160 
like using this as a heat protectant
sometimes<00:03:37.530> just<00:03:37.950> really<00:03:38.310> lightly<00:03:38.579> and<00:03:39.170> every

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
sometimes just really lightly and every

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.050 
sometimes just really lightly and every
now<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:40.440> then<00:03:40.530> I'll<00:03:40.799> seal<00:03:41.100> with<00:03:41.370> this<00:03:41.549> oil<00:03:41.760> as

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
now and then I'll seal with this oil as

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.759 
now and then I'll seal with this oil as
well<00:03:42.359> but<00:03:42.600> other<00:03:42.840> than<00:03:43.079> that<00:03:43.140> I<00:03:43.260> don't<00:03:43.590> use

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
well but other than that I don't use

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.580 
well but other than that I don't use
grapeseed<00:03:44.280> oil<00:03:44.519> too<00:03:44.940> much<00:03:45.350> and<00:03:46.350> then<00:03:46.500> of

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
grapeseed oil too much and then of

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.009 
grapeseed oil too much and then of
course<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.980> had<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.220> put<00:03:47.549> in<00:03:47.670> my<00:03:47.850> hobo<00:03:48.329> oil<00:03:48.720> which

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
wrapping it ever since but I just really

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.880

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
really enjoyed this so I am NOT going to

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.340 
really enjoyed this so I am NOT going to
recommend<00:05:56.730> that<00:05:56.880> you<00:05:56.940> go<00:05:57.120> out<00:05:57.270> and<00:05:57.480> buy<00:05:57.900> a<00:05:57.930> ton

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
recommend that you go out and buy a ton

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.770 
recommend that you go out and buy a ton
of<00:05:58.380> oils<00:05:58.860> if<00:05:59.190> you<00:05:59.730> don't<00:05:59.910> have<00:06:00.210> them<00:06:00.480> already

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
of oils if you don't have them already

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.620 
of oils if you don't have them already
because<00:06:01.740> that<00:06:02.040> could<00:06:02.190> be<00:06:02.310> expensive<00:06:02.669> but<00:06:03.270> if

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
because that could be expensive but if

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.050 
because that could be expensive but if
you<00:06:03.780> have<00:06:03.990> the<00:06:04.200> budget<00:06:04.650> to<00:06:04.680> do<00:06:05.070> it<00:06:05.310> I<00:06:05.520> would

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
you have the budget to do it I would

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.210 
you have the budget to do it I would
definitely<00:06:06.690> try<00:06:06.930> it<00:06:07.050> if<00:06:07.380> for<00:06:07.620> no<00:06:07.800> other<00:06:07.830> reason
