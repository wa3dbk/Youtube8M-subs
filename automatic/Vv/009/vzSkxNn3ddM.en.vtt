00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
air air flow through and it's still

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.569 
air air flow through and it's still
small<00:00:34.079> off<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.620> put<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.010> insert<00:00:35.340> and

small off that you put the insert and

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.790 
small off that you put the insert and
the<00:00:35.730> answer<00:00:36.090> it's<00:00:36.239> not<00:00:36.420> huge<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.260> anyways

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
the answer it's not huge so anyways

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:54.549 
the answer it's not huge so anyways
start<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:38.700> up

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559

tapered man gelato oh I just slide that

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.740 
tapered man gelato oh I just slide that
block<00:01:35.039> onto<00:01:35.340> there<00:01:35.610> till<00:01:35.819> it<00:01:35.909> stops<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.630> it's

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
block onto there till it stops and it's

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.120 
block onto there till it stops and it's
pretty<00:01:36.929> tight<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.259> know<00:01:37.500> tight<00:01:37.740> enough<00:01:37.950> to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
pretty tight you know tight enough to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.740 
pretty tight you know tight enough to
the<00:01:38.250> Lord<00:01:38.459> on<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.209> lathe

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
the Lord on the lathe

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:54.520 
the Lord on the lathe
so<00:01:40.909> put<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:43.130> into<00:01:44.130> here<00:01:47.899> tighten<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.110> up

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.550 

and<00:01:55.130> then<00:01:58.420> tool<00:01:59.420> rest<00:01:59.690> up<00:01:59.960> as<00:02:00.110> close<00:02:00.320> as<00:02:00.470> you

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
and then tool rest up as close as you

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:10.779 
and then tool rest up as close as you
can<00:02:02.050> without<00:02:03.050> it<00:02:03.410> hitting

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:18.270 

all<00:02:11.239> right<00:02:12.519> when<00:02:13.519> you<00:02:13.610> lock<00:02:13.819> that<00:02:13.849> into<00:02:14.269> place

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:29.339 

and<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.709> lights<00:02:21.950> on<00:02:22.959> let<00:02:23.959> me<00:02:23.989> get<00:02:24.200> started

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:03:08.509 

so<00:02:30.349> let's<00:02:30.470> write<00:02:30.620> out<00:02:30.739> a<00:02:30.769> roughing<00:02:31.250> God

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.070 

all<00:03:09.519> right<00:03:09.700> it's<00:03:09.879> slipping<00:03:10.330> right<00:03:10.510> now<00:03:10.720> so<00:03:11.050> I

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
all right it's slipping right now so I

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.979 
all right it's slipping right now so I
found<00:03:11.319> it<00:03:11.379> works<00:03:11.590> really<00:03:11.769> well<00:03:11.920> with<00:03:12.069> this<00:03:12.989> I'm

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
found it works really well with this I'm

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.890 
found it works really well with this I'm
slipping<00:03:14.290> so<00:03:14.739> bad

slipping so bad

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:23.729 
slipping so bad
get<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.019> wax<00:03:17.290> I<00:03:17.800> find<00:03:18.310> it<00:03:22.110> get<00:03:23.110> some<00:03:23.260> beeswax

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739

what<00:03:40.740> makes<00:03:40.890> it<00:03:41.040> stick<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.460> lot<00:03:41.790> better

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.560 

it's<00:04:22.310> almost<00:04:22.670> all<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:22.880> foreigners<00:04:23.270> are<00:04:23.450> off

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570

here actually you can see it with a
small<00:04:29.840> flat<00:04:30.020> spot<00:04:30.470> but<00:04:31.570> take<00:04:32.570> that<00:04:32.750> down<00:04:32.960> until

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
small flat spot but take that down until

00:04:33.140 --> 00:05:06.370 
small flat spot but take that down until
it's<00:04:33.410> completely<00:04:33.890> gone

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.990 

yep<00:05:07.410> that<00:05:08.190> thing's<00:05:08.430> gone<00:05:09.650> so<00:05:10.650> now<00:05:10.680> I<00:05:11.190> pull<00:05:11.880> it

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
yep that thing's gone so now I pull it

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.240 
yep that thing's gone so now I pull it
out<00:05:12.060> I<00:05:12.830> will<00:05:13.830> call<00:05:14.100> it<00:05:14.310> I<00:05:14.430> made<00:05:14.730> and<00:05:15.030> before<00:05:15.480> I

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
out I will call it I made and before I

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.700 
out I will call it I made and before I
just<00:05:17.250> like<00:05:17.370> get<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:17.700> distance<00:05:18.120> like<00:05:18.500> how<00:05:19.500> far

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
just like get the distance like how far

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.310 
just like get the distance like how far
it<00:05:19.830> is<00:05:19.980> from<00:05:20.010> the<00:05:20.250> front<00:05:20.490> to<00:05:20.640> the<00:05:20.670> back<00:05:20.760> here

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
it is from the front to the back here

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.480 
it is from the front to the back here
I'll<00:05:22.320> end<00:05:22.440> up<00:05:22.530> marking<00:05:23.010> that<00:05:23.160> with<00:05:23.340> this

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
I'll end up marking that with this

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:31.640 
I'll end up marking that with this
parting<00:05:23.880> tool<00:05:29.090> and<00:05:30.090> I'll<00:05:30.210> cut<00:05:30.540> this<00:05:30.810> just<00:05:31.080> a

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
parting tool and I'll cut this just a

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:52.430 
parting tool and I'll cut this just a
second<00:05:46.040> again<00:05:50.690> all<00:05:51.690> right<00:05:51.780> set<00:05:52.140> barrel

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
second again all right set barrel

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.640 
second again all right set barrel
lengths<00:05:52.740> about<00:05:53.160> right<00:05:54.110> so<00:05:55.110> I'm<00:05:55.200> gonna<00:05:55.350> start

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
lengths about right so I'm gonna start

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.440 
lengths about right so I'm gonna start
on<00:05:55.980> the<00:05:56.300> mouthpiece<00:05:57.300> right<00:05:57.870> here<00:05:59.300> taking<00:06:00.300> this
