00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
to get and then she could put highlights

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.260

through<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:25.980> just<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.340> kind<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.700> lighten<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.150> up

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
through it just to kind of lighten it up

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.350 
through it just to kind of lighten it up
again<00:02:27.600> so<00:02:27.870> it's<00:02:28.020> not<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.350> harsh<00:02:28.940> black<00:02:30.500> so<00:02:31.500> I

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
again so it's not so harsh black so I

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.280 
again so it's not so harsh black so I
decided<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.960> do<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:35.010> bleach<00:02:35.190> wash<00:02:35.460> myself<00:02:35.700> and

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
decided to do the bleach wash myself and

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.810 
decided to do the bleach wash myself and
I<00:02:37.290> asked<00:02:37.530> her<00:02:37.590> basically<00:02:37.950> what<00:02:38.160> she<00:02:38.370> did<00:02:38.580> so

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
I asked her basically what she did so

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.410 
I asked her basically what she did so
the<00:02:38.940> difference<00:02:39.090> between<00:02:40.430> her<00:02:41.430> doing<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:42.000> and

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
the difference between her doing it and

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.480 
the difference between her doing it and
one<00:02:42.750> hundred<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.170> fifty<00:02:43.380> dollars<00:02:43.680> later<00:02:43.920> it

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
one hundred and fifty dollars later it

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.170 
one hundred and fifty dollars later it
cost<00:02:45.030> me<00:02:45.390> about<00:02:45.890> seven<00:02:46.890> dollars<00:02:47.070> at<00:02:47.610> Sally's

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
cost me about seven dollars at Sally's

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.710 
cost me about seven dollars at Sally's
so<00:02:49.020> I<00:02:49.500> did<00:02:49.920> do<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.070> today<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:51.390> learned<00:02:51.600> out

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
so I did do it today and I learned out

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.540 
so I did do it today and I learned out
to<00:02:51.870> be<00:02:51.990> like<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.200> medium<00:02:52.680> reddish<00:02:53.250> brown
