barrel um you should if you did it fast
enough<00:00:12.420> catch<00:00:12.960> about<00:00:13.440> 3<00:00:13.710> splicers<00:00:14.190> grouped<00:00:14.429> up

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
enough catch about 3 splicers grouped up

enough catch about 3 splicers grouped up
and<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.540> makes<00:00:15.750> very<00:00:16.289> easy<00:00:17.210> there's<00:00:18.210> going<00:00:18.359> to

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
and it makes very easy there's going to

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.820 
and it makes very easy there's going to
make<00:00:18.539> two<00:00:18.720> more<00:00:18.840> sets<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.140> splicers<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.710> come

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
make two more sets of splicers that come

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.759 
make two more sets of splicers that come
out<00:00:20.010> there<00:00:20.250> these<00:00:20.609> two<00:00:20.820> guys<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.390> then<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
out there these two guys and then the

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.009 
out there these two guys and then the
closer<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.189> get<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.460> door<00:00:23.869> another<00:00:24.869> group

them as they're coming out about three

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.540 
them as they're coming out about three
groups<00:05:13.410> come<00:05:13.620> out<00:05:13.740> of<00:05:13.830> the<00:05:13.890> right<00:05:14.070> tunnel<00:05:14.400> and

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
groups come out of the right tunnel and

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.050 
groups come out of the right tunnel and
about<00:05:15.060> one<00:05:15.390> comes<00:05:15.660> out<00:05:15.810> of<00:05:15.870> the<00:05:15.930> left<00:05:16.170> so

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
about one comes out of the left so

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.330 
about one comes out of the left so
there's<00:05:18.060> plenty<00:05:18.270> of<00:05:18.450> barrels<00:05:18.980> maybe<00:05:19.980> it<00:05:20.100> helps

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
there's plenty of barrels maybe it helps

Arcadia<00:06:10.590> complete<00:06:11.160> which<00:06:11.340> was<00:06:11.460> a<00:06:11.490> big<00:06:11.700> level

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 
Arcadia complete which was a big level

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.420 
Arcadia complete which was a big level
and<00:06:12.240> it<00:06:12.300> had<00:06:12.419> some<00:06:12.660> diversions<00:06:13.340> levels<00:06:14.340> are

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
and it had some diversions levels are

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.270 
and it had some diversions levels are
pretty<00:06:14.729> big<00:06:15.120> why<00:06:15.630> it<00:06:15.930> take<00:06:15.960> long<00:06:16.440> all<00:06:16.770> the<00:06:17.070> time

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
pretty big why it take long all the time

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.400 
pretty big why it take long all the time
I<00:06:17.700> think<00:06:18.330> the<00:06:18.510> Ryan<00:06:18.750> illusion<00:06:19.140> of<00:06:19.169> the<00:06:19.260> whole

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
I think the Ryan illusion of the whole

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.190 
I think the Ryan illusion of the whole
set<00:06:19.680> is<00:06:19.710> about<00:06:20.130> seven<00:06:20.550> or<00:06:20.610> eight<00:06:20.820> videos<00:06:21.200> so

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
set is about seven or eight videos so

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.590 
set is about seven or eight videos so
and<00:06:22.860> they're<00:06:23.010> about<00:06:23.130> six<00:06:23.520> six<00:06:24.120> minutes<00:06:24.390> apiece

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 
and they're about six six minutes apiece

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.450 
and they're about six six minutes apiece
so<00:06:24.960> I<00:06:24.990> mean<00:06:25.320> you<00:06:25.440> got<00:06:25.590> about<00:06:25.770> 40<00:06:26.160> minutes<00:06:26.310> of

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
so I mean you got about 40 minutes of

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.570 
so I mean you got about 40 minutes of
gameplay<00:06:26.640> coming<00:06:27.240> up<00:06:27.360> take<00:06:27.660> the<00:06:27.810> train<00:06:28.580> it's
