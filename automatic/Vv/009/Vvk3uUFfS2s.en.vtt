00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.910
 I greet everyone with you android android 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.160
 today wanted to talk about quite 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.599
 unusual interesting decor called 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.089
 found in blackhole 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.130
 Well, let's wait for the data is coming 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.130
 that we often tell the bunker special 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.820
 attraction in which will fall into 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.580
 various black holes in space 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.840
 very original idea at all 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.890
 graphically, the game is also made enough 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.960
 good level 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.790
 here is our carry amusement park 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.120
 now shows us to carry the whole 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.410
 level before we accelerate to 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.950
 we have to do a certain 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.540
 action and for this you need to tap in 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.520
 certain point as you see when 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.770
 as the circle narrows and is in the middle 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.960
 this circle yellow we have accumulated 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.520
 the burnt amount of energy that 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.739
 will help later on when 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.579
 passing the level plate so clear 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.030
 go up 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.399
 this say we get this black bad 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.039
 cool cool i clean for all time 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.619
 How many reviews did you have at all? 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.330
 i have an android device before playing 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.520
 games have never seen similar games 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.070
 so for originals I can immediately Peter 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.080
 passenger during the assessment do not put we all with 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.530
 overclock you and now we are with you now 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.930
 fly into a black hole in the floor 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.509
 spatially into that dimension where nowhere 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.310
 never been so we accelerate the schedule 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.770
 Of course once again I repeat very beautifully 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.439
 done and now a little other things 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.040
 we have to do with us we are the river in this 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.140
 black hole 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.689
 we can tilt our device to the left 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.299
 right and as you can see below we have blue 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.970
 color and red these tracks we 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.869
 can switch so to speak if it goes 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.520
 fly to the red then click on our 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.799
 the screen and we have to pile up 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.200
 energy must have time to move not 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.579
 bump into these lips 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.979
 are here because we will 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.920
 running out of energy brought under mine 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.649
 recover if we are so good with 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.170
 you go along the blue line is not the fabric in the garden 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.090
 the course and have time to switch red 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.159
 blue color then we have this energy 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.320
 piling up and also points they are on the market 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.440
 cut off whim gets points we all with 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.510
 you have overcome one black hole again 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.280
 we start to rise then what thing 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.930
 I am very people 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.220
 here in order to now restore 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.110
 energy to curb will determine the amount 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.959
 questions we need with you 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.000
 I just need to answer 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.610
 knowledge of English even I am out of three 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.720
 moments can tread 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.290
 Now let's say how clean we changed 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.180
 which is divided and and just like in 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.600
 previous time when we're just straight 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.510
 on the screen 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.640
 we will restore our energy and that is 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.970
 very entertaining can also be done 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.640
 even develop your carry intelligence 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.340
 quickly tell you your brain was thinking in 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.590
 this sense of course is very very 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.690
 correctly done and let's about 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.650
 plus or minus well of course very cool 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.810
 beautiful graphics very original 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.680
 gameplay yes I really like 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.989
 cool music 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.150
 comfortable enough good management 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.769
 the only thing I think is a huge minus 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.410
 This is what the game is in English and 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.330
 questions that you ask need to carry 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.239
 know what is written there about what you case 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.459
 just going to carry it all the time 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.290
 in energy not to set it like this 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.560
 about such an interesting game I wanted today 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.790
 talk to you i will put on this 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.220
 the game is probably four 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.320
 originality and and of course saves a 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.850
 you were android android and play 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.329
 only in the best games that i have 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.329
 I advise
