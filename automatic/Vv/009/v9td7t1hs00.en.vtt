00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.679 
now I've had to go back to do and drive
into<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.460> see<00:01:41.790> again<00:01:42.030> that's<00:01:42.270> been<00:01:42.450> probably

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
into I see again that's been probably

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:43.910 
into I see again that's been probably
the<00:01:42.810> toughest<00:01:43.170> thing<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.409> have<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.560> do<00:01:43.770> with

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
the toughest thing you have to do with

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.210 
the toughest thing you have to do with
this<00:01:44.009> Hill<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.369> weekend<00:01:45.680> it's<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.770> same<00:01:46.979> car

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
this Hill this weekend it's the same car

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.679 
this Hill this weekend it's the same car
I<00:01:47.250> used<00:01:47.549> for<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.759> rally<00:01:47.880> america<00:01:48.030> series

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
I used for the rally america series

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.510 
I used for the rally america series
although<00:01:49.439> most<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.799> rally<00:01:49.950> america<00:01:50.040> stuff

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
although most the rally america stuff

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.399 
although most the rally america stuff
apart<00:01:50.790> from<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.030> few<00:01:51.060> super<00:01:51.509> special<00:01:51.869> stages<00:01:52.140> as

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
apart from a few super special stages as

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.319 
apart from a few super special stages as
all<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.740> gravel<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.700> get<00:01:53.939> them<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.149> drive

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
all on gravel so to get them to drive

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.700 
all on gravel so to get them to drive
the<00:01:54.360> car<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.750> tarmac<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.320> obviously<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.619> little

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
the car and tarmac is obviously a little

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.830 
the car and tarmac is obviously a little
bit<00:01:55.890> different<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:56.820> also<00:01:57.000> have<00:01:57.420> more<00:01:57.600> power

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
bit different but also have more power

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.149 
bit different but also have more power
we<00:01:57.990> have<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.110> bigger<00:01:58.290> turbo<00:01:58.710> because<00:01:58.950> we're<00:01:59.070> in

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
we have a bigger turbo because we're in

00:01:59.159 --> 00:01:59.570 
we have a bigger turbo because we're in
open

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
open

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.060 
open
there's<00:02:00.030> no<00:02:00.150> co-driver<00:02:00.690> we<00:02:01.440> also<00:02:01.590> run<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.040> a

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
there's no co-driver we also run to a

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.830 
there's no co-driver we also run to a
lower<00:02:02.280> weight<00:02:02.700> category<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.480> obviously<00:02:03.720> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
lower weight category so obviously the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.810 
lower weight category so obviously the
car<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.110> much<00:02:04.230> faster<00:02:04.470> accelerates<00:02:05.220> faster<00:02:05.400> so

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
car is much faster accelerates faster so

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.670 
car is much faster accelerates faster so
a<00:02:06.090> lot<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.570> new<00:02:06.720> things<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:07.080> get<00:02:07.170> used<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.530> but

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
a lot of new things to get used to but

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.130 
a lot of new things to get used to but
it's<00:02:07.770> nice<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.070> be<00:02:08.100> in<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.369> familiar<00:02:08.729> car<00:02:12.140> it's

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
probably on the key factors we've

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.630 
probably on the key factors we've
already<00:02:22.500> been<00:02:22.650> able<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:22.890> practice<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.370> bottom

bad to go on the top so we haven't gone
to<00:02:28.290> grab<00:02:28.440> on<00:02:28.590> yet<00:02:28.770> you<00:02:29.610> look<00:02:29.730> at<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:29.970> road<00:02:30.120> all

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
to grab on yet you look at the road all

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.790 
to grab on yet you look at the road all
looks<00:02:30.570> bone-dry<00:02:30.930> here<00:02:31.230> but<00:02:31.380> as<00:02:31.470> soon<00:02:31.590> as<00:02:31.680> you

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
looks bone-dry here but as soon as you

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.200 
looks bone-dry here but as soon as you
go<00:02:31.920> maybe<00:02:32.190> one<00:02:32.400> mile<00:02:32.580> up<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.730> road<00:02:32.880> you<00:02:33.060> into

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
go maybe one mile up the road you into

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.000 
go maybe one mile up the road you into
different<00:02:33.600> conditions<00:02:34.080> you've<00:02:34.260> got<00:02:34.440> you've

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
different conditions you've got you've

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.650 
different conditions you've got you've
got<00:02:35.040> damp<00:02:35.340> conditions<00:02:35.520> you've<00:02:36.150> got<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.420> fog

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
got damp conditions you've got the fog

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.870 
got damp conditions you've got the fog
so<00:02:36.900> temperatures<00:02:37.380> drop<00:02:37.560> pretty<00:02:37.740> quickly<00:02:38.070> and

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
so temperatures drop pretty quickly and

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.340 
so temperatures drop pretty quickly and
then<00:02:39.000> then<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.540> Sun<00:02:39.720> can<00:02:39.930> come<00:02:40.050> out<00:02:40.140> pretty

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
then then the Sun can come out pretty

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.870 
then then the Sun can come out pretty
quickly<00:02:40.620> again<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.459> try<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.730> get<00:02:41.820> that

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
quickly again so it to try and get that

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.490 
quickly again so it to try and get that
choice<00:02:42.060> right<00:02:42.360> is<00:02:42.480> real<00:02:42.690> difficult<00:02:43.200> but<00:02:43.380> we've

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
choice right is real difficult but we've

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.140 
choice right is real difficult but we've
got<00:02:43.650> some<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:43.980> our<00:02:44.070> rally<00:02:44.340> crash<00:02:44.610> tires<00:02:44.850> we've
