00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:14.219
 welcome also to today's episode 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.070
 today I will show you how to train i 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.080
 bibs with two exercises thanks 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:25.350
 to the use of these loop bands 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.910
 elastic bands closed in a ring 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.550
 simple to go and hook up to 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.510
 any end in this case the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.500
 I'm going to hook it to a back 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.350
 what are the two exercises we are going to 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.829
 see the first kidnapping today 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.040
 tuck into the loop band and let's go 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.010
 to perform thrusts with the arms 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.289
 to go and simulate the gestures that 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.510
 it can be done during a flat bench 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.050
 or simple folds on the ground but in 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.020
 this case 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.239
 we will use the berlin loop this case 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.789
 the movement will be much more 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.039
 unstable and you will have to go to manage 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.660
 this instability of movement thanks 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.640
 to the use of all the muscles 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.460
 shoulder stabilizers then 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.409
 the exercise may seem simple but in 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.229
 reality is very difficult to go to 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.369
 handle movement follows us so in hand 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.680
 my beautiful loops 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.619
 I get tense going slightly 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.369
 forward and from this position by extending into 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.520
 forward your arms so pushed and back 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.939
 back push and go back push 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.590
 and I go back to perfect exercise 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.750
 especially if you were born at home or not 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.090
 you have large items available 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.520
 great tools to go training 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.130
 it seems to me an exercise we are going to 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.170
 see the crosses are the crosses with one 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.180
 loop band in this case we go to 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.670
 simulate that exercise you are performing or 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.950
 to cables and that you can run on one 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.530
 inclined bench with handlebars 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.960
 the exercise exactly and this to 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.619
 wide and I'm going to close in this case 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.560
 android use my loop birds 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:04.619
 I grab the loop band brought it forward 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.670
 and from this position offshore and then 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.099
 I'm going to close off I go to 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.030
 as said it is a highly movement 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:18.959
 unstable through an elastic band 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.000
 and this will allow you to give to 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.250
 your shoulders great coordination 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.100
 motor and great stability is a 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.959
 unreal exercise like wind first for 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.030
 who does not have large tools a 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.010
 layout is ideal for sportsmen 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.350
 who need to improve the 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.050
 stability of one's shoulders but ideal 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.690
 even those who seek new stimuli for i 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.580
 own workouts for your muscles 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.560
