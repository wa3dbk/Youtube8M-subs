00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:20.630
 hello I am days and I do not know if it shows in the 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:25.760
 camera but here I have a burn 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:28.220
 sun unfortunately today I left and as not 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.580
 I was getting a lot of sun because I got 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.620
 sunscreen but I think I kicked 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:37.850
 on one side more than on the other and 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.489
 look what happened to me I burned so in 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.820
 view of that then less badly that I already 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:49.650
 I have prepared my macerated 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.200
 I achiote seeds of this I have 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.230
 proven to be very good for 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.660
 sunburn I also use for 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.150
 the lips and can also be used 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.340
 for the face the only thing I like 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.309
 mix it because by the fact of being 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.100
 orange because it colors the skin if used 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.869
 if we use it too often by 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.460
 example every day then we can 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.030
 leave the orange skin like the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.180
 carrot oil as this oil 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.600
 has the excellent properties and I what 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.450
 I tried on someone very white a person 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.850
 blonde 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.259
 and he had a burn like me 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.830
 in the neck that was neglected and did not 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.950
 put 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:38.940
 sunscreen and good had the skin 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:43.350
 inflamed red red and we use the oil 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:46.630
 of shock and then this person to the three 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.149
 days his skin was completely fine 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.770
 and without it being loomed to the skin because 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.880
 as you know when one has burned 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.360
 strong then 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.820
 the skin burns the skin tries 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.970
 regenerate so it's a good 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.640
 recommendation that when we started 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.759
 expose the sun to get enough 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.769
 solar protection here because I do not know how 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.780
 happened because I am very careful I 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:16.500
 throw up your arms I threw myself everywhere 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.090
 and that space stayed with me and I think that 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.730
 has given me a little allergy because I 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.090
 it stings a little and well those are the 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.489
 recommendations to avoid burning 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:30.239
 also when you make your 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:33.180
 steely and do not forget to put the date and 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:36.810
 when they prepared it and when they package it 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.819
 to prevent them from being forgotten and 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.250
 damage because these oils do not last 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.560
 a long time some may last six 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.599
 months and if they keep it in the refrigerator 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.599
 a little more others may last less 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.819
 can last three months that depends on 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.160
 each oil and the conditions in the 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.049
 which you keep if the 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.080
 keep in a cool place or as I say in 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.080
 the fridge 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.140
 or refrigerator because there you are going to 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.640
 conserve a lot more time because 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.500
 these oils are degraded by the fact 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.410
 of being natural they degrade with the 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.360
 good heat this oil also what 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.850
 Can be used on children without any problem 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.850
 As I tell you, it is a very good oil 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.480
 and regenerant for that same reason is 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.909
 well the example of a burn because 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.829
 when the skin is not pellets because it 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:31.360
 has regenerated but if the 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:34.310
 Skin is looking to take out new cells 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.430
 to remove the dead cells that have 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:41.390
 stayed by the burn and this helps 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:44.109
 that the cells are kept alive by 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.970
 say it like that and then you avoid the 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:50.000
 peeling the skin then they can 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.370
 use it as an anti-wrinkle all all 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.590
 the nights mixed with other oils 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.650
 it can be with olive oil a 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.629
 small amount of this oil and another 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.060
 amount of olive oil or oil 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.889
 of your preference rosehip that for 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.769
 true the rose hip is also a 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:08.300
 little orange and it's also another oil 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.780
 very good 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.000
 anti-wrinkle and to regenerate the skin 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.299
 good friends I hope that you do not 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.049
 spend what I take care of the sun and a 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.049
 kiss everyone 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.919
 look 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.470
 Y
