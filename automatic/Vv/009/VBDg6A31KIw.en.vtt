the handle the spool revolves around at

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:18.840 
the handle the spool revolves around at
a<00:01:16.630> high<00:01:16.960> speed<00:01:17.020> some<00:01:17.860> reels<00:01:18.070> are<00:01:18.250> low<00:01:18.399> gear<00:01:18.670> so

reels like this guy here spinning wheels
high-speed<00:01:25.630> spinning<00:01:25.899> reels<00:01:26.110> so<00:01:26.320> when<00:01:26.470> you

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
high-speed spinning reels so when you

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.410 
high-speed spinning reels so when you
when<00:01:26.890> you<00:01:26.920> turn<00:01:27.190> the<00:01:27.250> handle<00:01:27.640> the<00:01:28.060> spill

revolves up to maybe six times which

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.590 
revolves up to maybe six times which
which<00:01:30.399> means<00:01:30.610> when<00:01:30.759> you<00:01:30.880> wind<00:01:31.149> like<00:01:31.390> this

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
which means when you wind like this

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.419 
which means when you wind like this
you're<00:01:32.500> bringing<00:01:32.530> a<00:01:32.920> lot<00:01:33.100> of<00:01:33.160> line<00:01:33.399> you

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.389 
reason why you want to do a high speed
is<00:01:37.690> because<00:01:38.110> what<00:01:38.710> you're<00:01:38.800> basically<00:01:38.950> trying

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
to do is fill the fish into thinking a

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.020 
to do is fill the fish into thinking a
little<00:01:41.470> bit<00:01:41.590> of<00:01:41.740> metal<00:01:41.920> is<00:01:42.250> actually<00:01:42.940> a<00:01:42.970> little

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
little bit of metal is actually a little

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.779 
little bit of metal is actually a little
baked<00:01:43.300> fish<00:01:43.539> if<00:01:43.840> you<00:01:44.289> do<00:01:44.410> it<00:01:44.530> too<00:01:44.560> slow<00:01:45.039> you're

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
baked fish if you do it too slow you're

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.060 
baked fish if you do it too slow you're
not<00:01:45.940> going<00:01:46.179> to<00:01:46.350> incite<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.560> feeding<00:01:47.920> response

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
not going to incite the feeding response

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.010 
not going to incite the feeding response
to<00:01:48.400> the<00:01:48.490> fish<00:01:48.700> also<00:01:49.210> you<00:01:49.479> give<00:01:49.659> it<00:01:49.720> a<00:01:49.780> bit<00:01:49.900> of<00:01:49.960> a

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
to the fish also you give it a bit of a

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.510 
to the fish also you give it a bit of a
time<00:01:50.229> to<00:01:50.380> look<00:01:50.500> at<00:01:50.650> the<00:01:50.799> lure<00:01:50.979> and<00:01:51.189> then

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
close as possible to the rock zone

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.320 
close as possible to the rock zone
without<00:04:20.329> actually<00:04:21.199> ending<00:04:21.470> up<00:04:21.560> on<00:04:21.709> the<00:04:21.889> rocks

without actually ending up on the rocks

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.150 
without actually ending up on the rocks
we<00:04:23.330> were<00:04:23.360> fishing<00:04:23.630> in<00:04:23.810> deep<00:04:24.020> water<00:04:24.229> before<00:04:24.650> and

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
we were fishing in deep water before and

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.439 
we were fishing in deep water before and
that's<00:04:25.310> why<00:04:25.430> I<00:04:25.460> let<00:04:25.669> the<00:04:25.759> Lewis<00:04:26.030> sink<00:04:26.270> down

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449 
that's why I let the Lewis sink down

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:28.420 
that's why I let the Lewis sink down
into<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:26.900> sort<00:04:27.110> of<00:04:27.169> the<00:04:27.259> target<00:04:27.650> depth<00:04:27.860> here

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
into the sort of the target depth here

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.499 
into the sort of the target depth here
you're<00:04:28.669> going<00:04:28.759> to<00:04:28.849> be<00:04:28.910> a<00:04:28.940> bit<00:04:29.090> careful<00:04:29.479> because

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:29.509 
you're going to be a bit careful because

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:31.300 
you're going to be a bit careful because
you're<00:04:29.870> obviously<00:04:30.050> in<00:04:30.289> shallow<00:04:30.500> water<00:04:30.889> you

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
you're obviously in shallow water you

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.520 
you're obviously in shallow water you
don't<00:04:31.400> let<00:04:31.639> your<00:04:31.759> little<00:04:31.910> sink<00:04:32.210> right<00:04:32.330> down

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.870 
don't let your little sink right down
some<00:04:33.530> areas<00:04:33.830> you<00:04:33.949> can<00:04:34.039> fish<00:04:34.280> a<00:04:34.310> really<00:04:34.759> really

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
some areas you can fish a really really

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.330 
some areas you can fish a really really
shallow<00:04:35.180> Taylor<00:04:36.080> in<00:04:36.380> particular<00:04:36.680> like<00:04:37.039> really

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
shallow Taylor in particular like really

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.800 
shallow Taylor in particular like really
shallow<00:04:37.550> washes<00:04:37.970> owns<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.389> water<00:04:38.570> can<00:04:38.690> maybe

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
shallow washes owns the water can maybe

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.749 
shallow washes owns the water can maybe
like<00:04:39.110> a<00:04:39.139> couple<00:04:39.500> of<00:04:39.560> foot<00:04:39.710> deep<00:04:39.919> so<00:04:40.580> what<00:04:40.729> are

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:40.759
