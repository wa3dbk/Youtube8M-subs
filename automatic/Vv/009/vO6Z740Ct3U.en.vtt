00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:15.620 

so<00:00:03.449> we're<00:00:03.629> on<00:00:03.720> for<00:00:04.400> audition<00:00:14.299> we<00:00:15.299> realize<00:00:15.599> that

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
so we're on for audition we realize that

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
so we're on for audition we realize that
it's<00:00:15.960> top-heavy<00:00:18.529> what<00:00:19.529> it's<00:00:20.490> not<00:00:20.670> talking

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
it's top-heavy what it's not talking

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.529 
it's top-heavy what it's not talking
it's<00:00:22.650> center<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.609> gravity's<00:00:24.090> will<00:00:24.330> higher

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
it's center of gravity's will higher

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.429 
it's center of gravity's will higher
than<00:00:24.810> those<00:00:26.000> so<00:00:27.000> means<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.660> ride<00:00:27.869> might<00:00:28.230> be

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
than those so means the ride might be

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.580 
than those so means the ride might be
