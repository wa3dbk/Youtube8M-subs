00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
leave before this becomes a

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.710 
leave before this becomes a
long-distance<00:03:39.190> thing<00:03:39.599> it's<00:03:40.599> really

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
long-distance thing it's really

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.920 
long-distance thing it's really
important<00:03:41.230> for<00:03:41.699> it<00:03:42.699> to<00:03:42.730> be<00:03:42.910> clear<00:03:43.299> because<00:03:43.780> if

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
important for it to be clear because if

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.449 
important for it to be clear because if
it's<00:03:44.079> not<00:03:44.319> clear<00:03:44.709> somebody's<00:03:45.160> gonna<00:03:45.280> be

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
it's not clear somebody's gonna be

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.250 
it's not clear somebody's gonna be
miserable<00:03:45.690> so<00:03:46.690> I<00:03:46.750> think<00:03:46.900> it's<00:03:47.079> really

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
miserable so I think it's really

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.740 
miserable so I think it's really
important<00:03:47.769> for<00:03:47.829> her<00:03:48.040> to<00:03:48.220> talk<00:03:48.669> to<00:03:48.910> him<00:03:49.060> we<00:03:49.720> need

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
important for her to talk to him we need

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.869 
important for her to talk to him we need
to<00:03:49.989> talk<00:03:50.199> together<00:03:50.530> and<00:03:50.829> see<00:03:51.069> where<00:03:51.669> they're

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 
to talk together and see where they're

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.750 
to talk together and see where they're
at<00:03:52.199> if<00:03:53.199> one<00:03:53.410> person<00:03:53.829> doesn't<00:03:54.430> want<00:03:54.519> long

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
at if one person doesn't want long

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.509 
at if one person doesn't want long
distance<00:03:55.150> and<00:03:55.299> one<00:03:55.480> person<00:03:55.870> does<00:03:55.900> I<00:03:56.519> think

that's a bad sign both parties need to

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.030 
that's a bad sign both parties need to

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.270 
sort of agree
it<00:04:02.519> needs<00:04:02.730> to<00:04:03.000> end<00:04:03.650> because<00:04:04.650> if<00:04:04.920> one<00:04:05.069> person

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
it needs to end because if one person

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.490 
it needs to end because if one person
wants<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.909> long-distance<00:04:06.319> relationship<00:04:07.319> and

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
wants the long-distance relationship and

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.420 
wants the long-distance relationship and
one<00:04:07.709> doesn't

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
one doesn't

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.130 
one doesn't
somebody's<00:04:08.879> gonna<00:04:09.030> be<00:04:09.150> heartbroken<00:04:09.510> in<00:04:10.019> the

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
somebody's gonna be heartbroken in the

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.289 
somebody's gonna be heartbroken in the
end<00:04:10.260> so<00:04:10.890> I<00:04:10.920> think<00:04:11.069> I<00:04:11.579> think<00:04:11.969> it's<00:04:12.150> really

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
end so I think I think it's really

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:13.910 
end so I think I think it's really
important<00:04:12.719> they<00:04:12.810> just<00:04:13.019> need<00:04:13.200> to<00:04:13.379> talk

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
important they just need to talk

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.410 
important they just need to talk
everything<00:04:14.430> out<00:04:14.579> and<00:04:14.819> she<00:04:15.000> needs<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.299> know

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
everything out and she needs to know

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.210 
everything out and she needs to know
where<00:04:15.780> she<00:04:15.959> stands<00:04:16.259> because<00:04:16.650> if<00:04:17.039> he's<00:04:17.190> not

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
where she stands because if he's not

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.590 
where she stands because if he's not
interested<00:04:17.699> in<00:04:18.030> a<00:04:18.359> long-distance

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
interested in a long-distance

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.680 
interested in a long-distance
relationship<00:04:19.940> she<00:04:20.940> need<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.209> send<00:04:21.359> all<00:04:21.479> that

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
relationship she need to send all that

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.510 
relationship she need to send all that
so<00:04:21.840> she<00:04:21.900> can<00:04:22.169> go<00:04:22.320> ahead<00:04:22.410> and<00:04:22.680> move<00:04:22.800> forward<00:04:22.860> and

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
so she can go ahead and move forward and

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.990 
so she can go ahead and move forward and
meet<00:04:24.330> other<00:04:24.630> people<00:04:24.720> and<00:04:25.789> forget<00:04:26.789> about<00:04:26.850> that

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
meet other people and forget about that

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.800 
meet other people and forget about that
person<00:04:28.460> and<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:30.210> next<00:04:30.449> part<00:04:30.660> of<00:04:30.690> that

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
person and the next part of that

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.930 
person and the next part of that
question<00:04:30.990> is<00:04:31.259> what<00:04:31.470> can<00:04:31.620> I<00:04:31.740> do<00:04:31.800> as<00:04:32.070> a<00:04:32.100> friend<00:04:32.310> to
