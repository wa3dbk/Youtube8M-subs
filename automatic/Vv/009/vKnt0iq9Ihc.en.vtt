00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
will most likely pass out another really

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.049 
will most likely pass out another really
important<00:00:43.379> thing<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.620> don't<00:00:44.309> do<00:00:44.460> drugs<00:00:44.700> don't

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
important thing is don't do drugs don't

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.819 
important thing is don't do drugs don't
drink<00:00:45.239> alcohol<00:00:45.719> or<00:00:45.750> take<00:00:45.930> any<00:00:46.230> blood<00:00:46.469> thinners

drink alcohol or take any blood thinners

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.160 
drink alcohol or take any blood thinners
such<00:00:47.070> as<00:00:47.219> Advil<00:00:47.670> don't<00:00:48.480> do<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.780> before<00:00:48.930> your

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
such as Advil don't do that before your

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.450 
such as Advil don't do that before your
tattoo<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.530> know<00:00:49.590> people<00:00:49.829> think<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.250> like<00:00:50.370> a

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
tattoo I know people think it's like a

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.160 
tattoo I know people think it's like a
good<00:00:50.640> idea<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.270> do<00:00:51.449> any<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.809> those<00:00:51.960> things

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
good idea to do any of those things

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.299 
good idea to do any of those things
because<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.559> think<00:00:52.590> it'll<00:00:52.860> make<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.039> hurt<00:00:53.280> less

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
because I think it'll make it hurt less

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.580 
because I think it'll make it hurt less
or<00:00:53.699> whatever<00:00:53.789> but<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.719> reality<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.289> thins<00:00:55.500> your

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
or whatever but in reality it thins your

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.590 
or whatever but in reality it thins your
blood<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.070> then<00:00:56.610> when<00:00:56.760> you're<00:00:56.879> attacked<00:00:57.149> like

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
blood and then when you're attacked like

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.660 
blood and then when you're attacked like
getting<00:00:57.930> tattooed<00:00:58.230> you'll<00:00:58.440> bleed<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.829> lot<00:00:59.280> more

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
getting tattooed you'll bleed a lot more

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.220 
getting tattooed you'll bleed a lot more
than<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.030> would<00:01:00.149> normally<00:01:00.359> which<00:01:00.840> makes<00:01:01.109> it

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
than you would normally which makes it

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.869 
than you would normally which makes it
almost<00:01:01.379> impossible<00:01:01.530> for<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.280> tattoo<00:01:02.579> artist

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
almost impossible for the tattoo artist

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.429 
almost impossible for the tattoo artist
to<00:01:03.000> tattoo<00:01:03.300> properly<00:01:03.780> because<00:01:04.199> you're

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
to tattoo properly because you're

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.550 
to tattoo properly because you're
bleeding<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:04.769> much<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:06.080> you<00:01:07.080> know<00:01:07.110> if<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.409> want
