00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
hi I'm Allen and welcome to expert

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.090 
hi I'm Allen and welcome to expert
village<00:00:02.850> today<00:00:03.659> I'm<00:00:04.049> gonna<00:00:04.380> show<00:00:04.680> you<00:00:04.710> how<00:00:05.040> to

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
village today I'm gonna show you how to

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.270 
village today I'm gonna show you how to
build<00:00:05.310> your<00:00:05.460> very<00:00:05.580> own<00:00:06.000> personal<00:00:06.839> computer

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:07.280 
build your very own personal computer

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.650 
build your very own personal computer
this<00:00:08.280> part<00:00:08.610> right<00:00:08.700> here<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.480> memory

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
this part right here is the memory

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.320 
this part right here is the memory
module<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.610> there's<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.670> lot<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.030> different

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
module and there's a lot of different

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.680 
module and there's a lot of different
memory<00:00:12.570> modules<00:00:12.960> depending<00:00:13.440> on<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:14.130> type<00:00:14.490> of

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
memory modules depending on the type of

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.810 
memory modules depending on the type of
motherboard<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.809> pick<00:00:15.990> up<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.730> you<00:00:17.730> know

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
motherboard you pick up and you know

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.950 
motherboard you pick up and you know
that's<00:00:18.029> going<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.240> determine<00:00:18.390> what<00:00:18.779> type<00:00:18.930> of

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
that's going to determine what type of

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.750 
that's going to determine what type of
memory<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.410> how<00:00:19.560> fast<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.010> memory<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.460> things

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
memory and how fast the memory is things

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.519 
memory and how fast the memory is things
like<00:00:20.850> that<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.779> that's<00:00:22.080> gonna<00:00:22.230> be<00:00:22.350> something

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
like that so that's gonna be something

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.480 
like that so that's gonna be something
that<00:00:22.680> you're<00:00:22.859> really<00:00:22.890> gonna<00:00:23.160> have<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.310> look

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
that you're really gonna have to look

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.370 
that you're really gonna have to look
into<00:00:23.820> but<00:00:24.359> pretty<00:00:24.539> much<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.990> lot<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.289> these

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
into but pretty much a lot of these

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.170 
into but pretty much a lot of these
modules<00:00:25.619> they<00:00:26.039> may<00:00:26.160> look<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.490> same<00:00:26.699> but<00:00:26.970> the

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
modules they may look the same but the

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.550 
modules they may look the same but the
connectors<00:00:27.599> on<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.750> bottom<00:00:28.140> or<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.289> little<00:00:28.470> bit

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
connectors on the bottom or a little bit

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.990 
connectors on the bottom or a little bit
different<00:00:28.890> when<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.070> put<00:00:29.250> them<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.490> place<00:00:29.760> and

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
different when you put them in place and

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.930 
different when you put them in place and
you<00:00:30.779> know<00:00:30.900> they<00:00:31.019> have<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.320> obviously<00:00:31.740> fit<00:00:31.980> when

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
you know they have to obviously fit when

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.520 
you know they have to obviously fit when
you<00:00:32.969> do<00:00:33.210> your<00:00:33.360> research<00:00:33.540> obviously<00:00:34.140> there's

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
you do your research obviously there's

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.870 
you do your research obviously there's
so<00:00:34.800> many<00:00:34.950> different<00:00:35.340> types<00:00:35.520> right<00:00:35.700> now

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
so many different types right now

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.639 
so many different types right now
they're<00:00:36.390> all<00:00:36.420> like<00:00:36.690> DDR<00:00:37.170> but<00:00:37.500> there's

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
they're all like DDR but there's

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.229 
they're all like DDR but there's
different<00:00:37.980> speeds<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.520> things<00:00:38.730> like<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.059> so

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
different speeds and things like that so

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.840 
different speeds and things like that so
you<00:00:39.300> want<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.540> make<00:00:39.629> sure<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.960> they're<00:00:40.140> good

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
you want to make sure that they're good

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.729 
you want to make sure that they're good
also<00:00:41.850> you'll<00:00:42.300> see<00:00:42.390> different<00:00:42.989> numbers<00:00:43.020> you

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
also you'll see different numbers you

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.319 
also you'll see different numbers you
know<00:00:43.829> have<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> series<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.640> four<00:00:44.940> numbers<00:00:45.300> that

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
know have a series of four numbers that

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.150 
know have a series of four numbers that
are<00:00:45.629> direct<00:00:45.870> call<00:00:46.020> timing<00:00:46.530> numbers<00:00:46.860> and

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
are direct call timing numbers and

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.770 
are direct call timing numbers and
you'll<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:48.030> want<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.360> do<00:00:48.450> some<00:00:48.629> basic

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
you'll you want to do some basic

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.840 
you'll you want to do some basic
research<00:00:48.989> if<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.770> see<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> good<00:00:50.190> price<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.640> some

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
research if you see a good price on some

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.369 
research if you see a good price on some
memory<00:00:51.090> some<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.510> might<00:00:51.660> be<00:00:51.690> slower<00:00:52.110> even

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
memory some of it might be slower even

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.110 
memory some of it might be slower even
though<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.010> speed<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.579> your<00:00:53.820> system

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
though it is the speed that your system

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.139 
though it is the speed that your system
needs<00:00:54.300> so<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:55.230> look<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.969> information<00:00:56.969> up

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
needs so just look that information up

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.510 
needs so just look that information up
and<00:00:57.440> there's<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.500> lot<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.890> different<00:00:59.129> brands<00:00:59.340> I

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
and there's a lot of different brands I

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.760 
and there's a lot of different brands I
usually<00:00:59.789> buy<00:01:00.000> just<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:01.500> know<00:01:01.620> different

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
usually buy just you know different

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.260 
usually buy just you know different
brands<00:01:02.070> as<00:01:02.280> long<00:01:02.460> as<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.640> timings<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
brands as long as the timings and the

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.679 
brands as long as the timings and the
speeds<00:01:03.539> are<00:01:03.719> really<00:01:03.960> good<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:05.369> bought<00:01:06.060> PNY

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
speeds are really good the I bought PNY

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.140 
speeds are really good the I bought PNY
and<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.920> couple<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.490> those<00:01:08.610> brands<00:01:08.909> like

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
and a couple of those brands like

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.600 
and a couple of those brands like
Kingston<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.990> really<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:11.040> not<00:01:11.189> had<00:01:11.400> too

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
Kingston and really have not had too

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.280 
Kingston and really have not had too
much<00:01:11.760> trouble<00:01:12.270> with<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.750> those<00:01:13.229> are

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
much trouble with it and those are

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.020 
much trouble with it and those are
really<00:01:13.710> really<00:01:13.920> good<00:01:14.070> brands<00:01:14.400> but<00:01:14.549> also<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
really really good brands but also the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.270 
really really good brands but also the
generic<00:01:15.479> brands<00:01:15.869> are<00:01:16.020> really<00:01:16.130> really<00:01:17.130> good

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
generic brands are really really good

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.520 
generic brands are really really good
too<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.780> know<00:01:18.840> do<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> little<00:01:19.380> research

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
too so you know do a little research

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.770 
too so you know do a little research
find<00:01:20.070> out<00:01:20.220> about<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.520> brands<00:01:20.970> some<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
find out about the brands some of the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.560 
find out about the brands some of the
other<00:01:21.930> brands<00:01:22.200> out<00:01:22.380> there<00:01:23.479> just<00:01:24.479> just

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
other brands out there just just

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.210 
other brands out there just just
research<00:01:25.080> them<00:01:25.259> look<00:01:25.470> what<00:01:25.590> other<00:01:25.770> people<00:01:26.040> say

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
research them look what other people say

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.440 
research them look what other people say
about<00:01:26.250> them<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.790> picked<00:01:27.030> up<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.210> lot<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.360> my

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
about them I picked up a lot of my

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.210 
about them I picked up a lot of my
memory<00:01:27.750> from<00:01:27.869> club<00:01:28.229> accom<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.009> also

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220

install<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.950> central<00:01:35.159> component<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:36.000> not<00:01:36.119> hard

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
install a central component but not hard

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.690 
install a central component but not hard
to<00:01:36.479> install<00:01:36.810> only<00:01:37.350> goes<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:38.009> one<00:01:38.040> way<00:01:38.310> these

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
to install only goes in one way these

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.940 
to install only goes in one way these
newer<00:01:39.000> boards<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.930> just<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.500> know<00:01:40.560> put<00:01:40.860> it

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
newer boards you just you know put it

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.450 
newer boards you just you know put it
straight<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.310> click<00:01:42.150> click<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:43.460> and

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
straight in click click it's in and

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.499 
straight in click click it's in and
pretty<00:01:44.759> much<00:01:44.850> ready<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.240> go

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
pretty much ready to go

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.590 
pretty much ready to go
I<00:01:45.750> do<00:01:46.320> recommend<00:01:46.799> going<00:01:47.159> with<00:01:47.490> at<00:01:48.210> least<00:01:48.390> a

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
I do recommend going with at least a

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.929 
I do recommend going with at least a
gigabyte<00:01:49.100> starting<00:01:50.100> these<00:01:50.189> days<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.790> can

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
gigabyte starting these days and you can

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.120 
gigabyte starting these days and you can
usually<00:01:51.060> get<00:01:51.360> 1<00:01:51.630> gigabyte<00:01:51.990> chip<00:01:52.130> relatively

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
usually get 1 gigabyte chip relatively

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.880 
usually get 1 gigabyte chip relatively
cheap<00:01:53.369> nowadays<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:55.200> gigabyte<00:01:55.770> will

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
cheap nowadays and a gigabyte will

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.499 
cheap nowadays and a gigabyte will
really<00:01:56.250> get<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.460> up<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.820> going<00:01:56.969> I'm<00:01:57.240> running

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
really get you up and going I'm running

gaming<00:02:05.700> stuff<00:02:05.939> make<00:02:06.180> two<00:02:06.390> gigs<00:02:06.600> would<00:02:06.810> be<00:02:06.869> good

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
gaming stuff make two gigs would be good

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.180 
gaming stuff make two gigs would be good
for<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.290> depending<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:07.740> what<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.950> want<00:02:08.129> to

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
for you depending on what you want to

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.160 
for you depending on what you want to
spend<00:02:08.459> but<00:02:09.179> that's<00:02:09.660> definitely<00:02:10.050> something

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
spend but that's definitely something

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.229 
spend but that's definitely something
look<00:02:10.379> at<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.619> want<00:02:10.800> fast<00:02:11.039> memory<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.700> lot<00:02:12.090> of

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
look at you want fast memory a lot of

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:12.910 
look at you want fast memory a lot of
memory

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
memory

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.100 
memory
and<00:02:13.670> that's<00:02:14.090> just<00:02:14.180> gonna<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:14.750> know<00:02:14.840> allow<00:02:15.050> you

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
and that's just gonna you know allow you

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.140 
and that's just gonna you know allow you
to<00:02:15.350> expand<00:02:15.770> make<00:02:16.280> sure<00:02:16.430> their<00:02:16.610> motherboard

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
to expand make sure their motherboard

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.840 
to expand make sure their motherboard
does<00:02:17.420> allow<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.870> also<00:02:18.620> expand<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:19.550> memory

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
does allow you to also expand the memory

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.730 
does allow you to also expand the memory
at<00:02:19.970> least<00:02:20.000> four<00:02:20.390> slots<00:02:20.690> is<00:02:20.930> definitely<00:02:21.350> a<00:02:21.410> good

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
at least four slots is definitely a good

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.980 
at least four slots is definitely a good
way<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:21.950> go<00:02:22.220> you'll<00:02:22.940> also<00:02:23.180> see<00:02:23.480> something<00:02:23.750> like

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
way to go you'll also see something like

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.480 
way to go you'll also see something like
dual<00:02:24.260> channel<00:02:24.740> which<00:02:24.890> almost<00:02:25.130> all<00:02:25.370> the

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
dual channel which almost all the

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.070 
dual channel which almost all the
board's<00:02:25.850> offer<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:26.569> that's<00:02:26.990> just<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.440> way<00:02:27.560> of

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
board's offer and that's just a way of

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.350 
board's offer and that's just a way of
bringing<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.530> memory<00:02:31.250> slots<00:02:31.520> together<00:02:31.760> so<00:02:32.270> if

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
bringing the memory slots together so if

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.730 
bringing the memory slots together so if
you're<00:02:32.480> running<00:02:32.720> two<00:02:32.930> gigabytes

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
you're running two gigabytes

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.770 
you're running two gigabytes
instead<00:02:34.459> of<00:02:34.550> addressing<00:02:34.940> them<00:02:35.060> separately<00:02:35.540> it

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
instead of addressing them separately it

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.949 
instead of addressing them separately it
addresses<00:02:36.440> it<00:02:36.590> as<00:02:36.709> one<00:02:37.240> memory<00:02:38.240> module<00:02:38.660> and

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
addresses it as one memory module and

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.300 
addresses it as one memory module and
makes<00:02:39.170> things<00:02:39.350> a<00:02:39.470> little<00:02:39.560> bit<00:02:39.709> faster<00:02:40.100> that's

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
makes things a little bit faster that's

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.910 
makes things a little bit faster that's
pretty<00:02:40.550> much<00:02:40.640> all<00:02:40.850> that<00:02:40.880> is<00:02:41.209> so<00:02:41.570> memory<00:02:42.050> right

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
pretty much all that is so memory right

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.430 
pretty much all that is so memory right
here<00:02:43.250> go<00:02:44.120> ahead<00:02:44.330> check<00:02:44.630> it<00:02:44.780> out<00:02:44.930> make<00:02:45.230> sure<00:02:45.260> you

here go ahead check it out make sure you

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.860 
here go ahead check it out make sure you
get<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.680> right<00:02:45.830> ones<00:02:46.100> but<00:02:46.489> essential<00:02:47.180> part<00:02:47.660> of
