00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
watch it and it was a way it was pretty

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.229 
watch it and it was a way it was pretty
crazy<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.840> wasn't<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:47.070> best<00:00:47.399> trailer<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:47.910> don't

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
crazy it wasn't the best trailer I don't

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.540 
crazy it wasn't the best trailer I don't
think<00:00:48.480> because<00:00:49.050> there<00:00:49.320> wasn't<00:00:49.530> any<00:00:49.980> action

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
think because there wasn't any action

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.040 
think because there wasn't any action
but<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.989> was<00:00:52.739> very<00:00:53.239> suspenseful<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.390> think<00:00:54.719> it

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
but it was very suspenseful I think it

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.700 
but it was very suspenseful I think it
was<00:00:55.469> just<00:00:55.530> very<00:00:55.860> slow<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:58.170> mean<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:58.590> our

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
was just very slow so I mean it's our

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.860 
was just very slow so I mean it's our
