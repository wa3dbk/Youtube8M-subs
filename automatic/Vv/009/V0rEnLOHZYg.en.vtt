the graffiti that you see on this car it

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.039 
the graffiti that you see on this car it
wasn't<00:02:43.549> an<00:02:43.640> easy<00:02:43.760> task<00:02:44.150> but<00:02:44.510> then<00:02:44.659> again<00:02:44.900> it

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
wasn't an easy task but then again it

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:46.839 
wasn't an easy task but then again it
wasn't<00:02:45.230> that<00:02:45.440> difficult<00:02:45.709> either<00:02:46.159> and<00:02:46.580> you<00:02:46.670> can

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
wasn't that difficult either and you can

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.550 
wasn't that difficult either and you can
see<00:02:47.030> that<00:02:47.209> I<00:02:47.299> welded<00:02:47.569> up<00:02:47.810> all<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.170> windows

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560

see that I welded up all the windows
with<00:02:48.799> styrene<00:02:49.450> now<00:02:50.450> let's<00:02:50.720> flip<00:02:50.900> it<00:02:50.959> around

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
with styrene now let's flip it around

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.970 
with styrene now let's flip it around
and<00:02:51.560> look<00:02:51.650> at<00:02:51.799> the<00:02:51.830> other<00:02:52.040> side<00:02:53.620> okay<00:02:54.620> here's

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
and look at the other side okay here's

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.110 
and look at the other side okay here's
the<00:02:55.190> other<00:02:55.310> side<00:02:55.670> of<00:02:55.879> it<00:02:56.030> I<00:02:56.720> know<00:02:57.709> that<00:02:58.040> in<00:02:58.849> none

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
the other side of it I know that in none

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.770 
the other side of it I know that in none
of<00:02:59.150> these<00:02:59.329> pictures<00:02:59.810> is<00:03:00.140> probably<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:01.780> ends

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
of these pictures is probably the ends

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.110 
of these pictures is probably the ends
of<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.019> car<00:03:03.290> where<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.159> doors<00:03:04.400> are<00:03:04.670> are<00:03:04.909> not

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
said on the real caboose because I

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.289 
said on the real caboose because I
wasn't<00:03:30.859> smart<00:03:31.280> enough<00:03:31.310> to<00:03:31.519> get<00:03:31.760> back<00:03:31.940> and<00:03:32.150> take

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159 
of the other side in both ends but as

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:39.940 
of the other side in both ends but as
you'll<00:03:37.579> see<00:03:37.900> this<00:03:38.900> is<00:03:38.959> what<00:03:39.170> I<00:03:39.200> wound<00:03:39.470> up<00:03:39.709> with

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.580 
and so let's get this thing put together
and<00:03:44.120> try<00:03:44.450> and<00:03:44.569> make<00:03:44.690> some<00:03:44.930> sense<00:03:45.139> out<00:03:45.349> of<00:03:45.410> this

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590
