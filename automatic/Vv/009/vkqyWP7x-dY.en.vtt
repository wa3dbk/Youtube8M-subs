00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:25.000
 probably the biggest and most important thing in life 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:30.279
 a thing he can't do or 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.160
 makes it worse than me is a director I know how 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.620
 do it but he doesn't but he doesn't know how 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:40.230
 hockey play in general he can not stand 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:43.330
 skating on roller skates does not know how he 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.900
 not even a quarter can do that 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:51.960
 what can i do on the computer at all 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:54.600
 here he speaks a hundred times worse than me 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.160
 a hundred times worse than me speak 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.190
 foreign languages 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.100
 I basically almost perfectly mastered 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.410
 english language and very good 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:12.030
 speak chinese and he doesn't 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:14.619
 can do no one knew how to drive a car 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.280
 definitely it is very controversial 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.590
 question for us he disagrees with that 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.490
 but if paragraph b is used, we will exit 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:28.330
 parallel place you are an hour earlier 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:31.210
 I come there and in rare cases when he 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.040
 me somewhere overtaking lady navigator died 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.509
 one more is a rare case then 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.070
 remembers there for two years 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:41.380
 why are you lying all or something else or 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.140
 once it's a shame and such a thing for 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.220
 I took us on my autoradio 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:52.780
 participation just race on by or russian 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:55.030
 I donâ€™t remember Moscow 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.740
 rules are okay in the sense of breaking 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:02.680
 rules but not boundless 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.549
 cork all things going somewhere like 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.459
 ordinary person as a driver like 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.680
 chauffeur on he turns out took out 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.480
 facing the policeman came retouch 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.690
 policeman race so and so it is possible and there 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.730
 four ways crossed he blocked him 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.910
 movement he crossed the line for 40 minutes 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.460
 I used to come all and I am ahead 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.080
 he was already behind him 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.910
 with full confidence I see he is not 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.500
 it overtakes even the mirrors there back 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.950
 come it is worth the game somehow 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.250
 and everything and he considered that he won the race 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.470
 this is not true even when we bought 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.090
 SUVs 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.060
 I did everything to ensure that 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.310
 I have a long SUV weaker than him 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.180
 so he can easily get me on the way 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.950
 catch up 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.930
 overtake thing because i don't care 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.910
 even with a weak motor anyway its 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.690
 warm up catch up but so he wants all the time 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.690
 and the stove themselves do not like to admit so 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.830
 and he became there about the director probably yes 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.830
 no, I admit it 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.110

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.110
