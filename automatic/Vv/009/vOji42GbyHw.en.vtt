00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
back by a few more weeks so my original

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.680 
back by a few more weeks so my original
prediction<00:04:08.170> was<00:04:08.530> for<00:04:08.920> kind<00:04:09.640> of<00:04:09.700> the<00:04:09.820> februari

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
prediction was for kind of the februari

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.920 
prediction was for kind of the februari
midterm<00:04:11.410> kind<00:04:11.860> of<00:04:11.920> round<00:04:12.160> the<00:04:12.580> 14<00:04:13.390> 15<00:04:13.750> 16

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
midterm kind of round the 14 15 16

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.770 
midterm kind of round the 14 15 16
somewhere<00:04:14.530> around<00:04:14.620> that<00:04:14.980> kind<00:04:15.130> of<00:04:15.280> zone<00:04:15.780> but

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
somewhere around that kind of zone but

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.690 
somewhere around that kind of zone but
because<00:04:17.170> of<00:04:17.200> these<00:04:17.650> issues<00:04:18.160> of<00:04:18.370> course

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
because of these issues of course

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.210 
because of these issues of course
because<00:04:19.090> 4j<00:04:19.750> Studios<00:04:20.200> their<00:04:20.620> attention<00:04:21.100> is

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
because 4j Studios their attention is

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.600 
because 4j Studios their attention is
mainly<00:04:21.580> on<00:04:22.470> ps3<00:04:23.470> and<00:04:23.890> getting<00:04:24.070> that<00:04:24.130> fixed<00:04:24.430> at

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
mainly on ps3 and getting that fixed at

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
the moment a lot of people are

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.300 
the moment a lot of people are
predicting<00:04:26.770> it's<00:04:26.950> going<00:04:27.160> to

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
predicting it's going to

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.640

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
is going to be in it i think it's going

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.240 
is going to be in it i think it's going
to<00:04:55.389> be<00:04:55.450> great<00:04:55.660> update<00:04:56.050> and<00:04:56.230> they<00:04:56.710> have<00:04:56.889> stated

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
to be great update and they have stated

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.320 
to be great update and they have stated
that<00:04:57.580> right<00:04:57.880> after<00:04:58.120> that<00:04:58.510> and<00:04:58.780> the<00:04:59.650> next-gen

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
that right after that and the next-gen

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.790 
that right after that and the next-gen
versions<00:05:01.330> of<00:05:01.510> Minecraft<00:05:01.810> should<00:05:02.410> be<00:05:02.530> rolling

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
versions of Minecraft should be rolling

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.330 
versions of Minecraft should be rolling
out<00:05:03.190> so<00:05:03.820> I'm<00:05:04.060> predicting<00:05:04.570> tu14<00:05:05.260> for<00:05:05.770> maybe<00:05:05.950> the

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
out so I'm predicting tu14 for maybe the

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.180 
out so I'm predicting tu14 for maybe the
stairs<00:05:06.729> of<00:05:07.050> maybe<00:05:08.050> to<00:05:08.260> start<00:05:08.500> a<00:05:08.590> marriage<00:05:08.800> and

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
stairs of maybe to start a marriage and

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.890 
stairs of maybe to start a marriage and
I'm<00:05:09.370> predicting<00:05:09.850> the<00:05:09.940> next-gen<00:05:10.360> versions<00:05:10.780> of

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
I'm predicting the next-gen versions of

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.230 
I'm predicting the next-gen versions of
Minecraft<00:05:11.139> maybe<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:11.889> end<00:05:12.040> of<00:05:12.280> March<00:05:12.550> I<00:05:12.820> could

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
Minecraft maybe the end of March I could

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.670 
Minecraft maybe the end of March I could
be<00:05:13.330> completely<00:05:13.450> wrong<00:05:13.780> there<00:05:14.260> is<00:05:14.380> sites

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
be completely wrong there is sites

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.290 
be completely wrong there is sites
predicting<00:05:15.280> that<00:05:15.370> it<00:05:15.520> could<00:05:15.669> be<00:05:15.700> the<00:05:15.940> start<00:05:16.000> of

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
predicting that it could be the start of

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.629 
predicting that it could be the start of
merit<00:05:16.570> when<00:05:16.720> we<00:05:16.840> get<00:05:16.960> next<00:05:17.380> next-gen<00:05:18.190> versions

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
merit when we get next next-gen versions

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.460 
merit when we get next next-gen versions
there's<00:05:19.270> some<00:05:19.510> sites<00:05:19.810> and<00:05:20.050> even<00:05:20.290> some

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
there's some sites and even some

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.960 
there's some sites and even some
youtubers<00:05:20.979> are<00:05:21.160> predicting<00:05:21.610> that<00:05:21.639> it<00:05:21.850> could

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
youtubers are predicting that it could

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.719 
youtubers are predicting that it could
be<00:05:22.000> the<00:05:22.210> summer<00:05:22.770> early<00:05:23.770> summer<00:05:24.070> before<00:05:24.340> we<00:05:24.610> get

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
be the summer early summer before we get

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.540 
be the summer early summer before we get
these<00:05:24.880> next-gen<00:05:25.450> versions<00:05:25.930> so<00:05:26.590> hopefully<00:05:27.340> it

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
these next-gen versions so hopefully it

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.190 
these next-gen versions so hopefully it
would<00:05:27.729> be<00:05:27.790> earlier<00:05:28.330> not<00:05:28.570> hopefully<00:05:28.990> it<00:05:29.110> will

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
would be earlier not hopefully it will

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.800 
would be earlier not hopefully it will
be<00:05:29.410> sometime<00:05:29.680> in<00:05:30.070> March<00:05:30.370> but<00:05:30.940> myself<00:05:31.180> I<00:05:31.690> have

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
be sometime in March but myself I have

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.360 
be sometime in March but myself I have
my<00:05:31.960> money<00:05:32.169> bet<00:05:32.440> there's<00:05:32.650> gonna<00:05:32.830> be<00:05:32.950> some<00:05:33.190> time

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370
