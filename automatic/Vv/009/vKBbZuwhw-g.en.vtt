00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.680
 hello I'm angela from the visual mission 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.330
 I will explain how to make the closure 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.990
 of points when you have elastic point 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:27.210
 in this case we are knitting the points 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:31.079
 as they are presented in this case we have 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.430
 at the beginning two points of right we weave 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.980
 the two points of the right 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.520
 and the first point just like the closing 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.880
 traditional we passed it over 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.740
 next point we have it upside down 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:49.130
 we protect from the reverse 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:52.850
 and we passed the point above 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:56.570
 we continue we have another point of the reverse 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.829
 we knit it the other way around we passed the point 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:04.190
 above and so we are closing each one 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:07.250
 of the knitting points according to how 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.009
 present if you tend to squeeze a lot 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.220
 point I recommend you use a 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:16.369
 needle of a greater thickness so that the 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.140
 points are not too tight this 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.229
 close as is a knit sample 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.380
 elastic has to be loose and a 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.929
 little elastic if we squeeze a lot this is 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.729
 it can get very tight and the function 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:30.580
 from this point it should be elastic 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.800
 misses 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.800
 we keep closing the points 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.420
 and another important thing that I always 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:47.490
 I usually do is close the points when 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.490
 you are in the back of the back 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.870
 in this way you see good in this case 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.210
 as it is elastic point gives a little like 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.660
 but it is preferable to always do it in the 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.540
 turn inside out you see how it looks 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:05.170
 practically symmetrical to the assembly of 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:09.640
 points in the initial part and by the 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.860
 upper part is this way you see and 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.130
 on the other side is also so 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.130
 symmetric 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.750
 well, we continue 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.750
 closing the points 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.709
 remember not to tighten and close well all 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:28.900
 the points can not be any point 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.220
 loose because if not all would be undone 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.820
 like work 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.820
 we follow 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.080
 and we have 4 points left 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.090
 3 more 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.530
 and that's it 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.090
 we close the last point 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:07.739
 and as always we throw a little 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.739
 we cut the strand 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.650
 we passed it through the last point and 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.290
 we would have our dead finished and 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.360
 finished we hope that this video will 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.489
 has helped you if you want to continue 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.590
 Learning to knit visit our channel 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.129
 from youtube until the next greetings
