00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 let's start making the sauce and 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:09.599
 for this I need a tomato half and 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:12.630
 four guajillo chilies we put them 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.880
 a little bit to cook while that is sewn 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.910
 let's cut the vegetables here I have 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.350
 carrot potato zucchini onion a 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.760
 tomato and I have green leaf tomato 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.920
 you can add the amount that you 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.140
 want but the more tomato I have the more 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.260
 sour is going to be the caldillo and also 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.149
 I have two poblano peppers all cut 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.540
 in small pictures onion tomato 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.840
 zucchini potato tomato carrot and chili 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.330
 all in little ones 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.430
 when the sauce is cooked, we will 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.560
 add a clove of garlic also will 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.010
 we put salt and I'm putting a 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:52.880
 little bit of dried oregano and a little 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.980
 tomato concentrate in a casserole 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.620
 to put a little oil and I'm going to 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.520
 put the toughest vegetables like the 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.339
 Potato and carrot as they are going 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.810
 to add the ones that were left 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:07.650
 remaining together with the meat and I'm 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.970
 using 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.130
 meat to wish 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.780
 and the amounts more or less are like 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:21.200
 for about 78 people with a good plate 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.930
 served the same can be varying what 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.840
 let's wiggle a little bit and let's 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.750
 add what is the sauce or the caldillo 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.270
 what we did with the tomatoes and with the 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.580
 chiles we are going to put a little more 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.830
 of salt and in the same blender we are going to 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.040
 grab more clean water and let's put 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.290
 that is, without rinsing it so that it is 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.200
 what's left in the blender we put it 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.869
 there we are going to come a little bit more and 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.880
 let's let it boil, we're going to 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.369
 cover obviously on low heat 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.930
 I do not know if they can see the line of everything 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:01.409
 what the casserole lowered the water when boiling 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.530
 and that's because my broth or my picadillo 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.420
 stayed an hour in the fire because 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.369
 potatoes were pretty hard enough 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.400
 so I imagine that with you 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.550
 will be less and then nothing would be all 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.980
 that's how it looks like it's pretty 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.440
 easy enough is very different from pp 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.349
 picadillo that I made before it has meat 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.440
 milled and I really recommend them 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:29.930
 very much is very good and for my part 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.930
 it would be all I see them in the next bye
