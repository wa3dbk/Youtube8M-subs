00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 if one card rods half rods full rod 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.950
 or goblet how to recognize them before 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.880
 buy them in your garden center or 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:16.199
 at your nursery in principle the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.609
 fruit trees are made with 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.680
 different forms then I have you 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.850
 talked about the furrows of the half cups 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.680
 stems of the cards if I have a little bit 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.730
 lost with all this the simplest it is 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.900
 already understand that these are 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.269
 trees that are grafted to 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.410
 nurseries and according to the age according to the 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.160
 size they will have shapes 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.779
 different 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.969
 let's go right to work 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.040
 practices the grooves in trees 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.410
 fruit trees are one to two weapons 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.450
 years they were grafted to the base and we 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.860
 just ends up with a rod but this 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.559
 are trees that remain to be trained 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.629
 you can train them into rods 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.610
 goblet if you wish or why 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.469
 not in palm is provided that it is 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.809
 grafted onto a weak graft 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.360
 force in principle the paths are 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.670
 trees that are sold at prices 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.530
 down in the supermarket the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.600
 goblets or that they they are 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.750
 trees whose trunk makes a minimum of 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.129
 60 cm you can find smaller ones 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.479
 in principle it's the size that was 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.820
 required to have a nice goblins to 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.580
 goblet in principle three or four 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.439
 years of which they are already trained trees 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.850
 so the advantage is that they are 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.710
 pretty low trees by the time you go 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.850
 able to pick the fruits and well you 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.500
 will have the fruits roughly at the same 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.020
 height would almost even not 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.310
 need to scale the disadvantage it's 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.229
 that these are branches that will you 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.119
 annoy if for example you plant your 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.650
 goblet in the middle of a lawn when 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.750
 you will spend with your lawnmower 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:38.610
 you will always be bored at the time of 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:40.170
 passage 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 between 8 and 10 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.210
 meters it's the right distance when 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.189
 you're planting trees full of wind 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.810
 Plains stems so they do more 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.220
 one meter eighty author 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.630
 the benefits of these trees is that we 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.119
 can always turn around you are 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.130
 not bothered by his branches and if you 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.899
 own a micro tractor unit 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.939
 mower that will allow you to mow 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.040
 at the foot of your tree without being disturbed 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.810
 by the branches only you will have 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.030
 need a ladder to go pick 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.000
 fruits a fruit tree because of 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.369
 stems or 2010 the big difference it's 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.520
 the height of the trunk a quarter of stems 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.470
 measure between 40 and 60 cm of author here 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.440
 seized nasri 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.600
 and it is grafted to 50 cm in height 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.580
 the advantage is that it is a low tree 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.680
 you can easily pick his 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.600
 fruit the inconvenience a little bit like 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.130
 the goblets and well if in the middle 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.080
 of a lawn but you will always be 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.430
 bored with the branches that were going 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.620
 that may happen in your eyes 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.320
 the half stems and still more where he 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.830
 is grafted 130 cm high between 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.970
 110 and 140 cm of author so it will be 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.790
 much easier to be able to 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.770
 circulate around to pick the fruits 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.810
 you will need a stepladder anyway 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.060
 since the twigs will be at a 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.760
 certain height between capturing 5 m or 6 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.709
 meters depending on the species of your tree a 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.780
 another very important criterion is the 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.860
 trunk circumference and I said well 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.230
 the circumference 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:02.000
 when you sell a tree there is a 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.190
 circumference 6 8 8 10 10 12 12 14 ce 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.590
 are dimensions of the circumference 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.090
 from deception to one meter from the ground here he 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.340
 this is a 6.8 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.020
 so it's a young tree so he goes 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.790
 report in four or five years 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.860
 will give some apples but no longer the 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.050
 diameter is bigger the faster you will 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.940
 fruits also beware when 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.980
 you buy a tree when it is in 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.080
 skin and well will be anyway 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.690
 buried so your tree are you going 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.730
 lose between 20 and 30 cm of author that he 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.860
 it is a furrow of a quarter of stem 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.480
 half a stem of a goblet or a 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.620
 rod at the moment you go you 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.200
 to procure this weapon 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.030
 check the condition of its branches 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.070
 branches should be well fed 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.780
 if the branches are dry it's a 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.250
 tree that died from before and these are 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.720
 often trees found in 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.720
 premises overheated
