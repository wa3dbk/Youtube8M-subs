00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
is a leather neck strap that I'm sure

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.840 
is a leather neck strap that I'm sure
says<00:01:56.280> Rico<00:01:56.579> on<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:58.280> so<00:01:59.280> that's<00:01:59.399> pretty<00:01:59.520> cool

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
says Rico on it so that's pretty cool

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.770 
says Rico on it so that's pretty cool
and<00:02:00.500> let's<00:02:01.500> see<00:02:01.680> you've<00:02:01.860> got<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.430> disc<00:02:03.180> for

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
and let's see you've got a disc for

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.880 
and let's see you've got a disc for
software<00:02:04.140> which<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.799> will<00:02:05.700> use<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.770> whole<00:02:07.770> bunch

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
software which I will use a whole bunch

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.910

explanation<00:02:15.660> on<00:02:16.660> this<00:02:16.900> side<00:02:17.080> you<00:02:17.170> have

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
explanation on this side you have

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.180 
explanation on this side you have
something<00:02:17.620> that<00:02:17.740> I<00:02:17.800> probably<00:02:17.950> will<00:02:18.580> use<00:02:20.190> which

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
something that I probably will use which

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.610 
something that I probably will use which
is<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.370> leather<00:02:21.610> case<00:02:21.880> so<00:02:22.330> I<00:02:22.360> will<00:02:22.780> likely<00:02:23.319> toss

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
is a leather case so I will likely toss

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.960 
is a leather case so I will likely toss
the<00:02:23.800> camera<00:02:24.160> in<00:02:24.220> this<00:02:24.400> way<00:02:24.610> I'm<00:02:24.760> going<00:02:24.819> to

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
the camera in this way I'm going to

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.260 
the camera in this way I'm going to
throw<00:02:25.120> in<00:02:25.209> a<00:02:25.270> bag<00:02:25.420> or<00:02:25.630> something<00:02:25.810> like<00:02:26.140> that

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
throw in a bag or something like that

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:37.770 
throw in a bag or something like that
pretty<00:02:28.270> cool<00:02:28.510> little<00:02:28.600> thing<00:02:29.520> so<00:02:30.540> that's<00:02:31.540> me<00:02:36.780> so

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
pretty cool little thing so that's me so

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.050 
pretty cool little thing so that's me so
here's<00:02:38.500> how<00:02:38.680> it's<00:02:38.860> packaged<00:02:39.400> in<00:02:39.610> here<00:02:39.880> and

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
here's how it's packaged in here and

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.350 
here's how it's packaged in here and
you've<00:02:40.420> got<00:02:40.450> a<00:02:41.430> plug<00:02:42.430> here<00:02:42.700> I<00:02:42.880> believe<00:02:43.150> this<00:02:43.300> is

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
you've got a plug here I believe this is

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:51.600 
you've got a plug here I believe this is
