about a different topic that's important

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.890 
about a different topic that's important
to<00:00:27.599> me<00:00:28.070> starting<00:00:29.070> with<00:00:29.539> vegetarianism<00:00:30.539> this

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
to me starting with vegetarianism this

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.500 
to me starting with vegetarianism this
week<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.830> I've<00:00:32.160> been<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.340> vegetarian<00:00:32.489> now<00:00:33.000> for

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
week so I've been a vegetarian now for

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.860 
week so I've been a vegetarian now for
about<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:34.380> think<00:00:34.800> it's<00:00:34.920> about<00:00:35.040> 16<00:00:35.700> 18<00:00:36.300> years<00:00:36.600> and

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
about I think it's about 16 18 years and

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.459 
about I think it's about 16 18 years and
I<00:00:37.469> started<00:00:38.210> when<00:00:39.210> somebody<00:00:39.570> at<00:00:39.690> work<00:00:39.870> gave<00:00:40.200> me

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
I started when somebody at work gave me

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.150 
I started when somebody at work gave me
a<00:00:40.500> book<00:00:40.829> about<00:00:42.260> you<00:00:43.260> know<00:00:43.379> not<00:00:43.620> eating<00:00:43.980> meat

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
a book about you know not eating meat

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.069 
a book about you know not eating meat
and<00:00:44.550> what<00:00:44.910> eating<00:00:45.239> meat<00:00:45.420> does<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.809> your<00:00:45.899> body

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
and what eating meat does to your body

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.720 
and what eating meat does to your body
and<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.500> was<00:00:46.590> actually<00:00:46.739> more<00:00:47.100> from<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.550> health

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
and it was actually more from a health

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.529 
and it was actually more from a health
perspective<00:00:47.989> than<00:00:48.989> actually<00:00:49.610> about<00:00:50.610> how<00:00:51.090> it's

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
perspective than actually about how it's

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.560 
perspective than actually about how it's
harmful<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.350> animals<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.129> whole<00:00:53.570> process

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
harmful to animals in the whole process

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.799 
harmful to animals in the whole process
of<00:00:55.170> raising<00:00:55.920> animals<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:57.239> then<00:00:57.420> killing<00:00:57.690> them

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
of raising animals and then killing them

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.450 
of raising animals and then killing them
in<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.109> US<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.890> was<00:00:58.980> really<00:00:59.100> more<00:00:59.399> just

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
in the US so it was really more just

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.869 
in the US so it was really more just
about<00:00:59.760> for<00:01:00.180> health<00:01:00.359> reasons<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:01.879> it's

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
about for health reasons and it's

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.579 
about for health reasons and it's
evolved<00:01:03.390> since<00:01:03.570> then<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.439> know<00:01:04.559> I

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
evolved since then and you know I

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.039 
evolved since then and you know I
started<00:01:05.070> by<00:01:05.309> not<00:01:05.850> eating<00:01:06.030> red<00:01:06.390> meat<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.689> then

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
started by not eating red meat and then

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.469 
started by not eating red meat and then
I<00:01:07.260> stopped<00:01:07.560> eating<00:01:07.740> chicken<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.549> over<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
I stopped eating chicken and over the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.330 
I stopped eating chicken and over the
years<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.990> actually<00:01:10.140> went<00:01:10.380> vegan<00:01:10.650> for<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.130> while

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
years I actually went vegan for a while

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.149 
years I actually went vegan for a while
which<00:01:11.880> means<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.570> didn't<00:01:12.840> eat<00:01:13.020> anything<00:01:13.470> that

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
which means I didn't eat anything that

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.760 
which means I didn't eat anything that
came<00:01:15.150> from<00:01:15.540> an<00:01:15.750> animal<00:01:16.460> including<00:01:17.460> eggs<00:01:17.880> and

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.210 
did that for a couple of years and then
I<00:01:24.299> went<00:01:24.479> back<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.810> being<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.140> vegetarian<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:26.070> now
