discipline and dancers period when I was
in<00:00:38.630> my<00:00:38.809> 20s<00:00:39.260> young<00:00:39.680> 20s<00:00:40.130> I<00:00:40.370> find<00:00:41.180> that<00:00:41.480> if<00:00:41.690> I<00:00:41.840> did

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
in my 20s young 20s I find that if I did

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.290 
in my 20s young 20s I find that if I did
this<00:00:42.230> kind<00:00:42.410> of<00:00:42.559> a<00:00:42.680> job<00:00:42.920> I<00:00:43.250> would<00:00:44.059> tire

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
this kind of a job I would tire

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.710 
this kind of a job I would tire
extremely<00:00:45.230> fast<00:00:45.580> and<00:00:46.580> I<00:00:47.030> don't<00:00:47.090> know<00:00:47.330> why<00:00:47.510> that

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
extremely fast and I don't know why that

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.120 
extremely fast and I don't know why that
is<00:00:47.930> maybe<00:00:48.500> I<00:00:48.620> was<00:00:50.020> maybe<00:00:51.020> because<00:00:51.500> I<00:00:51.620> spent<00:00:51.980> too

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
is maybe I was maybe because I spent too

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.350 
is maybe I was maybe because I spent too
much<00:00:52.280> energy<00:00:52.540> in<00:00:53.540> other<00:00:53.720> areas<00:00:54.200> and<00:00:55.360> whereas

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
much energy in other areas and whereas

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.660 
much energy in other areas and whereas
now<00:00:56.540> I've<00:00:56.810> concentrated<00:00:57.530> all<00:00:58.010> my<00:00:58.190> energies

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
now I've concentrated all my energies

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.060 
now I've concentrated all my energies
into<00:00:58.930> what<00:00:59.930> I'm<00:01:00.079> going<00:01:00.290> to<00:01:00.380> do<00:01:00.560> and<00:01:00.770> I<00:01:00.829> know<00:01:01.010> if

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.060 

yeah<00:01:14.570> I<00:01:14.600> started<00:01:14.930> off<00:01:15.140> with<00:01:15.350> yoga<00:01:15.710> because<00:01:15.890> I

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
yeah I started off with yoga because I

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.700 
yeah I started off with yoga because I
had<00:01:16.399> a<00:01:17.080> back<00:01:18.080> problem<00:01:18.189> and<00:01:20.049> which<00:01:21.049> I<00:01:21.200> still<00:01:21.440> do

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
had a back problem and which I still do

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.070 
had a back problem and which I still do
when<00:01:21.979> I<00:01:22.100> find<00:01:22.340> that<00:01:22.640> all<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.420> exercises

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
when I find that all the exercises

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.810 
when I find that all the exercises
because<00:01:24.470> it<00:01:24.799> uses<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.670> spine<00:01:26.000> so<00:01:26.479> completely

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
because it uses the spine so completely

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.440 
because it uses the spine so completely
exercises<00:01:28.820> but<00:01:29.330> it<00:01:29.479> was<00:01:29.630> improving<00:01:30.020> my<00:01:30.320> back

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.450 

you<00:01:35.450> combine<00:01:36.439> your<00:01:36.710> breathing<00:01:37.190> with<00:01:37.429> your

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
you combine your breathing with your

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.510 
you combine your breathing with your
exercises<00:01:38.149> and<00:01:38.569> it<00:01:38.690> doesn't<00:01:39.470> where<00:01:40.159> you<00:01:40.340> ask

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
exercises and it doesn't where you ask

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.850 
exercises and it doesn't where you ask
for<00:01:40.729> your<00:01:40.850> shirt<00:01:41.119> so<00:01:41.990> I<00:01:42.020> really<00:01:42.409> like<00:01:42.560> it<00:01:42.740> to

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
I die of embarrassment because it was a

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.460 
I die of embarrassment because it was a
very<00:01:55.759> personal<00:01:56.330> thing<00:01:56.479> I'd<00:01:56.810> ever<00:01:56.840> done<00:01:57.259> on

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
very personal thing I'd ever done on

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.760 
very personal thing I'd ever done on
movie<00:01:57.860> and<00:01:58.360> as<00:01:59.360> far<00:01:59.600> as<00:01:59.720> an<00:01:59.840> actress<00:02:00.229> goes<00:02:00.530> I'm

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
movie and as far as an actress goes I'm

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:15.270 
movie and as far as an actress goes I'm
sure<00:02:01.159> there's<00:02:01.490> no<00:02:01.700> anything<00:02:02.119> about<00:02:02.539> that

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:24.720 

I<00:02:21.540> feel<00:02:22.540> that<00:02:22.720> I<00:02:22.750> come<00:02:23.080> across<00:02:23.110> better<00:02:23.730> line

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
I feel that I come across better line

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.770 
I feel that I come across better line
when<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.510> do<00:02:25.590> on<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.709> screen<00:02:26.950> I<00:02:27.459> find<00:02:28.420> that<00:02:28.569> in

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
when I do on the screen I find that in

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.800 
when I do on the screen I find that in
my<00:02:28.959> when<00:02:29.290> I<00:02:29.319> watch<00:02:29.620> myself<00:02:29.830> on<00:02:30.190> television

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
my when I watch myself on television

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.300 
my when I watch myself on television
dancing<00:02:31.810> dancing<00:02:32.350> I<00:02:32.760> just<00:02:33.840> don't<00:02:34.840> seem<00:02:35.200> to

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
dancing dancing I just don't seem to

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.640 
dancing dancing I just don't seem to
because<00:02:36.310> I<00:02:36.459> think<00:02:36.520> I'm<00:02:36.880> very<00:02:37.450> visual<00:02:37.959> I<00:02:38.050> think

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
because I think I'm very visual I think

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.309 
because I think I'm very visual I think
that<00:02:39.060> place<00:02:40.060> has<00:02:40.300> so<00:02:40.480> much<00:02:40.660> to<00:02:40.900> do<00:02:41.050> with

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
that place has so much to do with

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.960 
that place has so much to do with
expressing<00:02:41.980> what<00:02:42.130> you're<00:02:42.280> doing<00:02:42.459> physically

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
expressing what you're doing physically

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.750 
expressing what you're doing physically
as<00:02:43.090> well<00:02:43.330> in<00:02:44.020> dance<00:02:44.319> which<00:02:45.100> you<00:02:45.250> can't<00:02:45.489> see<00:02:45.580> on

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
as well in dance which you can't see on

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.630 
as well in dance which you can't see on
TV<00:02:46.300> once<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.410> get<00:02:47.650> more<00:02:48.010> than<00:02:48.160> two<00:02:48.340> people

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
TV once you get more than two people

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.780 
TV once you get more than two people
full-length<00:02:49.410> dancing<00:02:50.410> you<00:02:51.160> lose<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.550> face

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
full-length dancing you lose the face

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.479 
full-length dancing you lose the face
and<00:02:52.180> I<00:02:53.110> always<00:02:53.350> look<00:02:53.530> at<00:02:53.620> faces<00:02:54.100> because<00:02:54.310> they

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
and I always look at faces because they

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.570 
and I always look at faces because they
they<00:02:55.209> say<00:02:55.450> so<00:02:55.510> much<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:58.200> just<00:02:59.200> find<00:02:59.580> there's

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
they say so much I just find there's

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.009 
they say so much I just find there's
something<00:03:00.910> that<00:03:00.940> dies<00:03:01.239> that<00:03:01.540> doesn't<00:03:01.900> come

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
something that dies that doesn't come

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.979 
something that dies that doesn't come
across<00:03:02.970> unless<00:03:03.970> like<00:03:04.239> for<00:03:04.420> example<00:03:04.780> if<00:03:04.870> you're

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
across unless like for example if you're

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.080 
across unless like for example if you're
watching<00:03:05.170> a<00:03:05.440> performance<00:03:05.620> on<00:03:06.090> ballerinas
