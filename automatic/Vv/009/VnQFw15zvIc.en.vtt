00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.510 
improved off but I think there are a
bunch<00:03:05.260> of<00:03:05.350> horses<00:03:05.620> that<00:03:05.860> maybe<00:03:06.070> didn't<00:03:06.370> run

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
bunch of horses that maybe didn't run

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.460 
bunch of horses that maybe didn't run
the<00:03:06.610> race<00:03:06.850> you<00:03:07.840> know<00:03:07.930> because<00:03:08.230> they<00:03:08.410> were

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
the race you know because they were

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.930 
the race you know because they were
running<00:03:08.710> on<00:03:08.950> a<00:03:08.980> track<00:03:09.310> that<00:03:09.340> they<00:03:09.550> didn't<00:03:09.790> feel

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
running on a track that they didn't feel

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.480 
running on a track that they didn't feel
very<00:03:09.970> comfortable<00:03:10.360> on<00:03:10.720> uh<00:03:10.980> but<00:03:11.980> pedigree

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
very comfortable on uh but pedigree

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.730 
very comfortable on uh but pedigree
why's<00:03:12.730> he<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.600> know<00:03:13.720> he<00:03:13.870> figured<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.380> handle<00:03:14.710> a

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
why's he you know he figured to handle a

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.390 
why's he you know he figured to handle a
work<00:03:15.130> track<00:03:15.400> like<00:03:15.640> that<00:03:15.670> uh<00:03:16.410> he<00:03:17.410> didn't<00:03:17.980> and<00:03:18.190> so

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
work track like that uh he didn't and so

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.280 
work track like that uh he didn't and so
I<00:03:18.760> you<00:03:19.540> know<00:03:19.570> I<00:03:19.660> don't<00:03:19.720> think<00:03:19.990> he<00:03:20.050> moved

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
I you know I don't think he moved

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.780 
I you know I don't think he moved
forward<00:03:20.740> on<00:03:20.830> it<00:03:21.010> but<00:03:21.160> i<00:03:21.190> don't<00:03:21.580> think<00:03:21.700> the

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
forward on it but i don't think the

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.970 
forward on it but i don't think the
track<00:03:21.970> her<00:03:22.090> terminal<00:03:22.390> so<00:03:22.690> I<00:03:22.960> in<00:03:23.410> general<00:03:23.830> as

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
track her terminal so I in general as

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.370 
track her terminal so I in general as
you<00:03:24.400> know<00:03:24.730> about<00:03:24.940> a<00:03:25.120> seven<00:03:25.600> to<00:03:25.690> five<00:03:25.840> even

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
you know about a seven to five even

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.320 
you know about a seven to five even
money<00:03:26.530> favorite<00:03:27.040> would<00:03:27.670> you<00:03:27.790> say<00:03:27.940> that<00:03:27.970> that

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
money favorite would you say that that

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.510 
money favorite would you say that that
that<00:03:28.780> he's<00:03:28.930> overvalued<00:03:29.680> undervalued<00:03:30.430> or

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
that he's overvalued undervalued or

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.600 
that he's overvalued undervalued or
appropriately<00:03:31.060> valued<00:03:31.420> at<00:03:31.510> those<00:03:31.660> odds<00:03:32.610> you

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
appropriately valued at those odds you

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.400 
appropriately valued at those odds you
know<00:03:33.700> I<00:03:33.730> actually<00:03:34.270> I<00:03:34.540> probably<00:03:34.780> say<00:03:35.170> that's

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
know I actually I probably say that's

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.790 
know I actually I probably say that's
about<00:03:35.590> right<00:03:35.800> I<00:03:36.510> wouldn't<00:03:37.510> Betemit<00:03:38.170> at<00:03:38.380> seven

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
about right I wouldn't Betemit at seven

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.460 
about right I wouldn't Betemit at seven
to<00:03:38.860> five<00:03:39.070> right<00:03:39.550> uh<00:03:39.810> but<00:03:40.810> i<00:03:40.870> think<00:03:41.290> that's

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
to five right uh but i think that's

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.320 
to five right uh but i think that's
about<00:03:41.560> what<00:03:41.890> he<00:03:41.980> should<00:03:42.160> be<00:03:42.250> for<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:42.490> race<00:03:42.700> you

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
about what he should be for the race you

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.760 
about what he should be for the race you
know<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.690> lot<00:03:43.840> of<00:03:44.050> these<00:03:44.200> other<00:03:44.410> things<00:03:44.650> are

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
know a lot of these other things are

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.520 
know a lot of these other things are
going<00:03:44.830> to<00:03:45.070> have<00:03:45.220> to<00:03:46.020> repent<00:03:47.020> significantly

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
going to have to repent significantly

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.210 
going to have to repent significantly
off<00:03:47.710> the<00:03:48.010> Derby<00:03:48.460> um<00:03:48.840> it<00:03:49.840> often<00:03:50.440> Derby<00:03:50.920> efforts

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
off the Derby um it often Derby efforts

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.490 
off the Derby um it often Derby efforts
not<00:03:51.340> necessarily<00:03:51.910> off<00:03:52.060> of<00:03:52.240> past<00:03:52.540> efforts<00:03:52.840> but

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
not necessarily off of past efforts but

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.870 
not necessarily off of past efforts but
i<00:03:53.560> think<00:03:53.770> that<00:03:53.890> the<00:03:54.130> you<00:03:54.460> know<00:03:54.550> few<00:03:54.760> these

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
i think that the you know few these

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.920 
i think that the you know few these
things<00:03:55.030> are<00:03:55.120> gonna<00:03:55.210> have<00:03:55.360> to<00:03:55.450> really<00:03:55.660> take

things are gonna have to really take

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.030 
things are gonna have to really take
your<00:03:56.050> step<00:03:56.260> forward<00:03:56.560> off<00:03:56.680> their<00:03:56.860> Derby

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
your step forward off their Derby

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.640 
your step forward off their Derby
efforts<00:03:57.430> to<00:03:57.610> she<00:03:58.540> can<00:03:58.690> be<00:03:58.810> with<00:03:58.990> him<00:03:59.140> alright

excitement<00:04:15.810> racing<00:04:16.810> down<00:04:16.930> in<00:04:17.080> Louisiana<00:04:17.140> or

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
excitement racing down in Louisiana or

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.039 
excitement racing down in Louisiana or
earlier<00:04:18.370> this<00:04:18.520> year<00:04:18.580> here<00:04:19.150> um<00:04:19.330> he's<00:04:19.840> coming

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
earlier this year here um he's coming

off an impressive win in the in the
Illinois<00:04:22.090> Derby<00:04:22.630> I<00:04:23.100> think<00:04:24.100> he's<00:04:24.190> shorter<00:04:24.550> than

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
Illinois Derby I think he's shorter than

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.050 
Illinois Derby I think he's shorter than
he<00:04:24.760> should<00:04:24.820> be<00:04:25.090> because<00:04:25.240> he's<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:25.660> new<00:04:25.900> phase

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
he should be because he's the new phase

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.140 
he should be because he's the new phase
or<00:04:28.060> just<00:04:28.510> be<00:04:28.780> itsmyluckyday<00:04:29.320> in<00:04:30.030> you<00:04:31.030> know

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
or just be itsmyluckyday in you know

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.970 
or just be itsmyluckyday in you know
about<00:04:31.360> six<00:04:31.660> of<00:04:31.780> these<00:04:31.870> other<00:04:32.050> things<00:04:32.320> and<00:04:32.530> so

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
about six of these other things and so

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.310 
about six of these other things and so
because<00:04:33.310> he's<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:33.640> new<00:04:33.730> face<00:04:34.000> he<00:04:34.260> kind<00:04:35.260> of

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
because he's the new face he kind of

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.380 
because he's the new face he kind of
generates<00:04:35.950> excitement<00:04:36.430> I<00:04:36.610> think<00:04:37.270> he's<00:04:37.360> a

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
generates excitement I think he's a

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.720 
generates excitement I think he's a
horse<00:04:37.630> with<00:04:37.780> a<00:04:37.840> lot<00:04:37.990> of<00:04:38.110> potential<00:04:38.410> but<00:04:39.250> in

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
horse with a lot of potential but in

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.360 
horse with a lot of potential but in
terms<00:04:39.910> of<00:04:40.060> being<00:04:40.420> a<00:04:40.540> second<00:04:40.930> choice<00:04:41.110> I<00:04:41.620> think

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
terms of being a second choice I think

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.680 
terms of being a second choice I think
that's<00:04:42.520> probably<00:04:42.730> I<00:04:43.240> think<00:04:43.390> he<00:04:43.540> probably

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
that's probably I think he probably

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.510 
that's probably I think he probably
fourth<00:04:44.440> or<00:04:44.620> fifth<00:04:44.800> choice<00:04:44.980> I<00:04:45.190> think<00:04:45.340> would<00:04:45.400> be

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
fourth or fifth choice I think would be

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.220 
fourth or fifth choice I think would be
about<00:04:45.670> right<00:04:45.730> flora<00:04:46.150> all<00:04:46.600> right<00:04:46.780> and<00:04:46.930> then<00:04:47.050> the

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
about right flora all right and then the

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.710 
about right flora all right and then the
the<00:04:47.470> third<00:04:47.890> choice<00:04:48.160> that<00:04:48.340> I'm<00:04:48.430> seeing<00:04:48.730> is<00:04:49.270> is

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
the third choice that I'm seeing is is

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.980 
the third choice that I'm seeing is is
goldencents<00:04:50.380> 621<00:04:51.100> 721<00:04:51.820> around<00:04:52.480> there<00:04:52.750> and

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
goldencents 621 721 around there and

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.990 
goldencents 621 721 around there and
maybe<00:04:53.440> golden<00:04:53.860> Santino<00:04:54.280> obviously<00:04:54.700> finished

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
maybe golden Santino obviously finished

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.460 
maybe golden Santino obviously finished
terribly<00:04:55.360> in<00:04:55.570> the<00:04:55.900> Derby<00:04:56.140> i<00:04:56.200> think<00:04:56.350> it<00:04:56.410> was

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
terribly in the Derby i think it was

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.220 
terribly in the Derby i think it was
17th<00:04:57.010> but<00:04:57.250> maybe<00:04:57.820> goldencents<00:04:58.390> was<00:04:58.870> a<00:04:58.900> horse

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
17th but maybe goldencents was a horse

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.770 
17th but maybe goldencents was a horse
that<00:04:59.410> was<00:04:59.850> significantly<00:05:00.850> harmed<00:05:01.540> by<00:05:01.720> the

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
that was significantly harmed by the

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.380 
that was significantly harmed by the
off-track<00:05:02.290> I<00:05:02.880> think<00:05:03.880> he<00:05:03.940> was<00:05:04.090> you<00:05:04.270> know<00:05:04.330> I

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
off-track I think he was you know I

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.700 
off-track I think he was you know I
judge<00:05:04.630> miss<00:05:04.840> connections<00:05:05.230> going<00:05:05.470> into<00:05:05.620> the

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
judge miss connections going into the

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.160 
judge miss connections going into the
race<00:05:05.830> and<00:05:05.980> they<00:05:06.070> were<00:05:06.360> Dennis<00:05:07.360> O'Neil<00:05:07.660> who<00:05:08.020> is

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.170 
race and they were Dennis O'Neil who is

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.410 
race and they were Dennis O'Neil who is
the<00:05:08.530> brother<00:05:08.680> doug<00:05:09.100> o'neill<00:05:09.250> and<00:05:09.880> who<00:05:10.150> bought

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
the brother doug o'neill and who bought

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.510 
the brother doug o'neill and who bought
the<00:05:10.600> horse<00:05:10.720> as<00:05:11.260> a<00:05:11.290> two-year-old<00:05:11.680> and<00:05:12.100> said<00:05:12.430> he

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
the horse as a two-year-old and said he

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.920 
the horse as a two-year-old and said he
was<00:05:12.580> doing<00:05:12.790> a<00:05:12.850> rain<00:05:13.000> dance<00:05:13.030> and<00:05:13.570> really<00:05:13.750> hoping

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
was doing a rain dance and really hoping

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.120 
was doing a rain dance and really hoping
for<00:05:14.140> an<00:05:14.230> off-track<00:05:14.500> and<00:05:14.770> i<00:05:14.800> think<00:05:14.980> i<00:05:15.100> think

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
for an off-track and i think i think

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.440 
for an off-track and i think i think
they<00:05:15.520> thought<00:05:15.760> he<00:05:15.910> was<00:05:16.000> going<00:05:16.180> to<00:05:16.240> move

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
they thought he was going to move

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.080 
they thought he was going to move
forward<00:05:16.660> off<00:05:16.990> it<00:05:17.170> um<00:05:17.350> and<00:05:18.220> obviously<00:05:19.000> he

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
forward off it um and obviously he

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.330 
forward off it um and obviously he
didn't<00:05:19.390> I<00:05:19.540> you<00:05:19.780> know<00:05:19.840> he<00:05:19.960> was<00:05:20.020> close<00:05:20.290> to<00:05:20.320> a<00:05:20.500> fast

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
didn't I you know he was close to a fast

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.490 
didn't I you know he was close to a fast
pace<00:05:21.580> and<00:05:21.880> never<00:05:22.780> really<00:05:23.170> looked<00:05:23.290> that

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
pace and never really looked that

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.010 
pace and never really looked that
comfortable<00:05:24.010> on<00:05:24.130> the<00:05:24.220> track<00:05:24.460> and<00:05:24.640> so<00:05:25.360> even

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
comfortable on the track and so even

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.090 
comfortable on the track and so even
though<00:05:26.110> they<00:05:26.230> thought<00:05:26.770> he<00:05:26.860> was<00:05:26.950> going<00:05:27.040> to

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
though they thought he was going to

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.640 
though they thought he was going to
handle<00:05:27.340> it<00:05:27.600> you<00:05:28.600> know<00:05:28.630> understandably<00:05:29.440> he

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
handle it you know understandably he

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.200 
handle it you know understandably he
didn't<00:05:29.980> and<00:05:30.160> I<00:05:30.190> think<00:05:30.430> he<00:05:30.520> was<00:05:30.670> legitimately

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
didn't and I think he was legitimately

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.110 
didn't and I think he was legitimately
one<00:05:31.420> of<00:05:31.510> those<00:05:31.600> horses<00:05:32.020> that<00:05:32.640> that<00:05:33.640> after<00:05:33.880> six

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
one of those horses that that after six

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.820 
one of those horses that that after six
furlongs<00:05:34.540> or<00:05:34.810> a<00:05:34.960> little<00:05:35.350> bit<00:05:35.440> longer<00:05:35.560> than

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
furlongs or a little bit longer than

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.590 
furlongs or a little bit longer than
that<00:05:35.920> which<00:05:36.190> had<00:05:36.670> had<00:05:36.850> enough<00:05:36.970> of<00:05:37.240> it<00:05:37.420> and<00:05:37.510> just

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
that which had had enough of it and just

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.140 
that which had had enough of it and just
backed<00:05:37.870> up<00:05:38.080> so<00:05:38.590> he's<00:05:39.160> one<00:05:39.370> of<00:05:39.460> two<00:05:39.610> horses<00:05:39.910> in

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
backed up so he's one of two horses in

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.570 
backed up so he's one of two horses in
the<00:05:40.210> race<00:05:40.240> that<00:05:40.510> I<00:05:40.600> think<00:05:40.810> it<00:05:40.900> really<00:05:41.580> excuse

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
the race that I think it really excuse

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.670 
the race that I think it really excuse
me<00:05:42.700> it<00:05:42.820> really<00:05:43.000> improved<00:05:43.420> you<00:05:44.230> know<00:05:44.350> from<00:05:44.530> the

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
me it really improved you know from the

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.080 
me it really improved you know from the
Derby<00:05:44.950> into<00:05:45.130> this<00:05:45.250> race<00:05:45.460> especially<00:05:45.730> if<00:05:46.030> he

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
Derby into this race especially if he

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.110 
Derby into this race especially if he
catches<00:05:46.270> a<00:05:46.450> dry<00:05:46.720> track<00:05:47.050> and<00:05:47.320> I<00:05:47.940> expected<00:05:48.940> much

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
catches a dry track and I expected much

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.880 
catches a dry track and I expected much
better<00:05:49.330> performance<00:05:49.510> by<00:05:49.900> him<00:05:50.050> is<00:05:50.200> done<00:05:50.350> okay

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:50.890 
better performance by him is done okay

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.040 
better performance by him is done okay
to<00:05:50.950> sum<00:05:51.250> up<00:05:51.280> of<00:05:51.640> the<00:05:52.000> three<00:05:52.210> top<00:05:52.390> choices<00:05:52.690> right

those three choices which do you think

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.430 
those three choices which do you think
is<00:06:01.150> the<00:06:01.240> most<00:06:01.270> overvalued<00:06:01.780> which<00:06:02.260> do<00:06:02.380> you

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
is the most overvalued which do you

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.700 
is the most overvalued which do you
think<00:06:02.500> is<00:06:02.680> the<00:06:02.710> most<00:06:02.890> undervalued<00:06:04.620> you<00:06:05.620> know

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
think is the most undervalued you know

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.590 
think is the most undervalued you know
goldencents<00:06:06.160> at<00:06:06.370> 71<00:06:06.820> is<00:06:06.970> probably<00:06:07.270> the<00:06:07.420> most

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 
goldencents at 71 is probably the most

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.080 
goldencents at 71 is probably the most
or<00:06:07.960> undervalued<00:06:08.380> III<00:06:09.310> think<00:06:09.700> he's<00:06:09.880> a<00:06:09.910> horse

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
or undervalued III think he's a horse

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.880 
or undervalued III think he's a horse
that<00:06:10.240> can<00:06:10.390> move<00:06:10.510> forward<00:06:10.720> I'm<00:06:11.170> not<00:06:11.440> I<00:06:11.650> don't

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:11.890 
that can move forward I'm not I don't

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.380 
that can move forward I'm not I don't
love<00:06:12.100> him<00:06:12.280> I<00:06:12.430> don't<00:06:12.760> you<00:06:12.910> know<00:06:12.970> don't<00:06:13.060> want<00:06:13.330> to

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390 
love him I don't you know don't want to

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:14.610 
love him I don't you know don't want to
like<00:06:13.540> give<00:06:13.930> my<00:06:14.050> wholehearted<00:06:14.230> endorsement

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
like give my wholehearted endorsement

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.860 
like give my wholehearted endorsement
but<00:06:15.370> I<00:06:15.430> think<00:06:15.670> it<00:06:15.760> at<00:06:15.970> those<00:06:16.150> odds<00:06:16.450> he's<00:06:16.720> the

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
but I think it at those odds he's the

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.000 
but I think it at those odds he's the
one<00:06:17.020> that<00:06:17.110> makes<00:06:17.260> sense<00:06:17.410> to<00:06:17.650> take<00:06:17.770> a<00:06:17.860> chance

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
one that makes sense to take a chance

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.220
