looking in the mirror and i felt good

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.190 
looking in the mirror and i felt good
being<00:01:39.119> there<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:40.159> um<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.270> would<00:01:43.079> like

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
being there and um so I would like

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.969 
being there and um so I would like
setting<00:01:44.540> yet<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.689> think<00:01:45.930> big<00:01:46.290> but<00:01:46.740> she<00:01:46.829> has<00:01:46.860> to

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
setting yet to think big but she has to

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.789 
setting yet to think big but she has to
set<00:01:47.280> realistic<00:01:47.939> smaller<00:01:48.570> goals<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.500> think

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
set realistic smaller goals and I think

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.340 
set realistic smaller goals and I think
that<00:01:50.180> when<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.270> do<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.659> you're<00:01:52.049> more

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
that when you do that you're more

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.359 
that when you do that you're more
successful<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:54.860> if<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.950> can<00:01:56.070> have<00:01:56.159> more<00:01:56.310> fun

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770
