three kilos lock it back up and you just
plug<00:01:58.420> it<00:01:58.570> back<00:01:58.600> in<00:01:59.009> the<00:02:00.009> batteries<00:02:00.369> can<00:02:00.549> be

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
plug it back in the batteries can be

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.230 
plug it back in the batteries can be
charged<00:02:01.030> on<00:02:01.180> or<00:02:01.539> off<00:02:01.899> the<00:02:02.110> trike<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.939> they

going to the shops or something and and
you<00:02:08.920> lock<00:02:09.130> your<00:02:09.280> trike<00:02:09.610> up<00:02:09.880> then<00:02:10.690> nobody<00:02:11.350> can

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
you lock your trike up then nobody can

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.619 
you lock your trike up then nobody can
just<00:02:11.740> steal<00:02:11.980> your<00:02:12.130> battery<00:02:12.550> so<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:16.300> battery

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
just steal your battery so the battery

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.920 
just steal your battery so the battery
bike<00:02:16.810> trike<00:02:17.200> 20<00:02:17.739> has<00:02:18.190> got<00:02:18.400> a<00:02:18.430> unique<00:02:18.930> pivot

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
bike trike 20 has got a unique pivot

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.089 
bike trike 20 has got a unique pivot
system<00:02:20.500> so

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
system so

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.979 
system so
if<00:02:21.280> my<00:02:21.640> colleague<00:02:21.969> just<00:02:22.120> pushes<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.659> bike<00:02:22.810> at

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
if my colleague just pushes the bike at

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.800 
if my colleague just pushes the bike at
the<00:02:23.019> moment<00:02:23.439> it's<00:02:23.590> rigid<00:02:23.859> so<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:25.239> trike<00:02:25.569> is

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
the moment it's rigid so the trike is

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.770 
the moment it's rigid so the trike is
rigid<00:02:26.319> so<00:02:26.499> as<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:26.650> can<00:02:26.799> see<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:27.549> then<00:02:27.909> if<00:02:28.150> you

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
rigid so as you can see and then if you

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.470 
rigid so as you can see and then if you
just<00:02:29.400> flip<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.459> switch<00:02:30.579> on<00:02:30.969> the<00:02:31.030> handlebars

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
just flip the switch on the handlebars

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.979 
just flip the switch on the handlebars
it<00:02:32.290> now<00:02:32.530> pivots<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.670> you<00:02:33.939> can<00:02:34.150> ride<00:02:34.389> it<00:02:34.569> almost

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
it now pivots and you can ride it almost

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.379 
it now pivots and you can ride it almost
like<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.230> regular<00:02:35.499> bike<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.670> that's<00:02:36.819> the<00:02:36.969> one

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:37.389 
like a regular bike and that's the one

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:39.089 
like a regular bike and that's the one
of<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.540> attractions<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.409> this<00:02:38.769> particular

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
of the attractions of this particular

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.069 
of the attractions of this particular
trike<00:02:39.519> it's<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:39.909> only<00:02:40.030> trike<00:02:40.299> on<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.599> market

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
trike it's the only trike on the market
