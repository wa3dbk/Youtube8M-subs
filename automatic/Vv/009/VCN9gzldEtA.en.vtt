00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:08.240
 another thing that has changed my life has 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.190
 been internet when I have a doubt what 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.000
 I searched the internet when I go shopping 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.910
 something either the camera a lens the light a 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.140
 microphone a guitar a brush 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:24.050
 teeth a computer all everything I look at the 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.580
 I read the blogs I listen to the 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.400
 opinions of people who have already 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.160
 purchased watch the videos on YouTube from 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.890
 a boxing that is when they open and explain 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.990
 I'm nurturing all that information and 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.270
 when I go to buy he came with an idea 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.980
 clear of what I want but internet is 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.100
 also a double-edged sword that's why it's 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.080
 it is very important to know how to look if 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.940
 I will see the review of a product 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.130
 like to see the reviews of those 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.140
 people that I already have confidence in their 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.060
 opinion this is very important not 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.650
 Pay attention to anyone 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.080
 put a camera in front of you to tell you things 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.210
 including me for example in these 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.070
 days I saw a girl who recommended them 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.430
 to his followers that to go to the beach 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.659
 and lucy legs with little cellulite that 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.030
 they saw firmer 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.369
 and more toned that they will throw the house 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.969
 lacquer to go to sunbathe is 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.619
 a colossal mistake another thing that changed me 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:19.369
 life and that I already shared it with you 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:21.619
 it's having learned to read the 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.539
 ingredients in the cream that information 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.159
 we should have it all because it is not 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.200
 only for a matter of beauty but 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.030
 even for a question especially of 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.619
 health and I have done the videÃ­to 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.329
 dedicated the ingredients in the creams 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.280
 that if you have not seen it check in my 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.049
 youtube channel that you find it and already 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.509
 when you learn to interpret 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.110
 ingredients in the creams you'll see that you 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.509
 alone or you alone will happen to use and 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.700
 prefer natural oils I have already 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:50.149
 videos dedicated also to oils 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.340
 but well I'm going to show you what 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.049
 they are really in the top for the body 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.599
 which I prefer is the oil of 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.719
 sweet almonds for the face the one 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:02.899
 I prefer is rosehip oil and 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:05.000
 he alternated it with shea butter other 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.600
 important discovery are the 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.520
 bitch training programs 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.870
 look on the internet for their pages 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.330
 for you to see they have a 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.340
 number of exercise programs for 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.250
 others in my opinion are the programs 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.500
 more complete that exist because not only 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.050
 it's jumping and running as I say 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.080
 combine what you should eat to your diet 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.760
 have lunch and eat daily 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.830
 the exercises are varied every day 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.260
 you make a different program therefore 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.420
 it's not boring they mix the exercises 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.140
 aerobics to the aerobic ghana does 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.390
 yoga you do stretching you train all the 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.550
 muscles all muscle groups yo 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.800
 I think there is work to extend water all 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.160
 the foot and the best thing they have is that they are 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.050
 exercises designed to do in the 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.820
 box is to say that if you do not want to go to 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.830
 gym because you do not have money to 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.290
 pay you what or because you do not like it because 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.810
 you do not have time these programs are 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.920
 perfect that I did the turbo fire that 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.870
 I loved the bad lift that is also a 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.410
 super program especially for 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.260
 work the glutes after 90 x that 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.040
 It is more for men and the other me 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.030
 would like to do is insanity but 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.900
 If you have to be well trained because 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.090
 that is death another discovery 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.060
 this is more for the girls are the 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.849
 nate treatments I had nails 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.890
 very dehydrated delicate I was 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:35.849
 they broke easily but not only that 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.890
 they broke, they opened, they left me 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.200
 action like a hairline and then they went 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.799
 opening, opening, opening, and that hurts 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.260
 this saved me in fact it's over and 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.909
 now I bought the new version good no 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.650
 is that it still exists but this 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:51.810
 let's say it's a new product I can 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.359
 to take out a work called citra is 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.459
 always the same brand neiss but this 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.560
 I like it more because among the 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.659
 ingredients does not have the formal one of which 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.900
 if they are going to see sale of each 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:06.870
 ingredient and they will not know that the 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:11.100
 formal day is better to avoid it and as 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:14.280
 topco to nothing in the world 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:17.310
 I know you saw his name, this is the version 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.440
 chiquitica because I bought it on ebay and not 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.570
 I read the ml and what came to my house 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.180
 I was trying to save this beautiful 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.000
 little but good when I run out 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.890
 I buy the full size that also lasts 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.990
 very much because to me the full size 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.240
 it lasted like a year out there does not dry nor 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.730
 nothing is the maximum 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.220
 this other discovery that changed me 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.370
 life and this is the one that changes it 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.370
 quite 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.940
 your secret is a book but what I saw 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.920
 it was the documentary and I recommend them 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.990
 vividly that they look for it here in 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.700
 youtube there are videos about this credit and 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.110
 the full documentary because I also 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.120
 can find on the internet what 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.540
 you have to search but first thing 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:03.030
 I'm going to tell you everything is to open your 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:06.510
 mind especially for those people 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.820
 who have studied that they are unbelievers 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:12.450
 because normally what they teach us in 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:15.870
 the school is marx engels at least 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:18.630
 in Cuban in dialectical materialism and 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.810
 one like he does not believe much in what is 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:25.230
 the fantasy the visualization that is of 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:28.080
 what the secret of idealizing and 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:31.560
 visualize what you want and they 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.320
 they say that the universe conspires in you 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:38.070
 please so that all that you want is 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.110
 make reality towards first crashes 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.380
 because you say all that I do 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.870
 I want to have and achieve with imagining it 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:49.650
 I want a yacht and I can imagine inside 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:52.380
 of the yacht walking the wind waters my 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:55.710
 hair and I'm burning, let me throw myself 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.110
 sunscreen the right mood 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.390
 to receive that valuable message that 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:04.200
 has secretly is to open the mind 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:07.290
 remove all prejudices and leave 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.680
 that enters within you is to have faith is 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:13.020
 How to believe in God, not because you do not 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.150
 give tangible proof that he exists 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.490
 because it does not come before you and you 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.350
 say I am god does not mean that I do not 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.630
 insist so the secret is more or 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:24.690
 less the same is to have faith is to believe in 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:27.930
 that message that is being given to receive it 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:29.880
 in your life and practice practicing it is 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:34.520
 very important but enthusiastically 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.520
 and credulously
