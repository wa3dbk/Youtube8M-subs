so<00:00:01.319> Paul<00:00:01.560> you<00:00:01.740> think<00:00:01.979> we'll<00:00:02.159> be<00:00:02.399> able<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.850> plug

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
so Paul you think we'll be able to plug

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.079 
so Paul you think we'll be able to plug
our<00:00:03.389> cars<00:00:03.689> in<00:00:03.929> how<00:00:04.500> you<00:00:04.560> doing<00:00:04.890> it<00:00:05.009> yes<00:00:05.190> well<00:00:05.850> we

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
our cars in how you doing it yes well we

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.720 
our cars in how you doing it yes well we
take<00:00:06.270> regular<00:00:06.990> prius<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:07.710> we<00:00:08.099> had<00:00:08.309> extra

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
take regular prius and we had extra

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.580 
take regular prius and we had extra
batteries<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.240> charging<00:00:09.960> system<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.410> software

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
batteries a charging system and software

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.190 
batteries a charging system and software
so<00:00:11.550> that<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.940> car<00:00:12.179> becomes<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.840> plug-in<00:00:13.080> hybrid

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
so that the car becomes a plug-in hybrid

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.589 
so that the car becomes a plug-in hybrid
but<00:00:13.740> we<00:00:13.830> don't<00:00:14.009> take<00:00:14.130> anything<00:00:14.400> away<00:00:14.639> so<00:00:14.849> it's

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
but we don't take anything away so it's

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.150 
but we don't take anything away so it's
still<00:00:15.780> one<00:00:15.929> hundred<00:00:16.170> percent<00:00:16.199> regular<00:00:16.920> prius

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
still one hundred percent regular prius

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.840 
still one hundred percent regular prius
that<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.760> can<00:00:17.940> run<00:00:18.090> off<00:00:18.300> of<00:00:18.330> plug-in<00:00:19.260> power

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
that you can run off of plug-in power

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.769 
that you can run off of plug-in power
and<00:00:20.850> then<00:00:21.029> you've<00:00:21.180> got<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.359> couple<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.720> the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
and then you've got a couple of the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.300 
and then you've got a couple of the
batteries<00:00:22.199> here<00:00:22.380> what's<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.010> difference

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
batteries here what's the difference

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.529 
batteries here what's the difference
between<00:00:23.369> these<00:00:23.760> batteries<00:00:24.119> here<00:00:24.390> we're

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
between these batteries here we're

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.750 
between these batteries here we're
showing<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:25.019> different<00:00:25.410> in<00:00:25.590> chemistry's<00:00:26.490> a

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
showing the different in chemistry's a

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.359 
showing the different in chemistry's a
lead<00:00:27.390> acid<00:00:27.810> battery<00:00:28.140> which<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.740> traditional

lead acid battery which is a traditional
automotive<00:00:30.330> batteries<00:00:30.599> very<00:00:30.840> heavy<00:00:31.109> quite

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
automotive batteries very heavy quite

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.250 
automotive batteries very heavy quite
hard<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.250> lift<00:00:32.540> where<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.809> lithium<00:00:34.140> iron

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
hard to lift where the lithium iron

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.290 
hard to lift where the lithium iron
phosphate<00:00:34.530> which<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> newer<00:00:35.489> technology

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
phosphate which is the newer technology

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.780 
phosphate which is the newer technology
is<00:00:36.420> much<00:00:36.630> lighter<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.350> much<00:00:38.040> more<00:00:38.309> suitable

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
is much lighter and much more suitable

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.340 
is much lighter and much more suitable
for<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> vehicle<00:00:39.300> application<00:00:40.910> so<00:00:41.910> you've<00:00:42.090> got

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
for a vehicle application so you've got

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.950 
for a vehicle application so you've got
more<00:00:43.350> usable<00:00:44.010> energy<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.420> lithium<00:00:45.809> iron

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
more usable energy in the lithium iron

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.360 
more usable energy in the lithium iron
phosphate<00:00:46.230> than<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.770> do<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.070> lettuce

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
phosphate than you do in the lettuce

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.549 
phosphate than you do in the lettuce
correct<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:48.030> will<00:00:48.239> propel<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.719> car<00:00:48.930> quite<00:00:49.530> a

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
correct this will propel the car quite a

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.490 
correct this will propel the car quite a
bit<00:00:49.739> further<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.910> lighter<00:00:51.300> weight<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.989> it

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
bit further it's lighter weight and it

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.229 
bit further it's lighter weight and it
has<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> much<00:00:52.829> longer<00:00:53.070> life<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.699> lead<00:00:53.879> acid

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
has a much longer life the lead acid

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.360 
has a much longer life the lead acid
might<00:00:54.390> last<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.809> couple<00:00:54.960> years<00:00:55.350> let's<00:00:56.010> give<00:00:56.190> the

power combines the two electric motors
in<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.040> gases<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.869> part<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
in the gases and this is part of the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.139 
in the gases and this is part of the
electric<00:01:10.649> motor<00:01:10.860> one<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.580> two<00:01:11.759> electric

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
electric motor one of the two electric

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:14.990 
electric motor one of the two electric
motors<00:01:12.180> that's<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> prius<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.759> then<00:01:14.759> can

motors that's in the prius and then can

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:28.930 
motors that's in the prius and then can
we<00:01:15.090> take<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> look<00:01:15.479> at<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:16.140> inside<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.799> car

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.620 

I<00:01:28.970> think<00:01:29.300> it<00:01:29.390> so<00:01:29.570> this<00:01:29.690> is<00:01:29.870> the<00:01:30.020> back<00:01:30.560> of<00:01:31.630> this

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
I think it so this is the back of this

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.950 
I think it so this is the back of this
is<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:32.990> mother<00:01:33.230> having<00:01:33.620> Mario<00:01:33.950> side<00:01:34.220> 30<00:01:34.670> 7<00:01:35.600> 3's

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
is the mother having Mario side 30 7 3's

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.140 
is the mother having Mario side 30 7 3's
we<00:01:36.260> can<00:01:36.440> upgrade<00:01:36.620> anything<00:01:37.340> from<00:01:37.520> old<00:01:37.790> foreign

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
we can upgrade anything from old foreign

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.650 
we can upgrade anything from old foreign
up<00:01:38.330> and<00:01:39.230> we<00:01:39.590> use<00:01:39.770> a<00:01:39.910> formerly<00:01:40.910> hidden<00:01:41.360> storage

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
up and we use a formerly hidden storage

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.380 
up and we use a formerly hidden storage
area<00:01:42.170> to<00:01:42.950> put<00:01:43.130> in<00:01:43.250> a<00:01:43.340> battery<00:01:43.730> box<00:01:43.970> we<00:01:44.240> had<00:01:44.360> a
