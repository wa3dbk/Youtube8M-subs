a very own type of crunch which is

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.370 
a very own type of crunch which is
different<00:02:53.490> from<00:02:53.580> like<00:02:53.820> a<00:02:53.850> fender<00:02:54.180> or<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.780> Gibson

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
and it cuts through very nicely without

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.789 
and it cuts through very nicely without

being shrill or harming the air so and

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.339 
being shrill or harming the air so and
since<00:03:08.609> the<00:03:08.849> design<00:03:09.239> of<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.569> guitarist<00:03:10.049> is<00:03:10.170> so

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
since the design of the guitarist is so

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.770 
since the design of the guitarist is so
unique<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.129> this<00:03:11.280> is<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:12.000> know<00:03:12.120> this<00:03:12.420> is<00:03:12.750> a

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
unique and this is you know this is a
