00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 the super crazy experience of the 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.080
 surgery and the injury of richter debate 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.120
 robur of germany 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.800
 he will attach himself to a train using a 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.660
 special suction cup 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.750
 the last thing he hoped he would 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.490
 make that lock on the back of the train 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.810
 Ladies and gentlemen this is that is 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.810
 surfer rail 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.390
 it's a high-speed train that's 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.820
 very dangerous if the face is and will be 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.530
 God is more fortunately Alexandre lived 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.780
 to tell you then we went to germany 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.540
 ask him what his inspiration was 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.379
 I had talked to a lot of people about it and 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.690
 all said that it was impossible for 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.129
 modern trains are not 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.500
 made for surfing 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:55.309
 so I got the idea of the suction cup made 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.890
 to transport glass to understand it are not 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.260
 for this purpose. 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.270
 so he did not fall off this train 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:07.670
 which reaches 330 kilometers per hour 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:10.070
 it's just big suckers what he 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.890
 do is touch the suction cup and then 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.770
 pressing and when he presses it 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.160
 removes the air from within the showy and creates 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.100
 14 when sucking the vacuum there is less 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.350
 pressure and the weight of the entire 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.210
 pressure on the disc and do you think 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.250
 atmosphere will pull because of the 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.640
 wind resistance but what happens 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.130
 This is where the atmosphere holds you there. 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.430
 the cable has to win some things 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.610
 loves the weight of the body the second is the strength 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.890
 time has produced acceleration since the 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.530
 the air pressure the weight of the air in the suction cup 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.380
 is greater than his will be 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.509
 well if the suction cup is securely attached 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.759
 the video of alexander surfing on the train 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.409
 made success on the internet with more than 6 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.939
 millions of views 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.119
 but how close he got to a 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.340
 huge disaster like any other 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:06.430
 radical sport there is a chance 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.430
 You die, but it's worth it. 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.970
 this room has more than 30 thousand mirrors 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.060
 and this is our next to throw the zouk 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.800
 It's fabel with nothing but a pair of gloves 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.800
 Let's see what gives this 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:39.319
 there are those who are in the popular consciousness 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:40.939
 to fight with the car gives a 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:46.790
 time and I think he did not know the 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:49.099
 that happen I hope biologists 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.340
 have a good explanation for this 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:54.680
 effect because I found it horrible df and 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:59.780
 how pop bedroom defended against the 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:02.000
 Australian pimped cacti are 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.980
 modified leaves if you think of a leaf 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.340
 normal it has a surface area 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.220
 too much chance of evaporating water 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.400
 The leaf of the cactus is the opposite of that. 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.349
 Very sharp and very sharp does not 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.629
 escape ball and of course this is the 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.379
 in the desert where there is a lot of 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.450
 little water 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.819
 The other advantage of thorns is to protect 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.010
 the cactus of some animals that want to 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.900
 food or until you have access to the 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.870
 liquid trapped within it 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.389
 but these teens do not want the water 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.859
 of cato want glory on the internet and 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:39.410
 there is no glory if there is no suffering 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:42.079
 the thorns are punished they hurt 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.810
 worse than a needle are like faquinhas 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.120
 and not only that but it may have some 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.840
 inflammation or an infection because the 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.730
 fungi that cover the mirrors 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.989
 this is a real experience 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.989
 super crazy
