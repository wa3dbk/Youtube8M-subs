 Point is one I are two or did not grasp quite an interval of three years 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.380
 It is 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.470
 It is the one who can not beat easily though I know it with my head 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.470
 High 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:47.600
 It is a person of feeling shuffle becomes gradually 8 ordinary Tsuttsu tool 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.600
 For another one is 8 speed is I speed You do not know quite easily 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.079
 Speed ​​is likely to increase if you are moving, but you can not move your arm smoothly 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.530
 hardness 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.530
 It is 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:09.140
 8 r 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:12.610
 Not only hard to be tired and I feel like become such wind 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.610
 Line at hair tips 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.420
 If I do it, I can not easily understand the volume or the tone is high 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.960
 I wonder if I am walking 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.380
 I can use it for a while 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.950
 As it is the house, it is quite tired and I have no idea 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.820
 I can not speed up 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.440
 That kind of feeling 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:41.590
 It is the two that is so this time quite often Nee 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:46.930
 Because there is one practice menu to solve the problem 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:50.470
 But let's do it together and I would like to introduce you right away 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.150
 First of all , it seems like the first one 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:58.540
 As a preparatory stage 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:00.570

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.870
 Down 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.120
 Repeat all the way this triple unit 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.020
 You have 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.799
 Had 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.799
 I am 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:24.550
 Tei directly below 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.300
 Please practice to be down up and down up at first it's great slow 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.330
 Because it is good 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.290
 For example, Tenpo eightfold 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.290
 I wonder 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.799

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.270
 Try a little practice in Tappusoro notation because it little thought that Na can I put 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.170
 Please give me 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:33.300
 Argent naturally I can say as much as possible, but at first I tap a little 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:39.110
 You can do it today with a stroke , so try it 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.110

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.560
 Ah ah ah 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.610
 Since the open place of accent comes with an accent , cut it with recognition 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.100
 Please try it 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.100
 Percent is the form that comes to just beat my head 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:03.159

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:06.579

 Celebrate the 3rd year and the stroke is overwintering 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:17.400
 The first is down minute 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:20.350
 In app stroke tab tab solo 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.650
 It is this repetition that entered 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.160
 Started from the right 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:30.540
 Will be told 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:34.020
 This is because this time the director receives an accent on his head 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:37.960
 Etc. to do with alternate that alternate right left and right left 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:41.430
 The say right right and left right left and right went a little while ago 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.639
 It may be one measure or two measures 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:49.979
 Even at each place until stable 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:54.990

 When the I do not know so much accent is to Toka or did not know so much 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:49.610
 When I try to put out the accent strongly, I will let the 8 type a little bit more power 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:51.330
 To practice rather than put the accent in in I feel it 's the tiny Noh line portion 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.020
