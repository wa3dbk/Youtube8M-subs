00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.000
 handhelds welcome to another 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.430
 follow from our tutorial series charts 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.520
 read but right today we look at each other 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.020
 let's take a closer look at the transition chart 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.590
 a transition is think i know that 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.870
 most 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.320
 this is an approach procedure to the ils 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:34.690
 where you once in the course of a 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.789
 track in the thumb and one man 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.660
 then in a 180 degree turn on the ile 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:39.550
 it is directed 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.949
 we are still looking at each other as I said 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.350
 We have some info on the head 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:47.589
 already proud in the other batch 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.329
 explains down there as well 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.210
 the education check summit matic so the 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:57.460
 all information about magnetic 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:59.889
 or normal and / or that the 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.289
 heights all information above sea level 

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:04.059
 be measured 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.450
 We have four flights to Frankfurt 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.729
 points that would be once kerax and 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.580
 Spessart on the right side of the 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:17.010
 chart in the east of frankfurt and once 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:20.230
 the north of frankfurt or in the 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:24.430
 west northwest of frankfurt once 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:27.310
 rohles and a no go in this way can 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.230
 Now you realize what you have to fly 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.940
 if one of the clemens limit kerax and 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.730
 clemens limit spessart arrives 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.230
 child with srk I explain briefly a clear one 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.820
 Limit means that if you look at this 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.410
 point back and you no further 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.780
 get information from a note 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.480
 that as long as a publishing flee 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.070
 Must be on this point until you just one 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.280
 new information 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.409
 we get a new setting for pilots 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.820
 have different rifles in frankfurt 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.320
 we have that by one 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.600
 have parallel operation on the two 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.240
 create a place transition south 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.610
 transition the southern French goes 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.369
 always on the egg leaves the riedhof 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.119
 bled or center and the north turn 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.679
 take on the one leaves the tu fried 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.140
 Say, let's assume we have 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.200
 spessart as an approach puncturer last 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.240
 point in our flight plan and become 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.450
 now for the sake of coincidence and widely clarified 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.750
 the transition dads their alpha 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.630
 deep-city transition means we 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.430
 look here we'll look here 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:33.150
 our spessart and we must see 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:39.910
 north over impact and delta fox 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:41.890
 408 and delta fox 407 on the parallel 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.650
 Course of the train flying 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.430
 that would be course as well as 248 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:52.330
 that has too wide a country course and that 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.730
 all at 4000 feet here we fly now 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.370
 our first 180 degree turn is on 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:02.470
 about delta fox 08 this point here and 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:05.350
 delta fox 409 on this point here in 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.840
 the exchange rate in the download of the 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.890
 running to fight 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.440
 There we fly ours again 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.390
 points off that are delta fox teldafax 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.360
 on the ground in every village at each 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.190
 German airport is delta 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.470
 points of departure speak in dÃ¼sseldorf are 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.200
 would rather apply waypoints here in frankfurt 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.230
 is data fox waypoints and in munich 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.880
 are estate on mic waypoints we have 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.329
 as in frankfurt her delta fox and 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.760
 now fly in 4 miles distance here 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.739
 delta fox point after another from to 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.720
 We arrived at some point up here 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.480
 this corner there begins now 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.560
 screw in the 180 degree turn on the ls 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:47.079
 we have our embarking on this on 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.570
 this line attached to say now 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:52.120
 that means we turn our 180 here 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:57.080
 Grad curve over delta fox 416 and pictures 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:01.160
 fox 426 and turn to 5,000 feet 1 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:04.940
 on the fine the runway freed 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:10.220
 this case is also course 248 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:13.640
 speaks the runway course of the 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.260
 runway course from the right track and 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.049
 otherwise here again the 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.150
 Information given that here is the 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.630
 everything intercepted or interested 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.280
 can 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:28.070
 that would be once dmi 20 2 miles or 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.350
 what would that be 20 twice twice 120 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.460
 twice from the airport here 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.990
 is located 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.570
 yes that was it in the big and big 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.830
 all to the French state should 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.960
 to be said there are two more 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.180
 more approach points is uno control 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.150
 which I already addressed would then 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.650
 coming from the west 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.790
 there you can see one too 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.320
 information cad 2 pdf 315 that's two 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.480
 then you can get other charts there 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.590
 again the approach procedure in the 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.020
 transition from the other two 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.610
 look at points 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.740
 and there you have to note that this 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.680
 completely northern part falls away and one 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:11.240
 directly in the thumb internet shore free 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:13.460
 flies and yes then directly his first 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.669
 curve in siders turns if you now from 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.870
 spessart from a not the north 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.810
 transition but get the 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.330
 Southern French one has thus speak to the 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.340
 you can not bad or center 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.940
 look at this line but must the 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.980
 line to money fox 607 consider that 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:35.660
 you can see papa chf here as well 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:38.360
 so insecure or on the 20 is here 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:41.780
 again marked that goes then 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.790
 also on the ios so on the 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.590
 the same course as the train then makes 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.440
 the first 180 degree bend where then 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:52.130
 another transition from one 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.930
 point with attached makes then here the 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.000
 first 180 degrees turn then the second 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:59.540
 and is also on the 124th 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.070
 two times apart from 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:05.430
 as the call runs or 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:07.920
 center that's it too 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.780
 did more there is not to say that 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.670
 Similar to the sl the charts only him 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.440
 looked around differently, so to speak 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.090
 I thank you for watching if 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.820
 you have questions then post them as 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:20.180
 comments and have fun while continuing 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.180
 learn
