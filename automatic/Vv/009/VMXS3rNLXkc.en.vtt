00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.569 
young guys finding their way and playing
at<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.090> college<00:01:39.329> pace<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:41.250> biggest<00:01:41.430> thing

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
at a college pace the biggest thing

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.830 
at a college pace the biggest thing
you're<00:01:41.759> looking<00:01:41.850> for<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.180> tempo<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.750> guys

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
you're looking for is tempo and guys

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.690 
you're looking for is tempo and guys
getting<00:01:43.170> another<00:01:43.409> huddle<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.009> communicating

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
getting another huddle and communicating

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.219 
getting another huddle and communicating
because<00:01:44.759> obviously<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.450> can't<00:01:45.659> really<00:01:45.899> line

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
because obviously you can't really line

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.840 
because obviously you can't really line
up<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.619> be<00:01:46.710> as<00:01:46.799> physical<00:01:47.280> as<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.460> want<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.729> be

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
up and be as physical as you want to be

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.940 
up and be as physical as you want to be
so<00:01:48.119> it's<00:01:48.299> more<00:01:48.479> alignment<00:01:49.020> an<00:01:49.110> assignment<00:01:49.829> and

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
so it's more alignment an assignment and

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.800 
so it's more alignment an assignment and
then<00:01:50.340> certainly<00:01:50.670> as<00:01:50.820> we<00:01:50.850> put<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.210> pads<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.630> in

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
then certainly as we put the pads on in

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.780 
then certainly as we put the pads on in
stages<00:01:52.259> with<00:01:52.890> shoulder<00:01:53.189> pads<00:01:53.310> coming<00:01:53.610> on

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
stages with shoulder pads coming on

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.550 
stages with shoulder pads coming on
after<00:01:53.970> two<00:01:54.240> days<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.750> then<00:01:54.840> full<00:01:55.049> pads<00:01:55.290> after

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
after two days and then full pads after

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.499 
after two days and then full pads after
five<00:01:55.920> right<00:01:56.250> at<00:01:56.490> practice<00:01:56.850> number<00:01:57.090> five<00:01:57.270> then

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
five right at practice number five then

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.389 
five right at practice number five then
we<00:01:57.630> can<00:01:57.750> start<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.110> evaluate<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:59.100> way<00:01:59.219> we're

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
we can start to evaluate the way we're

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.649 
we can start to evaluate the way we're
playing<00:01:59.490> physically<00:02:00.060> but<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.360> biggest<00:02:00.540> thing

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
playing physically but the biggest thing

things you need to do to computing pads

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.930 
things you need to do to computing pads
you<00:02:10.319> know<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.470> can't<00:02:10.739> just<00:02:10.920> hop<00:02:11.430> right<00:02:11.489> in<00:02:11.819> and

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
game so yeah just kind of smooth out

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.130 
game so yeah just kind of smooth out
some<00:02:18.849> of<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.120> rough<00:02:19.239> spots<00:02:19.390> before<00:02:19.719> we<00:02:19.959> get<00:02:20.019> in

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
some of the rough spots before we get in

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.750 
some of the rough spots before we get in
the<00:02:20.200> past<00:02:20.349> and<00:02:20.709> Curtis<00:02:21.250> Curtis<00:02:21.579> we're

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
the past and Curtis Curtis we're

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.890 
the past and Curtis Curtis we're
probably<00:02:21.969> going<00:02:22.209> to<00:02:22.269> play<00:02:22.480> in<00:02:22.659> the<00:02:22.750> in<00:02:22.870> the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
probably going to play in the in the

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.809 
probably going to play in the in the
game<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.439> so<00:02:23.620> it<00:02:23.980> just<00:02:24.040> changes<00:02:24.579> from<00:02:24.730> a

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
game and so it just changes from a

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.119 
game and so it just changes from a
preparation<00:02:25.239> standpoint<00:02:25.900> in<00:02:26.109> terms<00:02:26.379> of<00:02:26.829> us<00:02:26.950> no

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
preparation standpoint in terms of us no

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.830 
preparation standpoint in terms of us no
one<00:02:27.250> will<00:02:27.400> display<00:02:27.700> against<00:02:28.030> one<00:02:28.209> you<00:02:28.750> know

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
one will display against one you know

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.699 
one will display against one you know
for<00:02:29.019> them<00:02:29.109> they<00:02:29.230> don't<00:02:29.379> have<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.590> waste

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
for them they don't have to waste
