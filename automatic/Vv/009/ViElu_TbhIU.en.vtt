00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
before it's pretty easy and they were a

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.099

lot<00:00:17.730> more<00:00:18.000> cloudy<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.449> first<00:00:18.660> time<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.840> did<00:00:19.080> it

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
lot more cloudy the first time I did it

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.510 
lot more cloudy the first time I did it
they've<00:00:19.529> probably<00:00:19.710> never<00:00:19.859> been<00:00:20.130> done<00:00:20.310> for

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
they've probably never been done for

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.849 
they've probably never been done for
seven<00:00:20.789> or<00:00:20.820> eight<00:00:20.880> years<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.390> then<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.500> did<00:00:22.740> it

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
seven or eight years and then I did it

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.170 
seven or eight years and then I did it
and<00:00:22.920> they<00:00:23.010> came<00:00:23.100> out<00:00:23.220> really<00:00:23.340> good<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:23.760> now

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
and they came out really good so now

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.580 
and they came out really good so now
it's<00:00:24.330> just<00:00:24.390> maintaining<00:00:24.990> them<00:00:25.109> every<00:00:25.380> six

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
it's just maintaining them every six

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.769 
it's just maintaining them every six
months<00:00:25.890> or<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:27.019> and<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.560> used<00:00:29.779> mother's

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779

Powerball headlight restoration kit and
this<00:00:34.890> thing<00:00:35.130> works<00:00:35.280> really<00:00:35.489> well<00:00:36.710> I've<00:00:37.710> done

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
this thing works really well I've done

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.569 
this thing works really well I've done
both<00:00:38.070> my<00:00:38.309> cars<00:00:38.550> with<00:00:38.790> it

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.759 

it<00:00:44.120> really<00:00:44.329> the<00:00:45.140> first<00:00:45.350> time<00:00:45.499> you<00:00:45.589> do<00:00:45.710> it

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
it really the first time you do it

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:47.590 
it really the first time you do it
you'll<00:00:45.890> see<00:00:46.039> a<00:00:46.070> huge<00:00:46.249> difference<00:00:46.489> and<00:00:46.969> then

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
you'll see a huge difference and then

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.180 
you'll see a huge difference and then
every<00:00:48.170> time<00:00:48.289> after<00:00:48.530> that<00:00:48.679> it's<00:00:48.920> just<00:00:49.039> going<00:00:49.129> to

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
every time after that it's just going to

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.430 
every time after that it's just going to
be<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:49.609> maintenance<00:00:49.969> of<00:00:50.120> it<00:00:50.440> because

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
be the maintenance of it because

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.039 
be the maintenance of it because
unfortunately<00:00:51.649> with<00:00:52.309> these<00:00:52.519> plastic<00:00:53.390> lenses

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:54.049 
unfortunately with these plastic lenses

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:56.020 
unfortunately with these plastic lenses
they<00:00:54.350> that's<00:00:54.829> just<00:00:55.070> how<00:00:55.460> they<00:00:55.609> are<00:00:55.640> they<00:00:55.879> get

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
they that's just how they are they get

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.759 
they that's just how they are they get

unlike the nice glass lenses and once

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.819 
unlike the nice glass lenses and once
once<00:01:02.449> you<00:01:02.600> do<00:01:02.899> them<00:01:03.019> the<00:01:03.109> first<00:01:03.289> time<00:01:03.469> you<00:01:03.680> can

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
once you do them the first time you can

to<00:01:07.130> cover<00:01:07.280> over<00:01:07.580> here<00:01:07.789> so<00:01:08.030> they<00:01:08.149> don't<00:01:08.890> they

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
to cover over here so they don't they

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.080 
to cover over here so they don't they
don't<00:01:09.920> break<00:01:10.220> down<00:01:10.369> as<00:01:10.549> quickly<00:01:10.850> they<00:01:10.909> don't

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
don't break down as quickly they don't

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.359 
don't break down as quickly they don't
oxidize<00:01:11.270> as<00:01:11.720> quickly<00:01:12.049> but<00:01:12.770> I<00:01:12.799> just<00:01:13.039> do<00:01:13.220> this

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
oxidize as quickly but I just do this

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.529 
oxidize as quickly but I just do this
about<00:01:13.490> every<00:01:13.610> six<00:01:13.970> months<00:01:14.270> or<00:01:14.390> so<00:01:15.130> just<00:01:16.539> go

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
about every six months or so just go

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:20.080 
about every six months or so just go

through and buff them out again with a
little<00:01:21.020> wheel<00:01:21.200> in<00:01:21.409> here<00:01:23.679> it's<00:01:24.679> probably<00:01:24.770> not

they're<00:02:36.530> still<00:02:36.800> they're<00:02:37.099> still<00:02:37.129> quite<00:02:37.400> a<00:02:37.459> bit

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
they're still they're still quite a bit

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:38.920 
they're still they're still quite a bit
in<00:02:37.730> here<00:02:37.849> but<00:02:38.030> I<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.269> IV<00:02:38.480> I've<00:02:38.629> done<00:02:38.810> this

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
in here but I and IV I've done this

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.130 
in here but I and IV I've done this
probably<00:02:39.409> maybe<00:02:39.739> six<00:02:40.010> times<00:02:40.190> total<00:02:41.049> for<00:02:42.049> my

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
probably maybe six times total for my

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.369 
probably maybe six times total for my
cars<00:02:42.409> so<00:02:43.420> this<00:02:44.420> stuff<00:02:44.629> lasts<00:02:44.870> quite<00:02:45.049> a<00:02:45.140> while

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
cars so this stuff lasts quite a while

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.050 
cars so this stuff lasts quite a while
and<00:02:45.920> I<00:02:46.040> last<00:02:46.220> walk<00:02:46.400> as<00:02:46.580> long<00:02:46.730> as<00:02:46.819> you<00:02:46.909> need

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
and I last walk as long as you need

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.710 
and I last walk as long as you need
really<00:02:47.239> is<00:02:47.360> a<00:02:48.909> little<00:02:49.909> bit<00:02:50.030> on<00:02:50.150> here<00:02:50.360> to<00:02:50.480> start

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
really is a little bit on here to start

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.010 
really is a little bit on here to start
with<00:02:52.030> probably<00:02:53.030> like<00:02:53.120> that<00:02:53.270> like<00:02:53.420> a<00:02:53.510> dime<00:02:53.720> size

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
with probably like that like a dime size

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.660 
with probably like that like a dime size
and<00:02:54.590> what<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:54.770> do<00:02:54.890> is<00:02:55.010> just<00:02:55.040> come<00:02:55.370> up<00:02:55.490> to<00:02:55.640> it

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
and what you do is just come up to it

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.309 
and what you do is just come up to it
and<00:02:55.910> just

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
and just

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:12.690 
and just
an<00:02:56.379> area<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:56.769> workaround

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.070 

all<00:03:13.700> right<00:03:13.850> so<00:03:14.030> after<00:03:14.090> you<00:03:14.300> filled<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.660> buff

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
all right so after you filled the buff

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.110 
all right so after you filled the buff
good<00:03:15.620> enough<00:03:15.890> with<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.220> drill<00:03:16.460> we're<00:03:17.090> going

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
good enough with the drill we're going

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.360 
good enough with the drill we're going
to<00:03:17.300> take<00:03:17.420> our<00:03:17.650> terry<00:03:18.650> cloth<00:03:18.860> and<00:03:19.130> give<00:03:19.250> it<00:03:19.340> a

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
to take our terry cloth and give it a

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:27.930 
to take our terry cloth and give it a
wipe<00:03:19.580> down<00:03:23.920> you<00:03:24.920> can<00:03:25.040> see<00:03:26.290> it's<00:03:27.290> a<00:03:27.380> lot<00:03:27.560> more

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
wipe down you can see it's a lot more

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.760 
wipe down you can see it's a lot more
clear<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.090> shiny<00:03:29.420> and<00:03:30.110> it<00:03:30.380> will<00:03:30.500> stay<00:03:30.650> like

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
this you know for about six or eight

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.240 
this you know for about six or eight
months<00:03:32.510> I<00:03:33.260> think<00:03:33.620> it's<00:03:33.710> actually<00:03:33.800> been<00:03:34.070> a<00:03:34.100> year

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
months I think it's actually been a year

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.190 
months I think it's actually been a year
since<00:03:34.280> I've<00:03:34.580> redone<00:03:34.820> it<00:03:34.970> but<00:03:35.090> last<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:36.020> other

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.460 
since I've redone it but last the other

so<00:03:57.080> it's<00:03:57.200> that<00:03:57.380> easy<00:03:58.360> but<00:03:59.360> it's<00:03:59.480> the<00:03:59.570> head<00:03:59.690> easy

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
so it's that easy but it's the head easy

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.000 
so it's that easy but it's the head easy
for<00:04:00.110> me<00:04:00.200> because<00:04:00.410> I've<00:04:00.530> already<00:04:00.680> done<00:04:00.800> it

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
for me because I've already done it

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.620 
for me because I've already done it
before<00:04:01.130> but<00:04:01.550> if<00:04:01.730> you<00:04:01.760> do<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.030> first<00:04:02.180> time<00:04:02.390> too

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
before but if you do the first time too

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.330 
before but if you do the first time too
it<00:04:02.780> might<00:04:02.900> take<00:04:03.080> a<00:04:03.110> little<00:04:03.200> bit<00:04:03.350> more<00:04:03.410> more

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
it might take a little bit more more

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.430 
it might take a little bit more more
work<00:04:04.580> but<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.300> mothers<00:04:05.570> kit<00:04:05.780> really<00:04:06.080> is<00:04:06.290> worth

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
work but the mothers kit really is worth

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.050 
work but the mothers kit really is worth
