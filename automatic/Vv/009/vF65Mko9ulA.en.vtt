00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.570
 in today indicate a video that 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.130
 It is super bad crime and super practical 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.949
 today we are going to learn how to do 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.380
 different hairstyles with only one 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.999
 headband a headband one of these things 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.940
 that many of us have in the 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:35.370
 little house so all is super easy and 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.219
 also super super practical is so that 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.969
 enjoy it a lot and let's start I'm 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.750
 nothing 'the number one I'm going to take as a 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.750
 half tail 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.160
 well with one held like a comb 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.040
 any one brush I will try to 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.440
 entangle in the part of here only 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.850
 to give it volume since I do not have 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.280
 volume I'm going to take and I'm going to comb 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.020
 slowly so as not to damage the volume 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.780
 Once my hair has volume that 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.480
 have accepted plane I will take the 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.490
 cintita and this is obviously the hairstyle 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.220
 that many of us already know 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.210
 we know how it works I will take the 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.030
 tape 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.729
 and I'm going to pass it back like the one 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.220
 nowadays it has volume is no longer going to see 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.650
 so simple or so flat I'm just going to 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.940
 comb these puppies here so that 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.940
 do not be so raised 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.880
 and this would be number 1 this is super 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.010
 easy super practical but as has 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.470
 this raised here you will see 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.200
 much more elegant at the end number 2 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.119
 it's just as easy as I'm going to take the 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.220
 bandita in the same way I will make sure 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.960
 that this part of here is up 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.710
 that has volume so that it is not so 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.720
 I'll take up the hair band 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.509
 I'm going to put it here as if it were 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.020
 a crown I'm going to take out his spirit 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.020
 from ahead 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:06.850
 investment per meter I will not go putting 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:09.930
 the ones below down here under 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.930
 of the tape 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.209
 the hair that is lion 11 with another 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.209
 lock of hair 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:24.660
 and together I'm going to roll up the 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:27.000
 subway tape below the tape 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.069
 arcs I'll take with another tuft quoted 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.940
 which is down here and I'm going to do 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.940
 exactly the same 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.540
 it's like a half tail I'm going to do what 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.719
 same with the other side I take a lock 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.390
 the methods inside the tape in 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:46.340
 many milestones that came out as thread 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.040
 together with a lock of hair here 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.469
 down 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.830
 and I do the same now here is the part 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:55.090
 we throw in the back 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.160
 in the back 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:02.190
 I'm going to take the strand that had come out 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:05.170
 over here and I'm just going to wrap it 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.050
 and wrap 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.900
 by the elastic tape to cover it 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.260
 completely 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.150
 I leave it there 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.299
 more sure that the seat is fine 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.790
 covered me using one of these 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:22.040
 invisible or shoelaces I will pull the 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.920
 two strands of hair that wrapped them 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.459
 I'm going to make sure 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.459
 with 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.160
 Now I'm going to pull the hair so that 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.400
 do not look so perfect 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.710
 but lift a little here also and 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.570
 something the same the front part is 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:44.570
 in a little bit so it does not look so 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.570
 perfect 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.269
 this would be the number 2 hairstyle that 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.220
 facilitates truth now is combed the 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.500
 number 3 for this hairstyle can have 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.239
 straight hair or better yet can 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.489
 have hair with waves and is that 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.950
 they have waves you know a lot more 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.840
 dramatic and much more beautiful and good 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.569
 sure that this part of here from my 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.629
 head have volume and it will not be so flat 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.150
 and I'm going to take the bandit again 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:16.030
 elastic 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.620
 and as it is in number 2 I'm going to 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:23.359
 put it like this 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.359
 I'm going to take a head 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.270
 what under then not with another piece of 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:30.270
 hair 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:36.309
 and I'm going to wrap it around the 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.660
 I'll do the same with all the 

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:39.940
 hair 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.040
 counted everything everyone who visited a 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.480
 little bit well pushing the tape to 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.850
 up a little bit to continue creating 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.830
 volume in this part of here I'm going to 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.080
 leave for a moment is there in what 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.770
 do the other side will join it with 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.770
 another lock 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:58.039
 and I'm going to wrap it 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:01.129
 now the older ones that are in the part 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:03.050
 from behind I'm going to take the lock and I'm going 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:06.099
 to continue joining with other locks of 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:09.529
 hair and I will continue to wrap 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:13.779
 wrap the hair and pushed for 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:13.779
 ends to create more slowly 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:26.700
 Now here is a single tail 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:30.630
