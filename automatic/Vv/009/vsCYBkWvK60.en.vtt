better<00:02:43.489> but<00:02:44.239> all<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.510> files<00:02:44.750> i'll<00:02:45.079> probably

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
better but all the files i'll probably

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.819 
better but all the files i'll probably
still<00:02:45.650> be<00:02:45.680> able<00:02:45.859> to<00:02:46.069> get<00:02:46.450> but<00:02:47.450> yeah<00:02:47.569> that<00:02:47.750> is

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
still be able to get but yeah that is

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.920 
still be able to get but yeah that is
simply<00:02:48.829> it<00:02:49.069> you<00:02:49.250> can<00:02:49.430> just<00:02:49.690> go<00:02:50.690> through<00:02:50.870> all

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
simply it you can just go through all

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.020 
simply it you can just go through all
the<00:02:51.019> next<00:02:51.230> one<00:02:51.349> so<00:02:51.530> player<00:02:51.859> name<00:02:52.220> whoever

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
the next one so player name whoever

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.080 
the next one so player name whoever
you've<00:02:53.269> got<00:02:53.480> so<00:02:53.690> if<00:02:53.810> you<00:02:53.959> get<00:02:54.290> messy<00:02:55.129> you<00:02:55.879> fill

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
you've got so if you get messy you fill

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.720 
you've got so if you get messy you fill
that<00:02:56.269> one<00:02:56.450> in<00:02:56.659> and<00:02:56.870> then<00:02:57.290> this<00:02:57.409> is<00:02:57.730> crucial

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
that one in and then this is crucial

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.280 
that one in and then this is crucial
because<00:02:59.269> this<00:02:59.599> is<00:02:59.720> what<00:02:59.870> I<00:02:59.900> want<00:03:00.170> to<00:03:00.230> know

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
because sometimes they might not even

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.640 
because sometimes they might not even
look<00:03:02.060> at<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.269> picture<00:03:02.690> but<00:03:03.260> when<00:03:03.379> I'm<00:03:03.500> like
