00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
computer later on let's see what

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.700 
computer later on let's see what
happened<00:03:31.820> now<00:03:31.910> with<00:03:32.120> four<00:03:32.840> seconds<00:03:33.380> after

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
speed f29 100 iso is also possible to

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.510 
speed f29 100 iso is also possible to
play<00:03:41.570> with<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:41.980> exposure<00:03:42.980> constant

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
play with the exposure constant

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.910 
play with the exposure constant
confrontation<00:03:44.080> which<00:03:45.080> does<00:03:45.260> automatically

confrontation which does automatically

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.310 
confrontation which does automatically
should<00:03:45.980> be<00:03:46.850> shot<00:03:47.060> with<00:03:47.300> different<00:03:47.660> exposures

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
should be shot with different exposures

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.390 
should be shot with different exposures
and<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:49.580> result<00:03:49.940> is<00:03:50.180> this<00:03:50.740> very<00:03:51.740> high<00:03:52.010> spell

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
and the result is this very high spell

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.550 
and the result is this very high spell
right<00:03:53.770> into<00:03:54.770> this<00:03:54.890> one<00:03:55.070> that<00:03:55.250> makes<00:03:55.370> thanks

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.500 

now<00:04:00.340> that<00:04:00.520> is<00:04:00.610> getting<00:04:00.910> darker<00:04:01.209> we<00:04:01.330> can

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
now that is getting darker we can

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.309 
now that is getting darker we can
actually<00:04:01.930> extend<00:04:03.510> we<00:04:04.510> can<00:04:04.660> go<00:04:04.780> up<00:04:04.870> to<00:04:05.050> six

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
actually extend we can go up to six

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.050 
actually extend we can go up to six
seconds<00:04:05.860> f29

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
seconds f29

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.080 
seconds f29
and<00:04:07.870> actually<00:04:08.290> now<00:04:08.410> we<00:04:08.470> can<00:04:08.920> even<00:04:09.750> increase

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
and actually now we can even increase

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.520 
and actually now we can even increase
increase<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.240> shutter<00:04:13.420> speed<00:04:13.840> so<00:04:13.870> two<00:04:14.230> eight

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
increase the shutter speed so two eight

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.280 
increase the shutter speed so two eight
seconds<00:04:15.100> or<00:04:15.280> 10<00:04:15.520> seconds<00:04:16.000> and<00:04:16.810> we<00:04:16.930> can<00:04:17.109> also

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
seconds or 10 seconds and we can also

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.270 
seconds or 10 seconds and we can also
start<00:04:18.040> reducing<00:04:18.750> or<00:04:19.750> increasing<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:21.010> size<00:04:21.220> of

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
start reducing or increasing the size of

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.200 
start reducing or increasing the size of
the<00:04:21.850> aperture<00:04:22.090> let's<00:04:22.600> try<00:04:23.080> with<00:04:23.139> F<00:04:23.620> 25<00:04:24.210> 10

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
the aperture let's try with F 25 10

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.300 
the aperture let's try with F 25 10
seconds<00:04:25.750> and<00:04:25.960> I<00:04:26.110> want<00:04:26.260> to<00:04:26.350> still<00:04:26.500> keep<00:04:26.530> my<00:04:26.860> ISO

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
seconds and I want to still keep my ISO

can<00:04:32.050> see<00:04:32.200> there's<00:04:32.380> a<00:04:32.440> timer<00:04:32.680> going<00:04:32.860> I<00:04:33.340> gave<00:04:34.060> it

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
can see there's a timer going I gave it

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.020 
can see there's a timer going I gave it
10<00:04:34.450> seconds<00:04:34.870> to<00:04:34.990> make<00:04:35.140> sure<00:04:35.320> that<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:35.590> camera

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
10 seconds to make sure that the camera

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.240 
10 seconds to make sure that the camera
stabilized<00:04:37.030> doesn't<00:04:37.390> have<00:04:37.480> any<00:04:37.630> vibration

so<00:04:57.020> let's<00:04:57.230> keep<00:04:57.320> rotating<00:04:57.530> see<00:04:58.130> if<00:04:58.190> we<00:04:58.280> can<00:04:58.400> get

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
so let's keep rotating see if we can get

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.940 
so let's keep rotating see if we can get
some<00:04:58.730> good<00:04:58.850> shots<00:04:58.910> I<00:04:59.389> hope<00:05:00.080> this<00:05:00.230> video
