capital punishment now i am not

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.350 
capital punishment now i am not
suggesting<00:01:22.350> that's<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.189> case<00:01:23.369> now<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.210> is

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
suggesting that's the case now that is

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.780 
suggesting that's the case now that is
that<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.229> should<00:01:25.860> be<00:01:25.979> punished<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.610> way

that that should be punished in that way
that's<00:01:27.030> not<00:01:27.180> my<00:01:27.330> view<00:01:27.920> because<00:01:28.920> we're<00:01:29.100> not

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
that's not my view because we're not

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.359 
that's not my view because we're not
under<00:01:29.579> theocracy<00:01:30.210> anymore<00:01:30.600> but<00:01:31.110> i<00:01:31.320> think<00:01:31.860> that

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
under theocracy anymore but i think that

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.160 
under theocracy anymore but i think that
does<00:01:32.759> tell<00:01:33.090> us<00:01:33.270> something<00:01:33.689> about<00:01:33.780> god's

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
does tell us something about god's

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.249 
does tell us something about god's
perspective<00:01:34.799> about<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:36.390> particular<00:01:36.780> thing

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
perspective about that particular thing

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.830 
perspective about that particular thing
and<00:01:37.590> we're<00:01:38.159> not<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.610> restricted<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
and we're not just restricted to the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.980 
and we're not just restricted to the
leviticus<00:01:40.320> passage<00:01:40.829> or<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.960> sodom<00:01:42.960> and

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
makes very clear that homosexuality is a

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.719 
makes very clear that homosexuality is a
violation<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.649> natural<00:01:53.070> order<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.610> he

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
violation of the natural order that he

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.600 
violation of the natural order that he
created<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:55.320> other<00:01:55.470> words<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.040> here<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.460> have

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
created in other words and here you have

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.249

to go to the new American Standard Bible
I<00:01:58.560> think<00:01:58.799> for<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.369> Crispus<00:02:00.030> at<00:02:00.240> clearest

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
I think for the Crispus at clearest

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.929 
I think for the Crispus at clearest
characterization<00:02:02.880> or<00:02:03.560> translation<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.649> this

characterization or translation of this

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.469 
characterization or translation of this
but<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.090> problem<00:02:06.600> there<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:08.300> men<00:02:09.300> and

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
but the problem there is that men and

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.869 
but the problem there is that men and
women<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:10.050> their<00:02:10.590> homosexual<00:02:11.280> behaviors

this is what God says about how we treat
people<00:03:16.650> so<00:03:16.980> there<00:03:17.400> is<00:03:17.490> no<00:03:17.730> justification<00:03:18.720> for

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
people so there is no justification for

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.410 
people so there is no justification for
anything<00:03:19.530> like<00:03:19.740> gay<00:03:20.160> bashing<00:03:20.400> given<00:03:21.360> the

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
anything like gay bashing given the

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.550 
anything like gay bashing given the
scriptural<00:03:22.430> evidence<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.640> total

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
and this is what people think when you

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.340 
and this is what people think when you
say<00:03:29.250> what's<00:03:29.430> wrong<00:03:29.490> of<00:03:30.209> course<00:03:30.270> we<00:03:30.780> don't<00:03:30.900> bash
