00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.930
 you know there is always 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.490
 least one thing you do not know 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.780
 and it's nice if you know 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.219
 all and you are already in the future 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.349
 and in this case I'll pull my cap 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.630

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.070
 know fly lo fm one of the multiples 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.570
 gta 5 radio stations 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.279
 but do you know the novelty 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.750
 of this radio and ben in fact she is going 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.430
 record more than 30 minutes of 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.910
 additional music on consoles 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.230
 next gen 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.160
 I'll give you an excerpt from one of 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.160
 music that will be available 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.640
 not bad I find the link of the music 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.500
 in full is in the description 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.250
 of the video the complete music is 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.410
 really top 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.970
 you are a real gta 5 player when you 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.559
 know that you can cross the hangar of 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.720
 mary wever on a fighter 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.860
 we had proposed a challenge I did not 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.299
 video on it because it's a lot 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.590
 too simple the person who gave it to me 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.210
 proposed was perhaps unaware 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.500
 that we could cross it she thought 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.240
 maybe it was going to be difficult 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.590
 in reality it's really simple where 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.690
 there is a hole there is hope 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.429
 you are a real gta 5 player when you 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.720
 know the scooters brave hours 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:23.490
 it's an easter egg at the famous stage 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.050
 grover scooters from gta iv 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.550
 but where you are a real gta player 5 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.960
 it's when you've already seen the head of your 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.550
 scooter brothers I leave you with 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.479

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.960
