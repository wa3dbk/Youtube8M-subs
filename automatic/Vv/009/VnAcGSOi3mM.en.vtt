00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:27.570
 from simple preparation of the ciabatta 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.960
 250 g of flour are simple 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:35.070
 manitoba a quarter of yeast cube 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.120
 of compressed beer 185 g of water 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.090
 warm 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.850
 the spoon of salt and a tablespoon of 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.350
 anime will also serve part flour 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.820
 also prepare a dish towel for 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.480
 cover the dough during 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:56.700
 rising and a baking pan covered with 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:04.340
 beard forum we prepare by dissolving the 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:04.340
 yeast with water 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:21.359
 and honey choose the idiot well 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.090
 so it doesn't have to be too hot 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:31.849
 being city has its own too hot 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:36.890
 interrupts the debt proceeding 

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:36.890
 to then make the rest 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:49.500
 let's go to the flour we put on one side 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:53.329
 we occupy the salt so that it is poured 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.329
 the leaven I have not commented 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.629
 we think pitot lines and on the other side high 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.650
 add the remaining water 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:25.890
 and mix well to mix 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:30.030
 all the ingredients the dough 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:33.599
 will be slightly sticky and 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.940
 even wrinkled it is normal not to worry 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.660
 it is precisely this type of processing that 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.660
 from this result 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:46.049
 those last ones are ingredients but you see 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:54.569
 you don't need to knead it as you normally do 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:57.750
 sign for the bread to wrap it 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:03.720
 always with help in the fork up 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:07.410
 to these blacks a little dough enough 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.810
 claimed you have it sticking to the 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:16.049
 bowl don't worry 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:18.769
 take the pan pour yours 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.769
 loaf 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.350
 mash lightly with a fork 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.720
 I give it a slight shape 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:42.130
 stretched so that it comes just like 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.680
 if it were actually a loaf then 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.550
 during gestation it flattens 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.580
 slightly a bread of the height comes 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:55.900
 about 2 3 centimeters is not much 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:04:01.209
 tall if you want to give it more shape 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:03.580
 elongated plus a slightly higher head 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:09.780
 you can also use a plum mold 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.780
 cake and to help you 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.510
 now we have to completely cover the 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.910
 surface of the dough with the flour 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.419
 white 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.419
 in this way 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:34.039
 open and let rise in a 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:38.270
 room temperature for an hour e 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:41.449
 half the leavening ended in 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:05:00.229
 moment when the stake doubles the 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:05:05.050
 volume this is the loaf once 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:07.159
 limited as you can see and down 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.680
 doubled 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:14.750
 now we turn on the oven at 200 30 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:18.259
 degrees and cook it for 15 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:25.430
 minutes anyway you see it when upstairs 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:27.349
 and it is gilded it is ready this is the cloth 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.539
 once baked I do n't do it 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:32.719
 cool on a wire rack so that 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:37.009
 humidity did not form below 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:38.630
 of the bread shape we try it is still 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:42.140
 a little hot 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:45.070
 the same for you to see how we 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.070
 miss the inter 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:54.360
 I'm looking for a grandfather to crush him 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.360
 too much because being calm 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.610
 this is over
