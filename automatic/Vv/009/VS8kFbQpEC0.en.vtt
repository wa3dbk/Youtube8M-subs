00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
don't i don't think that happens i don't

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.100 
don't i don't think that happens i don't
know<00:03:16.730> if<00:03:16.820> that's<00:03:16.940> really<00:03:17.090> ever<00:03:17.269> the<00:03:17.690> case<00:03:17.870> for

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
know if that's really ever the case for

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.890 
know if that's really ever the case for
me<00:03:18.200> cuz<00:03:18.350> like<00:03:18.410> i<00:03:18.530> said<00:03:18.739> i<00:03:19.180> mean<00:03:20.180> i<00:03:20.269> I<00:03:20.299> feel

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
me cuz like i said i mean i I feel

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.020 
me cuz like i said i mean i I feel
pretty<00:03:21.739> good<00:03:21.890> with<00:03:22.010> carbs<00:03:22.280> later<00:03:22.489> on<00:03:22.670> I<00:03:22.700> guess

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
pretty good with carbs later on I guess

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.509 
pretty good with carbs later on I guess
but<00:03:23.480> I<00:03:23.720> think<00:03:24.590> my<00:03:24.680> favorite<00:03:24.890> time<00:03:25.220> during<00:03:25.430> the

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
but I think my favorite time during the

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:26.890 
but I think my favorite time during the
low<00:03:25.610> carb<00:03:25.850> dieting<00:03:26.209> is<00:03:26.330> when<00:03:26.480> you<00:03:26.570> really<00:03:26.720> get

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
low carb dieting is when you really get

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.289 
low carb dieting is when you really get
into<00:03:27.200> it<00:03:27.230> and<00:03:27.500> it's<00:03:28.100> like<00:03:28.220> it's<00:03:28.880> once<00:03:29.150> your

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
into it and it's like it's once your

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.479 
into it and it's like it's once your
carb<00:03:29.540> depleted<00:03:29.959> you<00:03:30.470> sort<00:03:30.769> of<00:03:30.830> have<00:03:31.160> no<00:03:31.190> choice

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
carb depleted you sort of have no choice

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.030 
carb depleted you sort of have no choice
but<00:03:31.820> to<00:03:32.180> really<00:03:32.330> gut<00:03:32.720> it<00:03:32.840> out<00:03:32.989> and<00:03:33.230> really

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
but to really gut it out and really

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.070 
but to really gut it out and really
access<00:03:34.760> whatever<00:03:35.150> sort<00:03:35.570> of<00:03:35.630> internal

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
access whatever sort of internal

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.009 
access whatever sort of internal
motivation<00:03:36.410> you<00:03:37.370> have<00:03:37.610> to<00:03:38.330> really<00:03:38.510> push<00:03:38.750> hard

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
motivation you have to really push hard
