00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.680
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.820
Not a footprint to be seen.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.580
A kingdom of isolation,
and it looks like I'm the Queen

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:30.120
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.800
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.580
Don't let them in,
don't let them see

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.760
Be the good girl you always have to be

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.240
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.340
Well now they know

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.080
Let it go, let it go

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.340
Can't hold it back anymore

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.240
Let it go, let it go

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.320
Turn away and slam the door

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.180
I don't care
what they're going to say

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.700
Let the storm rage on

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.780
The cold never bothered me anyway

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.400
It's funny how some distance

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.040
Makes everything seem small

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.260
and the fears that once controlled me

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.720
Can't get to me at all

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.680
It's time to see what I can do

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.240
To test the limits and break through

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.460
No right, no wrong, no rules for me,
I'm free

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.100
Let it go, let it go

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.760
I am one with the wind and sky

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.680
Let it go, let it go

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.460
You'll never see me cry

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.480
Here I stand

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.340
And here I'll stay

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.380
Let the storm rage on

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.800
My power flurries through the air into the ground

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.500
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.820
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.560
I'm never going back, the past is in the past

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.840
Let it go, let it go

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.840
And I'll rise like the break of dawn

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.220
Let it go, let it go

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.900
That perfect girl is gone

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:19.060
Here I stand in the light of day

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.480
Let the storm rage on

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.000
The cold never bothered me anyway
