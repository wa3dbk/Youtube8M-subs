bit almost like a quarter-inch
but<00:02:11.129> it's<00:02:11.610> fine<00:02:11.819> because<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.390> whole<00:02:12.540> pad

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
but it's fine because the whole pad

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.520 
but it's fine because the whole pad
can<00:02:13.430> be<00:02:13.550> pushing<00:02:13.819> a<00:02:13.910> little<00:02:14.060> bit<00:02:14.210> and<00:02:14.470> that's<00:02:15.470> a

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
can be pushing a little bit and that's a

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.870 
can be pushing a little bit and that's a
little<00:02:15.710> actually<00:02:16.100> a<00:02:16.130> little<00:02:16.340> gap<00:02:16.520> between<00:02:16.550> the

my<00:04:14.100> macbook<00:04:14.340> but<00:04:15.030> I'm<00:04:15.150> not<00:04:15.360> sure<00:04:15.810> it<00:04:15.930> will<00:04:16.050> fit

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
my macbook but I'm not sure it will fit

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.580 
my macbook but I'm not sure it will fit
with<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.700> speed<00:04:18.090> if<00:04:18.600> I<00:04:18.690> were<00:04:18.840> to<00:04:18.930> sleep<00:04:19.140> on<00:04:19.320> I

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
with the speed if I were to sleep on I

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.560 
with the speed if I were to sleep on I
may<00:04:19.650> have<00:04:19.770> to<00:04:19.950> put<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.340> MacBook<00:04:21.060> just<00:04:21.239> in<00:04:21.390> the

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
may have to put the MacBook just in the

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.120 
may have to put the MacBook just in the
main<00:04:21.720> compartment<00:04:22.940> but<00:04:23.940> uh<00:04:24.260> the<00:04:25.260> inside<00:04:25.650> is

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
main compartment but uh the inside is

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.340 
main compartment but uh the inside is
this<00:04:26.580> move<00:04:26.880> it's<00:04:27.360> not<00:04:27.510> had<00:04:27.690> it<00:04:27.840> but<00:04:28.050> it's<00:04:28.170> move

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
this move it's not had it but it's move

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.050 
this move it's not had it but it's move
so<00:04:28.710> most<00:04:29.010> likely<00:04:29.070> I'll<00:04:29.280> just<00:04:29.400> carry<00:04:29.610> like<00:04:29.880> this

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.330 
there I tried a s 95 it fits the Lobos
squeeze<00:05:42.360> but<00:05:42.600> it<00:05:42.690> fit<00:05:42.900> the<00:05:43.380> problem<00:05:43.590> is<00:05:43.860> when

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
squeeze but it fit the problem is when

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.220 
squeeze but it fit the problem is when
you<00:05:44.430> wear<00:05:44.610> it<00:05:44.730> is<00:05:44.850> this<00:05:45.450> is<00:05:45.600> con<00:05:45.780> to<00:05:45.900> the<00:05:45.990> side

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
you wear it is this is con to the side

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.350 
you wear it is this is con to the side
or<00:05:46.500> slightly<00:05:46.920> back<00:05:47.160> so<00:05:47.850> it's<00:05:47.940> actually<00:05:48.180> kind

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
or slightly back so it's actually kind

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.260 
or slightly back so it's actually kind
of<00:05:48.390> goofy<00:05:48.690> to<00:05:48.870> like<00:05:49.020> unzip<00:05:49.800> it<00:05:49.980> work<00:05:50.940> it<00:05:51.120> out

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
of goofy to like unzip it work it out

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.730 
of goofy to like unzip it work it out
and<00:05:51.600> take<00:05:51.780> a<00:05:51.840> big<00:05:51.930> chance<00:05:52.050> to<00:05:52.200> get<00:05:52.350> back<00:05:52.530> in

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
and take a big chance to get back in

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.250 
and take a big chance to get back in
most<00:05:53.100> likely<00:05:53.370> I'll<00:05:53.490> just<00:05:53.610> keep<00:05:53.820> thumb<00:05:54.260> my

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260 
most likely I'll just keep thumb my

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.170 
most likely I'll just keep thumb my
point<00:05:55.530> is<00:05:55.620> shoot<00:05:55.860> in<00:05:56.490> my<00:05:56.640> pockets<00:05:57.090> or

something and put some other
miscellaneous<00:05:58.830> stuff<00:05:59.220> here<00:05:59.640> it<00:05:59.910> really

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
miscellaneous stuff here it really

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.260 
miscellaneous stuff here it really
necessary<00:06:00.360> on<00:06:01.320> the<00:06:01.440> other<00:06:01.560> side<00:06:01.830> you<00:06:02.790> have<00:06:02.910> two

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
necessary on the other side you have two

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.640 
necessary on the other side you have two
straps<00:06:03.600> here<00:06:03.780> you<00:06:03.840> can<00:06:03.930> hang<00:06:04.110> things<00:06:04.260> off<00:06:04.470> as

straps here you can hang things off as

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.920 
straps here you can hang things off as
well<00:06:04.830> and<00:06:05.100> again<00:06:05.730> I<00:06:06.090> kind<00:06:06.390> of<00:06:06.450> doubt<00:06:06.600> I'll<00:06:06.750> use

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
well and again I kind of doubt I'll use

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:07.770 
well and again I kind of doubt I'll use
those

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
those

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.090 
those
how<00:06:08.560> about<00:06:08.710> that's<00:06:08.830> pretty<00:06:09.070> much<00:06:09.160> it<00:06:09.639> um<00:06:11.100> not

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
how about that's pretty much it um not

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.960 
how about that's pretty much it um not
gonna<00:06:12.280> sugarcoat<00:06:12.520> it

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
gonna sugarcoat it

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.840 
gonna sugarcoat it
the<00:06:13.360> backpack<00:06:14.290> is<00:06:14.530> kinda<00:06:15.190> expensive<00:06:15.250> what<00:06:15.760> it

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:15.850 
the backpack is kinda expensive what it

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.629 
the backpack is kinda expensive what it
is<00:06:16.000> I<00:06:16.960> think<00:06:17.410> the<00:06:17.590> whole<00:06:17.710> set<00:06:17.980> cost<00:06:18.340> me<00:06:18.550> about

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 
is I think the whole set cost me about

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:22.800 
is I think the whole set cost me about
2:30<00:06:19.680> but<00:06:20.680> uh<00:06:20.740> then<00:06:21.639> again<00:06:21.880> I<00:06:21.910> mean<00:06:22.180> it<00:06:22.660> also

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
2:30 but uh then again I mean it also

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.810 
2:30 but uh then again I mean it also
depends<00:06:23.200> on<00:06:23.260> like<00:06:23.500> how<00:06:23.770> often<00:06:23.889> even<00:06:24.160> you<00:06:24.370> hike

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
depends on like how often even you hike

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.750 
depends on like how often even you hike
a<00:06:24.910> travel<00:06:25.270> and<00:06:25.360> be<00:06:25.450> something<00:06:25.690> like<00:06:25.810> this<00:06:26.020> and

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
a travel and be something like this and

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.830 
a travel and be something like this and
do<00:06:27.760> you<00:06:27.820> think<00:06:27.970> is<00:06:28.030> worth<00:06:28.180> it<00:06:28.300> to<00:06:28.389> you<00:06:28.540> like<00:06:28.750> in

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
do you think is worth it to you like in

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.180 
do you think is worth it to you like in
terms<00:06:28.870> of<00:06:29.110> your<00:06:29.260> financial<00:06:29.560> situation<00:06:29.770> as

terms of your financial situation as
well<00:06:30.370> I<00:06:30.580> think<00:06:31.060> it's<00:06:31.389> I<00:06:31.540> think<00:06:31.660> it's<00:06:31.840> pretty

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
well I think it's I think it's pretty

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.520 
well I think it's I think it's pretty
solid

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530 
solid

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.540 
solid
this<00:06:32.980> is<00:06:33.130> a<00:06:33.160> long-term<00:06:33.370> investment<00:06:34.060> and<00:06:35.550> I

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
this is a long-term investment and I

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.159 
this is a long-term investment and I
look<00:06:36.730> forward<00:06:36.970> to<00:06:37.000> actually<00:06:37.300> trying<00:06:37.750> it<00:06:38.020> and

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:38.169 
look forward to actually trying it and

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:40.830 
look forward to actually trying it and
then<00:06:38.950> give<00:06:39.820> them<00:06:39.910> more<00:06:40.060> in<00:06:40.120> that<00:06:40.240> review<00:06:40.570> of
