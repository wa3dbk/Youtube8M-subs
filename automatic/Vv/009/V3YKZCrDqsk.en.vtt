late<00:00:10.540> and<00:00:10.870> thought<00:00:11.110> brings<00:00:11.349> some<00:00:11.530> of<00:00:11.589> the<00:00:11.679> old

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:11.769 
late and thought brings some of the old

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.470 
late and thought brings some of the old
gear<00:00:12.009> with<00:00:12.219> me<00:00:12.299> the<00:00:13.299> cardinal<00:00:13.839> 55<00:00:14.320> out<00:00:15.480> just

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
gear with me the cardinal 55 out just

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.820 
gear with me the cardinal 55 out just
hooked<00:00:16.750> and<00:00:16.930> played<00:00:17.109> a<00:00:17.140> fish<00:00:17.470> for<00:00:17.619> a<00:00:17.680> long

while<00:00:18.039> and<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:20.650> suppose<00:00:20.859> exploded

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:21.789 
while and the suppose exploded

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.550 
while and the suppose exploded
I<00:00:22.859> guess<00:00:23.859> that's<00:00:24.130> perhaps<00:00:24.310> why<00:00:24.640> we<00:00:25.349> don't<00:00:26.349> use

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
I guess that's perhaps why we don't use

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.589 
I guess that's perhaps why we don't use
old<00:00:26.769> gear<00:00:26.980> so<00:00:27.189> much<00:00:28.170> but<00:00:29.170> the<00:00:29.289> culprit<00:00:29.679> of<00:00:29.710> that
