doing<00:04:00.030> at<00:04:00.150> Pixar<00:04:00.569> is<00:04:00.959> what<00:04:01.409> Walt<00:04:01.650> Disney<00:04:02.040> did

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
doing at Pixar is what Walt Disney did

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.149 
doing at Pixar is what Walt Disney did
way<00:04:02.699> back<00:04:02.939> and<00:04:03.269> you<00:04:03.329> sweatbox<00:04:04.290> those<00:04:04.889> scenes

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
way back and you sweatbox those scenes

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.670 
way back and you sweatbox those scenes
with<00:04:05.340> everybody<00:04:05.790> there<00:04:06.500> everybody<00:04:07.500> in<00:04:07.590> the

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
with everybody there everybody in the

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.409 
with everybody there everybody in the
room<00:04:07.829> all<00:04:08.069> animators<00:04:08.639> look<00:04:08.849> at<00:04:08.939> everybody's

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:09.419 
room all animators look at everybody's

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:11.270 
room all animators look at everybody's
scene<00:04:09.659> and<00:04:09.900> first<00:04:10.349> we<00:04:10.560> thought<00:04:10.769> oh<00:04:10.919> that's<00:04:11.129> a

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
scene and first we thought oh that's a

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.990 
scene and first we thought oh that's a
little<00:04:11.459> scary

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
little scary

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.969 
little scary
because<00:04:12.239> then<00:04:12.419> they<00:04:12.750> can<00:04:12.930> it's<00:04:13.319> like<00:04:13.500> an<00:04:13.829> open

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:13.979 
because then they can it's like an open

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:17.210 
because then they can it's like an open
open<00:04:14.970> field<00:04:15.209> you<00:04:15.449> know<00:04:15.599> but<00:04:16.560> we<00:04:16.709> started<00:04:17.039> doing

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
open field you know but we started doing

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.550 
open field you know but we started doing
that<00:04:17.519> and<00:04:17.699> it

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
that and it

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.319 
that and it
really<00:04:18.859> makes<00:04:19.100> sense<00:04:19.430> because<00:04:19.790> you<00:04:20.060> throw

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
really makes sense because you throw

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.530 
really makes sense because you throw
your<00:04:20.980> rough<00:04:21.980> animation<00:04:22.250> scene<00:04:22.760> out<00:04:22.940> there<00:04:23.270> and

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
your rough animation scene out there and

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.360 
your rough animation scene out there and
some<00:04:24.020> you<00:04:24.500> know<00:04:24.590> somebody<00:04:24.889> else<00:04:24.950> might<00:04:25.250> have

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
some you know somebody else might have

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.070 
some you know somebody else might have
an<00:04:25.460> idea<00:04:25.550> of<00:04:25.790> how<00:04:26.000> to<00:04:26.030> make<00:04:26.450> that<00:04:26.630> seem<00:04:26.810> better

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
an idea of how to make that seem better

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.230 
an idea of how to make that seem better
you<00:04:27.680> know<00:04:27.800> so<00:04:28.010> I<00:04:28.280> think<00:04:28.730> it's<00:04:28.850> better<00:04:29.000> the

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
you know so I think it's better the

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.129 
you know so I think it's better the
whole<00:04:29.360> process<00:04:31.419> well<00:04:32.419> the<00:04:32.630> interview<00:04:32.930> is<00:04:32.990> over
