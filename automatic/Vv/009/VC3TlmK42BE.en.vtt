00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
it's just so happens that it's a on the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.790 
it's just so happens that it's a on the
same<00:00:35.610> level<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.940> g-unit<00:00:36.450> did<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:37.110> thought

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
same level that g-unit did I thought

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.900 
same level that g-unit did I thought
that<00:00:37.890> was<00:00:38.010> kind<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.190> funny<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.700> coincidence

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
that was kind of funny the coincidence

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.630 
that was kind of funny the coincidence
but<00:00:39.629> i<00:00:39.840> don't<00:00:40.590> know<00:00:40.620> but<00:00:41.129> i<00:00:41.190> figured<00:00:41.520> i'd<00:00:41.579> wait

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
but i don't know but i figured i'd wait

but i don't know but i figured i'd wait
out<00:00:41.850> here<00:00:41.879> because<00:00:42.329> uh<00:00:42.510> they're<00:00:43.079> probably

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
out here because uh they're probably

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.510 
out here because uh they're probably
going<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.500> rush<00:00:43.649> me<00:00:43.800> they<00:00:43.949> were<00:00:44.010> saying<00:00:44.399> that
