and<00:00:04.859> alpha<00:00:04.920> sapphire<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:05.910> this<00:00:06.450> time<00:00:06.690> we're

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
and alpha sapphire and this time we're

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:14.509 
and alpha sapphire and this time we're
going<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.230> find<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:07.560> shiny<00:00:07.770> trapinch<00:00:13.519> well

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
going to find a shiny trapinch well

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.829 
going to find a shiny trapinch well
let's<00:00:14.670> start<00:00:14.910> by<00:00:14.969> having<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.509> look<00:00:15.540> at<00:00:15.809> the

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
let's start by having a look at the

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.380 
let's start by having a look at the
pattern<00:00:16.190> trapinch<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.369> pattern<00:00:17.760> has<00:00:18.000> four

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
pattern trapinch is pattern has four

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.900 
pattern trapinch is pattern has four
tiles<00:00:18.630> in<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.109> diamond<00:00:19.320> shape<00:00:19.580> starting<00:00:20.580> at<00:00:20.730> the

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
tiles in a diamond shape starting at the

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.220 
tiles in a diamond shape starting at the
left<00:00:21.060> side<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.720> moving<00:00:22.080> in<00:00:22.170> a

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
left side and moving in a

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.740 
left side and moving in a
counterclockwise<00:00:22.380> fashion<00:00:23.150> also<00:00:24.150> trapinch

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
counterclockwise fashion also trapinch

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.710 
counterclockwise fashion also trapinch
hides<00:00:25.080> once<00:00:25.529> every<00:00:26.070> three<00:00:26.310> tiles<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:27.449> means

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
hides once every three tiles that means

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.320 
hides once every three tiles that means
only<00:00:28.050> fog<00:00:28.529> will<00:00:28.920> show<00:00:29.130> up<00:00:29.310> at<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.550> third<00:00:30.000> tile

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
only fog will show up at the third tile

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.990 
only fog will show up at the third tile
in<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.840> first<00:00:31.109> pattern<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.830> at<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.520> second

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
in the first pattern and at the second

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.540 
in the first pattern and at the second
tile<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.600> second<00:00:33.989> pattern<00:00:34.200> room<00:00:34.550> this

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
tile in the second pattern room this

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.100 
tile in the second pattern room this
pattern<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.120> unpredictable<00:00:36.930> because

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
pattern is unpredictable because

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.959 
pattern is unpredictable because
trapinch<00:00:37.649> will<00:00:37.980> show<00:00:38.190> up<00:00:38.370> either<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.760> very

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
trapinch will show up either in very

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.590 
trapinch will show up either in very
close<00:00:39.600> tiles<00:00:40.110> or<00:00:40.260> very<00:00:40.649> far<00:00:40.950> apart<00:00:41.070> tiles<00:00:41.700> so

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
close tiles or very far apart tiles so

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.540 
close tiles or very far apart tiles so
we<00:00:42.809> are<00:00:42.870> going<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.290> find<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.739> good<00:00:43.890> tile<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.399> the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
we are going to find a good tile in the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.400 
we are going to find a good tile in the
first<00:00:44.820> pattern<00:00:45.059> loop<00:00:45.360> usually<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.230> first

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
first pattern loop usually the first

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.290 
first pattern loop usually the first
tile<00:00:46.739> but<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.340> could<00:00:47.520> be<00:00:47.640> other<00:00:47.789> tiles<00:00:48.030> and

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
tile but it could be other tiles and

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.479 
tile but it could be other tiles and
then<00:00:48.780> sneak<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.379> when<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.770> shows<00:00:49.980> up<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
then sneak to it when it shows up on the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.680 
then sneak to it when it shows up on the
second<00:00:50.850> loop<00:00:52.760> notice<00:00:53.760> here<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.360> as<00:00:54.539> I

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
second loop notice here that as I

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.150 
second loop notice here that as I
approached<00:00:54.960> through<00:00:55.199> pinch<00:00:55.469> I'm<00:00:55.680> walking<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
approached through pinch I'm walking the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.819 
approached through pinch I'm walking the
second<00:00:56.579> tile<00:00:56.789> now<00:00:57.600> trapinch<00:00:58.260> will<00:00:58.469> show<00:00:58.680> up

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
second tile now trapinch will show up

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.650 
second tile now trapinch will show up
directly<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.730> third<00:00:59.940> tile<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.359> hide

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
directly on the third tile and hide

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.439 
directly on the third tile and hide
instead<00:01:01.109> at<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.590> fourth<00:01:01.890> tile<00:01:02.149> when<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.270> shows

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
instead at the fourth tile when it shows

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.420 
instead at the fourth tile when it shows
up<00:01:03.480> again<00:01:03.870> at<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.290> first<00:01:04.500> tile<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:05.010> will<00:01:05.040> still

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
up again at the first tile it will still

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.520 
up again at the first tile it will still
be<00:01:05.460> visible<00:01:06.000> but<00:01:06.570> beware<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.049> what<00:01:07.380> can

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
be visible but beware of what can

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.039 
be visible but beware of what can
Pokemon<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.159> hide<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.479> desert<00:01:09.869> we<00:01:10.020> have

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
Pokemon that hide in the desert we have

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.770 
Pokemon that hide in the desert we have
no<00:01:10.350> title<00:01:10.619> scenes<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.850> how<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.299> know<00:01:12.420> we're

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
no title scenes so how do you know we're

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.020 
no title scenes so how do you know we're
in<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.990> right<00:01:13.080> place<00:01:13.409> it's<00:01:14.250> not<00:01:14.460> easy<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.909> get

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
in the right place it's not easy to get

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.969 
in the right place it's not easy to get
it<00:01:15.150> right<00:01:15.330> at<00:01:15.450> first<00:01:15.479> but<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.200> use<00:01:16.350> some<00:01:16.590> visual

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
it right at first but I use some visual

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.460 
it right at first but I use some visual
cues<00:01:17.040> like<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.180> trainer<00:01:18.450> up<00:01:18.630> there<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.259> rock

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
cues like the trainer up there the rock

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.260 
cues like the trainer up there the rock
in<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.740> middle<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.430> slope<00:01:20.729> with<00:01:20.939> darker

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
in the middle the slope with darker

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.780 
in the middle the slope with darker
dials<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.720> one<00:01:21.900> tile<00:01:22.110> long<00:01:22.320> well<00:01:23.100> see<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
dials and one tile long well see if the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.570 
dials and one tile long well see if the
Pokemon<00:01:24.240> align<00:01:24.479> somehow<00:01:24.979> you<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.159> think<00:01:26.430> of

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
Pokemon align somehow you can think of

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.520 
Pokemon align somehow you can think of
this<00:01:26.729> as<00:01:26.790> just<00:01:27.240> making<00:01:27.659> an<00:01:27.750> L<00:01:27.869> shape<00:01:28.170> with<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
this as just making an L shape with the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:38.550 
this as just making an L shape with the
Pokemon

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.930 

these<00:01:39.560> are<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.860> hardest<00:01:40.220> tiles<00:01:40.490> from<00:01:40.670> in<00:01:40.850> the

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
these are the hardest tiles from in the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.210 
these are the hardest tiles from in the
desert<00:01:41.330> because<00:01:41.750> I<00:01:42.110> usually<00:01:42.260> can<00:01:42.680> tell<00:01:42.950> if<00:01:43.070> the

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
desert because I usually can tell if the

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.280 
desert because I usually can tell if the
pinch<00:01:43.550> is<00:01:43.790> on<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.090> lower<00:01:44.270> or<00:01:44.540> upper<00:01:44.780> part<00:01:45.200> of

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
pinch is on the lower or upper part of

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.040 
pinch is on the lower or upper part of
the<00:01:45.440> slope<00:01:45.790> I'm<00:01:46.790> always<00:01:47.090> one<00:01:47.420> tile<00:01:47.660> farther

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
the slope I'm always one tile farther

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.440 
the slope I'm always one tile farther
than<00:01:48.170> I<00:01:48.290> should<00:01:48.560> be<00:01:48.770> running<00:01:49.640> still<00:01:50.000> helps<00:01:50.300> me

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
than I should be running still helps me

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.580 
than I should be running still helps me
save<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:50.810> change<00:01:51.110> but<00:01:51.380> barely<00:01:53.530> actually<00:01:54.530> I

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
save the change but barely actually I

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.080 
save the change but barely actually I
should<00:01:54.800> have<00:01:54.830> begun<00:01:55.130> for<00:01:55.400> a<00:01:55.460> different<00:01:55.850> time

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
should have begun for a different time

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.200 
should have begun for a different time
but<00:01:56.480> I'll<00:01:56.630> show<00:01:56.840> you<00:01:56.900> that<00:01:57.080> soon<00:02:01.000> one<00:02:02.000> good

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
but I'll show you that soon one good

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.330 
but I'll show you that soon one good
perk<00:02:02.480> of<00:02:02.720> large<00:02:02.960> patterns<00:02:03.410> is<00:02:03.680> that<00:02:03.950> if<00:02:04.160> you

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
perk of large patterns is that if you

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.130 
perk of large patterns is that if you
block<00:02:04.580> one<00:02:04.910> tile<00:02:05.180> you<00:02:05.510> still<00:02:05.780> have<00:02:05.900> another

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
block one tile you still have another

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.620 
block one tile you still have another
chance<00:02:06.230> to<00:02:06.770> keep<00:02:06.920> your<00:02:07.100> chain<00:02:07.340> going<00:02:07.580> if<00:02:07.910> this

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
chance to keep your chain going if this

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.750 
chance to keep your chain going if this
were<00:02:08.810> Cacnea<00:02:09.470> or<00:02:09.649> gibble<00:02:10.130> I<00:02:10.280> would<00:02:10.670> have

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
were Cacnea or gibble I would have

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.190 
were Cacnea or gibble I would have
broken<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.210> chain<00:02:11.480> here<00:02:11.720> because<00:02:12.020> that

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
broken the chain here because that

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.800 
broken the chain here because that
pattern<00:02:12.530> is<00:02:12.740> only<00:02:13.010> two<00:02:13.160> times<00:02:13.490> I<00:02:13.820> end<00:02:14.720> up

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
pattern is only two times I end up

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:15.760 
pattern is only two times I end up
blocking<00:02:15.140> trapinch

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
blocking trapinch

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.620 
blocking trapinch
but<00:02:16.100> now<00:02:16.400> it's<00:02:16.640> still<00:02:16.820> going<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.120> show<00:02:17.330> up<00:02:17.450> in

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
but now it's still going to show up in

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.660 
but now it's still going to show up in

walk for a bit the dexnav will work

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.600
