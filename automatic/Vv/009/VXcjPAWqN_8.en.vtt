on<00:01:48.300> a<00:01:48.360> bridge<00:01:48.800> apparently<00:01:49.800> I<00:01:49.830> was<00:01:50.070> told<00:01:50.280> that

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
on a bridge apparently I was told that

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.980 
on a bridge apparently I was told that
they<00:01:50.490> nerfed<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:51.180> like<00:01:51.360> two<00:01:51.510> years<00:01:51.750> ago

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
they nerfed this like two years ago

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.260 
they nerfed this like two years ago
but<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:53.159> know<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.370> didn't<00:01:53.610> know<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.730> when<00:01:54.180> I

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
but you know I didn't know that when I

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.730 
but you know I didn't know that when I
came<00:01:54.330> back<00:01:54.510> to<00:01:54.750> play<00:01:54.840> mists<00:01:55.050> of<00:01:55.110> pandaria<00:01:55.350> this

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
came back to play mists of pandaria this

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.010 
came back to play mists of pandaria this
 worked<00:01:56.100> again<00:01:56.400> so<00:01:56.760> I<00:01:57.090> don't<00:01:57.690> know<00:01:57.840> what's

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
 worked again so I don't know what's

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.510 
 worked again so I don't know what's
going<00:01:58.230> on<00:01:58.350> with<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.620> but<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.159> might<00:01:59.340> as<00:01:59.430> well

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
going on with that but you might as well

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.250 
going on with that but you might as well
take<00:01:59.670> advantage<00:01:59.729> of<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.390> it's<00:02:00.690> the<00:02:00.810> way<00:02:00.900> I<00:02:00.930> see

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
take advantage of it it's the way I see

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
take advantage of it it's the way I see
it<00:02:01.290> at<00:02:01.440> least<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:02.520> what<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.790> do<00:02:02.940> is<00:02:04.040> you<00:02:05.040> you

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
it at least and what you do is you you

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.190 
it at least and what you do is you you
just<00:02:05.610> inch<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:06.030> little<00:02:06.240> bit<00:02:06.360> across<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.990> bridge

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
just inch a little bit across the bridge

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.449 
just inch a little bit across the bridge
to<00:02:07.350> see<00:02:07.470> what<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.650> timer<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.069> if<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.310> don't

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
to see what the timer is if you don't

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.899 
to see what the timer is if you don't
have<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.670> add-on<00:02:08.970> but<00:02:10.159> you<00:02:11.159> know<00:02:11.250> just<00:02:11.760> get

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909

invested<00:02:25.800> in<00:02:26.010> this<00:02:26.519> action<00:02:26.970> can<00:02:27.480> be<00:02:27.510> as<00:02:27.720> low<00:02:27.900> as

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
invested in this action can be as low as

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.710 
invested in this action can be as low as
like<00:02:28.170> one<00:02:28.379> minute<00:02:28.849> 200<00:02:29.849> on<00:02:29.940> in<00:02:30.150> one<00:02:30.330> minute

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
how does that sound pretty good also if

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.479 
how does that sound pretty good also if
you<00:02:34.110> if<00:02:34.349> you<00:02:34.470> lose<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.800> battle<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.130> get<00:02:35.220> some

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
you if you lose the battle you get some

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.370 
you if you lose the battle you get some
on<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:35.910> don't<00:02:36.780> actually<00:02:36.900> know<00:02:37.110> what<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.290> is

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
on it I don't actually know what it is

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.100 
on it I don't actually know what it is
because<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:38.040> haven't<00:02:38.849> really<00:02:39.000> lost<00:02:39.239> total<00:02:39.959> brat

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
because I haven't really lost total brat

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.960 
because I haven't really lost total brat
on<00:02:40.230> my<00:02:40.319> server<00:02:40.590> since<00:02:41.430> I've<00:02:41.550> been<00:02:41.640> doing<00:02:41.880> this

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
on my server since I've been doing this

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.199 
on my server since I've been doing this
I<00:02:42.930> think<00:02:43.410> it's<00:02:43.620> like<00:02:43.709> $100<00:02:44.250> but<00:02:44.580> it's<00:02:44.849> you<00:02:45.180> know

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
I think it's like $100 but it's you know

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.020 
I think it's like $100 but it's you know
even<00:02:45.540> $100<00:02:45.989> is<00:02:46.200> worth<00:02:46.410> it<00:02:46.560> in<00:02:46.620> my<00:02:46.650> opinion<00:02:47.030> the

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
even $100 is worth it in my opinion the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.630 
even $100 is worth it in my opinion the
only<00:02:48.269> issue<00:02:49.110> is<00:02:49.410> that<00:02:49.739> when<00:02:50.130> you're<00:02:50.280> trying<00:02:50.459> to

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
only issue is that when you're trying to

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.800 
only issue is that when you're trying to
run<00:02:50.760> across<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.060> bridge<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.569> didn't

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
run across the bridge and you didn't

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.170 
run across the bridge and you didn't
manage<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:52.019> get<00:02:52.200> in<00:02:52.290> told<00:02:52.440> Brad<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:52.940> told<00:02:53.940> Brad

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
manage to get in told Brad and told Brad

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.780 
manage to get in told Brad and told Brad
you're<00:02:54.810> either<00:02:54.959> going<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.410> win<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.130> or<00:02:56.310> lose<00:02:56.760> it

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
you're either going to win it or lose it

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.400 
you're either going to win it or lose it
at<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.540> time<00:02:57.840> that's<00:02:58.140> not<00:02:58.470> 15<00:02:59.040> minutes<00:03:00.079> then<00:03:01.079> you

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
at a time that's not 15 minutes then you

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.930 
at a time that's not 15 minutes then you
need<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.709> message<00:03:01.920> someone<00:03:02.220> inside<00:03:02.730> the

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
need to message someone inside the

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.180 
need to message someone inside the
battle<00:03:03.239> and<00:03:03.560> hopefully<00:03:04.560> they're<00:03:04.709> kind<00:03:04.980> enough

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
battle and hopefully they're kind enough

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.190 
battle and hopefully they're kind enough
to<00:03:05.250> let<00:03:05.519> you<00:03:05.640> know<00:03:05.760> when<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.630> battle<00:03:06.959> is<00:03:07.140> about

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
to let you know when the battle is about

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.229 
to let you know when the battle is about
to<00:03:07.349> be<00:03:07.560> lost<00:03:07.799> or<00:03:08.069> won<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:08.819> you<00:03:08.910> can<00:03:09.000> get<00:03:09.120> that

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
to be lost or won so you can get that

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.449 
to be lost or won so you can get that
 for<00:03:09.569> free<00:03:09.690> as<00:03:09.840> well<00:03:10.079> but<00:03:10.709> on<00:03:11.099> a<00:03:11.160> server

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
 for free as well but on a server

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.250 
 for free as well but on a server
like<00:03:11.549> mine<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.120> what<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:12.510> expect<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:13.019> be<00:03:13.140> on<00:03:13.230> a

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
like mine and what I expect to be on a

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.550 
like mine and what I expect to be on a
lot<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.650> other<00:03:13.980> servers<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:15.750> population<00:03:16.319> side

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
lot of other servers the population side

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.410 
lot of other servers the population side
is<00:03:16.739> like<00:03:17.220> there's<00:03:17.579> always<00:03:17.790> one<00:03:18.030> side<00:03:18.239> that's

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
is like there's always one side that's

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.870 
is like there's always one side that's
you<00:03:18.720> know<00:03:18.840> heavily<00:03:19.410> favored<00:03:19.799> and<00:03:19.950> because<00:03:20.849> of

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
you know heavily favored and because of

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.379 
you know heavily favored and because of
that<00:03:21.590> for<00:03:22.590> my<00:03:22.709> experience<00:03:23.100> told<00:03:23.430> Brad<00:03:23.670> is<00:03:23.850> is<00:03:24.060> a

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
that for my experience told Brad is is a

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.690 
that for my experience told Brad is is a
pretty<00:03:24.780> clear-cut<00:03:25.079> kind<00:03:25.620> of<00:03:25.799> way<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.340> get<00:03:26.549> on
