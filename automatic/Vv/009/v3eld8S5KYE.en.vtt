00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
described to you so that you can see it

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.410 
described to you so that you can see it
more<00:02:48.870> clearly<00:02:52.430> all<00:02:53.430> right<00:02:53.550> he<00:02:53.730> says<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.240> he

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
more clearly all right he says that he

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.220 
more clearly all right he says that he
has<00:02:54.510> seen<00:02:55.160> that<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.850> wheel<00:02:57.090> is<00:02:57.510> within<00:02:58.020> a

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
has seen that that the wheel is within a

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.080 
has seen that that the wheel is within a
wheel<00:02:58.440> so<00:02:58.800> first<00:02:59.100> we<00:02:59.310> have<00:02:59.460> a<00:02:59.730> wheel<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:02.100> then

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
wheel so first we have a wheel and then

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.570 
wheel so first we have a wheel and then
he<00:03:03.150> says<00:03:03.390> it's<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.660> wheel<00:03:03.900> within<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.470> wheel<00:03:04.580> or

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
he says it's a wheel within a wheel or

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.490 
he says it's a wheel within a wheel or
more<00:03:05.910> importantly<00:03:06.390> a<00:03:06.450> circle<00:03:06.989> within<00:03:07.350> a

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
more importantly a circle within a

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.910 
more importantly a circle within a
circle<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:08.400> then<00:03:08.970> he<00:03:09.090> says<00:03:09.390> that<00:03:09.810> when<00:03:10.770> they

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
circle and then he says that when they

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.360 
circle and then he says that when they
went<00:03:11.250> they<00:03:11.670> went<00:03:12.000> upon<00:03:12.570> their<00:03:12.840> sides<00:03:13.230> now<00:03:14.190> that

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
went they went upon their sides now that

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.460 
went they went upon their sides now that
would<00:03:14.550> be<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.820> wheel<00:03:15.030> turned<00:03:15.480> on<00:03:15.690> its<00:03:15.870> side<00:03:15.930> as

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
would be the wheel turned on its side as

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.740 
would be the wheel turned on its side as
you<00:03:16.800> would<00:03:16.920> maybe<00:03:17.100> see<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.520> a<00:03:17.670> wheel<00:03:18.030> laying<00:03:18.540> on

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
you would maybe see it a wheel laying on

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.020 
you would maybe see it a wheel laying on
the<00:03:18.840> ground<00:03:19.080> and<00:03:19.470> then<00:03:20.370> later<00:03:20.640> on<00:03:20.730> he

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
the ground and then later on he

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.880 
the ground and then later on he
describes<00:03:21.480> that<00:03:21.720> there<00:03:21.930> is<00:03:22.080> a<00:03:22.110> terrible

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
describes that there is a terrible

describes that there is a terrible
crystal<00:03:23.660> stretched<00:03:24.660> forth<00:03:25.190> over<00:03:26.330> the<00:03:27.330> living

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
crystal stretched forth over the living

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.150 
crystal stretched forth over the living
creatures<00:03:28.170> that<00:03:28.500> were<00:03:29.130> in<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:30.060> wheels<00:03:30.739> so<00:03:31.739> and

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
creatures that were in the wheels so and

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.970 
creatures that were in the wheels so and
then<00:03:32.880> he<00:03:32.970> says<00:03:33.269> it<00:03:34.170> had<00:03:34.410> eyes<00:03:34.730> round<00:03:35.730> about<00:03:36.980> now

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
then he says it had eyes round about now

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.070 
then he says it had eyes round about now
