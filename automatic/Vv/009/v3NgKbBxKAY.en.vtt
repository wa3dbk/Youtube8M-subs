paid<00:01:08.079> particular<00:01:08.409> attention<00:01:08.770> to<00:01:09.159> how<00:01:09.369> the<00:01:09.430> art

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
paid particular attention to how the art

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.160 
paid particular attention to how the art
changes<00:01:09.880> over<00:01:10.330> the<00:01:10.360> course<00:01:10.450> of<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:10.870> level

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
changes over the course of the level

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.200 
changes over the course of the level
right<00:01:11.650> now<00:01:11.800> it's<00:01:11.980> very<00:01:12.040> clean<00:01:12.610> and<00:01:12.820> well<00:01:12.970> lit

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
right now it's very clean and well lit

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.060 
right now it's very clean and well lit
and<00:01:13.270> pristine<00:01:13.900> but<00:01:14.140> as<00:01:14.290> the<00:01:14.409> battle<00:01:14.680> rages<00:01:14.860> on

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
and pristine but as the battle rages on

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.830 
and pristine but as the battle rages on
and<00:01:15.280> on<00:01:15.400> it's<00:01:16.120> going<00:01:16.210> to<00:01:16.300> get<00:01:16.450> more<00:01:16.630> and<00:01:16.810> more

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
and on it's going to get more and more

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.580 
and on it's going to get more and more
damaged<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.700> in<00:01:19.020> for<00:01:20.020> example<00:01:20.350> we<00:01:20.470> have

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
damaged so in for example we have

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.320 
damaged so in for example we have
integrated<00:01:21.310> a<00:01:21.490> lot<00:01:21.670> of<00:01:21.760> choreograph<00:01:22.210> the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
integrated a lot of choreograph the

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.270 
integrated a lot of choreograph the
winds<00:01:22.570> in<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:22.870> sandbox<00:01:23.229> experience<00:01:23.950> so<00:01:24.190> you

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
winds in the sandbox experience so you

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.550 
winds in the sandbox experience so you
have<00:01:24.640> here<00:01:24.850> for<00:01:25.030> example<00:01:25.120> the<00:01:25.690> Delian<00:01:26.320> unit

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
have here for example the Delian unit

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.469 
have here for example the Delian unit
pinner<00:01:26.920> coming<00:01:27.250> in<00:01:27.400> which<00:01:28.300> is<00:01:28.330> the

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
pinner coming in which is the

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.440 
pinner coming in which is the
choreography<00:01:29.020> itself<00:01:29.380> but<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:31.090> important

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
choreography itself but the important

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.240 
choreography itself but the important
thing<00:01:31.479> is<00:01:31.780> like<00:01:32.080> unlike<00:01:32.530> in<00:01:32.710> typical<00:01:33.040> games

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
thing is like unlike in typical games

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.830 
thing is like unlike in typical games
where<00:01:33.580> this<00:01:33.700> will<00:01:33.880> be<00:01:34.000> a<00:01:34.030> completely<00:01:34.510> new

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
where this will be a completely new

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.080 
where this will be a completely new
experience<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:36.220> player<00:01:36.520> has<00:01:36.700> a<00:01:36.729> choice<00:01:37.030> to

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
experience the player has a choice to

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.660 
experience the player has a choice to
