00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
right and it's so annoying so I look

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.960

September 19th that would be hot fixes
in<00:01:42.830> the<00:01:42.950> game<00:01:43.190> that<00:01:43.789> between<00:01:44.209> now<00:01:44.479> and<00:01:44.509> the

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
in the game that between now and the

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.050 
in the game that between now and the
time<00:01:45.050> that<00:01:45.080> patch<00:01:45.349> 4.3<00:01:46.009> releases<00:01:46.490> will<00:01:46.729> nerf

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
time that patch 4.3 releases will nerf

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.059 
time that patch 4.3 releases will nerf
the<00:01:47.270> Firelands<00:01:47.750> rates<00:01:48.080> it'll<00:01:48.619> reduce<00:01:48.770> the

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
the Firelands rates it'll reduce the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:50.290 
the Firelands rates it'll reduce the
amount<00:01:49.250> of<00:01:49.310> hit<00:01:49.459> points<00:01:49.490> as<00:01:49.880> well<00:01:50.090> as<00:01:50.179> the

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
amount of hit points as well as the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.050 
amount of hit points as well as the
amount<00:01:50.509> of<00:01:50.539> damage<00:01:50.899> that<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.140> bosses<00:01:51.380> do

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
amount of damage that the bosses do

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.309 
amount of damage that the bosses do
again<00:01:53.060> their<00:01:53.240> reasoning<00:01:53.690> for<00:01:53.810> this<00:01:53.959> is<00:01:54.170> so

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
again their reasoning for this is so

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:55.900 
again their reasoning for this is so
that<00:01:54.440> people<00:01:54.709> can<00:01:54.830> see<00:01:55.039> as<00:01:55.130> much<00:01:55.280> content<00:01:55.759> as

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
that people can see as much content as

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.169 
that people can see as much content as
possible<00:01:56.119> before<00:01:56.929> patch<00:01:57.289> 4.3<00:01:58.160> I<00:01:58.399> think<00:01:58.970> it's<00:01:59.090> a

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
possible before patch 4.3 I think it's a

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:00.790 
possible before patch 4.3 I think it's a
little<00:01:59.390> early<00:01:59.539> to<00:01:59.840> talk<00:01:59.989> about<00:02:00.050> nerfing<00:02:00.649> those

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
little early to talk about nerfing those

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.710 
little early to talk about nerfing those
raids<00:02:01.069> because<00:02:01.459> patch<00:02:01.700> 4.3<00:02:02.330> isn't<00:02:02.539> going<00:02:02.660> to

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
raids because patch 4.3 isn't going to

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.219 
raids because patch 4.3 isn't going to
be<00:02:02.810> into<00:02:03.050> like<00:02:03.520> November<00:02:04.520> but<00:02:05.380> what<00:02:06.380> do<00:02:06.440> I<00:02:06.560> know

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
be into like November but what do I know

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.749 
be into like November but what do I know

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.620 
looking for group rates and all of the
mechanics<00:03:18.900> will<00:03:19.050> be<00:03:19.140> similar<00:03:19.620> but<00:03:19.980> easier<00:03:20.630> and

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
mechanics will be similar but easier and

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.540 
mechanics will be similar but easier and
I<00:03:21.870> think<00:03:22.080> this<00:03:22.200> is<00:03:22.350> a<00:03:22.380> necessary<00:03:22.920> evil<00:03:23.010> with

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
I think this is a necessary evil with

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.860 
I think this is a necessary evil with
the<00:03:23.670> looking<00:03:23.940> for<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.120> raid<00:03:24.270> tool<00:03:24.570> because

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
the looking for a raid tool because

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.030 
the looking for a raid tool because
there<00:03:24.990> will<00:03:25.050> probably<00:03:25.230> be<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.620> lot<00:03:25.860> less

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
there will probably be a lot less

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.610 
there will probably be a lot less
communication<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:27.030> teamwork<00:03:27.390> with<00:03:28.170> a<00:03:28.200> cross

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620

realm pug you may not even be able to

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.450 
realm pug you may not even be able to
use<00:03:30.840> like<00:03:31.080> I<00:03:31.200> mean<00:03:31.410> if<00:03:31.560> nobody<00:03:31.830> has<00:03:31.950> event<00:03:32.250> you

use like I mean if nobody has event you

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.520 
use like I mean if nobody has event you
might<00:03:32.640> not<00:03:32.790> even<00:03:32.940> be<00:03:33.150> in<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.780> sort<00:03:34.290> of<00:03:34.320> like

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530

you<00:03:34.650> can<00:03:34.800> talk<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.190> each<00:03:35.280> other<00:03:35.430> situation<00:03:36.180> so

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
you can talk to each other situation so

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.360 
you can talk to each other situation so
I<00:03:36.750> do<00:03:36.990> think<00:03:37.440> it's<00:03:37.560> necessary<00:03:38.100> for<00:03:38.160> them<00:03:38.340> to

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
I do think it's necessary for them to

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.900 
I do think it's necessary for them to
make<00:03:38.550> it<00:03:38.580> easier<00:03:38.820> I<00:03:39.210> just<00:03:39.600> hope<00:03:39.720> it's<00:03:39.930> not<00:03:40.020> like

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
make it easier I just hope it's not like

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.640 
make it easier I just hope it's not like
stupid<00:03:41.910> easy

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
stupid easy

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.990 
stupid easy
another<00:03:43.650> thing<00:03:43.890> that<00:03:43.920> dev<00:03:44.250> said<00:03:44.550> this<00:03:44.760> week

another thing that dev said this week
was<00:03:45.240> that<00:03:45.270> we<00:03:45.660> would<00:03:45.870> be<00:03:45.990> hearing<00:03:46.410> more<00:03:46.590> about

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
was that we would be hearing more about

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.590 
was that we would be hearing more about
pandas<00:03:47.220> at<00:03:47.340> Blizzcon<00:03:47.820> and<00:03:48.030> being<00:03:48.240> that<00:03:48.450> they

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
pandas at Blizzcon and being that they

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.750 
pandas at Blizzcon and being that they

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
it I know I had said in previous videos

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.060 
it I know I had said in previous videos
that<00:03:57.690> I<00:03:57.840> was<00:03:57.960> really<00:03:58.140> against<00:03:58.470> pandas<00:03:58.800> in<00:03:58.950> WoW

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
that I was really against pandas in WoW

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.860 
that I was really against pandas in WoW
but<00:03:59.640> what<00:03:59.790> I<00:03:59.820> really<00:04:00.120> meant<00:04:00.390> was<00:04:00.540> that<00:04:00.690> I'm

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
but what I really meant was that I'm

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.840 
but what I really meant was that I'm
against<00:04:01.230> pandas<00:04:01.650> as<00:04:01.860> playable<00:04:02.280> characters<00:04:02.820> in
