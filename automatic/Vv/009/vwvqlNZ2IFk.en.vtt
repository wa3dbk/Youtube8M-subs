00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
why I figured out like logically what

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.890 
why I figured out like logically what
was<00:04:16.549> going<00:04:16.789> on<00:04:16.880> with<00:04:17.060> her<00:04:17.120> you<00:04:17.359> know<00:04:17.419> like<00:04:17.690> I'm

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
was going on with her you know like I'm

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.539 
was going on with her you know like I'm
not<00:04:18.229> sure<00:04:18.409> if<00:04:18.470> that's<00:04:18.560> verbatim<00:04:18.830> what's<00:04:19.310> going

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
not sure if that's verbatim what's going

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:20.539 
not sure if that's verbatim what's going
on<00:04:19.669> with<00:04:19.820> her<00:04:19.940> you<00:04:20.030> know<00:04:20.090> but

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
on with her you know but

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.260 
on with her you know but
and<00:04:21.560> an<00:04:22.560> educated<00:04:23.280> guess<00:04:23.490> what<00:04:23.789> was<00:04:23.909> going<00:04:24.180> on

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
and an educated guess what was going on

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.960 
and an educated guess what was going on
and<00:04:24.330> it<00:04:24.569> makes<00:04:24.750> sense<00:04:24.990> you<00:04:25.199> know<00:04:25.639> that<00:04:26.639> someone

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
and it makes sense you know that someone

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.369 
and it makes sense you know that someone
would<00:04:27.090> be<00:04:27.240> struggling<00:04:27.690> like<00:04:27.840> that<00:04:27.900> and<00:04:28.110> then

00:04:28.369 --> 00:04:28.379 
would be struggling like that and then

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:30.230 
would be struggling like that and then
want<00:04:28.620> to<00:04:28.770> project<00:04:28.979> it<00:04:29.460> you<00:04:29.819> know<00:04:29.940> and<00:04:30.120> be

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
want to project it you know and be

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.270 
want to project it you know and be
negative<00:04:30.690> it<00:04:31.050> doesn't<00:04:31.470> mean<00:04:31.560> it's<00:04:31.740> right<00:04:31.889> but

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
negative it doesn't mean it's right but

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.790 
negative it doesn't mean it's right but
it<00:04:32.400> makes<00:04:32.580> sense<00:04:33.199> so<00:04:34.199> feel<00:04:34.379> like<00:04:34.500> that's<00:04:34.650> what

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
it makes sense so feel like that's what

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.320 
it makes sense so feel like that's what
you<00:04:34.860> need<00:04:35.009> to<00:04:35.039> teach<00:04:35.310> students<00:04:35.789> you<00:04:36.030> know<00:04:36.150> that
