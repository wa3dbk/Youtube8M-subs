00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 is the analysis no more an analysis 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:07.350
 small do not touch or good defender I think 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.630
 that was well defensively and 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.950
 indeed we believe that no 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.890
 we were clear in attack 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.439
 but there was a lot of game association and 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.210
 later I think defensively we gave 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.800
 some sales and they lent a little 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.570
 liar prof results so 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.790
 did in the first time not you 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.770
 they also had to tip to convert in 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.450
 the first time more part lasts 90 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.730
 minutes always so in that sense 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.500
 I think we had to be much more 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.300
 constant in it especially in the second 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.730
 part of the lime they spend they pass the phase of 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.710
 It is not easy for us to take 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.030
 because we have a good team in front 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.980
 but it's all very let's see 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.070
 all the necessary effort and all the 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.600
 necessary work to be able to achieve 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.730
 last profe and melgar made four goals 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.710
 in Peru I needed five of you 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.510
 they need three for the penalties the uv 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.820
 he has scored four goals in Lima 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.649
 I can not enter anything only what 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.100
 inside what one has to think 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.739
 always in this is 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.729
 I wanted to do everything possible by up 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.950
 the end to achieve the classification that 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.940
 is what I should should always not leave 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.470
 inside the court 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.230
 logically within all the 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:21.310
 circumstances that occur then do it 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.920
 well always always look for the 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.740
 situations that 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.330
 that are in favor our advantage to 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.450
 take advantage of those that after 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.210
 everyone is helping each other from the start 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.420
 because that sense the only thing one should 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.320
 thinking is from the beginning of the first 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.330
 minute look in some way to be 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.940
 changing the result how are your 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.740
 pro players at that time 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.500
 thanks there is the technical director of
