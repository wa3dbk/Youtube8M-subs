00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.210
 hello everyone my name is Stas and today im 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.150
 I decided to talk about how to change 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.620
 the film on your ipad means something first 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.730
 that he will need what I use 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.009
 it's usually 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.199
 naturally liquid and of course 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.630
 microfiber in some films it goes to 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.250
 bundled means but in this case here 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.289
 so here's the blue to pay attention that is 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.150
 she leaves villus so i'm her 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.060
 generally do not use I have 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.789
 already tomoya which i am and to which i am very 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.710
 got used actually with time from experience 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.930
 you can do this even with a regular towel 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.120
 As for the skin, I personally use 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.760
 ordinary water again because 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.559
 already, too, with time to have learned and all 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.140
 do it means if you have fat 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.239
 screen or dirty you just pshikat 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.559
 wipe absolutely any surface 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.510
 yes that is, but in this case I 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.270
 I use this cloth that was in 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.360
 set after which I throw out further 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.489
 I wipe dry to me 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.170
 there were no villi left 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.870
 preferably at this moment 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.510
 so what do you say when you're glue 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.030
 Yes, did not use the open next to the window 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.340
 either there to you someone ran around 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.170
 or walked or breathed or something else but 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.360
 But of course you must 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.550
 make completely sterile 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.550
 room to the exact place where you will be 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.220
 do it well and of course you when 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.740
 wipe absolutely everything further 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.230
 proceed to stick to the film 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.150
 As for the film matte or 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.790
 glossy sli it will be interesting i did 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.370
 separate video about which film is better 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.060
 total glue means as in the case of 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:38.670
 ipad such cases with iphone you 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.710
 there should be such a sticker 1 and 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.000
 sticker 2 you more in 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.940
 ninety percent of cases 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.009
 their loan is correct i mean deuce it 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.590
 the fact that we shoot the second time edinichka 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.259
 this is what we shoot first on reading 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.290
 before her and such pads with iPhones, I 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.890
 always glue the film just under the keys 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.619
 home 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.290
 that is, from this key raincoat home 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:05.509
 yes and let's say so therefore here on the very 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:08.489
 really just you will need to select the 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.800
 the way that you will be less 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.020
 convenient if you have any 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.410
 villi yes i have created a case like u 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.600
 me since 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.030
 of course we are in a room at 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.050
 I am lit the camera light and the whole thing 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.890
 sticking here i will show you 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.690
 Naturally yes I think that I am now 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.590
 it will be I show you how to remove 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.950
 these villi 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.530
 so I always unstick from here starting 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.500
 bottom because for me the home key 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.200
 more important it seems to me that it should fall 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.530
 from here and we start to glue on 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.110
 someone in this case I will do it 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.430
 something like this 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.810
 look look 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.580
 plus or minus it goes with me so exactly 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.470
 if that's actually the case 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.330
 the situation when here already begins 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.210
 go then I understand that in the corner 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.600
 here I will have it too later 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:12.040
 creep so I lift it up and 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:14.920
 I turn a little about how 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.990
 so on after that of course you 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.530
 You can immediately remove these big ones 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.750
 bubbles 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.870
 don't be afraid about them 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:29.550
 nothing appeared with them you their 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.550
 You can remove it very nicely 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.320
 mean for beginners that is those who 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.050
 The first time they glue or there, well, let's say 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.110
 I don't recommend much experience yet 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.420
 output bubbles with exactly 2 this one 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.880
 here is the strap yes that is with the second part 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.160
 film because you otherwise just 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.989
 scratch the film itself originally 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.989
 before you use it yourself 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.239
 my foam on the choice of film which is better 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:59.260
 what's worse here is also difficult to answer 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.940
 because basically the Chinese are already just 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.489
 over the years of practice yes that is, we understand 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.680
 which suppliers to work with 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.230
 which films to buy therefore here 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.300
 the more expensive the film of course the better 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.000
 Here we really are not always so 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.190
 now i'm filming the second part of the tape she 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.340
 we no longer need us too we can rivers 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:22.450
 give and see my situation is what 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:25.790
 one . 2 I think he's not well here 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.700
 you can remove it means I got dust 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.560
 here here and here now for you 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.650
 tell you what to do for 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.720
 to remove this dust means again 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.610
 I got the same while I was working 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.600
 a huge number of such here any 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:44.630
 stickers remax and by the way are very good 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.280
 films with a jeep too and so on you 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.160
 can use ordinary scotch i 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.930
 I think that I probably will show exactly 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.780
 this example yes so that you do not 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:05:03.200
 thought everyone was very sad all very 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:05.630
 difficult means those who can not work 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.810
 do not worry about scotch 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.090
 mean most important yes it is his park whether 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.460
 in order to climb up 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.670
 second part 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:19.070
 Scotch I recommend to do this 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.780
 here is the way here and so fold it up for 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.700
 order to get something like 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:27.280
 spoon then you will be easier to manage 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:33.110
 this scotch further after we 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:38.510
 lift up this thing we just 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:40.820
 slips under the bottom and squeeze it 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.150
 we all removed this point further exactly 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.150
 in the same way yes you do everything 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.150
 rest 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:55.650
 great did everything raise scotch 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:58.439
 By the way, you can absolutely not limited 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:01.139
 number of times the main thing is to when 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:02.729
 raised for not settled new dust but 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:06.870
 again, yes, in exactly the same way 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:10.199
 you can remove it so here we have everything 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:13.949
 here too here too 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:15.539
 Well, and here, in principle, on this all 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:17.669
 that is, you can see the dates I 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:19.650
 unenviable you or not seen in the islands 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:22.080
 acids of this wolf pictures yes we are 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.229
 Of course we remove them but in general the film 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.229
 give her very, very much 

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:30.120
 beautiful as for the button here 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:32.610
 sometimes divorces mean you 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.530
 I will try to show but the light is not enviable 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.449
 minivan not seen here are such tidy 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.250
 in fact if you just press it down 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:40.650
 finger slightly and gently for 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:43.660
 not to crush your glass 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:46.480
 it turns out and everything gets on 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:49.900
 instead of your now if you want to know how 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.490
 stick on the back of the ipad here 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.270
 it will be interesting to you there 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:56.470
 other films they are glued with water 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.880
 which do not wipe very much if there will be 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.340
 interesting to leave in the comments I'm with 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.870
