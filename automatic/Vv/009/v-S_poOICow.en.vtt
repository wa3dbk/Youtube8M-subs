stay<00:01:44.070> there<00:01:44.100> there's<00:01:44.490> no<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.970> know<00:01:45.090> case<00:01:45.750> for

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
stay there there's no you know case for

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.679 
stay there there's no you know case for
or<00:01:46.259> anything<00:01:46.439> now<00:01:47.340> but<00:01:47.700> also<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.360> other<00:01:48.570> thing

or anything now but also the other thing

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.550 
or anything now but also the other thing
which<00:01:49.560> got<00:01:49.860> me<00:01:49.890> thinking<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:51.270> know<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:52.350> was

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
which got me thinking is you know it was

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.520 
which got me thinking is you know it was
Logitech<00:01:53.159> who<00:01:53.310> first<00:01:53.640> went<00:01:53.880> from<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.600> old<00:01:54.869> you

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
Logitech who first went from the old you

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.310 
Logitech who first went from the old you
know<00:01:55.680> USB<00:01:56.250> dongles<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.509> old<00:01:57.689> unifying

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
know USB dongles to the old unifying

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.710 
know USB dongles to the old unifying
ones<00:01:58.619> which<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.340> think<00:01:59.759> Microsoft<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.570> going

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
ones which I think Microsoft is going

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.830 
ones which I think Microsoft is going
down<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.170> path<00:02:01.229> also<00:02:01.970> now<00:02:02.970> they<00:02:03.299> work<00:02:03.540> there

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
down that path also now they work there

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.469 
down that path also now they work there
pretty<00:02:03.990> simple<00:02:04.470> but<00:02:05.159> they're<00:02:05.579> easy<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:06.180> also

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
it was backlit now I know if it was

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.330 
it was backlit now I know if it was
backlit<00:04:16.140> it<00:04:16.410> would<00:04:16.590> have<00:04:16.739> raised<00:04:16.890> the<00:04:16.919> price

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340

you<00:04:17.790> know<00:04:17.970> maybe<00:04:18.660> another<00:04:19.169> $20<00:04:19.919> $30<00:04:20.489> more<00:04:20.760> but

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
you know maybe another $20 $30 more but

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.390 
you know maybe another $20 $30 more but
it's<00:04:21.540> something<00:04:21.840> that<00:04:22.049> I<00:04:22.380> think<00:04:22.530> this

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
it's something that I think this

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.700 
it's something that I think this
keyboard<00:04:24.030> would<00:04:24.210> stand<00:04:24.660> out<00:04:24.840> with<00:04:25.050> you<00:04:25.590> know

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
keyboard would stand out with you know

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.529 
keyboard would stand out with you know
having<00:04:25.919> a<00:04:26.160> backlit<00:04:26.520> keyboard<00:04:26.760> and<00:04:27.120> something

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
having a backlit keyboard and something

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.170 
having a backlit keyboard and something
this<00:04:27.750> more<00:04:28.280> obviously<00:04:29.280> you<00:04:29.640> know<00:04:29.760> it<00:04:29.940> will<00:04:30.030> use

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
this more obviously you know it will use

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.830 
this more obviously you know it will use
a<00:04:30.210> lot<00:04:30.330> of<00:04:30.510> power<00:04:30.750> but

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
a lot of power but

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.110 
a lot of power but
I<00:04:31.889> think<00:04:32.889> it'd<00:04:32.980> look<00:04:33.010> great<00:04:33.250> what<00:04:33.880> don't<00:04:34.060> you

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
think then let's just pull off first

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.879 
think then let's just pull off first
