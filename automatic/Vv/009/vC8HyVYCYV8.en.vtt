hey<00:00:00.480> guys<00:00:00.719> Rick<00:00:01.020> the<00:00:01.140> electronics<00:00:01.680> guy<00:00:01.860> back

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
hey guys Rick the electronics guy back

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.110 
hey guys Rick the electronics guy back
again<00:00:02.460> now<00:00:03.000> that<00:00:03.799> I<00:00:04.799> do<00:00:04.950> have<00:00:05.339> a<00:00:05.460> working<00:00:05.879> hard

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
again now that I do have a working hard

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.330 
again now that I do have a working hard
drive<00:00:06.359> now<00:00:06.600> that<00:00:06.810> you<00:00:06.899> can<00:00:07.020> see<00:00:07.049> so<00:00:07.710> we<00:00:08.220> will

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
drive now that you can see so we will

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.570 
drive now that you can see so we will
make<00:00:08.550> that<00:00:09.080> not<00:00:10.080> our<00:00:10.320> boot<00:00:10.620> priority<00:00:10.860> we<00:00:11.370> want

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
make that not our boot priority we want

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.640 
make that not our boot priority we want
to<00:00:11.670> make<00:00:11.790> our<00:00:11.969> cd-rom<00:00:12.540> always<00:00:13.110> our<00:00:13.349> boot

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
to make our cd-rom always our boot

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.099 
to make our cd-rom always our boot
priority<00:00:14.089> and<00:00:15.089> i'm<00:00:15.389> going<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.690> set<00:00:15.900> this<00:00:16.049> up

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
priority and i'm going to set this up

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.760 
priority and i'm going to set this up
too<00:00:16.470> fast<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:17.270> then<00:00:18.270> also<00:00:18.930> going<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.590> come

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
too fast and then also going to come

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.740 
too fast and then also going to come
over<00:00:19.859> here<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.400> go<00:00:20.640> into<00:00:21.180> advanced<00:00:21.840> mode<00:00:22.310> and

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
over here and go into advanced mode and

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.500 
over here and go into advanced mode and
hit<00:00:24.750> okay<00:00:25.140> because<00:00:25.710> there's<00:00:26.699> always<00:00:27.150> some

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
hit okay because there's always some

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.410 
hit okay because there's always some
features<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:27.960> you'll<00:00:28.320> want<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.650> change<00:00:29.420> to

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
features that you'll want to change to

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.910 
features that you'll want to change to
make<00:00:31.410> your<00:00:31.679> system<00:00:32.099> better<00:00:33.469> right<00:00:34.469> now<00:00:34.680> we're

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
make your system better right now we're

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.850 
make your system better right now we're
reading<00:00:35.309> 32<00:00:35.760> gigs<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.180> ram<00:00:36.420> ddr3<00:00:37.170> 1600

megahertz<00:00:38.250> which<00:00:38.700> i<00:00:39.390> was<00:00:39.510> supposed<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.989> have

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
megahertz which i was supposed to have

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.470 
megahertz which i was supposed to have
1833<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.489> they<00:00:41.610> gave<00:00:41.730> me<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.910> wrong<00:00:42.059> memory

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
1833 so they gave me the wrong memory

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.200 
1833 so they gave me the wrong memory
now<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.260> see<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:44.270> but<00:00:45.270> anyways<00:00:45.780> our<00:00:47.210> CPU

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
now that I see that but anyways our CPU

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.709 
now that I see that but anyways our CPU
is<00:00:48.450> said<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.739> before<00:00:49.739> gigahertz<00:00:50.300> we<00:00:51.300> can<00:00:51.510> run

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
is said that before gigahertz we can run

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.930 
is said that before gigahertz we can run
it<00:00:51.840> between<00:00:52.140> four<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.469> 4.2<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.399> be<00:00:53.489> safe<00:00:53.699> on

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
it between four and 4.2 to be safe on

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.270 
it between four and 4.2 to be safe on
the<00:00:54.059> safe<00:00:54.239> side<00:00:54.379> I'll<00:00:55.379> just<00:00:55.649> leave<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.890> as<00:00:56.129> it

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
the safe side I'll just leave it as it

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.380 
the safe side I'll just leave it as it
is<00:00:56.370> because<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.699> doesn't<00:00:57.059> need<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.180> be<00:00:57.300> any

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
is because it doesn't need to be any

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.410 
is because it doesn't need to be any
faster<00:00:58.280> you're<00:00:59.280> not<00:00:59.430> going<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.699> notice<00:00:59.850> 200

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
faster you're not going to notice 200

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.479 
faster you're not going to notice 200
megahertz<00:01:00.629> anymore<00:01:01.170> anyways<00:01:03.860> and<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.070> mean<00:01:05.280> I

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
megahertz anymore anyways and I mean I

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.719 
megahertz anymore anyways and I mean I
can<00:01:06.180> manually<00:01:06.570> overclock<00:01:07.170> if<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.500> want<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.950> my

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
can manually overclock if I want I my

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.730 
can manually overclock if I want I my
cpu<00:01:09.510> ratio<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.320> at<00:01:10.590> auto<00:01:10.860> right<00:01:11.189> now<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:12.740> I

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
cpu ratio is at auto right now and I

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.100 
cpu ratio is at auto right now and I
mean<00:01:14.430> everything<00:01:14.700> set<00:01:15.060> at<00:01:15.210> auto<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.990> it

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
mean everything set at auto so that it

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.179 
mean everything set at auto so that it
runs<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.799> way<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.009> needs<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.310> run<00:01:18.799> now<00:01:19.799> when<00:01:20.070> we

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
runs the way it needs to run now when we

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.580 
runs the way it needs to run now when we
come<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.520> here<00:01:20.840> this<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.020> our<00:01:22.170> CPU

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
come in here this is our CPU

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.210 
come in here this is our CPU
configuration<00:01:23.869> cool<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.020> quiet<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:25.950> want<00:01:26.159> it

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
USB configurations but most of the time

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.030 
USB configurations but most of the time
everything's<00:03:02.569> already<00:03:02.870> enabled<00:03:03.139> for<00:03:03.620> you<00:03:03.769> and

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040

your core functions on auto so you're

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.819 
your core functions on auto so you're

good and then this is just monitoring

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.490 
good and then this is just monitoring
what<00:03:13.099> your<00:03:13.220> temperatures<00:03:13.669> would<00:03:13.849> be<00:03:14.060> at<00:03:14.540> rpms

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
what your temperatures would be at rpms

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.949 
what your temperatures would be at rpms
and<00:03:15.949> every<00:03:16.519> other<00:03:16.579> option<00:03:17.329> that<00:03:17.479> you<00:03:17.510> have<00:03:17.690> and

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
be in mind that every operating system

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.379 
be in mind that every operating system
and<00:03:20.629> bio<00:03:20.900> sizzle<00:03:21.500> is<00:03:21.650> a<00:03:21.709> little<00:03:22.159> different<00:03:22.639> so

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
and bio sizzle is a little different so

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.390 
and bio sizzle is a little different so
everything<00:03:24.199> you<00:03:24.470> do<00:03:24.650> is<00:03:24.979> going<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.310> be

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
everything you do is going to be

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.740 
everything you do is going to be
different<00:03:25.579> but<00:03:25.879> most<00:03:26.120> of<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:26.329> time<00:03:26.510> if<00:03:26.659> you

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
different but most of the time if you

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.899 
different but most of the time if you
buy<00:03:26.900> a<00:03:26.930> good<00:03:27.290> asus<00:03:27.799> board<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:28.340> biases<00:03:28.879> are

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:28.909 
buy a good asus board the biases are

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.300 
buy a good asus board the biases are
