this call of duty I to me it was before
I<00:00:53.489> think<00:00:53.879> they've<00:00:54.120> patched<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.780> mp40<00:00:55.500> and

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
I think they've patched the mp40 and

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.430 
I think they've patched the mp40 and
then<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.640> noticed<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.840> now<00:00:58.109> like

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
then I noticed that that that now like

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.979 
then I noticed that that that now like
maybe<00:00:59.100> I'm<00:00:59.460> wrong<00:00:59.789> but<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.270> Thompson<00:01:00.719> seems

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
maybe I'm wrong but the Thompson seems

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.490 
maybe I'm wrong but the Thompson seems
like<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.170> better<00:01:01.350> gun<00:01:01.649> than<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.980> mp40<00:01:03.409> but<00:01:04.409> at

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
like a better gun than the mp40 but at

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.170 
like a better gun than the mp40 but at
the<00:01:04.589> time<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.949> mp40<00:01:05.400> with<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> silence<00:01:06.060> here

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
the time the mp40 with the silence here

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.100 
the time the mp40 with the silence here
was<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.600> better<00:01:06.720> weapon<00:01:07.729> and<00:01:08.930> some<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.049> the

you<00:01:35.970> know<00:01:36.090> we<00:01:36.240> didn't<00:01:36.479> start<00:01:36.659> seeing<00:01:36.930> even<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
can see probably why the developers

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.609

haven't<00:01:44.939> really<00:01:45.360> figured<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:46.140> out<00:01:46.290> because

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
haven't really figured this out because

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.429 
haven't really figured this out because
it's<00:01:47.189> just<00:01:47.460> out<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.479> last<00:01:48.990> four<00:01:49.290> or<00:01:49.409> five

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
games me going back and playing them I

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.789 
games me going back and playing them I
realized<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:54.869> community<00:01:55.409> didn't

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
realized that the community didn't

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.120

wasn't<00:04:13.380> fixed<00:04:13.950> and<00:04:14.099> the<00:04:14.790> most<00:04:14.970> important

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
wasn't fixed and the most important

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.440 
wasn't fixed and the most important

thing<00:04:18.570> that<00:04:18.720> stood<00:04:18.870> out<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.049> me<00:04:19.200> was<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.620> fact

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
thing that stood out to me was the fact

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.770 
thing that stood out to me was the fact
that<00:04:21.800> called<00:04:22.800> 84<00:04:23.370> and<00:04:24.060> you<00:04:24.479> could<00:04:24.659> tell

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
that called 84 and you could tell

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.890 
that called 84 and you could tell
there's<00:04:25.020> some<00:04:25.140> animosity

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
there's some animosity

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.999 
there's some animosity
and<00:04:26.169> that<00:04:26.770> was<00:04:26.919> because<00:04:27.600> you<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:29.080> sound<00:04:29.470> was

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009

running it sounds like your own

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.980 
running it sounds like your own
footsteps<00:04:53.949> so<00:04:54.430> you<00:04:54.490> get<00:04:54.759> confused<00:04:55.270> and<00:04:55.419> and

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
footsteps so you get confused and and

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.170

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.969 
still haven't gotten the sound right but
I<00:05:10.000> mean<00:05:10.150> as<00:05:10.300> far<00:05:10.479> as<00:05:10.630> like<00:05:10.810> the<00:05:11.590> rest<00:05:11.770> of<00:05:11.889> the

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
I mean as far as like the rest of the

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.800 
I mean as far as like the rest of the
rest<00:05:12.520> of<00:05:12.639> mechanics<00:05:13.120> in<00:05:13.270> the<00:05:13.360> game<00:05:13.539> we're

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
rest of mechanics in the game we're

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.080 
rest of mechanics in the game we're
talking<00:05:14.139> like<00:05:14.289> I'm<00:05:14.949> standing<00:05:15.190> the<00:05:15.460> prone<00:05:15.760> I

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
talking like I'm standing the prone I

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.909 
talking like I'm standing the prone I
mean<00:05:16.300> is<00:05:16.449> still<00:05:16.720> there's<00:05:17.020> turning<00:05:17.620> on<00:05:17.800> your

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
mean is still there's turning on your

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.460 
mean is still there's turning on your
stomach<00:05:18.310> one<00:05:18.940> shot<00:05:19.270> kills<00:05:19.539> I<00:05:19.750> think<00:05:20.349> the

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
stomach one shot kills I think the

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.900 
stomach one shot kills I think the
streaks<00:05:20.770> are<00:05:20.889> pretty<00:05:21.099> low<00:05:21.280> enough<00:05:21.550> in<00:05:21.760> this

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
streaks are pretty low enough in this

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.670 
streaks are pretty low enough in this
game<00:05:22.120> I<00:05:22.270> mean<00:05:22.389> the<00:05:22.539> map<00:05:22.750> design<00:05:22.960> wasn't<00:05:23.500> here

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
game I mean the map design wasn't here

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.499 
game I mean the map design wasn't here
yet<00:05:23.889> I<00:05:24.099> mean<00:05:24.310> let's<00:05:24.789> be<00:05:24.910> honest<00:05:25.240> the<00:05:25.330> map

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:25.509 
yet I mean let's be honest the map

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:29.460 
yet I mean let's be honest the map
design<00:05:25.780> was<00:05:26.199> just<00:05:27.449> coming<00:05:28.449> into<00:05:28.720> its<00:05:29.080> own<00:05:29.229> with

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
design was just coming into its own with

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.800 
design was just coming into its own with
Trekkies<00:05:29.949> you<00:05:30.340> kind<00:05:30.610> of<00:05:30.699> start<00:05:30.970> to<00:05:31.060> see<00:05:31.240> but

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
Trekkies you kind of start to see but

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.900 
Trekkies you kind of start to see but
they<00:05:31.930> started<00:05:32.320> to<00:05:32.380> draw<00:05:32.650> design<00:05:33.250> get<00:05:33.789> it

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
they started to draw design get it

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.500 
they started to draw design get it
identity<00:05:34.510> for<00:05:34.900> themselves<00:05:35.020> and<00:05:36.000> but<00:05:37.000> you<00:05:37.389> know

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
identity for themselves and but you know

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.089 
identity for themselves and but you know
still<00:05:37.570> have<00:05:37.930> vehicle<00:05:38.380> so<00:05:38.410> you<00:05:38.620> still<00:05:38.860> had<00:05:39.010> to

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:39.099 
still have vehicle so you still had to

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:41.159 
still have vehicle so you still had to
account<00:05:39.310> for<00:05:39.430> those<00:05:39.639> things<00:05:39.940> and<00:05:40.210> I<00:05:40.599> mean<00:05:41.050> this

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
account for those things and I mean this

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:44.070 
account for those things and I mean this
is<00:05:41.229> when<00:05:41.560> sniper<00:05:42.280> rifles<00:05:42.880> were<00:05:43.750> still

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
is when sniper rifles were still

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.409 
is when sniper rifles were still
important<00:05:44.680> because<00:05:44.770> of<00:05:45.070> the<00:05:45.159> long<00:05:45.729> you<00:05:46.300> know

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
important because of the long you know

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:48.870 
important because of the long you know
how<00:05:46.570> long<00:05:46.780> the<00:05:46.930> maps<00:05:47.139> were<00:05:47.380> and<00:05:47.650> I<00:05:48.460> think<00:05:48.729> now

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
how long the maps were and I think now

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.180 
how long the maps were and I think now
where<00:05:49.150> we're<00:05:49.300> at<00:05:49.330> with<00:05:49.659> black<00:05:49.930> ops<00:05:50.139> 2<00:05:50.409> is<00:05:50.710> the

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
where we're at with black ops 2 is the

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.550 
where we're at with black ops 2 is the
fact<00:05:51.430> that<00:05:51.550> the<00:05:51.760> the<00:05:52.090> weapons<00:05:52.599> are<00:05:52.960> not

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
fact that the the weapons are not

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.439 
fact that the the weapons are not
balanced<00:05:54.099> comparative<00:05:54.760> to<00:05:54.880> the<00:05:54.970> maps<00:05:55.150> of<00:05:55.270> maps

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
balanced comparative to the maps of maps

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:57.750 
balanced comparative to the maps of maps
are<00:05:55.570> so<00:05:55.720> small<00:05:56.020> and<00:05:56.349> now<00:05:56.770> listen<00:05:57.130> I<00:05:57.250> asked<00:05:57.550> for

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
are so small and now listen I asked for

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.339 
are so small and now listen I asked for
small<00:05:58.030> maps<00:05:58.240> I'd<00:05:58.419> rather<00:05:58.599> have<00:05:58.810> action<00:05:59.229> and

00:05:59.339 --> 00:05:59.349 
small maps I'd rather have action and

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:01.469 
small maps I'd rather have action and
stuff<00:05:59.530> like<00:05:59.680> that<00:05:59.740> but<00:06:00.130> then<00:06:00.699> that<00:06:01.270> is

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 
stuff like that but then that is

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:04.320 
stuff like that but then that is
conducive<00:06:02.080> to<00:06:02.349> assault<00:06:02.830> rifles<00:06:03.130> and<00:06:03.280> SMGs<00:06:03.820> not

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
conducive to assault rifles and SMGs not

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.779 
conducive to assault rifles and SMGs not
sniper<00:06:04.900> rifle<00:06:05.349> one-shot<00:06:05.800> kills<00:06:06.070> and<00:06:06.280> that's

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:06.789 
sniper rifle one-shot kills and that's

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:08.939 
sniper rifle one-shot kills and that's
where<00:06:07.030> we're<00:06:07.240> at<00:06:07.270> a<00:06:07.389> crossroad<00:06:07.960> right<00:06:08.169> now<00:06:08.320> so

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:08.949 
where we're at a crossroad right now so

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:10.469 
where we're at a crossroad right now so
