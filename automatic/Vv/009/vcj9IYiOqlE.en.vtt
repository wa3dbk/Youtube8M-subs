00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:08.970
 hello modern smartphones 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.370
 far superior to portable 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.889
 game consoles for a number of parameters in 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.750
 including technical specifications 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.550
 availability and most importantly by the number of games 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.279
 besides smartphones are much more popular 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.439
 but unlike consoles I have 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.330
 set of physical controls 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.369
 which many gamers like 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.560
 however, you can always find more profitable 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.779
 solution that will save the user from 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.610
 need to buy two devices and 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.100
 allows you to conveniently play your favorite 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.110
 games are one of the similar gaming solutions 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.579
 powershell logger controller on 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.579
 which we'll see today 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.430
 Moscow 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.790
 I'll start with the logic power shell characteristics 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.530
 has a non-removable battery capacity 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.239
 1500 milliampere hours 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.720
 the dimensions of this device is 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.910
 200 on 63 and on 21 millimeter weight of all 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.260
 merely 120 grams to lay down so I raise 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.810
 will support devices on which 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.430
 installed ios 7 and above and will 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.100
 compatible with devices such as 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.050
 iphone 5 iphone 5 with ipod touch fifth 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.700
 generation except the controller in the box 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.290
 buyers will get a cable for it 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.570
 charging flexible connection adapter 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.550
 headset special backing for 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.460
 fifth generation ipod touch connectivity 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.290
 and user documentation substrate for 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.450
 ipod touch fifth generation needed 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.080
 because it is much thinner than the iphone 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.240
 five 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.250
 That's how it came out used tough 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.530
 not collapsible design which 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.790
 eliminates the possibility of squeaks and backlash but 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.760
 and does not allow compact folded 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.320
 controller when not in use 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.420
 front panel controller made from 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.910
 plastic here is the back cover device 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.830
 made of textured ribbed rubber 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.160
 which does not allow the gadget to slide in 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.390
 hands 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.220
 for comfort on the back 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.080
 powershell provides small 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.000
 protrusions despite playing 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.500
 purpose of the controller of managers 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.509
 elements on it was not very 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.850
 many cross joystick and button 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:10.300
 power on the left side four buttons 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.910
 xyab and pause button on the right side 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.400
 and also two triggers on the top all 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.380
 buttons has a good response and smooth 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.030
 move except cross joystick 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.130
 as for me it is not very comfortable 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.690
 press yes and everything is pressed somehow 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.060
 Uncertainly on the back of the device 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.740
 there is a battery charge indicator 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.870
 it is a small light bulb that is on 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.970
 two colors blue and red blue 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.920
 means that wajib made ready 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.090
 charge your device a red with 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.800
 exactly the opposite 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.510
 thanks to its modest mass and 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.400
 dimensions it is so powershell only 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.800
 slightly increases the weight of the smartphone and 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.480
 also its thickness and width connecting 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.940
 devices to the controller is carried out 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.980
 physically using the lighting controller 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.750
 the smartphone enters the controller very 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.850
 tight therefore the operation is obtained 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.160
 quite difficult but then 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.650
 you can not be afraid of the fact that the device 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.870
 will fall out of the gap controller between it 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.180
 and the logic power shell 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.840
 no ipod touch connection operation 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.370
 5g 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.250
 similarly but for him pre 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.440
 must be put in the corner 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.060
 Lenia controller supplied adapter 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.440
 the use of controllers does not interfere 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.600
 access to the buttons on the side faces 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.490
 phone at the game can be no problem 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.140
 change the volume or switch 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.460
 device to silent mode 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.100
 thanks to the hole in the back wall 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.110
 powershell can even be photographed on 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.450
 device though i think it's awkward 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.790
 but it will still be very helpful if you 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.860
 take a quick picture on the company website 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.520
 Ji so can be find list compatible with 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.160
 powershell 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.020
 games like asphalt 8 the list is not very 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.209
 extensive but in fact it turned out that not bad 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.270
 the controller also works with games that 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.880
 There is no list for example dead trigger 2 gta 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.170
 san andreas limbo and so on despite 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.940
 what I said before when 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.950
 testing the controller it turned out that not 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.510
 you can play comfortably in the whole game 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.670
 here so powershell is great yourself 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.040
 showed absence in races and arcades 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.959
 sticks does not affect management 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.209
 tangible response that allows 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.250
 to pass difficult in turns and quickly 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.420
 respond to what's happening here in 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.760
 action games using powershell 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.950
 It turned out to play not as comfortable as 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.330
 since there are no analog sticks 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.760
 so in these games have 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.920
 control the touch screen and buttons 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.840
 at the same time therefore the meaning of use 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.910
 controller itself disappears in this 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.950
 case, we can say that it is so power 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.290
 The shell is not in vain so large for 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.180
 like a battery device he 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.729
 can charge smartphone or player during 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.070
 play time through lighting connector what 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.810
 allow the gadget to work more 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.000
 that the controller can safely take with you 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.919
 on the road and even if you don't need and in 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.080
 him play it can be used as 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.060
 external battery logic power shell 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.250
 sure to enjoy racing lovers and 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.840
 arcade who prefers physical 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.940
 buttons with touch control 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.350
 the controller itself has excellent 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.780
 opportunities for a comfortable game 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.120
 specified genres and besides he almost 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.430
 does not make the smartphone have a pleasant 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.229
 ribbed coating which allows without 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.300
 fatigue keep the gadget even on 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.740
 for several hours you need more 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.630
 time mark and the possibility of charging 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.130
 smartphone battery while playing 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.229
 now you don't have to choose between 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.940
 karate him time for games and 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.890
 prematurely discharged 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.720
 battery create at the same time 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.729
 compact and maximum functional 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.890
 the controller is impossible so log house 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.140
 decided not to equip powershell with tics 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.639
 what makes the game of shooters either difficult 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.949
 or 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:18.229
 not at all possible therefore advise 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:20.120
 gadget connoisseurs shot unfortunately not 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.610
 turn out among the blues would like to note 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.229
 convenient form factor and pleasant sensations 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.210
 body material 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.490
 rigid construction which excludes 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.889
 squeaks and backlash not tight buttons that 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.810
 have a tangible click under built 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.969
 Battery charging and smartphone 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.560
 also low weight cons device 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:38.599
 probably also the main one 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.460
 is something that is not convenient to insert and 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:42.710
 get a smartphone by the way if you do it 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.360
 get back and forth a couple of times 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.400
 all likely scratch your 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.680
 the device is exactly what happened to my 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.330
 iphone 5 black and last minus 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.550
 This lack of sticks that not 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.740
 allow you to comfortably play action games 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.789
 microphone had apple exploitation not 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.860
 forget to subscribe to the channel 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:06:01.389
 leave your price tag video and go 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.389
 he's a social network yet 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.440
 led
