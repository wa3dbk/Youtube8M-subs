00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 to all friends here a new video theme 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.040
 is the first 14 and in this video they 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.980
 I'm going to teach how to do a kripper but 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.880
 this time in third dimension and good 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.710
 let's start as everyone knows the 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:27.210
 heads are 8 frames then we go 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:34.550
 to start all 4 6 and 8 2 4 6 and 8 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:38.750
 2 4 6 and 8 2 4 6 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:41.510
 and 8 and good when she is like this here 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.550
 you start here you can do what 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:51.010
 the spaces that I want, I'm going to 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:51.010
 start with 27 bags in 2 4 6 and 8 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.880
 246 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:01.140
 and 8 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.670
 then here is a line and here 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.409
 as well 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:13.350
 ready now what they do is put here 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:17.720
 here and here if now what they have to 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:23.270
 to do is to erase the lines here 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:25.320
 those on the line here and that would be the 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.850
 head 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.850
 I'm going to erase it 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.020
 I will also save you this line of 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.860
 here so that you can see the 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.220
 good head 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.230
 and later 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:52.290
 well I repeat it again and and already 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:55.710
 we have the head then like all 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:01.520
 you know the eyes are 4 x 4 then 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:07.220
 they are so and so so so and so and so 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.220
 well now here this part is done 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.780
 and three squares are made and counted and 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.650
 ceo and it gets like that 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.209
 when already 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:25.210
 and when they already have this way they see that it is the 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:28.510
 look like that now 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:32.440
 the face of the clipper now what follows 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:37.540
 will be the body then as everyone knows 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:46.870
 the body of all minimum ski 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:48.860
 is two frames then 2 4 6 8 10 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:54.380
 and 12 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:03:01.010
 here we do it again 246 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:03.920
 8 10 and 12 and here we come back to join here 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:10.280
 we do the same but this time only one 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:14.560
 line we have here again 8 2 4 6 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.930
 and 8 here too 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.659
 but this time like this 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.379
 and if you see here the body is staying 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:26.670
 very well now what follows are the 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:30.209
 legs are the legs 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:34.800
 it has an expansion table but they are 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:38.069
 four then we do 24 here do not you 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.890
 I forgot to make the little curve of 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:45.120
 that always because as it is third 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.580
 dimension then here it will be shown that 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.970
 it's in third dimension 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:55.440
 then it counts here 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:58.000
 sorry 8 then here we put another and 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.580
 we go down 2 and 4 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.930
 as you want like here is like this then 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:11.670
 we put cream and so 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:13.390
 here we tell two I say at 12 and 4 and 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.959
 we close 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.920
 then we join here 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:25.720
 A) Yes 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:28.820
 then wait 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:33.530
 as we have 10 squares we divide it 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:39.670
 in 5 then here are 2 squares and 5 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.670
 here here they divide and the line is made 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.020
 and here do not forget to do it until here 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:50.670
 well and good here we would have the 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:54.280
 creever but we would miss the color 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:56.470
 then in what you want me 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:00.520
 I will use a color you can 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:03.510
 also use I do not know a bookmark what 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:07.400
 so be it then first you start 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:09.919
 to delineate the lines 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.400
 so that it looks more beautiful to the 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.400
 finish 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:21.210
 here and so after color 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.760
 they are coloring 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.060
 then at the end of this part they continue with 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.250
 the eyes 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:43.190
 to have a tonality so that 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:48.230
 the one little advice on the sides do 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:51.950
 do it the way it is like this 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:54.600
 and there they can do it that way and if 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:57.090
 what a bad day 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.220
 so here I will continue with here 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.640
 with this one 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:05.010
 water nobody else I tell you this how it was 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.460
 very hard to find the shades 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:12.000
 of the creever or that they have almost many 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:14.610
 tonalities in the game then do not 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.190
 I'm going to make a tonality that's going to 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.190
 be the classic one of the green 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:27.750
 and well here we would have our eyes 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:30.539
 Now touch a green you can 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.510
 choose the green I want I go to 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:35.540
 choose this green 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:41.300
 I like this one a lot 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:45.940
 because I do not know why it looks a lot like 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.940
 that is to the skin that has in the game 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.190
 and well, well 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:56.450
 here we make these lines the head and I 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.349
 list now we start coloring the 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.680
 part that you want, I'm going to 

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:06.960
 start with this one 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:09.569
 remember from the sides so you do not 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.139
 come out and there if they start doing it for 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:12.139
 center 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.680
 so it would be ready 

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.060
 if you want, you can advance the video 

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:31.440
 for 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:34.080
 good so they do not open up a bit like that 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:37.639
 that good 

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.639
 we are already finishing
