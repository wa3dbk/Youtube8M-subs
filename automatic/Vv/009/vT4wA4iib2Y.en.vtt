well<00:00:29.109> I<00:00:29.140> think<00:00:29.289> he<00:00:29.619> will<00:00:29.769> repeat<00:00:30.550> ePHI<00:00:31.000> because

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
well I think he will repeat ePHI because

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.840 
well I think he will repeat ePHI because
I<00:00:31.539> don't<00:00:31.689> think<00:00:31.900> any<00:00:32.340> cousin<00:00:33.340> is<00:00:33.430> not<00:00:33.579> the<00:00:33.670> kind

repeat and he does this is something

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.149 
repeat and he does this is something
very<00:01:15.640> common<00:01:16.479> in<00:01:16.659> many<00:01:16.930> World<00:01:17.229> Championships

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
game with the same colors and Anand

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.190 
game with the same colors and Anand
repeats<00:01:27.490> exactly<00:01:28.180> the<00:01:28.299> same<00:01:28.570> as<00:01:28.810> we've<00:01:28.990> seen

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
repeats exactly the same as we've seen

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.070 
repeats exactly the same as we've seen
in<00:01:29.259> game<00:01:29.710> six<00:01:30.400> which<00:01:30.909> is<00:01:30.940> just<00:01:31.330> two<00:01:31.690> days<00:01:31.870> ago

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
in game six which is just two days ago

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.550 
in game six which is just two days ago
I've<00:01:33.010> been<00:01:33.310> told<00:01:33.580> that<00:01:33.850> on<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.090> day<00:01:34.270> off

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
I've been told that on the day off

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.430 
I've been told that on the day off
Magnus<00:01:35.560> through<00:01:36.250> to<00:01:36.400> his<00:01:36.580> himself<00:01:37.110> he<00:01:38.110> took

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
Magnus through to his himself he took

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.920 
Magnus through to his himself he took
the<00:01:38.590> opportunity<00:01:38.800> to<00:01:39.370> do<00:01:39.520> sports<00:01:40.030> buffering

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
the opportunity to do sports buffering

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.950 
the opportunity to do sports buffering
so<00:01:41.170> now<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.590> night<00:01:42.400> would<00:01:42.700> move<00:01:42.970> to<00:01:43.000> d4<00:01:43.720> than

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
so now the night would move to d4 than

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.590 
so now the night would move to d4 than
the<00:01:44.170> night<00:01:44.350> would<00:01:44.560> trade<00:01:45.010> which<00:01:45.970> with<00:01:46.210> a<00:01:46.240> favor

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
the night would trade which with a favor

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.630 
the night would trade which with a favor
black<00:01:47.080> because<00:01:47.620> then<00:01:47.800> right<00:01:48.040> would<00:01:48.310> end<00:01:48.490> up

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
black because then right would end up

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.960 
black because then right would end up
with<00:01:48.670> a<00:01:48.909> doubled<00:01:49.300> pawn<00:01:49.540> on<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:49.870> D<00:01:50.020> file<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.820> now

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
with a doubled pawn on the D file so now

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.010 
with a doubled pawn on the D file so now
the<00:01:52.030> question<00:01:52.270> is<00:01:52.900> what<00:01:53.440> can<00:01:53.680> an<00:01:54.120> undue<00:01:55.120> to<00:01:55.659> try

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
the question is what can an undue to try

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.580 
the question is what can an undue to try
to<00:01:56.080> make<00:01:56.409> any<00:01:56.680> kind<00:01:56.830> of<00:01:57.190> progress<00:01:57.490> honestly

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
to make any kind of progress honestly

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.960 
to make any kind of progress honestly
objectively<00:01:59.590> speaking<00:01:59.680> I<00:02:00.400> don't<00:02:00.880> think

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
objectively speaking I don't think

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.719 
objectively speaking I don't think
either<00:02:01.270> side<00:02:01.630> can<00:02:01.870> make<00:02:02.110> any<00:02:02.610> probably<00:02:03.610> he

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
either side can make any probably he

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.930 
either side can make any probably he
could<00:02:03.880> arise<00:02:04.330> playing<00:02:04.870> Queen<00:02:05.370> m390<00:02:06.370> I<00:02:06.610> and

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
could arise playing Queen m390 I and

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.789 
could arise playing Queen m390 I and
Queen<00:02:07.090> g2<00:02:07.570> since<00:02:07.990> he<00:02:08.080> has<00:02:08.170> already<00:02:08.319> tried<00:02:08.619> to

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:08.799 
Queen g2 since he has already tried to

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.369 
Queen g2 since he has already tried to
enough<00:02:09.039> to<00:02:09.250> write<00:02:09.789> maybe<00:02:10.269> he<00:02:10.450> could<00:02:10.599> and<00:02:11.200> here

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
enough to write maybe he could and here

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.270 
enough to write maybe he could and here
comes<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:11.769> move<00:02:12.030> repeating<00:02:13.830> for<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:14.950> second

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
comes a move repeating for the second

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.619 
comes a move repeating for the second
time<00:02:15.459> right<00:02:15.760> yeah<00:02:16.140> when<00:02:17.140> f3<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:18.209> 95<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:19.599> this

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
time right yeah when f3 and 95 and this

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.460 
time right yeah when f3 and 95 and this
is<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:20.129> hidden<00:02:21.129> drawer<00:02:21.549> offer<00:02:21.909> we<00:02:22.540> can<00:02:22.720> say<00:02:23.019> and

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
is a hidden drawer offer we can say and

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.679 
is a hidden drawer offer we can say and
I<00:02:23.950> think<00:02:24.159> we<00:02:24.280> may<00:02:24.459> see<00:02:24.519> I<00:02:24.790> think<00:02:25.120> we<00:02:25.239> are<00:02:25.390> seeing

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:25.689
