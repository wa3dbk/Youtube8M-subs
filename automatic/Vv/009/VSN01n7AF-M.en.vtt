00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.540
 this is a production of migdalia 

00:00:02.779 --> 00:00:07.129
 television and migdalia radio 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.110
 non-profit audiovisual 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:10.940
 mendavia dotcom to contribute 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.430
 knowledge and raise awareness 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.500
 migdalia dotcom the first social network 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.680
 of help to the tourist through the 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.680
 thought 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.259
 you remember that we were recently 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.000
 talking about loneliness in company 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.149
 today we are going to talk about that alone 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.879
 with myself there are many people who seem 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:35.579
 can not stand or coexist in a way 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.920
 horrific with himself and since he 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.949
 he raises until he goes to bed it seems that 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.720
 is in constant quarrel with oneself 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:45.540
 who is to blame the damn loneliness 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:49.079
 he has very bad press the loneliness not 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.940
 often he likes nobody or almost nobody 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.460
 I think there are a kind of people 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.530
 who like those people 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.510
 who have an inner world with a 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.150
 tremendous wealth and those who have 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.549
 learned to get along with themselves 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:07.100
 in your own company to those who have 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:11.000
 learned to lower the level of anxiety 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.310
 to be constantly trying to 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.130
 find someone who wants them 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.440
 understand them to keep them company 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.590
 distract them from themselves 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.259
 in short those people who have 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.630
 made a cut of sleeves or so it's 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.240
 finest to the club of the fold and those 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.250
 slogans that say that everyone 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.860
 you have to live as a couple all over the world 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.560
 he has to be married and many people 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.020
 they are very independent and maybe 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.539
 they may have some relationship because 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.030
 is to live alone with one does not mean to be 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:47.679
 only in life does it exist in the family 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.590
 there are friends but to start one 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:53.390
 exists with itself or should exist 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.310
 you have never been alone at 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.590
 cinema is to say in company of you 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.569
 I usually say to them to go to 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.049
 cinema all I need are my eyes 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:05.270
 or to travel alone I need to me is 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.789
 more that traveling alone has its 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.710
 advantages because one is given the opportunity 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:13.370
 to meet another 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:16.370
 Clear people if one lives it as I am 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.680
 I just do not have anyone to be ashamed 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.190
 I'm going to a restaurant and I alone 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.560
 alone to eat or have dinner or to drink something in 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.930
 that case obviously you are not going to leave 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.090
 home and you're going to lose your life 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.130
 to lose the fantastic people that by the 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.110
 obviously you will also lose us to 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.930
 the damsels and toads apt japanese 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.970
 but I already know that I am very optimistic 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.820
 I always prefer to think of what 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.970
 I can win and not in what I do not 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.520
 therefore interested and aprÃ©s 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.940
 I look like that president we had in 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:53.090
 the valley of therefore is a 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.160
 great opportunity learning to live with 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.890
 self and the exit of the world in 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.870
 company of one or the same you can do 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:04.190
 what you like, you will not have to 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:07.460
 negotiate nothing with anyone or where to sleep 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.430
 or what sites to see you can learn to 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.740
 enjoy because the person who lives 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.890
 very well with yourself that is understood 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.260
 what is understood 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.410
 that you love that you can do 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.140
 company that person is the best 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.330
 company of the world is the person who does not 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.870
 will demand other hey makes happy 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.730
 understand me understand me and bring me this 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.470
 bring me the other one because you do not buy me this 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.420
 because you do not give me the other 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.030
 opposite is a person of much 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.540
 share or that the individualists 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.180
 the independent of life by rule 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.940
 general are the best companies because 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.970
 also when they decide to interact with 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.459
 another person with another human being and what 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.590
 they do because that human being brings them 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:56.130
 something that really suits them 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.160
 fancy and fill them there are many people 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.920
 that are not alone 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.720
 friendship relations with people that neither 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.700
 he wants them neither understands them nor has 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.170
 no intention and when they return to their 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:13.709
 houses carry an extra weight tucking their 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.720
 loneliness the disappointment that disappointment of 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.030
 have shared a few hours with 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.190
 people who have not contributed anything I 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.980
 I have people who consult who tells me 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.470
 that before starting the sessions to 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.270
 given or freeze madrid and with me 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.160
 they had relationships from that of friends in 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.380
 which the best could hold milk of 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.410
 many hours for not coming home and 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:37.140
 be alone or alone and yet in that 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.450
 conversation with those people that good 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.120
 it was conversation let's say about you 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.490
 lynch and it did not bring them anything but 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.460
 they also did not dare to tell them hey look 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.190
 I exist I too 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.500
 would like to talk about this then those 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.530
 people what you have to learn is to 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.840
 say no and leave those people who 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:02.130
 they do not speak to their soul that they do not contribute 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:04.680
 nothing is more one has I also a 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.840
 American friend of mine he told me he says 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.900
 I would advise people to do 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.510
 what I did spend a year alone 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.060
 with myself in my own company says 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:18.750
 well there is a time when they hate you 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.680
 but when you get over the critical point and 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.740
 you go back up 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:28.160
 then you are the best company the best 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:31.610
 couple and the person you are most capable of 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:35.120
 to love in this world do not need 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.759
 go to the mojave desert in usa ni 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.430
 this one went to australia I did not 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:42.080
 had need of any mountain to 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.570
 spend a year in a stream with me 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.330
 However, I have learned to be 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.889
 with my own company very comfortable to me 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.410
 I have always liked to be in my 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:54.470
 company and in fact I am a very company 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.900
 good word fairy godmother is a lot 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.970
 easier to understand people and when 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.039
 I meet with other people I do not have 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:04.000
 need to be talking all the time 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:06.500
 from me then there are people who do because 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.389
 because he does not even support himself 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.870
 same and before it comes another says good to 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:15.380
 see if you can stand me so we look at the 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:17.300
 mirror look at the mirror of the soul 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.150
 but if I'm the best that I could 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:23.210
 spend in this life here I am waiting 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:25.910
 to have the best relationship in the world 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.680
 with myself good I do not know if to capture 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.980
 It's the mess but I'm in the middle of 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:33.800
 madrid that you know and here today is the 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.780
 This is going to be for the annals of 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.360
 the story in which you play you know who 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:41.030
 the barÃ§a and the athletic one of bilbao and 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.340
 Madrid is already burning and you do not know the 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:46.070
 number of cops helicopters 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:49.040
 There are so many madriles that 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:51.230
 we have a lot of trouble so talking 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.270
 of solitude the truth is that today is a 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:55.580
 day in which I think no one can 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:58.730
 be alone in Madrid and in company of 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.800
 same good you have to learn in life 

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:03.020
 as I told you another day that when 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:07.000
 life gives you pumpkins for that because beam 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.000
 jams to another
