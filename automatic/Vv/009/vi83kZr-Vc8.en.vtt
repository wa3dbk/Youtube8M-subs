back there all right now we now got this
but<00:03:47.580> the<00:03:47.880> problem<00:03:48.209> is<00:03:48.270> that<00:03:48.570> all<00:03:49.260> ground<00:03:50.250> floor

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
but the problem is that all ground floor

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.290 
but the problem is that all ground floor
is<00:03:50.880> only<00:03:52.040> black<00:03:53.040> so<00:03:53.459> we're<00:03:53.760> gonna<00:03:53.880> change<00:03:54.180> that

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
is only black so we're gonna change that

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.970 
is only black so we're gonna change that
in<00:03:54.510> a<00:03:54.600> minute<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:55.020> we're<00:03:55.230> gonna<00:03:55.350> also<00:03:55.620> call

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
in a minute and we're gonna also call

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.220 
in a minute and we're gonna also call
this<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.550> and<00:03:57.209> I<00:03:57.420> just<00:03:57.570> noticed<00:03:57.930> by<00:03:58.020> the<00:03:58.050> way

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
this and and I just noticed by the way

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.300 
this and and I just noticed by the way
that<00:03:59.000> that<00:04:00.000> text<00:04:00.300> is<00:04:00.390> are<00:04:00.690> a<00:04:01.620> little<00:04:02.130> bit

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
like three or so just take the plane

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.020 
like three or so just take the plane
here

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
here

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.580 
here

here to make us on color you stop to
click<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.200> material<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:23.150> on<00:04:24.150> our<00:04:24.680> reflection

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
click the material and on our reflection

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.560 
click the material and on our reflection
here<00:04:28.470> at<00:04:28.680> reflection<00:04:29.130> I<00:04:29.220> wanna<00:04:29.550> have<00:04:29.700> a<00:04:29.970> two

to<00:05:50.520> get<00:05:50.760> on<00:05:51.060> our<00:05:51.210> angular<00:05:51.570> so<00:05:52.410> now<00:05:52.530> we're<00:05:52.680> gonna

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
to get on our angular so now we're gonna

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.779 
to get on our angular so now we're gonna
color<00:05:54.720> the<00:05:54.840> the<00:05:55.680> middle<00:05:55.950> text<00:05:56.250> so<00:05:56.430> let's<00:05:56.550> go

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
color the the middle text so let's go

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:00.380 
color the the middle text so let's go
file<00:05:57.150> new<00:05:57.390> material

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.740 

and<00:06:00.510> we<00:06:01.170> want<00:06:01.350> to<00:06:01.440> have<00:06:02.060> basic<00:06:03.060> just<00:06:03.300> the<00:06:03.510> same

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
and we want to have basic just the same

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.240 
and we want to have basic just the same
thing<00:06:03.780> but<00:06:03.990> to<00:06:04.290> hear<00:06:04.620> it<00:06:04.770> in<00:06:04.860> the<00:06:04.890> reflection

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
thing but to hear it in the reflection

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.620 
thing but to hear it in the reflection
we're<00:06:05.490> gonna<00:06:05.670> go<00:06:06.440> Fresnel<00:06:07.440> as<00:06:07.590> the<00:06:07.740> same<00:06:08.630> and

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
we're gonna go Fresnel as the same and

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.810 
we're gonna go Fresnel as the same and
specular<00:06:10.410> is<00:06:10.560> to<00:06:10.800> change<00:06:11.190> it<00:06:11.430> we're<00:06:11.550> gonna<00:06:11.640> go

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
specular is to change it we're gonna go

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.390 
specular is to change it we're gonna go
metal<00:06:12.120> so<00:06:12.600> it<00:06:12.630> gets<00:06:12.840> all<00:06:13.290> right<00:06:13.770> let's<00:06:14.250> be

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
metal so it gets all right let's be

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.470 
metal so it gets all right let's be
black<00:06:15.860> take<00:06:16.860> that<00:06:17.100> black<00:06:17.400> material<00:06:17.820> here<00:06:18.270> and

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:18.480 
black take that black material here and

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.890 
black take that black material here and
just<00:06:18.690> drop<00:06:19.200> it<00:06:19.380> on<00:06:19.560> deck<00:06:19.830> soon<00:06:20.100> herbs<00:06:20.370> and

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
just drop it on deck soon herbs and

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.870 
just drop it on deck soon herbs and
we're<00:06:21.900> just<00:06:21.990> going<00:06:22.080> to<00:06:22.290> prove<00:06:22.890> that<00:06:23.100> a<00:06:23.160> bit<00:06:25.880> all

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
we're just going to prove that a bit all

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.820 
we're just going to prove that a bit all
right<00:06:27.030> you<00:06:27.240> see<00:06:27.510> it's<00:06:27.660> kind<00:06:28.230> of<00:06:28.350> nice

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
right you see it's kind of nice

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:34.250 
right you see it's kind of nice
reflection<00:06:29.610> air<00:06:29.730> so<00:06:32.090> basically<00:06:33.090> that's<00:06:33.600> it<00:06:33.870> so

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260 
reflection air so basically that's it so

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.770 
reflection air so basically that's it so
I'm<00:06:34.620> just<00:06:35.430> going<00:06:35.550> to<00:06:35.640> render<00:06:35.910> this<00:06:36.090> out<00:06:36.270> and

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
I'm just going to render this out and

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.440 
I'm just going to render this out and
we're<00:06:37.470> all<00:06:37.590> done<00:06:37.800> all<00:06:38.460> right<00:06:38.550> go<00:06:39.060> to<00:06:39.090> render

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:39.450 
we're all done all right go to render
