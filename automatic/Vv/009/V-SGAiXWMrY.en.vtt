00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
raising them and showing them I think

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.670 
raising them and showing them I think
the<00:01:05.519> biggest<00:01:05.760> part<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.479> they<00:01:07.200> don't<00:01:07.350> know<00:01:07.530> what

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
the biggest part is they don't know what

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.780 
the biggest part is they don't know what
