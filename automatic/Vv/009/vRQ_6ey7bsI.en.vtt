00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
now I flatten it well to make the petal

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.840 
now I flatten it well to make the petal
it<00:01:28.380> will<00:01:28.500> be<00:01:28.590> up<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.070> see<00:01:29.340> whether<00:01:29.549> you

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
it will be up to you to see whether you

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.609 
like the 3d rendering to be emphasized
or<00:01:32.280> if<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.490> prefer<00:01:32.610> flat<00:01:33.150> petals<00:01:33.630> if<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.470> like

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
or if you prefer flat petals if you like

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.920 
or if you prefer flat petals if you like
flat<00:01:34.920> ones<00:01:35.189> you'll<00:01:35.460> need<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.119> flatten<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.630> more

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
flat ones you'll need to flatten it more

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.740 
flat ones you'll need to flatten it more
with<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.140> brush

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
with a brush

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.620 
with a brush
so<00:01:39.290> I<00:01:39.320> do<00:01:39.410> it<00:01:39.620> again<00:01:39.740> put<00:01:40.130> another<00:01:40.400> drop<00:01:40.640> you

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
so I do it again put another drop you

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.930 
so I do it again put another drop you
should<00:01:41.810> consider<00:01:42.170> placing<00:01:42.650> the<00:01:43.250> petals<00:01:43.670> one

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
should consider placing the petals one

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.980 
should consider placing the petals one
over<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:44.330> other<00:01:44.360> it<00:01:44.900> looks<00:01:44.930> great

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
over the other it looks great

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.720 
over the other it looks great
if<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.200> resin<00:01:48.560> is<00:01:48.680> too<00:01:48.860> wet<00:01:49.070> you'll<00:01:49.310> see<00:01:49.520> that

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
if the resin is too wet you'll see that

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.910 
if the resin is too wet you'll see that
you<00:01:49.880> won't<00:01:50.120> be<00:01:50.270> able<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.540> flatten<00:01:51.050> it<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:51.440> also

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
you won't be able to flatten it and also

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.130 
you won't be able to flatten it and also
if<00:01:52.070> it's<00:01:52.250> too<00:01:52.490> dry<00:01:52.760> it<00:01:53.030> will<00:01:53.150> be<00:01:53.270> hard<00:01:53.540> and<00:01:53.840> you

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
if it's too dry it will be hard and you

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.470 
if it's too dry it will be hard and you
won't<00:01:54.380> be<00:01:54.530> able<00:01:54.680> to<00:01:54.890> flatten<00:01:55.130> it<00:01:55.460> that's<00:01:56.330> why

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
won't be able to flatten it that's why

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.630 
won't be able to flatten it that's why
I've<00:01:56.660> waited<00:01:56.930> some<00:01:57.560> three<00:01:57.860> or<00:01:57.890> four<00:01:58.250> seconds

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
I've waited some three or four seconds

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.450 
I've waited some three or four seconds

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
before flattening it here it is I

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.490 
before flattening it here it is I
forwarded<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.300> video<00:02:02.450> a<00:02:02.660> bit<00:02:02.990> because<00:02:03.200> it

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
forwarded the video a bit because it

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.220 
forwarded the video a bit because it
takes<00:02:03.740> some<00:02:03.950> times<00:02:04.190> to<00:02:04.370> do<00:02:04.490> 3d<00:02:04.760> nail<00:02:05.090> art<00:02:05.300> to

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
takes some times to do 3d nail art to

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.590 
takes some times to do 3d nail art to
make<00:02:06.410> the<00:02:06.590> leaves<00:02:06.830> first<00:02:07.430> I<00:02:07.610> make<00:02:07.910> a<00:02:07.940> drop<00:02:08.300> and

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
make the leaves first I make a drop and

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.050 
make the leaves first I make a drop and
flatten<00:02:09.140> it<00:02:09.229> on<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.590> sides<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:10.220> then<00:02:10.729> I<00:02:10.850> make

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
flatten it on the sides and then I make

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.720 
flatten it on the sides and then I make
the<00:02:11.209> tip<00:02:11.470> when<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.590> leaf<00:02:12.770> has<00:02:12.950> right<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.310> little

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
the tip when the leaf has right a little

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.910 
the tip when the leaf has right a little
I<00:02:13.850> will<00:02:13.910> use<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.840> back<00:02:15.110> of<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.410> brush<00:02:15.590> or

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
I will use the back of the brush or

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.430 
I will use the back of the brush or
another<00:02:16.190> tool<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:17.209> make<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.510> lines<00:02:17.780> for<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.290> to

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
another tool to make the lines for it to

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.350 
another tool to make the lines for it to
look<00:02:18.560> like<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.830> leaf<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:19.370> finally<00:02:20.120> make<00:02:20.330> it

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
look like a leaf and finally make it

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:56.789 
look like a leaf and finally make it
hollow<00:02:20.720> in<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.080> middle

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.649 

then<00:02:57.799> I<00:02:57.890> use<00:02:58.040> white<00:02:58.310> acrylic<00:02:58.670> paint<00:02:58.879> since

00:02:59.649 --> 00:02:59.659 
then I use white acrylic paint since

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:02.470 
then I use white acrylic paint since
it's<00:02:59.870> greater<00:03:00.200> than<00:03:00.469> the<00:03:00.590> resin<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:01.450> take<00:03:02.450> a

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
it's greater than the resin I take a

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.089 
it's greater than the resin I take a
small<00:03:02.780> brush<00:03:02.989> and<00:03:03.049> make<00:03:03.379> the<00:03:03.500> outlines<00:03:03.890> of<00:03:04.040> the

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
small brush and make the outlines of the

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.640 
small brush and make the outlines of the
petals<00:03:04.189> to<00:03:04.640> bring<00:03:04.819> them<00:03:05.030> out<00:03:05.290> to<00:03:06.290> get<00:03:06.439> even

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
petals to bring them out to get even

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.369 
petals to bring them out to get even
better<00:03:06.980> looking<00:03:07.489> flowers<00:03:08.060> I<00:03:08.329> have<00:03:08.840> made<00:03:09.049> loads

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
better looking flowers I have made loads

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.709 
better looking flowers I have made loads
of<00:03:09.560> lines<00:03:09.829> on<00:03:10.099> the<00:03:10.280> petals<00:03:10.670> from<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.209> outside

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:11.719 
of lines on the petals from the outside

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:14.559 
of lines on the petals from the outside
to<00:03:12.109> the<00:03:12.139> inside<00:03:12.519> these<00:03:13.519> lines<00:03:13.819> must<00:03:14.150> be<00:03:14.329> very

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
to the inside these lines must be very

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.399 
to the inside these lines must be very
small<00:03:14.870> ones<00:03:15.139> so<00:03:15.620> I<00:03:15.980> used<00:03:16.540> diluted<00:03:17.540> paints<00:03:18.049> to

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:18.409 
small ones so I used diluted paints to

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:55.250 
small ones so I used diluted paints to
be<00:03:18.620> able<00:03:18.709> to<00:03:19.010> make<00:03:19.189> very<00:03:19.430> small<00:03:19.609> lines

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.890 

then<00:03:55.650> I<00:03:55.800> make<00:03:55.980> some<00:03:56.159> lines<00:03:56.370> around<00:03:56.849> quick<00:03:57.659> ones

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
then I make some lines around quick ones

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.470 
then I make some lines around quick ones
and<00:03:58.379> I<00:03:58.860> apply<00:03:59.099> three<00:03:59.370> small<00:03:59.640> rhinestones<00:03:59.909> with

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
and I apply three small rhinestones with

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:17.390 
and I apply three small rhinestones with
rhinestone<00:04:01.170> goo<00:04:01.440> to<00:04:02.220> make<00:04:02.370> it<00:04:02.519> hold<00:04:02.730> better

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:40.919
