00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.509
 This sounds really good. 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.240
 But those speakers do cost a lot of money. 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.600
 The great thing is that for a tenth of the price, you can get roughly the same sound with headphones. 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:31.919
 There are actually hundreds of different brands of headphones and more are being added. 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.570
 And those brands do not make just one, but sometimes twenty types of headphones. 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.050
 There are quite a few. 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.130
 So if you want headphones, what should you look out for? 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.280
 An important question that you must answer is: "Where do you use the headphones the most?" 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.640
 Is that at home? Or for example on the road. 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.760
 On the road compact is very pleasant and there is nothing as small as these earbuds. 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.990
 But not everyone finds it comfortable. 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.030
 So you also have foldable headphones. 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.440
 If you use it during exercise, it is handy if it is just a little more tight. 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.360
 Then it stays better. 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.390
 For the home, large is not such an objection, but it is also nice if it is not so tight. 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.360
 That is more comfortable. 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.410
 Of course, a volume control is very handy for traveling. 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.300
 But make sure that it actually works with your type of smartphone. 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.860
 Also pay attention to the cable length, a short cable is handy for traveling and longer is better for home. 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.880
 You can always easily extend a short cord with an extra cord. 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.510
 Sometimes an extension cord is also included. 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.830
 There are all sizes of headphones but there is another difference. 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.720
 There are open headphones and closed models. 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.580
 Well, with an open headphone (that's this one), the sound can go out this way unhindered. 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.050
 And that means that people around you just hear that and vice versa. 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.730
 That sound is also easy from the outside in, so you can hear your environment better. 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.200
 As long as your music isn't too loud. 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.220
 Closed headphones have an airtight room. 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.579
 That means that the sound cannot go in or out there. 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.560
 A little noise always leaks. 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.849
 Open headphones have a few advantages. 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.729
 They can be lighter because, after all, no air-tight room is needed to close that air-tight sound. 

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:18.149
 The speaker is also not prevented by that airtight room. 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:21.620
 And in theory that gives an advantage for the sound quality. 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.860
 And when you press it, you feel less pressure on your ear than with the headphones closed. 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.700
 Some people find that more comfortable. 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.709
 Closed headphones are a bit more social for on the road. 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.609
 That is why most headphones are closed on the road. 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:44.559
 You have headphones for the ear and you have headphones for the ear. 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:48.629
 Well, such a headset for around the ear that closes the ear better. 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.729
 They are also often more comfortable. 

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:54.989
 But beware: if your ear sticks out a bit, it can still hit the speaker. 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.800
 Of course has to do with the thickness of the pillow, so pay attention to that. 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:03.149
 And sometimes it is also true that the pillow is just a little too small for the size of your ear cup. 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:04.720
 That is not so nice either. 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.540
 On-ear headphones are often somewhat more compact. 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.920
 This is of course more convenient when traveling. 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:14.759
 Where do you buy the headphones? 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:16.829
 Well, on the internet the choice is huge! 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:22.529
 Really decent tests are scarce there and they cannot tell everything about wearing comfort. 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:25.509
 User reviews are quite valuable but ... 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:27.089
 ... not always reliable. 

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:30.720
 You will have to read quite a bit of it to get an idea. 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.880
 Only with well-known models that have been on the market for a long time are there a lot of reviews. 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.829
 Fortunately, that may limit the choice a bit. 

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:46.519
 In a very large brown goods and white goods store you have a lot of choice and you can judge the wearing comfort a bit. 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.699
 Not ear plugs, by the way, because they are usually sealed in the package. 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:54.079
 But in a smaller and more audio specialized store you can listen much more at ease. 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.580
 And very important; if you ask, you can also compare the headphones at the same volume. 

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:03.149
 In addition to wearing comfort, sound quality is of course the most important thing. 

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:07.309
 Most music lovers who agree, such a speaker who needs the musical instruments ... 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:09.799
 ... pass on as naturally as possible. 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.459
 Then you hear it as the musician intended. 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:18.719
 In addition, it is best if the highs, mids and lows are displayed with equal strength in relation to each other. 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.490
 Which means; then you come closer to the artist (the musician). 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.610
 And that is what you call a neutral sound. 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.700
 Many people like it when the high tones, but especially the low tones, get a bit of emphasis. 

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:35.240
 Well, as far as I'm concerned, it's like you're looking at a painting with pink glasses on. 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.740
 That is partly a matter of taste and maybe the painter doesn't even mind if you put those glasses on. 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:48.020
 That is why the headphones are made with the emphasis on the bass and treble already built in. 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.680
 Note: with an audio installation or in your smartphone you can often use those high and low tones ... 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.640
 ... arrange it yourself. 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.140
 So you can also slightly discolor a neutral headset. 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.940
 And then you can actually determine yourself which glasses you put on. 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.240
 You've found the two that both sound incredibly good and you have huge doubts ... 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.620
 ...for me; the eye wants something too. 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.720
 Then just choose the one that you like best and I think this one is a bit nicer than this one. 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.540
 If you go to the store now, don't forget to bring your own music. 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:25.880
 Because that is the music that you know best, and that way you can better judge how it should sound.
