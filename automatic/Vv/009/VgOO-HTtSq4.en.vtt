00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
pretty standard one we'll just call that

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.890 
pretty standard one we'll just call that
alt<00:02:38.489> blue<00:02:41.090> when<00:02:42.090> we<00:02:42.180> go<00:02:42.329> ahead<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.540> make<00:02:42.659> this

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
alt blue when we go ahead and make this

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.100

like<00:03:32.069> a<00:03:32.099> lime<00:03:32.370> green<00:03:32.400> so<00:03:33.150> we're<00:03:33.359> going<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.540> give

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
like a lime green so we're going to give

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.170 
like a lime green so we're going to give

them a lime green pants but then when it
comes<00:03:36.329> to<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.810> designs<00:03:37.169> we're<00:03:37.470> gonna<00:03:37.560> make<00:03:37.709> a

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
comes to the designs we're gonna make a

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.640 
comes to the designs we're gonna make a
black<00:03:38.540> because<00:03:39.540> I<00:03:39.630> think<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:39.959> black<00:03:40.230> would<00:03:40.470> look

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
black because I think a black would look

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.180 
black because I think a black would look
cool

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
cool

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.330 
cool
oh<00:03:43.190> yeah<00:03:44.419> exactly<00:03:45.530> this<00:03:46.530> is<00:03:46.829> the<00:03:46.950> kind<00:03:47.130> of<00:03:47.190> look

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
oh yeah exactly this is the kind of look

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.740 
oh yeah exactly this is the kind of look
I'm<00:03:47.459> going<00:03:47.639> for<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:48.000> then<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.209> design<00:03:48.480> number

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
I'm going for and then the design number

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.650 
I'm going for and then the design number
three<00:03:52.220> you<00:03:53.220> can't<00:03:53.489> have<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:53.849> be<00:03:54.000> too<00:03:54.359> different

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
three you can't have it be too different

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.520 
three you can't have it be too different
but<00:03:55.079> if<00:03:55.169> it's<00:03:55.319> too<00:03:55.500> close<00:03:56.870> let's<00:03:57.870> see<00:03:58.200> let's<00:03:58.440> go

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
but if it's too close let's see let's go

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.860 
but if it's too close let's see let's go
to<00:03:58.650> history

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
to history

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.940 
to history
like<00:04:00.870> this<00:04:01.169> but<00:04:01.470> then<00:04:01.590> we<00:04:01.620> got<00:04:01.769> to<00:04:01.829> make<00:04:01.889> a

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
like this but then we got to make a

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.569 
like this but then we got to make a
darker<00:04:03.410> so<00:04:04.410> kind<00:04:04.680> of<00:04:04.709> like<00:04:04.829> a<00:04:04.859> green<00:04:05.250> that

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
darker so kind of like a green that

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:06.559 
darker so kind of like a green that
meshes<00:04:06.090> with<00:04:06.269> it

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
meshes with it

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:12.800 
meshes with it
I<00:04:06.599> like<00:04:07.230> that<00:04:07.470> well<00:04:08.900> actually<00:04:11.419> the<00:04:12.419> belt

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
I like that well actually the belt

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:19.199 
I like that well actually the belt
should<00:04:13.079> be<00:04:17.329> well

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
should be well

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.560 
should be well
now<00:04:19.900> the<00:04:19.959> belt<00:04:20.350> should<00:04:20.500> be<00:04:20.560> black<00:04:20.859> a<00:04:21.570> little

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
now the belt should be black a little

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.120 
now the belt should be black a little
crazy<00:04:22.900> a<00:04:23.050> little<00:04:23.080> funky<00:04:23.620> but<00:04:23.650> that's<00:04:23.919> fine

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
crazy a little funky but that's fine

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.640 
crazy a little funky but that's fine
with<00:04:24.310> me

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
with me

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.409 
with me
wristbands<00:04:26.650> can<00:04:26.949> go<00:04:27.100> black<00:04:27.460> we're<00:04:28.240> going<00:04:28.360> to

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
wristbands can go black we're going to

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.210 
wristbands can go black we're going to
alternate<00:04:28.840> it<00:04:28.930> out<00:04:29.020> before<00:04:29.470> when<00:04:29.919> we<00:04:30.070> would

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
alternate it out before when we would
