its position it shed last night as you
can<00:00:37.220> see<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:40.190> shed

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
can see the shed

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.759 
can see the shed
is<00:00:41.750> broy<00:00:42.379> there<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:43.400> skeleton<00:00:44.030> sort<00:00:44.420> of<00:00:44.769> color

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
is broy there the skeleton sort of color

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:50.590 
is broy there the skeleton sort of color
and<00:00:46.510> the<00:00:48.250> specimen<00:00:49.250> is<00:00:49.550> going<00:00:49.970> along<00:00:50.239> the

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
and the specimen is going along the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.860 
and the specimen is going along the
front<00:00:51.050> right<00:00:52.040> so<00:00:52.339> the<00:00:52.610> left<00:00:52.879> is<00:00:53.180> the<00:00:53.510> Indian

stick insect it's um a few months old
now<00:01:00.070> it's<00:01:01.070> it's<00:01:01.670> transformed<00:01:02.479> into<00:01:02.629> an<00:01:02.839> adult

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
now it's it's transformed into an adult

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.560 
now it's it's transformed into an adult
now<00:01:03.409> that's<00:01:03.830> very<00:01:03.949> good

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
now that's very good

can't can't expand and grow what they do

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.560 
can't can't expand and grow what they do
is<00:01:49.790> that<00:01:49.820> they<00:01:50.830> walked<00:01:51.830> into<00:01:52.340> a<00:01:52.570> different

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
is that they walked into a different

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:00.820 
is that they walked into a different
skin<00:01:56.020> not<00:01:57.020> like<00:01:57.230> humans<00:01:57.830> where<00:01:58.159> we<00:01:58.700> can<00:01:59.830> grow

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
skin not like humans where we can grow

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.710 
skin not like humans where we can grow
and<00:02:01.360> our<00:02:03.310> hardness<00:02:04.310> is<00:02:04.640> within<00:02:04.970> which<00:02:05.390> is<00:02:05.570> our

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
and our hardness is within which is our

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.170 
and our hardness is within which is our
boom<00:02:07.720> these<00:02:08.720> insects<00:02:09.229> hardness<00:02:09.860> is<00:02:10.399> on<00:02:10.879> their

boom these insects hardness is on their
cell<00:02:12.040> on<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.610> exterior<00:02:14.090> so<00:02:15.019> that's<00:02:15.260> why

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.059 

that's<00:02:18.739> why<00:02:19.010> we<00:02:19.159> moved<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.720> right<00:02:20.989> now<00:02:21.469> I'm

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
that's why we moved to the right now I'm

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.660 
that's why we moved to the right now I'm
just<00:02:22.489> going<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.819> zoom<00:02:23.030> in<00:02:23.239> for<00:02:23.480> you<00:02:24.310> this<00:02:25.310> is
