the starters we're starting to get

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.079 
the starters we're starting to get
really<00:00:04.770> into<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.310> fourth<00:00:05.520> generation<00:00:05.970> and

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
really into the fourth generation and

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.129 
that attack it's going to be very
powerful<00:00:11.700> because<00:00:12.179> being<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.570> flying<00:00:12.840> normal

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139

damage<00:00:15.299> moves<00:00:15.630> like<00:00:15.839> brave<00:00:16.230> bird<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.710> we'll

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
damage moves like brave bird and we'll

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.859 
damage moves like brave bird and we'll
talk<00:00:17.100> about<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.580> second<00:00:18.000> but<00:00:18.119> also<00:00:18.330> the

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
talk about that a second but also the

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.750 
talk about that a second but also the
rest<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.140> stats<00:00:19.380> pretty<00:00:19.830> decent<00:00:20.189> 85<00:00:20.550> on<00:00:20.699> the

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
rest of stats pretty decent 85 on the

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.670 
rest of stats pretty decent 85 on the
hit<00:00:20.910> points<00:00:21.210> with<00:00:21.539> 70<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:21.960> 60<00:00:22.199> on<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.320> defense

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
hit points with 70 and 60 on the defense

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.080 
hit points with 70 and 60 on the defense
means<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.070> have<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.189> decent<00:00:23.730> chance<00:00:23.939> of

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
means you have a decent chance of

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.060 
means you have a decent chance of
surviving<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.539> hit<00:00:24.720> potentially<00:00:25.500> even<00:00:25.800> after

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
surviving a hit potentially even after

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.220 
surviving a hit potentially even after
recoil<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.609> then<00:00:26.910> 100<00:00:27.330> base<00:00:27.449> speed<00:00:27.689> while<00:00:28.199> a

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
recoil and then 100 base speed while a

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.750 
recoil and then 100 base speed while a
flying-type<00:00:28.590> pokémon<00:00:28.830> could<00:00:29.340> glide<00:00:29.580> do

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
flying-type pokémon could glide do

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.460 
flying-type pokémon could glide do
better<00:00:29.970> on<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> base<00:00:30.330> speed<00:00:30.480> still<00:00:31.170> enough<00:00:31.349> to

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
better on the base speed still enough to

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.959 
better on the base speed still enough to
get<00:00:31.590> decent<00:00:31.769> outs<00:00:32.040> feeds<00:00:32.340> does<00:00:32.610> put<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:32.940> a

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
get decent outs feeds does put you in a

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.970 
get decent outs feeds does put you in a
really<00:00:33.059> good<00:00:33.239> scarf<00:00:33.540> range<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.110> again<00:00:34.290> 120

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
really good scarf range and again 120

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.100 
really good scarf range and again 120
attack<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.370> going<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.640> be<00:00:35.700> very<00:00:36.090> very<00:00:36.630> crushing

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
attack is going to be very very crushing

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.750 
attack is going to be very very crushing
with<00:00:37.230> high<00:00:37.380> damage<00:00:37.620> moves<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.340> we're<00:00:38.489> looking

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
with high damage moves so we're looking

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.910 
with high damage moves so we're looking
at<00:00:38.879> its<00:00:39.030> typing<00:00:39.540> flying<00:00:40.079> normal<00:00:40.379> type<00:00:40.530> already

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
at its typing flying normal type already

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.530 
at its typing flying normal type already
talked<00:00:41.100> about<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.430> just<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.760> bit<00:00:41.910> but<00:00:42.300> we<00:00:42.420> have

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
talked about that just a bit but we have

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.209 
talked about that just a bit but we have
three<00:00:42.899> main<00:00:43.050> weaknesses<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.620> worry<00:00:43.770> about<00:00:43.860> and

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
three main weaknesses to worry about and

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.680 
three main weaknesses to worry about and
it's<00:00:44.430> going<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.700> be<00:00:44.789> your<00:00:44.940> flying<00:00:45.180> weaknesses

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
it's going to be your flying weaknesses

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.290 
it's going to be your flying weaknesses
Rock<00:00:46.170> electric<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.770> ice<00:00:46.920> now<00:00:47.370> Sims<00:00:47.789> flying

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
Rock electric and ice now Sims flying

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.090 
Rock electric and ice now Sims flying
resists<00:00:48.870> fighting<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.410> normal<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:49.950> weak

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
resists fighting and normal is weak

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.470 
resists fighting and normal is weak
against<00:00:50.340> fighting<00:00:50.730> but<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:50.969> have<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.329> dual

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
against fighting but we have the dual

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.910 
against fighting but we have the dual
typing<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.230> just<00:00:52.440> kind<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.590> becomes<00:00:52.829> a

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
typing that just kind of becomes a

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.830 
typing that just kind of becomes a
neutral<00:00:53.190> hit<00:00:53.370> but<00:00:53.789> we<00:00:53.879> keep<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.300> immunity<00:00:54.719> to

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
neutral hit but we keep that immunity to

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.240 
neutral hit but we keep that immunity to
ghost<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.289> then<00:00:55.410> we<00:00:55.530> also<00:00:55.710> have<00:00:55.920> ground

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
ghost and then we also have ground

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.410 
ghost and then we also have ground
immunity<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.910> then<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> couple<00:00:57.329> of

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
immunity and then a couple of

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.660 
immunity and then a couple of
resistances<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.170> really<00:00:58.770> fairly<00:00:59.309> just

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
resistances so really fairly just

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.040 
resistances so really fairly just
balanced<00:00:59.969> typing<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.570> we<00:01:00.690> have<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.899> worry

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
balanced typing that we have to worry

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.420 
balanced typing that we have to worry
about<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.230> couple<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.590> flying<00:01:01.800> weaknesses<00:01:02.280> that

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
about a couple of flying weaknesses that

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.039 
about a couple of flying weaknesses that
are<00:01:02.520> pretty<00:01:02.670> standard<00:01:02.940> but<00:01:03.270> past<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.809> we're

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
are pretty standard but past that we're

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.660 
are pretty standard but past that we're
going<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.260> do<00:01:04.379> pretty<00:01:04.799> well<00:01:04.890> hopping<00:01:05.580> into

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
going to do pretty well hopping into

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.219 
going to do pretty well hopping into
Pokemon<00:01:05.970> showdown<00:01:06.030> we<00:01:06.600> get<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.840> see<00:01:07.049> these

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
Pokemon showdown we get to see these

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.109 
Pokemon showdown we get to see these
high<00:01:07.530> damage<00:01:07.860> moves<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.340> staraptor<00:01:08.549> uses

these have stabbed the other one is

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.789 
these have stabbed the other one is
actually<00:01:15.659> going<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.049> hit<00:01:16.140> super<00:01:16.409> effective

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
actually going to hit super effective

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.100 
actually going to hit super effective
for<00:01:17.130> what<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.460> resisted<00:01:18.000> now<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.479> idea<00:01:18.900> is

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
for what is resisted now the idea is

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.960 
for what is resisted now the idea is
well<00:01:19.350> why<00:01:19.530> have<00:01:19.740> double<00:01:20.100> edge<00:01:20.250> if<00:01:20.520> you're

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
well why have double edge if you're

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.249

with some other way around that Pokemon

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.420 
with some other way around that Pokemon
because<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.380> staraptor<00:01:37.619> isn't<00:01:38.100> gonna<00:01:38.189> do<00:01:38.400> it

because the staraptor isn't gonna do it

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.429 
because the staraptor isn't gonna do it
and<00:01:38.640> then<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.240> turn<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.900> tune<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> good

and then you turn you tune is a good

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.539 
and then you turn you tune is a good
move<00:01:40.590> when<00:01:40.770> you're<00:01:40.890> using<00:01:41.040> something<00:01:41.340> like<00:01:41.460> a

much damage you may ask let's look at

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.209 
much damage you may ask let's look at
talonflame

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
talonflame

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.880 
talonflame
now<00:02:02.460> talonflame<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.240> fairly<00:02:03.890> incomparable

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
now talonflame is fairly incomparable

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.920 
now talonflame is fairly incomparable
while<00:02:05.130> being<00:02:05.340> very<00:02:05.430> comparable<00:02:06.180> because<00:02:06.540> gale

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
while being very comparable because gale

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.570 
while being very comparable because gale
wings<00:02:07.140> okay<00:02:07.320> gale<00:02:07.649> wings<00:02:07.829> gives<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.190> +1

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
wings okay gale wings gives it a +1

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.369 
wings okay gale wings gives it a +1
priority<00:02:09.090> but<00:02:09.539> at<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.750> same<00:02:09.899> time<00:02:10.110> if<00:02:10.319> you

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
priority but at the same time if you

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.589 
priority but at the same time if you
have<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.530> 450<00:02:11.310> speed<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.970> really<00:02:12.300> doesn't

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
have a 450 speed it really doesn't

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.199 
have a 450 speed it really doesn't
matter<00:02:12.690> now

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
matter now

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.209 
matter now
so<00:02:13.420> I<00:02:13.450> was<00:02:13.599> doing<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.870> math<00:02:14.019> and<00:02:14.290> say<00:02:14.890> we<00:02:15.069> have

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:15.219 
so I was doing the math and say we have

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:17.069 
so I was doing the math and say we have
like<00:02:15.370> an<00:02:15.519> admin<00:02:15.939> talonflame<00:02:16.450> with<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.870> choice

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
like an admin talonflame with a choice

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.140 
like an admin talonflame with a choice
ban<00:02:17.379> coming<00:02:17.980> in<00:02:18.099> with<00:02:18.219> brave<00:02:18.459> bird<00:02:18.700> well

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
ban coming in with brave bird well

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.429 
ban coming in with brave bird well
actually<00:02:19.299> if<00:02:19.510> you're<00:02:19.599> using<00:02:19.719> a<00:02:19.870> star<00:02:20.140> Raptor

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:20.439 
actually if you're using a star Raptor

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.349 
actually if you're using a star Raptor
with<00:02:20.590> reckless<00:02:21.219> even<00:02:21.579> though<00:02:21.849> you're<00:02:22.030> using<00:02:22.150> a

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:22.359 
with reckless even though you're using a

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:23.970 
with reckless even though you're using a
toy<00:02:22.540> scarf<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.989> reckless<00:02:23.349> boost<00:02:23.560> with<00:02:23.829> the

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
toy scarf the reckless boost with the

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.979 
toy scarf the reckless boost with the
higher<00:02:24.129> attack<00:02:24.459> is<00:02:24.700> going<00:02:25.329> to<00:02:25.480> be<00:02:25.629> I<00:02:25.870> think

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
higher attack is going to be I think

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.199 
higher attack is going to be I think
slightly<00:02:26.680> more<00:02:27.099> damaged<00:02:27.519> than<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.969> choice

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
slightly more damaged than the choice

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.270 
slightly more damaged than the choice
band<00:02:28.510> so<00:02:29.019> you're<00:02:29.290> going<00:02:29.469> to<00:02:29.530> have<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.650> 450

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
band so you're going to have a 450

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.979 
band so you're going to have a 450
Pokemon<00:02:31.180> doing<00:02:31.480> more<00:02:31.599> damage<00:02:31.900> than

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
Pokemon doing more damage than

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.809 
Pokemon doing more damage than
talonflame<00:02:32.409> because<00:02:33.219> of<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.370> way<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.609> stats

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
talonflame because of the way the stats

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.339 
talonflame because of the way the stats
break<00:02:34.060> down<00:02:34.209> but<00:02:34.359> you<00:02:34.480> are<00:02:34.629> scarf<00:02:34.989> but<00:02:35.200> it's

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
break down but you are scarf but it's

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:36.990 
break down but you are scarf but it's
similar<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.709> being<00:02:35.829> choice<00:02:36.040> band<00:02:36.280> locked<00:02:36.519> so

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
similar to being choice band locked so

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.059 
similar to being choice band locked so
really<00:02:37.329> it's<00:02:37.480> just<00:02:37.599> like<00:02:38.049> in<00:02:38.230> priority<00:02:38.709> racela

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
really it's just like in priority racela

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.830 
really it's just like in priority racela
talonflame<00:02:39.370> what<00:02:40.030> makes<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.299> strong<00:02:40.569> as<00:02:40.719> that

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
talonflame what makes it strong as that

Rotom before they set up so you're good

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
to go on that and then you just keep

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.659 
to go on that and then you just keep
these<00:04:11.470> options<00:04:11.829> you<00:04:11.889> know<00:04:12.040> you<00:04:12.099> turn<00:04:12.400> if<00:04:12.579> it

these options you know you turn if it

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.280

time with this let's say your opponent
has<00:04:34.010> low<00:04:34.190> hitpoints<00:04:34.370> well<00:04:34.700> you<00:04:34.760> might<00:04:34.880> as<00:04:34.970> well

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
has low hitpoints well you might as well

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.610 
has low hitpoints well you might as well
just<00:04:35.240> stick<00:04:35.450> with<00:04:35.570> a<00:04:35.630> braver<00:04:36.020> that<00:04:36.470> way<00:04:36.560> you

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
just stick with a braver that way you

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.170 
just stick with a braver that way you
get<00:04:36.770> damage<00:04:37.130> on<00:04:37.250> that<00:04:37.370> pokemon<00:04:37.760> potentially

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
get damage on that pokemon potentially

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.700 
get damage on that pokemon potentially
knock<00:04:38.330> it<00:04:38.480> out<00:04:38.600> and<00:04:38.780> then<00:04:39.080> you<00:04:39.170> can<00:04:39.320> get<00:04:39.410> damage

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
knock it out and then you can get damage

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.170 
knock it out and then you can get damage
on<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:39.890> next<00:04:40.100> Pokemon<00:04:40.430> instead<00:04:40.970> of<00:04:41.060> just

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
on the next Pokemon instead of just

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.150 
on the next Pokemon instead of just
going<00:04:41.300> for<00:04:41.510> the<00:04:41.570> final<00:04:41.900> gambit<00:04:42.260> this<00:04:42.650> is<00:04:42.800> very

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
going for the final gambit this is very

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.950 
going for the final gambit this is very
powerful<00:04:43.490> in<00:04:43.850> battle<00:04:44.450> spot<00:04:44.660> because<00:04:44.930> you

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
powerful in battle spot because you

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.840 
powerful in battle spot because you
pretty<00:04:45.230> much<00:04:45.380> make<00:04:45.590> it<00:04:45.710> a<00:04:45.800> 2v2<00:04:46.100> really<00:04:46.550> quickly

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
pretty much make it a 2v2 really quickly

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.580 
pretty much make it a 2v2 really quickly
if<00:04:47.030> you<00:04:47.390> play<00:04:47.540> the<00:04:47.660> right<00:04:47.780> to<00:04:47.930> Pokemon<00:04:48.350> it<00:04:48.500> can

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
if you play the right to Pokemon it can

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.020 
if you play the right to Pokemon it can
be<00:04:48.680> really<00:04:48.890> good<00:04:49.040> or<00:04:49.250> you<00:04:49.520> can<00:04:49.640> use<00:04:49.760> this<00:04:49.880> in

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
be really good or you can use this in

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.760 
be really good or you can use this in
doubles<00:04:50.450> with<00:04:50.510> a<00:04:50.660> feint<00:04:50.960> pretty<00:04:51.440> much<00:04:51.590> what

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
doubles with a feint pretty much what

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.620 
doubles with a feint pretty much what
feint<00:04:51.950> does<00:04:52.130> is<00:04:52.310> it<00:04:52.460> nullifies<00:04:52.730> protect<00:04:53.480> that

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
feint does is it nullifies protect that

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.090 
feint does is it nullifies protect that
it<00:04:53.780> hits<00:04:53.960> with<00:04:54.110> priority<00:04:54.560> and<00:04:54.740> then<00:04:54.890> it<00:04:55.010> breaks

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
it hits with priority and then it breaks

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.590 
it hits with priority and then it breaks
the<00:04:55.280> protect<00:04:55.580> and<00:04:55.760> then<00:04:55.850> star<00:04:56.030> actor<00:04:56.300> can<00:04:56.450> come

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
the protect and then star actor can come

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.000 
the protect and then star actor can come
in<00:04:56.720> so<00:04:57.170> pretty<00:04:57.350> much<00:04:57.440> it's<00:04:57.650> just<00:04:57.740> a<00:04:57.830> good<00:04:57.950> way

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
in so pretty much it's just a good way

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.410 
in so pretty much it's just a good way
to<00:04:58.130> guarantee<00:04:58.340> a<00:04:58.550> one-for-one<00:04:58.940> if<00:04:59.270> they're

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
to guarantee a one-for-one if they're

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.180 
to guarantee a one-for-one if they're
not<00:04:59.570> using<00:04:59.960> fake<00:05:00.110> out<00:05:00.290> that<00:05:00.680> way<00:05:00.770> you<00:05:00.830> can<00:05:01.010> kind

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
not using fake out that way you can kind

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.130 
not using fake out that way you can kind
of<00:05:01.280> like<00:05:01.400> predict<00:05:01.730> to<00:05:01.820> protect<00:05:02.180> feint<00:05:02.720> final

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
of like predict to protect feint final

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.660 
of like predict to protect feint final
gamut<00:05:03.440> and<00:05:03.590> then<00:05:03.770> the<00:05:04.010> one<00:05:04.280> of<00:05:04.370> your<00:05:04.490> phone's

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 
gamut and then the one of your phone's

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.370 
gamut and then the one of your phone's
Pokemon<00:05:05.030> only<00:05:05.240> hits<00:05:05.390> the<00:05:05.480> other<00:05:05.600> one<00:05:05.840> it's<00:05:06.350> a

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
Pokemon only hits the other one it's a

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.870 
Pokemon only hits the other one it's a
nice<00:05:06.650> little<00:05:06.860> way<00:05:07.070> of<00:05:07.220> making<00:05:07.490> it<00:05:07.550> like<00:05:07.700> to

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
nice little way of making it like to

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.920 
nice little way of making it like to
where<00:05:07.970> you<00:05:08.060> can<00:05:08.150> balance<00:05:08.300> out<00:05:08.540> by<00:05:08.690> trading

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
where you can balance out by trading

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.630 
where you can balance out by trading
star<00:05:09.200> after<00:05:09.380> for<00:05:09.950> potentially<00:05:10.310> one<00:05:10.430> of<00:05:10.460> their

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
star after for potentially one of their

be<00:06:28.250> enough<00:06:28.490> and<00:06:28.670> then<00:06:28.790> the<00:06:28.880> intimidate<00:06:29.240> is

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
be enough and then the intimidate is

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.610 
be enough and then the intimidate is
just<00:06:29.570> there<00:06:29.690> for<00:06:29.840> your<00:06:29.960> tankyness<00:06:30.350> that<00:06:30.530> you

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:30.620 
just there for your tankyness that you

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.020 
just there for your tankyness that you
lower<00:06:30.800> their<00:06:31.010> attack<00:06:31.250> you<00:06:31.640> might<00:06:31.790> be<00:06:31.880> able<00:06:31.970> to

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.030 
lower their attack you might be able to

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.700 
lower their attack you might be able to
survive<00:06:32.210> a<00:06:32.360> hit<00:06:32.540> as<00:06:32.690> that<00:06:32.840> star<00:06:33.050> Raptor<00:06:33.380> even

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
survive a hit as that star Raptor even

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.350 
survive a hit as that star Raptor even
after<00:06:33.920> taking<00:06:34.040> recoil<00:06:34.580> you<00:06:34.970> get<00:06:35.120> in<00:06:35.240> that

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
after taking recoil you get in that

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.100 
after taking recoil you get in that
second<00:06:35.690> hit<00:06:35.810> and<00:06:35.930> then<00:06:36.080> you're<00:06:36.169> trading<00:06:36.380> one

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
second hit and then you're trading one

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.050 
second hit and then you're trading one
us<00:06:37.200> or<00:06:37.830> so<00:06:38.010> for<00:06:38.190> that<00:06:38.280> star<00:06:38.460> after<00:06:38.730> and<00:06:38.940> it's

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
us or so for that star after and it's

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.370 
us or so for that star after and it's
still<00:06:39.210> really<00:06:39.330> good<00:06:39.450> while<00:06:39.690> also<00:06:39.900> having<00:06:40.260> that

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380 
still really good while also having that

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.650 
still really good while also having that
intimidate<00:06:40.800> threat<00:06:41.040> out<00:06:41.190> there<00:06:41.220> and<00:06:41.660> that's

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 
intimidate threat out there and that's

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.080 
intimidate threat out there and that's
pretty<00:06:42.900> much<00:06:43.020> it<00:06:43.170> so<00:06:43.530> star<00:06:44.160> Raptor<00:06:44.550> really

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.090 
pretty much it so star Raptor really

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.640 
pretty much it so star Raptor really
crazy<00:06:45.300> Pokemon<00:06:45.720> really<00:06:46.080> powerful<00:06:46.470> high
