his hand to summon asked five Harry on
and<00:02:07.340> for<00:02:07.549> some<00:02:07.789> reason<00:02:07.820> I<00:02:08.450> thought<00:02:09.170> plasma

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
and for some reason I thought plasma

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.830 
and for some reason I thought plasma
could<00:02:10.039> protect<00:02:10.459> yourself<00:02:10.819> be<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:11.330> his<00:02:11.420> effect

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
could protect yourself be to his effect

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.030 
could protect yourself be to his effect
but<00:02:12.140> it<00:02:12.200> has<00:02:12.560> no<00:02:12.830> such<00:02:13.099> effect<00:02:14.290> so<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.709> gets<00:02:15.920> a

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
but it has no such effect so it gets a

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.420 
but it has no such effect so it gets a
student<00:02:16.459> battle<00:02:16.760> 250<00:02:17.330> points<00:02:17.569> d'Ange<00:02:17.840> I
