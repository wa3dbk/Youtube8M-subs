00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.880 
aperture just as remember when we had it
together<00:01:44.909> from<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.420> factory<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.020> we<00:01:46.710> just

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
together from the factory so we just

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.889 
together from the factory so we just
kind<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.159> place<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.909> rotate<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.600> around<00:01:48.659> a

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
kind of place it and rotate it around a

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.690 
kind of place it and rotate it around a
little<00:01:48.960> bit<00:01:49.170> until<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.500> snaps<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:50.070> place<00:01:50.100> and

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
little bit until it snaps in place and

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.690 
little bit until it snaps in place and
then<00:01:51.570> we<00:01:51.840> are<00:01:52.110> going<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.619> do<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> quick<00:01:53.100> check<00:01:53.460> of

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
then we are going to do a quick check of

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.789 
then we are going to do a quick check of
course<00:01:54.149> everything<00:01:54.930> still<00:01:55.170> works<00:01:55.409> since<00:01:55.680> we

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
course everything still works since we

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.740 
course everything still works since we
really<00:01:56.130> didn't<00:01:56.490> have<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.909> mess<00:01:57.119> with<00:01:57.450> the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
really didn't have to mess with the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.469 
really didn't have to mess with the
inner<00:01:58.070> mechanisms<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.549> lens<00:01:59.729> itself<00:02:00.090> and

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
inner mechanisms of the lens itself and

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.190 
inner mechanisms of the lens itself and
we<00:02:01.350> can<00:02:01.740> use<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.610> front<00:02:03.119> insert<00:02:03.570> ring<00:02:03.869> and

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
we can use the front insert ring and

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.830 
we can use the front insert ring and
just<00:02:04.619> screw<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.070> back<00:02:05.310> down<00:02:05.579> again<00:02:05.810> note<00:02:06.810> that

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
just screw it back down again note that

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.869 
just screw it back down again note that
I'm<00:02:07.079> working<00:02:07.409> opposite<00:02:07.890> sides<00:02:08.160> here<00:02:08.759> of

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
I'm working opposite sides here of

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.820 
I'm working opposite sides here of
course<00:02:09.179> these<00:02:09.420> things<00:02:09.479> flex<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.379> Bend<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.679> bit

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
course these things flex and Bend a bit

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.190 
course these things flex and Bend a bit
so<00:02:11.550> going<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.750> all

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
so going and all

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.400 
so going and all
dating<00:02:13.560> around<00:02:13.830> will<00:02:14.730> just<00:02:15.090> screw<00:02:15.989> this<00:02:16.140> down

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
dating around will just screw this down

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.790 
dating around will just screw this down
and<00:02:16.950> we're<00:02:17.670> done<00:02:17.879> this<00:02:18.720> was<00:02:18.989> incredibly

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
and we're done this was incredibly

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.949 
and we're done this was incredibly
simple<00:02:20.250> compared<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.700> some<00:02:20.940> other<00:02:21.060> lenses<00:02:21.510> and

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
simple compared to some other lenses and

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.650 
simple compared to some other lenses and
you<00:02:22.950> don't<00:02:23.129> have<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.489> go<00:02:23.640> super<00:02:23.970> crazy<00:02:24.390> would

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
you don't have to go super crazy would

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.000 
you don't have to go super crazy would
make<00:02:24.840> them<00:02:24.959> this<00:02:25.110> tight<00:02:25.349> because<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.800> last

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
make them this tight because the last

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.229 
make them this tight because the last
thing<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.340> want<00:02:26.489> to<00:02:26.550> do<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:26.879> have<00:02:27.090> the

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120
