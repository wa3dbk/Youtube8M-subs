with<00:00:34.840> my<00:00:34.960> grandparents<00:00:35.620> and<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:37.180> it's<00:00:37.329> great

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
with my grandparents and so it's great

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.300

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.310 
to have Amir and I was absolutely

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.940

delighted<00:00:39.610> with<00:00:39.910> our<00:00:40.060> performance

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
delighted with our performance

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.160 
delighted with our performance
considering<00:00:41.950> that<00:00:42.040> we<00:00:42.190> played<00:00:43.140> three<00:00:44.140> games

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
considering that we played three games

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.740 
considering that we played three games
in<00:00:44.560> four<00:00:44.800> days<00:00:45.070> and<00:00:45.520> the<00:00:46.059> opposition<00:00:46.329> has

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
in four days and the opposition has

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.049 
in four days and the opposition has
progressively<00:00:47.200> got<00:00:47.620> better<00:00:47.860> I<00:00:48.190> thought<00:00:48.940> it

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
progressively got better I thought it

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:50.639 
progressively got better I thought it
