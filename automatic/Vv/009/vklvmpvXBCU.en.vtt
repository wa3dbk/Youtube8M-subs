it's<00:00:00.719> an<00:00:01.050> eight<00:00:01.860> would<00:00:02.129> be<00:00:03.589> 24<00:00:05.359> hybrid<00:00:07.309> bicycle

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 
it's an eight would be 24 hybrid bicycle

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.940 
it's an eight would be 24 hybrid bicycle
electric<00:00:09.540> bicycle<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.700> as<00:00:11.700> you<00:00:12.540> know<00:00:12.750> it's<00:00:13.500> it

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
electric bicycle and as you know it's it

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.870 
electric bicycle and as you know it's it
can<00:00:14.190> be<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:14.580> phase<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:16.369> pedal<00:00:17.369> assist

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
can be this phase the pedal assist

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.269 
can be this phase the pedal assist
sensor<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.410> guy<00:00:19.619> who<00:00:19.680> owned<00:00:20.039> this

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
sensor and the guy who owned this

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.620 
sensor and the guy who owned this
bicycle<00:00:20.820> asked<00:00:21.420> me<00:00:21.800> to<00:00:22.800> put<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.210> twist<00:00:24.210> throttle

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
bicycle asked me to put a twist throttle

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.040 
bicycle asked me to put a twist throttle
and<00:00:25.939> that<00:00:26.939> we<00:00:27.750> can<00:00:27.960> control<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.560> motto<00:00:29.929> it<00:00:30.929> is

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
and that we can control the motto it is

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.860 
and that we can control the motto it is
a<00:00:31.080> very<00:00:31.439> nice<00:00:32.510> 250<00:00:33.510> watts<00:00:33.750> motto<00:00:35.570> by<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.630> way

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
a very nice 250 watts motto by the way

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.069 
a very nice 250 watts motto by the way
it<00:00:36.930> looks<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.670> guess<00:00:38.670> because<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.570> can<00:00:39.809> work

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
it looks I guess because it can work

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.440 
it looks I guess because it can work
even<00:00:41.390> in<00:00:42.829> 350<00:00:43.829> watts<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.430> even<00:00:45.059> more<00:00:45.239> than

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
even in 350 watts and even more than

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.490 
even in 350 watts and even more than
that<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:47.550> main<00:00:47.700> problem<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.660> controller

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
that the main problem is the controller

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.979 
that the main problem is the controller
where<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.340> controller<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.239> found<00:00:51.780> it

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
where is the controller so I found it

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.420 
where is the controller so I found it
it's<00:00:52.770> here<00:00:53.300> down<00:00:55.039> inside<00:00:56.899> you<00:00:57.899> can<00:00:58.079> see<00:00:58.430> some

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
it's here down inside you can see some

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:07.670 
it's here down inside you can see some
hybrid<00:01:00.090> 24<00:01:01.399> controller<00:01:02.399> made<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.420> Taiwan<00:01:06.680> it

very small pins yes this is the Olson

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.980 
very small pins yes this is the Olson
source<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.950> sensors<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.939> tell<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
source the the sensors that tell the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.170 
source the the sensors that tell the
controller<00:01:41.150> in<00:01:42.150> what<00:01:42.360> stage<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.079> motor<00:01:43.590> is

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
controller in what stage the motor is

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.399 
controller in what stage the motor is
here<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:45.450> see<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.780> pin<00:01:48.049> yeah<00:01:49.049> there<00:01:49.259> is

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
here you can see this pin yeah there is

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.700 
here you can see this pin yeah there is
a<00:01:50.000> six<00:01:51.680> pins<00:01:52.680> inside<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.189> don't<00:01:53.460> know<00:01:53.700> actually

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
a six pins inside I don't know actually

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.880 
a six pins inside I don't know actually
I<00:01:55.710> don't<00:01:56.219> have<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.509> wiring<00:01:58.229> diagram<00:01:58.740> of

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
I don't have the the wiring diagram of

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.060 
I don't have the the wiring diagram of
this<00:01:59.100> motor<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.759> if<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.240> can<00:02:00.390> send<00:02:00.719> me<00:02:01.070> it

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
this motor so if you can send me it

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.480 
this motor so if you can send me it
would<00:02:02.280> be<00:02:02.490> really<00:02:02.700> great<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:04.040> I'm<00:02:05.040> going<00:02:05.340> to

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
would be really great and I'm going to

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.820 
would be really great and I'm going to
try<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.390> replace<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.649> with<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:09.410> 250<00:02:10.410> watts

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
try and replace it with a 250 watts
