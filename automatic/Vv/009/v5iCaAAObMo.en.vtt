00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
for this is still the same you can see

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.149 
for this is still the same you can see
on<00:01:31.649> the<00:01:31.740> back<00:01:31.890> here<00:01:32.240> it's<00:01:33.240> flat<00:01:33.890> okay<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:34.950> they

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
on the back here it's flat okay so they

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.099 
on the back here it's flat okay so they
detailed<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.700> one<00:01:35.819> side<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.539> side<00:01:36.749> of<00:01:36.929> it<00:01:37.020> is

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.109 
detailed on one side this side of it is

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:39.379 
detailed on one side this side of it is
flat<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.579> reason<00:01:38.880> for<00:01:38.969> that<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.240> because

00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:39.389 
flat and the reason for that is because

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:41.059 
flat and the reason for that is because
if<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.719> take<00:01:39.869> Skeletor<00:01:40.409> sword<00:01:40.770> which<00:01:41.039> is

identical to this one except purple and
you<00:01:44.130> put<00:01:44.340> them<00:01:44.460> back<00:01:44.609> to<00:01:44.819> back<00:01:45.859> this<00:01:46.859> piece

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.010 
skeletal at the other half of the sword
and<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.139> was<00:02:04.259> supposed<00:02:04.499> to<00:02:04.649> make<00:02:04.859> em<00:02:05.749> one<00:02:06.749> big

and it was supposed to make em one big
powerful<00:02:07.560> sword<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.690> obviously<00:02:09.690> the

powerful sword and obviously the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.570 
powerful sword and obviously the
Filmation<00:02:10.319> series<00:02:10.619> in<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.800> 80s<00:02:11.130> didn't<00:02:11.459> go

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
Filmation series in the 80s didn't go

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.250 
Filmation series in the 80s didn't go
with<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.819> concept<00:02:12.300> there<00:02:12.690> was<00:02:12.780> actually<00:02:13.080> no

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
with that concept there was actually no

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.380 
with that concept there was actually no

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
mention of that at all so all that

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.160 
mention of that at all so all that
happened<00:02:18.690> was<00:02:18.840> Prince<00:02:19.770> Adam<00:02:19.950> was<00:02:20.160> given<00:02:20.430> this

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.540 
happened was Prince Adam was given this
whenever<00:02:22.170> he<00:02:22.410> man<00:02:22.590> was<00:02:22.740> needed<00:02:23.040> he'd<00:02:23.190> hold<00:02:23.370> it

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
whenever he man was needed he'd hold it

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.309 
whenever he man was needed he'd hold it
high<00:02:23.670> above<00:02:23.730> his<00:02:24.000> head<00:02:24.150> say<00:02:24.630> by<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.900> power<00:02:25.170> of

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
high above his head say by the power of

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.190 
high above his head say by the power of
Grayskull<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:27.450> was<00:02:27.540> all<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:27.690> need<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:28.020> do

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
Grayskull and that was all I need to do

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.050 
Grayskull and that was all I need to do
then<00:02:28.410> he-man<00:02:28.710> would<00:02:28.890> come<00:02:29.040> along<00:02:29.250> he'd<00:02:29.940> become

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
then he-man would come along he'd become

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.800 
then he-man would come along he'd become
he-man<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.740> go<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:31.890> do<00:02:31.950> his<00:02:32.040> stuff

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
he-man and go and do his stuff

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.100 
he-man and go and do his stuff
but<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.050> figure<00:02:34.290> itself<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:35.010> quite<00:02:35.790> basic

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
but the figure itself is quite basic

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.970 
but the figure itself is quite basic
there<00:02:37.110> aren't<00:02:37.350> like<00:02:37.470> I<00:02:37.590> said<00:02:37.740> there<00:02:37.860> are<00:02:37.890> no

gimmicks<00:02:38.340> on<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:39.650> it's<00:02:40.650> quite<00:02:40.980> so

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
gimmicks on it and it's quite so

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.510 
gimmicks on it and it's quite so

color<00:03:01.350> I'm<00:03:01.620> not<00:03:01.800> sure<00:03:01.980> because<00:03:02.220> they<00:03:02.520> thought

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
color I'm not sure because they thought

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.160 
color I'm not sure because they thought
if<00:03:03.209> they<00:03:03.440> actually<00:03:04.440> gave<00:03:04.739> him<00:03:04.860> a<00:03:04.980> pink<00:03:05.430> jacket

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.070 
actually stick it in behind there if you
wanted<00:06:48.800> to<00:06:49.010> carry<00:06:49.520> it<00:06:49.640> around<00:06:49.700> but<00:06:50.150> it<00:06:50.240> just<00:06:50.570> it

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 
wanted to carry it around but it just it

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.030 
wanted to carry it around but it just it
doesn't<00:06:51.260> work<00:06:51.740> very<00:06:51.770> well<00:06:52.010> at<00:06:52.280> that<00:06:52.400> really

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:54.040 
doesn't work very well at that really

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.320 
doesn't work very well at that really
there's<00:06:55.040> no<00:06:55.160> f1<00:06:55.460> to<00:06:55.610> store<00:06:55.850> it<00:06:55.940> so<00:06:56.090> you<00:06:56.180> can

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:56.330 
there's no f1 to store it so you can

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.030 
there's no f1 to store it so you can
either<00:06:56.420> put<00:06:56.750> it<00:06:56.810> in<00:06:56.900> this<00:06:57.080> hand<00:06:57.320> like<00:06:59.650> that<00:07:00.650> but

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:01.040 
either put it in this hand like that but

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.200 
either put it in this hand like that but
the<00:07:01.130> trouble<00:07:01.400> is<00:07:01.460> then<00:07:01.670> you<00:07:01.790> think<00:07:01.910> you<00:07:02.060> can

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.210 
the trouble is then you think you can

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.360 
the trouble is then you think you can
see<00:07:02.360> the<00:07:02.480> flat<00:07:02.750> edge<00:07:02.900> of<00:07:03.080> it<00:07:03.170> like<00:07:03.320> that<00:07:03.350> and<00:07:04.220> it

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:04.370 
see the flat edge of it like that and it

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.910 
see the flat edge of it like that and it
looks<00:07:04.700> good<00:07:04.940> when<00:07:05.150> it's<00:07:05.530> focusing<00:07:06.530> outwards

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:06.920 
looks good when it's focusing outwards

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.270 
looks good when it's focusing outwards
like<00:07:06.980> this<00:07:07.270> or<00:07:08.270> you<00:07:08.450> can<00:07:08.540> put<00:07:08.780> it<00:07:09.250> with<00:07:10.250> a

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280 
like this or you can put it with a

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:15.670 
like this or you can put it with a
little<00:07:10.540> support<00:07:11.540> thing<00:07:12.160> in<00:07:13.160> this<00:07:13.400> hand<00:07:14.680> looks

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 
little support thing in this hand looks

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.840 
little support thing in this hand looks
a<00:07:15.770> little<00:07:15.860> bit<00:07:16.070> better<00:07:16.220> because<00:07:16.400> you<00:07:16.580> can<00:07:16.670> see

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:16.850 
a little bit better because you can see

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:21.640 
a little bit better because you can see
the<00:07:16.940> front<00:07:17.180> of<00:07:17.240> it<00:07:17.360> there<00:07:19.540> okay<00:07:20.540> that's<00:07:21.470> all
