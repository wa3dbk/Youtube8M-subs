00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.850
 with your sea but we are not satisfied 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.480
 self-critical I say that I felt that he is 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.879
 missing to win a game 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.459
 and for the moment read the matches of 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:17.099
 intelligence be to pause as 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:19.380
 very fast recover I want to go out to 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:22.470
 make a goal and that generates in precisions 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.360
 that the opponent takes the ball and about 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.400
 everything today when giovani did the 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:31.109
 difference because in the first time 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.120
 for they gave much advantage they left many 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.600
 spaces and there could be 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.430
 paid more expensive yes yes 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.650
 that is, we are not satisfied with the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.420
 performance is clear but good in 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.130
 this moment the most important thing not to lose 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.860
 the calm 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.320
 but lit and hope that 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.960
 we can go ahead working and 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.600
 trusting the partner what yes 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:01.460
 we have to do everything is because we are 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.460
 giving time a while 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.090
 we made cotton and that gives you confidence 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.670
 has thought about match times for 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.220
 he wins because he looked or is behind and I do not 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.930
 generated many problems only the 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.940
 city the goal then one that capped down 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.549
 from Giovanni too and a center does 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.270
 little work in a match is because 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.270
 knock down attempt 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:29.040
 the team in front but as really 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.780
 this worries that it can not be found 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.100
 the victory that there are five matches 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.740
 consecutive draws a defeat that 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:41.430
 Worry can not add to 3 d especially 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.950
 in the condition of local is that nothing more 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.380
 what we will try now as not 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.880
 can win local and visitor is 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.119
 knows beyond the conditions 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.740
 we have now flowers are earning like 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.930
 we always do if we can play well 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.009
 well and if not with attitude and until 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.570
 We can contain an operation 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.920
 space a bit of luck also in 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.560
 this 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.159
 that is, there are many factors that have to 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.190
 be on your side luck 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.670
 have a good afternoon and we have good 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.050
 had perhaps party in which we have 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.300
 been very good but sometimes it has 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.410
 arrived 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.980
 the referees with regard to the kitchen are 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.790
 he directed very just had very well and the 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.379
 Luck is important in fire 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.790
 taking into account the reality of the 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.099
 numbers that made six games that did not 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.629
 they win today if you can already say that they do not 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.280
 can think about the championship and they continue 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.750
 score as many points for 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.120
 escape a bit from this area in which 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.150
 such 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.000
 I do not stop dreaming 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:48.099
 that is, mathematically they are very 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.400
 I'm not foolish either, what I 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.769
 yes we know that nothing is written and nothing 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.569
 saying 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.810
 suppose you get a streak starting 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:01.200
 of Sunday of 34 consecutive victory and 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:05.739
 the theme changes 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:08.769
 nothing else when we win and you will look for 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.780
 that this river and where in the 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.770
 table is given the carrier is placed for 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.040
 win this moment 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:19.130
 good is not missing being able to play well 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.670
 that is, we are perhaps earning the points 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.320
 for enthusiasm or because the 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.570
 people are not supporting much and do not 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.520
 we must them that is the games we know 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:32.810
 that we are missing a lot we do not achieve 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:35.630
 give five consecutive passes and that accomplishes 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.570
 a lot of imprecision and the rival 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.250
 in the face of this inaccuracy, it takes a 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.710
 he also plays rival if he leaves 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.390
 play is very likely to suffer from 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.550
 variable husband we can not pretend 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.010
 neither of a player because it denies 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.380
 football for injuries or positions of 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.240
 a technician between nissan in players and 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.270
 what we try to do during 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.430
 the whole week as the biggest thing in the 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.770
 message that this we have to be 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:06.010
 well for the fun of the moment and good me 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.010
 I believe in my point of view that when I peel 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.630
 what matters is that it's against the mouth 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.530
 we have to win 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:23.040
 press does not press or is it not 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.770
 misunderstand you want to win a classic what 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.230
 has the fan has the player that 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.970
 It would be the cutest thing but we have to 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.340
 understand that if we think well look for 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.680
 soneros what we have I go and we can not 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.630
 give the luxuries to lose points yo 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.730
 I wrote forest and we want to win 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.970
 and be able to achieve the three points that is what 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.500
 that there is no peace and time that 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.150
 I always think about what we do 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.000
 a separate party if beyond how 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.970
 come each team in the tournament 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.140
 that day and if anything can happen it 's a 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.140
 different party all
