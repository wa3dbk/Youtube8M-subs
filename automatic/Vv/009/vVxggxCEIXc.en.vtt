really<00:00:20.130> what<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.279> think<00:00:20.520> about<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.060> spawns

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
really what I think about is the spawns

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.300 
really what I think about is the spawns
on<00:00:21.750> demolition<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.500> how<00:00:22.560> bad<00:00:22.769> they<00:00:22.980> are<00:00:23.010> but

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
on demolition and how bad they are but

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.740 
on demolition and how bad they are but
we're<00:00:23.609> not<00:00:23.760> on<00:00:23.789> demolition<00:00:24.090> so<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.510> don't<00:00:24.689> have

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
we're not on demolition so I don't have

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.380 
we're not on demolition so I don't have
to<00:00:24.810> worry<00:00:25.019> about<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:26.090> but<00:00:27.090> I've<00:00:27.210> got<00:00:27.359> a

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
to worry about that but I've got a

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.460 
to worry about that but I've got a
feeling<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.750> I'm<00:00:27.960> gonna<00:00:28.080> have<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.230> decent
