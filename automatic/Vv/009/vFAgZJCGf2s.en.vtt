00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
stocking rocket as well even can be

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.560 
stocking rocket as well even can be
doubled<00:01:04.070> up<00:01:04.130> as<00:01:04.250> a<00:01:04.309> boating<00:01:04.489> rod<00:01:04.820> now<00:01:05.360> let's

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
doubled up as a boating rod now let's

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.150 
doubled up as a boating rod now let's
take<00:01:05.750> a<00:01:05.780> closer<00:01:06.080> look<00:01:06.320> at<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:06.560> carbon<00:01:06.920> blank

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
take a closer look at the carbon blank

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.280 
take a closer look at the carbon blank
now<00:01:07.520> this<00:01:07.700> is<00:01:07.850> constructed<00:01:08.240> using<00:01:08.630> a<00:01:08.840> unique

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
now this is constructed using a unique

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.560 
now this is constructed using a unique
feature<00:01:09.619> this<00:01:10.490> is<00:01:10.670> basically<00:01:11.030> only<00:01:11.180> used<00:01:11.450> by

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
feature this is basically only used by

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.249 
feature this is basically only used by
ProLogic

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
ProLogic

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:14.440 
ProLogic
now<00:01:12.830> this<00:01:13.009> unique<00:01:13.369> feature<00:01:13.550> is<00:01:13.940> a<00:01:13.970> crossover

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
now this unique feature is a crossover

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.600 
now this unique feature is a crossover
core<00:01:14.810> construction<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.830> first<00:01:16.160> time<00:01:16.460> this

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
core construction the first time this

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.340 
core construction the first time this
has<00:01:16.759> ever<00:01:16.880> been<00:01:17.000> used<00:01:17.300> in<00:01:17.479> a<00:01:17.540> cow<00:01:17.720> prod<00:01:17.960> now

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
has ever been used in a cow prod now

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.080 
has ever been used in a cow prod now
what<00:01:18.590> this<00:01:18.710> allows<00:01:18.770> you<00:01:19.220> to<00:01:19.340> do<00:01:19.490> is<00:01:19.670> keep<00:01:19.880> the

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
what this allows you to do is keep the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.389 
what this allows you to do is keep the
blanket<00:01:20.600> of<00:01:20.720> the<00:01:21.050> cabin<00:01:21.440> really<00:01:22.040> thin<00:01:22.250> as<00:01:22.369> you

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
blanket of the cabin really thin as you

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.370 
blanket of the cabin really thin as you
can<00:01:22.520> see<00:01:22.820> there<00:01:23.030> this<00:01:23.210> is<00:01:23.330> a<00:01:23.360> 13<00:01:23.780> foot<00:01:24.020> 3<00:01:24.290> and

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
can see there this is a 13 foot 3 and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.960 
can see there this is a 13 foot 3 and
1/2<00:01:24.470> pound<00:01:24.800> test<00:01:25.009> curve<00:01:25.250> I<00:01:25.399> have<00:01:25.520> in<00:01:25.670> my<00:01:25.790> hand

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
1/2 pound test curve I have in my hand

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.910 
1/2 pound test curve I have in my hand
and<00:01:26.390> it's<00:01:26.509> really<00:01:26.930> really<00:01:27.229> powerful<00:01:27.380> blank

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
and it's really really powerful blank

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.139 
and it's really really powerful blank
you<00:01:28.310> know<00:01:28.340> this<00:01:28.550> is<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.790> one<00:01:28.940> that<00:01:29.060> you're

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
you know this is the one that you're

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:30.670 
you know this is the one that you're
going<00:01:29.270> to<00:01:29.300> use<00:01:29.479> for<00:01:29.509> big<00:01:29.930> distances<00:01:30.470> stuff

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
going to use for big distances stuff

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.520 
going to use for big distances stuff
like<00:01:30.890> that<00:01:31.130> now<00:01:31.729> going<00:01:32.690> back<00:01:32.930> to<00:01:33.080> how<00:01:33.200> this<00:01:33.350> is

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
like that now going back to how this is

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.800 
like that now going back to how this is
constructed<00:01:34.160> basically<00:01:34.940> they've<00:01:35.060> taken<00:01:35.209> a<00:01:35.390> 40

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
constructed basically they've taken a 40

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.669 
constructed basically they've taken a 40
to<00:01:35.929> 46<00:01:36.649> ton<00:01:36.950> carbon<00:01:37.220> wrap<00:01:37.600> now<00:01:38.600> normal<00:01:39.470> carbon

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
to 46 ton carbon wrap now normal carbon

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:41.740 
to 46 ton carbon wrap now normal carbon
blanks<00:01:40.100> are<00:01:40.280> made<00:01:40.520> using<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:41.240> expensive

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
blanks are made using the expensive

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.930 
blanks are made using the expensive
blank<00:01:41.959> on<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.289> outside<00:01:42.709> what<00:01:43.310> we<00:01:43.490> found<00:01:43.759> by

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
blank on the outside what we found by

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.029 
blank on the outside what we found by
putting<00:01:44.240> this<00:01:44.360> in<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.569> car<00:01:44.899> hence<00:01:45.619> the

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
putting this in the car hence the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.400 
putting this in the car hence the
crossover<00:01:46.550> car<00:01:46.729> construction<00:01:47.390> it<00:01:47.720> allows<00:01:48.110> the

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
crossover car construction it allows the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.160 
crossover car construction it allows the
blank<00:01:48.649> to<00:01:48.800> be<00:01:48.920> absolutely<00:01:49.789> pencil<00:01:50.390> thin<00:01:50.630> but

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
blank to be absolutely pencil thin but

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.650 
blank to be absolutely pencil thin but
it<00:01:51.259> still<00:01:51.470> keeps<00:01:51.649> it<00:01:51.860> some<00:01:52.009> rigidity<00:01:52.660> responds

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
it still keeps it some rigidity responds

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.330 
it still keeps it some rigidity responds
really<00:01:53.869> quick<00:01:54.229> and<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.530> feeling<00:01:55.100> that<00:01:55.220> you

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
really quick and the feeling that you

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.859 
really quick and the feeling that you
get<00:01:55.520> through<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:55.850> blank<00:01:56.119> is<00:01:56.300> absolutely

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
get through the blank is absolutely

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:57.460 
get through the blank is absolutely
fantastic

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
fantastic

Fuji<00:02:07.789> KS<00:02:08.209> series<00:02:08.599> guides<00:02:08.840> now<00:02:09.530> these<00:02:09.770> are<00:02:09.979> the

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
Fuji KS series guides now these are the

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.010 
Fuji KS series guides now these are the
kick<00:02:10.250> forward<00:02:10.520> guides<00:02:10.910> which<00:02:11.209> aid<00:02:11.420> casting

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
kick forward guides which aid casting

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.589 
kick forward guides which aid casting
and<00:02:12.200> basically<00:02:12.590> eliminate<00:02:13.459> online<00:02:13.970> fraps<00:02:14.360> or

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
and basically eliminate online fraps or

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.080 
and basically eliminate online fraps or
tangles<00:02:14.990> on<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.290> cast<00:02:15.530> they<00:02:16.340> stand<00:02:16.640> off<00:02:16.790> quite

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
tangles on the cast they stand off quite

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.940 
tangles on the cast they stand off quite
largely<00:02:17.510> as<00:02:17.750> well<00:02:17.959> you<00:02:18.380> know<00:02:18.500> so<00:02:18.620> there's<00:02:18.740> no

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
largely as well you know so there's no

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.620 
largely as well you know so there's no
need<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:19.190> have<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.490> 50<00:02:19.760> ml<00:02:19.910> bought<00:02:20.060> ring<00:02:20.209> anymore

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
need to have a 50 ml bought ring anymore

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.630 
need to have a 50 ml bought ring anymore
basically<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:21.530> 40<00:02:21.830> mil<00:02:22.010> will<00:02:22.220> do<00:02:22.370> it<00:02:22.490> exactly

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
basically the 40 mil will do it exactly

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.059 
basically the 40 mil will do it exactly
the<00:02:23.000> same<00:02:23.090> if<00:02:23.450> not<00:02:23.900> even<00:02:24.050> better<00:02:24.410> now<00:02:25.010> the

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
the same if not even better now the

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.160 
the same if not even better now the
first<00:02:25.400> two<00:02:25.610> rings<00:02:25.910> on<00:02:26.240> all<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.569> blanks<00:02:27.020> are

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
first two rings on all the blanks are

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.190 
first two rings on all the blanks are
double<00:02:27.560> like<00:02:27.709> or<00:02:27.950> trouble<00:02:28.220> like<00:02:28.370> really<00:02:29.200> then

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
double like or trouble like really then

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.780 
double like or trouble like really then
after<00:02:30.470> that<00:02:30.590> we<00:02:30.739> go<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.130> double<00:02:31.400> legs<00:02:31.580> on

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
after that we go to the double legs on

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.680 
after that we go to the double legs on
the<00:02:32.000> tip<00:02:32.180> section<00:02:32.599> now<00:02:32.810> this<00:02:33.050> helps<00:02:33.319> as<00:02:33.620> well

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
the tip section now this helps as well

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.170 
the tip section now this helps as well
alleviate<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.950> unsprung<00:02:37.430> weight<00:02:37.489> in<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:38.030> rod

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
alleviate the unsprung weight in the rod

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.870 
alleviate the unsprung weight in the rod
and<00:02:38.390> it<00:02:38.690> also<00:02:38.900> helps<00:02:39.800> have<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:39.980> quicker<00:02:40.460> action

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
and it also helps have a quicker action

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.490 
and it also helps have a quicker action
in<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.090> tip<00:02:41.300> so<00:02:41.570> that<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.930> tip<00:02:42.110> of<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.320> rods

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
in the tip so that the tip of the rods

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.260 
in the tip so that the tip of the rods
not<00:02:42.680> floppy<00:02:43.070> it's<00:02:43.220> making<00:02:43.460> it<00:02:43.520> nice<00:02:43.700> on<00:02:43.880> line

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
not floppy it's making it nice on line

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.300 
not floppy it's making it nice on line
and<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:44.630> idea<00:02:44.960> with<00:02:45.050> a<00:02:45.140> step<00:02:45.440> further<00:02:45.710> if<00:02:46.250> you

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
and so idea with a step further if you

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.580 
and so idea with a step further if you
notice<00:02:46.790> all<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.060> weapons<00:02:47.450> on<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.900> new<00:02:48.110> quasar

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
notice all the weapons on the new quasar

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.830 
notice all the weapons on the new quasar
blank<00:02:48.860> these<00:02:49.370> are<00:02:49.520> all<00:02:49.640> cabin<00:02:50.030> strummed<00:02:50.390> so

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
blank these are all cabin strummed so

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.450 
blank these are all cabin strummed so
the<00:02:50.930> guys<00:02:51.110> are<00:02:51.140> pro<00:02:51.440> logical<00:02:51.890> really<00:02:52.160> looking

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
the guys are pro logical really looking

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.980 
the guys are pro logical really looking
into<00:02:52.610> this<00:02:52.790> now<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.210> looking<00:02:53.660> into<00:02:53.810> the

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
into this now and looking into the

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.650 
into this now and looking into the
issues<00:02:54.230> caused<00:02:54.860> by<00:02:54.890> unsprung<00:02:55.550> white<00:02:55.790> so<00:02:56.360> every

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
issues caused by unsprung white so every

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.120 
issues caused by unsprung white so every
weapon<00:02:56.810> on<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.200> rod<00:02:57.380> is<00:02:57.560> made<00:02:57.770> from<00:02:57.920> carbon

strand as well again making a lot rod
even<00:03:00.920> lighter<00:03:01.160> now<00:03:01.700> let's<00:03:01.880> have<00:03:01.940> a<00:03:02.030> closer

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
even lighter now let's have a closer

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.940 
even lighter now let's have a closer
look<00:03:02.510> at<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.840> real<00:03:03.020> seat<00:03:03.260> on<00:03:03.410> this<00:03:03.530> rod<00:03:03.770> and

through<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.040> real<00:03:13.220> seats<00:03:13.520> to<00:03:13.910> aid<00:03:14.290> basically

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
through the real seats to aid basically

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.170 
through the real seats to aid basically
the<00:03:15.440> full<00:03:15.710> curve<00:03:16.010> of<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.460> rod<00:03:16.640> so<00:03:16.880> it

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
the full curve of the rod so it

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.820 
the full curve of the rod so it
eliminates<00:03:17.720> any<00:03:17.870> flat<00:03:18.200> spots<00:03:18.320> but<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:18.710> also

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
eliminates any flat spots but it also

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.830 
eliminates any flat spots but it also
makes<00:03:19.280> a<00:03:19.400> rod<00:03:19.580> very<00:03:19.880> very<00:03:20.150> strong<00:03:20.480> around<00:03:20.750> the
