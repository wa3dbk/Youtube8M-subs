00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
more readily than low notes so in order

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.950 
more readily than low notes so in order
to<00:01:19.950> keep<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.400> low<00:01:20.549> notes<00:01:20.820> resonating<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:21.780> that

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
to keep the low notes resonating so that

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.050 
to keep the low notes resonating so that

they do travel as far as your high notes
we<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.350> imagine<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:26.130> our<00:01:27.030> mind<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
we have to imagine in our mind that the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.460 
we have to imagine in our mind that the
low<00:01:28.170> notes<00:01:28.439> are<00:01:28.740> sitting<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:30.840> point<00:01:31.229> of

low notes are sitting in the point of
the<00:01:32.070> triangle<00:01:32.509> now<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.540> mentioned<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.290> few

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
the triangle now I mentioned this a few

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.380 
the triangle now I mentioned this a few
seconds<00:01:34.979> ago<00:01:35.100> but<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.880> point<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
seconds ago but the point of the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.530 
seconds ago but the point of the
triangle<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.100> little<00:01:38.340> V<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:39.000> your

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
triangle is on that little V in your

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.429 
triangle is on that little V in your
upper<00:01:39.840> lip<00:01:40.610> we're<00:01:41.610> going<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.909> mentally<00:01:42.840> focus

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
upper lip we're going to mentally focus

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.330 
upper lip we're going to mentally focus
our<00:01:43.680> thoughts<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.570> low<00:01:45.750> notes<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.950> V

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
our thoughts of the low notes in the V

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.080 
our thoughts of the low notes in the V
of<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:48.030> triangle<00:01:48.899> by<00:01:49.860> doing<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.520> we're<00:01:50.850> going

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
of that triangle by doing so we're going

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.780 
of that triangle by doing so we're going
to<00:01:51.180> cause<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.869> low<00:01:52.020> notes<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.560> vibrate<00:01:53.040> on<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
to cause the low notes to vibrate on the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.670 
to cause the low notes to vibrate on the
back<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.240> teeth<00:01:54.450> or<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.810> forward<00:01:55.079> part<00:01:55.439> of

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
back of the teeth or the forward part of

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.490 
back of the teeth or the forward part of
the<00:01:55.770> roof<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.219> mouth<00:01:56.600> thereby<00:01:57.600> causing<00:01:58.320> a

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
the roof of the mouth thereby causing a

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.249 
the roof of the mouth thereby causing a
strong<00:01:59.280> resonance<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.329> enabling<00:02:00.780> those<00:02:00.960> low

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
strong resonance and enabling those low

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.179 
strong resonance and enabling those low
notes<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.799> travel<00:02:02.340> as<00:02:02.490> far<00:02:02.549> as<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:04.049> high<00:02:04.290> pitch

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
notes to travel as far as the high pitch

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.210 
notes to travel as far as the high pitch
sounds<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.229> low<00:02:07.409> notes<00:02:07.680> are<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.039> most

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
sounds so the low notes are the most

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.249 
sounds so the low notes are the most
focused<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.239> all<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.720> notes<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:10.050> you're

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
focused of all the notes that you're

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.630

a high note traveling a great distance
because<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.730> strong<00:03:03.239> of<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.750> sound<00:03:04.020> wave<00:03:04.230> is

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
because the strong of the sound wave is

because the strong of the sound wave is
so<00:03:04.590> strong<00:03:04.980> that<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.730> high<00:03:06.000> note<00:03:06.209> will<00:03:06.420> travel

so strong that a high note will travel
very<00:03:07.530> far<00:03:07.910> now<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:08.970> will<00:03:09.450> hear<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:10.070> scream<00:03:11.070> much

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
very far now you will hear a scream much

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.060 
very far now you will hear a scream much
more<00:03:12.300> readily<00:03:12.690> then<00:03:13.290> you<00:03:13.440> will<00:03:13.560> hear<00:03:13.770> a<00:03:13.830> low

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
more readily then you will hear a low

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.140 
more readily then you will hear a low
pitch<00:03:14.340> sound<00:03:14.700> such<00:03:15.660> as<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.870> moan<00:03:16.519> so<00:03:17.519> we<00:03:17.700> have<00:03:17.940> to

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
pitch sound such as a moan so we have to

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.330 
pitch sound such as a moan so we have to
confine<00:03:18.930> our<00:03:19.170> thinking<00:03:19.560> when<00:03:19.950> we<00:03:20.070> sing

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
confine our thinking when we sing

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.090 
confine our thinking when we sing
between<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.780> little<00:03:22.080> point<00:03:22.380> in<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.860> upper

now<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:29.190> low<00:03:29.400> notes<00:03:29.670> can<00:03:30.180> be<00:03:30.330> likened<00:03:30.540> in<00:03:30.810> a

resonance we'll say which causes it to

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.600 
resonance we'll say which causes it to
project<00:04:20.720> just<00:04:21.720> as<00:04:21.930> far<00:04:22.289> as<00:04:22.560> your<00:04:23.190> higher

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
project just as far as your higher

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.000 
project just as far as your higher
so<00:04:25.180> we're<00:04:25.360> going<00:04:25.510> to<00:04:25.630> concentrate<00:04:26.230> the<00:04:26.860> low

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
so we're going to concentrate the low

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.890 
so we're going to concentrate the low
notes<00:04:27.280> up<00:04:27.490> here<00:04:27.520> in<00:04:28.030> the<00:04:28.480> point<00:04:28.720> of<00:04:28.840> the

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
notes up here in the point of the

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.990 
notes up here in the point of the
triangle<00:04:29.200> we're<00:04:30.010> going<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.340> think<00:04:30.490> of<00:04:30.670> the<00:04:30.790> how

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
triangle we're going to think of the how

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.400 
triangle we're going to think of the how
the<00:04:31.060> middle<00:04:31.330> notes<00:04:31.600> sitting<00:04:31.870> across<00:04:32.139> the

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
the middle notes sitting across the

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.290 
the middle notes sitting across the
nostrils<00:04:33.190> or<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.430> middle<00:04:33.669> of<00:04:33.760> the<00:04:33.850> triangle

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
nostrils or the middle of the triangle

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.330 
nostrils or the middle of the triangle
and<00:04:34.450> we're<00:04:35.050> going<00:04:35.230> to<00:04:35.320> think<00:04:35.560> of<00:04:35.650> the<00:04:36.130> high

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
and we're going to think of the high

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.150 
and we're going to think of the high
notes<00:04:36.550> sitting<00:04:37.480> on<00:04:37.740> top<00:04:38.740> of<00:04:38.800> the<00:04:39.610> triangle
