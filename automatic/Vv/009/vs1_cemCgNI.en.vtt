and<00:00:01.410> we<00:00:01.829> should<00:00:02.040> also<00:00:02.190> look<00:00:02.550> at<00:00:02.669> some<00:00:02.850> examples

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
and we should also look at some examples

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.050 
and we should also look at some examples
that<00:00:03.750> involve<00:00:04.110> negative<00:00:04.680> numbers<00:00:05.069> in<00:00:05.220> all<00:00:05.910> of

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
that involve negative numbers in all of

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.600 
that involve negative numbers in all of
these<00:00:06.210> examples<00:00:06.629> one<00:00:07.560> or<00:00:07.830> more<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.429> the

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
these examples one or more of the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.930 
these examples one or more of the
fractions<00:00:09.179> are<00:00:09.769> negative<00:00:10.769> see<00:00:11.519> this<00:00:11.670> one<00:00:11.820> has

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
fractions are negative see this one has

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.509 
fractions are negative see this one has
two<00:00:12.389> negative<00:00:12.900> numbers<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.440> down<00:00:14.040> here<00:00:14.340> all

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
two negative numbers and down here all

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.820 
two negative numbers and down here all
three<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.150> fractions<00:00:15.690> are<00:00:15.900> negative<00:00:16.650> and

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
three of the fractions are negative and

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.290 
three of the fractions are negative and
again<00:00:17.039> we're<00:00:17.220> multiplying<00:00:17.550> these<00:00:18.000> are<00:00:18.180> all

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
again we're multiplying these are all

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.840 
again we're multiplying these are all
multiplied<00:00:18.779> together<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:20.160> rules<00:00:20.430> here

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
multiplied together and the rules here

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.790 
multiplied together and the rules here
are<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.420> same<00:00:21.630> as<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:22.109> rules<00:00:22.320> we've<00:00:22.560> seen

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
are the same as the rules we've seen

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.210 
are the same as the rules we've seen
before<00:00:23.010> if<00:00:23.580> we<00:00:24.029> have<00:00:24.320> a<00:00:25.320> negative<00:00:25.800> number

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
before if we have a negative number

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.359 
before if we have a negative number
times<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:27.060> positive<00:00:27.090> number<00:00:27.710> the<00:00:28.710> result<00:00:28.920> will

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
times a positive number the result will

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.420 
times a positive number the result will
be<00:00:29.400> negative<00:00:29.519> in<00:00:30.500> this<00:00:31.500> example<00:00:31.890> look<00:00:32.189> here's

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
be negative in this example look here's

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.660 
be negative in this example look here's
two<00:00:33.110> negative<00:00:34.110> numbers<00:00:34.530> multiplied<00:00:35.489> together

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
two negative numbers multiplied together

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.959 
two negative numbers multiplied together
the<00:00:36.570> result<00:00:36.989> there<00:00:37.290> will<00:00:38.040> be<00:00:38.190> positive<00:00:38.730> and

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
the result there will be positive and

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.010 
the result there will be positive and
down<00:00:39.930> here<00:00:40.320> we<00:00:40.500> have<00:00:40.680> three<00:00:41.600> negative<00:00:42.600> numbers

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
down here we have three negative numbers

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.170 
down here we have three negative numbers
all<00:00:43.260> multiplied<00:00:43.800> together<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.550> result<00:00:44.940> there

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
all multiplied together the result there

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.139 
all multiplied together the result there
will<00:00:45.360> be<00:00:45.390> negative<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.340> easiest<00:00:47.789> way

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
will be negative and the the easiest way

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.299 
will be negative and the the easiest way
to<00:00:48.180> remember<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.500> remember<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.980> an

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
to remember this is to remember that an

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.150 
to remember this is to remember that an
even<00:00:50.820> number<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.449> negative<00:00:52.050> signs<00:00:52.260> will

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
even number of negative signs will

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.910 
even number of negative signs will
cancel<00:00:53.640> out<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.449> like<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:54.989> one<00:00:55.199> here<00:00:55.590> we

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
cancel out so like in this one here we

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.220 
cancel out so like in this one here we
have<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.070> negative<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.879> negative<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.510> those

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
have a negative and a negative and those

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.770 
have a negative and a negative and those
two<00:00:58.440> negative<00:00:58.829> signs<00:00:59.039> cancel<00:00:59.219> out<00:00:59.730> but<00:01:00.329> an<00:01:00.480> odd

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
two negative signs cancel out but an odd

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.529 
two negative signs cancel out but an odd
number<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.590> negative<00:01:02.129> signs<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:03.000> we<00:01:03.180> have<00:01:03.390> in

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
number of negative signs like we have in

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.690 
number of negative signs like we have in
this<00:01:03.660> one<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.140> one<00:01:04.350> an<00:01:04.619> odd<00:01:05.220> number<00:01:05.670> of

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
this one in this one an odd number of

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.690 
this one in this one an odd number of
negative<00:01:06.119> signs<00:01:06.299> multiplied<00:01:07.170> together<00:01:07.700> will

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
negative signs multiplied together will

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.230 
negative signs multiplied together will
result<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.420> negative<00:01:09.659> answer

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
result in a negative answer

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.789 
result in a negative answer
so<00:01:12.240> sometimes<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:12.960> helpful<00:01:13.140> just<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.680> look

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
so sometimes it's helpful just to look

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.100 
so sometimes it's helpful just to look
at<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.040> numbers<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.640> take<00:01:15.180> note<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.720> whether

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
at the numbers and take note of whether

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.719 
at the numbers and take note of whether
they<00:01:16.350> are<00:01:16.380> positive<00:01:16.680> or<00:01:17.100> negative<00:01:17.460> and

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
they are positive or negative and

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.179 
they are positive or negative and
mentally<00:01:18.630> make<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> note<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.439> whether<00:01:19.860> your

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
mentally make a note of whether your

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.950 
mentally make a note of whether your
result<00:01:20.580> will<00:01:20.820> be<00:01:20.939> positive<00:01:21.479> or<00:01:21.600> negative

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
result will be positive or negative

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.050 
result will be positive or negative
before<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.439> start<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.460> let's<00:01:23.729> do<00:01:23.909> these

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
before you start so let's do these

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.390 
before you start so let's do these
problems<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:25.200> this<00:01:25.320> first<00:01:25.560> one<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.979> noticed

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
problems and in this first one I noticed

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.980 
problems and in this first one I noticed
that<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.580> have<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.820> negative<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.479> positive<00:01:27.509> so

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
that I have a negative and a positive so

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.660 
that I have a negative and a positive so
the<00:01:28.320> result<00:01:28.710> will<00:01:28.920> have<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.310> be<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> negative

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
the result will have to be a negative

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.800 
the result will have to be a negative
number<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.420> then<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.079> just<00:01:31.320> proceed<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.189> do<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
number and then I just proceed to do the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.130 
number and then I just proceed to do the
multiplication<00:01:33.810> 2<00:01:34.049> times<00:01:34.320> 4<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.680> 8<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:36.140> 7

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
multiplication 2 times 4 is 8 and 7

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.649 
multiplication 2 times 4 is 8 and 7
times<00:01:37.320> 3<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.740> 21<00:01:37.860> just<00:01:38.729> as<00:01:38.909> before<00:01:39.060> we<00:01:39.450> multiply

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
times 3 is 21 just as before we multiply

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.870 
times 3 is 21 just as before we multiply
the<00:01:39.990> numerators<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.860> multiply<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
the numerators and multiply the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.120 
the numerators and multiply the
denominators<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:42.689> we<00:01:42.899> get<00:01:43.049> 8<00:01:43.200> over<00:01:43.439> 21<00:01:43.890> and

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
denominators so we get 8 over 21 and

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.060 
denominators so we get 8 over 21 and
this<00:01:44.340> has<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.640> be<00:01:44.759> negative<00:01:44.790> 8<00:01:45.570> over<00:01:45.930> 21<00:01:46.409> now<00:01:47.009> we

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
this has to be negative 8 over 21 now we

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.920 
this has to be negative 8 over 21 now we
could<00:01:47.399> write<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.850> as<00:01:49.040> you<00:01:50.040> could<00:01:50.250> write<00:01:50.430> it

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
could write that as you could write it

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.270 
could write that as you could write it
as<00:01:52.040> negative<00:01:53.210> 8<00:01:54.210> over<00:01:54.270> 21<00:01:55.170> or<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.920> could<00:01:56.070> write

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
as negative 8 over 21 or you could write

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.469 
as negative 8 over 21 or you could write
it<00:01:56.399> as<00:01:56.520> negative<00:01:57.380> 8<00:01:58.380> over<00:01:58.439> 21<00:01:59.340> or<00:01:59.790> you<00:02:00.329> could

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
it as negative 8 over 21 or you could

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.929 
it as negative 8 over 21 or you could
write<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.659> as<00:02:00.869> 8<00:02:01.140> over<00:02:01.500> negative<00:02:02.070> 21

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
write it as 8 over negative 21

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.090

mathematically equal to each other but

mathematically equal to each other but
this<00:02:07.710> one<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:07.979> not<00:02:08.160> very<00:02:08.190> common<00:02:08.849> as<00:02:08.970> we've

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
this one is not very common as we've

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.240 
this one is not very common as we've
mentioned<00:02:09.810> before<00:02:10.080> having<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.979> negative

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250

the<00:02:12.370> denominator<00:02:12.970> is<00:02:13.180> not<00:02:13.360> wrong<00:02:13.840> it's<00:02:14.230> not<00:02:14.410> a

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
the denominator is not wrong it's not a

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.680 
the denominator is not wrong it's not a
mathematical<00:02:15.340> error<00:02:15.610> but<00:02:16.360> it's<00:02:16.510> pretty

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
mathematical error but it's pretty

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.390 
mathematical error but it's pretty
standard<00:02:17.050> to<00:02:17.440> either<00:02:17.620> have<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.040> negative

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
standard to either have the negative

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.120 
standard to either have the negative
sign<00:02:18.610> out<00:02:18.640> front<00:02:19.360> or<00:02:19.810> on<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.980> numerator<00:02:23.130> so

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
sign out front or on the numerator so

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.790 
sign out front or on the numerator so
we'll<00:02:24.400> leave<00:02:24.580> it<00:02:24.730> on<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:25.060> numerator<00:02:25.800> like

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
we'll leave it on the numerator like

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.480 
we'll leave it on the numerator like
that<00:02:27.270> okay<00:02:28.270> this<00:02:28.390> next<00:02:28.600> one<00:02:28.770> negative<00:02:29.770> 4/5

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
that okay this next one negative 4/5

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.990 
that okay this next one negative 4/5
times<00:02:30.640> 2/7<00:02:31.600> times<00:02:31.690> negative<00:02:32.350> 1/9<00:02:32.860> I<00:02:33.190> know<00:02:33.670> that

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
times 2/7 times negative 1/9 I know that

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.060 
times 2/7 times negative 1/9 I know that
two<00:02:34.240> negative<00:02:34.750> signs<00:02:35.050> multiplied<00:02:35.860> together

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
two negative signs multiplied together

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.130 
two negative signs multiplied together
will<00:02:36.340> cancel<00:02:37.000> out<00:02:37.090> so<00:02:37.420> I'm<00:02:37.630> just<00:02:37.840> going<00:02:38.050> to

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
will cancel out so I'm just going to

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.860 
will cancel out so I'm just going to
basically<00:02:38.410> ignore<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.880> negative<00:02:40.270> signs<00:02:40.570> and

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
basically ignore the negative signs and

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.070 
basically ignore the negative signs and
do<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.980> do<00:02:42.460> the<00:02:42.490> multiplication<00:02:43.330> four<00:02:43.780> times

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
do the do the multiplication four times

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.680 
do the do the multiplication four times
two<00:02:44.350> times<00:02:44.650> one<00:02:44.770> is<00:02:45.310> just<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.120> same<00:02:46.150> as<00:02:46.330> four

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
two times one is just the same as four

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.880 
two times one is just the same as four

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890

35 times 9 just pull out some scratch

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.480 
35 times 9 just pull out some scratch
paper<00:02:57.070> 9<00:02:57.940> times<00:02:58.240> 5<00:02:58.570> is<00:02:59.070> 45<00:03:00.070> 9<00:03:01.030> times<00:03:01.330> 3<00:03:01.450> is<00:03:01.870> 27

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
paper 9 times 5 is 45 9 times 3 is 27

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:09.350 
paper 9 times 5 is 45 9 times 3 is 27
plus<00:03:03.490> 4<00:03:03.910> is<00:03:04.240> 31<00:03:05.080> so<00:03:05.620> that's<00:03:05.910> 315<00:03:06.910> so<00:03:07.720> this<00:03:07.930> is<00:03:08.080> 8

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
plus 4 is 31 so that's 315 so this is 8

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.230 
plus 4 is 31 so that's 315 so this is 8
over<00:03:10.360> 3<00:03:10.390> 15<00:03:11.080> and<00:03:11.320> that<00:03:11.860> doesn't<00:03:12.310> simplify<00:03:12.910> any

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
over 3 15 and that doesn't simplify any

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.310 
over 3 15 and that doesn't simplify any
further<00:03:14.820> if<00:03:15.820> it<00:03:16.030> did<00:03:16.209> simplify<00:03:16.750> we<00:03:17.050> would<00:03:17.230> have

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
further if it did simplify we would have

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.270 
further if it did simplify we would have
tried<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.590> simplify<00:03:18.420> these<00:03:20.250> numerators<00:03:21.250> and

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
tried to simplify these numerators and

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.150 
tried to simplify these numerators and
denominators<00:03:21.520> over<00:03:22.390> here<00:03:22.570> beforehand<00:03:23.140> and<00:03:23.530> we

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
denominators over here beforehand and we

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.140 
denominators over here beforehand and we
can<00:03:24.280> do<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.550> down<00:03:24.730> here

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
can do that down here

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.590 
can do that down here
negative<00:03:25.930> 2/3<00:03:26.380> times<00:03:26.560> negative<00:03:27.040> 1<00:03:27.730> 6<00:03:28.090> times

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
negative 2/3 times negative 1 6 times

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.230 
negative 2/3 times negative 1 6 times
negative<00:03:28.900> 3<00:03:29.440> fourths<00:03:29.740> okay<00:03:30.430> I<00:03:30.459> know<00:03:30.640> there<00:03:31.150> are

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
negative 3 fourths okay I know there are

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.570 
negative 3 fourths okay I know there are
three<00:03:31.630> negative<00:03:32.140> signs<00:03:32.400> multiplied<00:03:33.400> together

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
three negative signs multiplied together

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.210 
three negative signs multiplied together
so<00:03:34.330> the<00:03:34.450> answer<00:03:34.780> will<00:03:34.959> be<00:03:34.990> negative<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.650> let's

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
so the answer will be negative and let's

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.690 
so the answer will be negative and let's
simplify<00:03:36.550> a<00:03:36.730> little<00:03:37.030> bit<00:03:37.180> this<00:03:37.480> 3<00:03:37.959> and<00:03:37.990> this<00:03:38.410> 3

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
simplify a little bit this 3 and this 3

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.770 
simplify a little bit this 3 and this 3
those<00:03:39.700> will<00:03:40.200> reduce<00:03:41.200> to<00:03:41.230> ones<00:03:41.709> and<00:03:42.270> this<00:03:43.270> 2<00:03:43.540> you

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
those will reduce to ones and this 2 you

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.750 
those will reduce to ones and this 2 you
could<00:03:43.900> take<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.320> 2<00:03:44.470> and<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.770> 6<00:03:44.800> or<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.310> 2<00:03:45.580> and

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
could take the 2 and the 6 or the 2 and

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.930 
could take the 2 and the 6 or the 2 and
the<00:03:45.820> 4<00:03:46.060> either<00:03:46.480> way<00:03:46.870> if<00:03:47.590> I<00:03:47.800> reduce<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.459> 2<00:03:48.670> and

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
the 4 either way if I reduce the 2 and

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.360 
the 4 either way if I reduce the 2 and
the<00:03:49.060> 6<00:03:49.300> I<00:03:49.540> divide<00:03:49.840> them<00:03:49.959> both<00:03:50.080> by<00:03:50.140> 2<00:03:50.410> I<00:03:50.620> get<00:03:50.950> a<00:03:50.980> 1

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
the 6 I divide them both by 2 I get a 1

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
the 6 I divide them both by 2 I get a 1
and<00:03:51.730> a<00:03:52.540> 3<00:03:52.570> and<00:03:53.440> so<00:03:54.100> I<00:03:54.130> have<00:03:54.250> 1<00:03:54.550> times<00:03:54.730> 1<00:03:55.030> times<00:03:55.209> 1

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
and a 3 and so I have 1 times 1 times 1

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.010 
and a 3 and so I have 1 times 1 times 1
that's<00:03:55.870> 1<00:03:56.530> and<00:03:57.100> down<00:03:57.730> on<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.120> bottom<00:03:58.209> 3<00:03:58.780> times

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
that's 1 and down on the bottom 3 times

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.979 
that's 1 and down on the bottom 3 times
4<00:03:59.350> which<00:03:59.560> is<00:03:59.590> 12<00:04:00.070> and<00:04:00.340> my<00:04:01.150> answer<00:04:01.510> has<00:04:01.690> to<00:04:01.870> be

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
4 which is 12 and my answer has to be

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.540 
4 which is 12 and my answer has to be
negative<00:04:02.260> don't<00:04:02.770> forget<00:04:03.130> that

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
negative don't forget that

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.959 
negative don't forget that
so<00:04:03.820> negative<00:04:04.180> 1/12
