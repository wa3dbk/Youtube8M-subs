I'll get into a little bit more about

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.959 
I'll get into a little bit more about
that<00:00:33.840> later<00:00:34.100> but<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.370> was<00:00:35.579> originally<00:00:35.880> going

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
that later but this was originally going

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.270 
that later but this was originally going
to<00:00:36.030> be<00:00:36.120> an<00:00:36.210> unboxing<00:00:36.540> video<00:00:36.870> obviously<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.739> have

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
to be an unboxing video obviously I have

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.459 
to be an unboxing video obviously I have
unboxed<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.820> already<00:00:39.090> but<00:00:39.450> unboxing<00:00:40.230> videos

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
unboxed it already but unboxing videos

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.950 
unboxed it already but unboxing videos
are<00:00:40.620> fairly<00:00:40.770> boring<00:00:41.040> anyway<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:42.360> guess<00:00:42.840> it

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
are fairly boring anyway so I guess it

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.260 
are fairly boring anyway so I guess it
doesn't<00:00:43.200> matter<00:00:43.379> but<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.789> what<00:00:44.940> comes<00:00:45.059> in

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
doesn't matter but this is what comes in

Windows 8 but I'm sure it also has to do
with<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.810> fact<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.170> was<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.380> 1.8

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
with the fact that this was a 1.8

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.289 
with the fact that this was a 1.8
gigahertz<00:02:02.509> Atom<00:02:03.509> processor<00:02:04.880> I'll<00:02:05.880> do<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.090> quick

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
gigahertz Atom processor I'll do a quick

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.809 
gigahertz Atom processor I'll do a quick
reboot<00:02:06.899> test<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.530> think<00:02:07.740> that's<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:08.039> good<00:02:08.640> way<00:02:08.789> to

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
reboot test I think that's a good way to

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.609 
reboot test I think that's a good way to
see<00:02:09.119> what<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.330> capabilities<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.349> thing

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
see what the capabilities of this thing

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.470 
see what the capabilities of this thing
are

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
are

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.070 
are
go<00:02:12.470> ahead<00:02:12.620> and<00:02:12.740> just<00:02:12.860> reboot<00:02:13.220> and<00:02:14.080> literally

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
go ahead and just reboot and literally

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.390 
go ahead and just reboot and literally
going<00:02:16.069> from<00:02:16.870> being<00:02:17.870> completely<00:02:18.349> in<00:02:18.890> the

a long time and the way this connects to
the<00:03:19.680> mobile<00:03:19.920> dock<00:03:20.069> is<00:03:20.280> much<00:03:20.550> simpler<00:03:21.500> gives

your your USB dongle and this almost
looks<00:04:04.170> like<00:04:04.230> it's<00:04:04.470> a<00:04:04.590> full<00:04:04.799> size<00:04:05.010> HDMI<00:04:05.239> port<00:04:06.239> I

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
looks like it's a full size HDMI port I

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.060 
looks like it's a full size HDMI port I
have<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.660> look<00:04:06.959> at<00:04:07.109> the<00:04:07.230> documentation<00:04:07.799> but

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
have to look at the documentation but

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.160 
have to look at the documentation but
that's<00:04:08.310> what<00:04:08.430> this<00:04:08.549> looks<00:04:08.730> like<00:04:08.820> to<00:04:08.970> me<00:04:09.269> but

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
that's what this looks like to me but

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.020 
that's what this looks like to me but
I'll<00:04:10.470> confirm<00:04:10.829> that<00:04:12.410> then<00:04:13.410> on<00:04:13.829> the<00:04:14.030> dock

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
I'll confirm that then on the dock

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.930 
I'll confirm that then on the dock
itself<00:04:17.570> there's<00:04:18.570> a<00:04:18.690> USB<00:04:19.560> 2.0<00:04:20.039> port<00:04:20.070> on<00:04:20.729> the

itself there's a USB 2.0 port on the

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.680 
itself there's a USB 2.0 port on the

to<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.460> dock<00:04:48.979> now<00:04:50.450> one<00:04:51.450> of<00:04:51.479> the<00:04:51.630> things<00:04:51.870> that<00:04:52.020> I

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
to the dock now one of the things that I

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.420 
to the dock now one of the things that I
dislike<00:04:52.919> about<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.789> dock<00:04:53.970> so<00:04:54.210> far<00:04:54.479> is<00:04:54.750> that<00:04:55.440> it

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
dislike about the dock so far is that it

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.680 
dislike about the dock so far is that it
actually<00:04:57.560> has<00:04:58.560> a<00:04:58.590> fairly<00:04:59.010> cheap<00:04:59.690> Mouse

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
actually has a fairly cheap Mouse

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.580 
actually has a fairly cheap Mouse
mechanism<00:05:01.320> here<00:05:01.530> the<00:05:01.830> trackpad<00:05:02.070> mechanism<00:05:03.590> it

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
mechanism here the trackpad mechanism it

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.380 
mechanism here the trackpad mechanism it
works<00:05:04.800> really<00:05:05.099> well<00:05:05.220> as<00:05:05.460> far<00:05:05.490> as<00:05:05.700> just<00:05:06.030> you

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
works really well as far as just you

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.360 
works really well as far as just you
know<00:05:06.530> moving<00:05:07.530> the<00:05:07.620> mouse<00:05:07.740> around<00:05:07.979> and<00:05:08.220> stuff

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
know moving the mouse around and stuff

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.410 
know moving the mouse around and stuff
like<00:05:08.520> that

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
like that

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.110 
like that
but<00:05:09.690> the<00:05:10.020> right-click<00:05:10.680> is<00:05:10.860> is<00:05:11.160> really<00:05:11.400> kind<00:05:12.030> of

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
but the right-click is is really kind of

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.500 
but the right-click is is really kind of
iffy<00:05:13.670> sometimes<00:05:14.670> when<00:05:14.880> you<00:05:14.940> right-click<00:05:15.180> it

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
iffy sometimes when you right-click it

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.970 
iffy sometimes when you right-click it
right<00:05:15.690> clicks<00:05:15.960> sometimes<00:05:16.560> when<00:05:16.890> you

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
right clicks sometimes when you

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.100 
right clicks sometimes when you
right-click<00:05:17.160> it<00:05:17.430> let's<00:05:17.640> click<00:05:18.120> clicks<00:05:18.450> so<00:05:19.080> you

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
right-click it let's click clicks so you

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.960 
right-click it let's click clicks so you
really<00:05:19.440> don't<00:05:19.860> know<00:05:20.130> sometimes<00:05:20.640> what<00:05:20.850> it's

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
really don't know sometimes what it's

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.420 
really don't know sometimes what it's
going<00:05:21.120> to<00:05:21.180> do<00:05:21.390> and<00:05:21.660> it<00:05:22.500> doesn't<00:05:22.830> inspire<00:05:23.100> a<00:05:23.220> lot

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
going to do and it doesn't inspire a lot

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.150 
going to do and it doesn't inspire a lot
of<00:05:23.490> confidence<00:05:23.780> so<00:05:24.780> I've<00:05:25.260> really<00:05:25.920> found

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
of confidence so I've really found

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.440 
of confidence so I've really found
myself<00:05:27.140> trying<00:05:28.140> to<00:05:28.230> avoid<00:05:28.560> using<00:05:28.980> the<00:05:29.070> mouse

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
myself trying to avoid using the mouse

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.950 
myself trying to avoid using the mouse
if<00:05:30.450> I<00:05:30.690> can<00:05:32.180> I'm<00:05:33.180> sorry<00:05:33.360> that<00:05:33.600> using<00:05:33.870> the
