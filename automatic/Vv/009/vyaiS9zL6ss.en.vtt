00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.250
 Hi friend sam 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.450
 Today I'm here to give a tip to 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.889
 you 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:15.770
 if for some reason you 're not healthy 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:22.619
 can change the screen resolution 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:26.340
 with the mouse is for example the case of 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.099
 its resolution deconfigured that 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.470
 the icons and the minus the letters 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.989
 appear so large that you do not 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.620
 can simply see what you 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.050
 need to do this can happen until 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.660
 by accident is happened to me another 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.289
 day I could not change resolution 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.930
 of the screen, because I do not know what I did and 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.899
 gave the revolution was very low 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.760
 the cyclone igor kunitsyn huge and I do not 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.210
 can do absolutely nothing 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.120
 because I did not see it is in my case 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.780
 As I have two monitors the function was 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.809
 other 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:09.090
 So how to do this? 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:13.920
 I am working with windows 7 is the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.710
 my version is 64 bits and it's portuguese 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.310
 portugal is now the Portuguese midfielder of 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.390
 Portugal 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.990
 I say this because the keys vary 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.090
 from one language to another 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:31.530
 so come on 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:35.460
 So let's suppose you're in that 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.549
 desperate situation, not with your 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:44.180
 monitor fully so mangled 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:47.390
 What are you going to do is you click on 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.970
 anywhere on your desktop 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.869
 is any place that is not an icon 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.399
 evidently and I believe that at least 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.979
 less san 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.240
 this you can do with the mouse in that 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.229
 situation that is not working to 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.290
 to process - and such 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.750
 at least click on an empty area of the 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.200
 I believe that it is still possible to 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:17.640
 It's what I do now. 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:23.010
 abandon the mouse 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.110
 only I will reapply because he 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.700
 left outside the ready area 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:32.160
 So, everything okay, now forget that 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:37.920
 Is there any harm if I will forget? 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:40.080
 know where there is resolution is is g 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.590
 screen resolution right 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.890
 and it's resolution starts with r 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.760
 so I come here for my keyboard and I 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:55.440
 I'll type the letter r 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.890
 This revolution has appeared to me. 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.799
 I can see the screen here but if you 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.239
 do not have sales because you know you do not 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.670
 will not see anything 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:10.280
 You'll have to do this in the dark to 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:13.700
 follow you can next you tab 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.650
 twice 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:24.049
 OK 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:31.530
 the next step is you press the key 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:33.630
 space it appeared're here for options 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.010
 screen resolution 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:41.400
 can decrease or increase without having 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.530
 mouse feature without seeing anything to 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.859
 increase you'll probably have to 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.090
 increase the revolution to reduce 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.280
 icons 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.730
 seems strange but that's exactly how much 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:58.739
 the bigger the minor revolution in your icons 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:03.660
 new ones - in the letters on your screen then 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:07.799
 with that eh you had stores that much 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:10.859
 People use to play games for you. 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:14.630
 rise down you decrease 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:16.950
 My little board is for me. 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.340
 slow down snack 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.070
 maybe you can not even know where 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.090
 you're exactly was simply 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:30.280
 to paint 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:33.820
 it snows and it's you press the arrow 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.770
 one two three four times and try not to 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.760
 and see what happens 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:45.960
 To assume this value is you key 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:51.820
 enter now it's not ready yet 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:56.410
 for you to apply né in my version of 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:05:01.120
 windows is the combination of the keys alt 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:07.330
 Are you high now? Come on. 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:09.690
 the other screen becomes black and you have 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.930
 15 seconds to decide whether to keep 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:17.860
 settings or revert 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.860
 good I'll pomegranate trying to type m in October 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.860
 high high 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.860
 opa 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:34.479
 if I had not clicked alte m 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:38.110
 and also had not escaped is by 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:41.950
 setting after 15 seconds is going 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:45.240
 nothing happens the value was going to be 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:52.000
 reversed what was previously 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:54.930
 So for you is to define its value as 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.620
 Okay, you have a screen preview. 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.200
 first né 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:02.800
 part becomes black and the 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:06.039
 vizolli visualization and questions you 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.760
 want to keep or reverse to keep 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:15.000
 with the antec aut n né which may vary 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:18.310
 according to the windows version and to 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:23.979
 return to previous state 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:26.380
 and you can give aut r revert or are you 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:28.750
 I just wait about 15 seconds 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.060
 Ok, I'm going to tell you how it was. 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:34.680

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:36.969
