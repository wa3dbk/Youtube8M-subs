00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
move the shot so we can bring the

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.760 
move the shot so we can bring the
dirties<00:03:46.230> max<00:03:47.180> added<00:03:48.180> a<00:03:48.300> just<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:48.960> big<00:03:49.230> array<00:03:49.740> of

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
dirties max added a just a big array of

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.480 
dirties max added a just a big array of
blocks<00:03:50.520> like<00:03:51.300> this<00:03:51.330> and<00:03:51.810> then<00:03:52.280> just<00:03:53.280> kind<00:03:53.400> of

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
blocks like this and then just kind of

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.810 
blocks like this and then just kind of
animated<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.150> blocks<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:55.700> disappear<00:03:56.700> out<00:03:56.730> of

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
animated the blocks to disappear out of

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.070 
animated the blocks to disappear out of
the<00:03:56.940> scene<00:03:57.150> of<00:03:57.390> course<00:03:57.690> we<00:03:57.780> have<00:03:57.870> like<00:03:57.990> the

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
the scene of course we have like the

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.410 
the scene of course we have like the
dirt<00:03:58.290> texture<00:03:58.710> underneath<00:03:58.800> and<00:03:59.250> then<00:03:59.420> once

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
dirt texture underneath and then once

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.360 
dirt texture underneath and then once
that<00:04:00.570> once<00:04:01.170> we<00:04:01.290> have<00:04:01.380> that<00:04:01.410> asset<00:04:02.040> rendered

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
that once we have that asset rendered

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.670 
that once we have that asset rendered
out<00:04:02.520> we<00:04:02.880> brought<00:04:03.360> it<00:04:03.510> in<00:04:03.600> after<00:04:03.780> effects<00:04:04.170> color

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
out we brought it in after effects color

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.090 
out we brought it in after effects color
corrected<00:04:05.160> and<00:04:05.490> match<00:04:06.300> the<00:04:06.630> shot<00:04:06.900> all<00:04:07.590> the

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
corrected and match the shot all the

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.270 
corrected and match the shot all the
little<00:04:08.580> intricacies<00:04:09.090> of<00:04:09.270> that<00:04:09.570> and<00:04:10.280> added

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
little intricacies of that and added

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.010 
little intricacies of that and added
some<00:04:11.310> glow<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:11.820> the<00:04:12.090> tops<00:04:12.360> of<00:04:12.540> those<00:04:12.660> when<00:04:12.900> it

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
some glow to the tops of those when it

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.290 
some glow to the tops of those when it
hit<00:04:13.200> and<00:04:13.680> then<00:04:14.370> we<00:04:14.430> have<00:04:14.520> like<00:04:14.640> a<00:04:14.730> fume<00:04:15.000> effects

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
hit and then we have like a fume effects

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.789 
hit and then we have like a fume effects
simulation<00:04:15.870> coming<00:04:16.140> down<00:04:16.260> here<00:04:16.380> so<00:04:16.590> we<00:04:16.620> had

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
simulation coming down here so we had

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.220 
simulation coming down here so we had
some<00:04:17.040> that<00:04:17.190> like<00:04:17.720> natural-looking<00:04:18.720> smoke

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
some that like natural-looking smoke

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.479 
some that like natural-looking smoke
even<00:04:19.590> though<00:04:19.680> it<00:04:19.709> was<00:04:19.859> generated<00:04:20.310> on<00:04:20.400> the

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
even though it was generated on the

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.940 
even though it was generated on the
computer<00:04:20.940> and<00:04:22.400> quick<00:04:23.400> roto<00:04:23.700> of<00:04:24.000> Britain's<00:04:24.450> leg

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
computer and quick roto of Britain's leg

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.710 
computer and quick roto of Britain's leg
coming<00:04:25.950> out<00:04:26.130> of<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.280> shop<00:04:26.490> with<00:04:26.790> some<00:04:27.180> dust<00:04:27.510> on

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
coming out of the shop with some dust on

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.030 
coming out of the shop with some dust on
top<00:04:27.780> of<00:04:28.110> that<00:04:28.200> makes<00:04:28.560> for<00:04:28.770> a<00:04:28.800> pretty

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
top of that makes for a pretty

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.660 
top of that makes for a pretty
clean-looking<00:04:30.020> explosion

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
clean-looking explosion

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:40.130
