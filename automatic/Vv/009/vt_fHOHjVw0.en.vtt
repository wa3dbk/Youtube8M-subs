00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
new to slow juicing it's been about a

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.100 
new to slow juicing it's been about a
month<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.290> half<00:00:37.320> hands<00:00:38.250> down<00:00:38.579> no<00:00:39.210> BS<00:00:39.570> i<00:00:39.870> can

a difference in the smell i notice a
difference<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.570> texture<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:47.010> juice

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
difference in the texture of the juice

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.770 
difference in the texture of the juice
that's<00:00:47.520> coming<00:00:47.910> out<00:00:48.000> there's<00:00:48.300> more<00:00:48.510> pulp

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
that's coming out there's more pulp

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.740 
that's coming out there's more pulp
there's<00:00:49.320> more<00:00:49.559> fiber<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.309> mean<00:00:50.789> those<00:00:51.059> are<00:00:51.600> all

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
there's more fiber I mean those are all

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.389 
there's more fiber I mean those are all
things<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.260> want<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.590> your<00:00:52.620> juice<00:00:52.920> very

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
things that you want in your juice very

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.910 
things that you want in your juice very
important<00:00:53.940> for<00:00:54.059> your<00:00:54.180> health<00:00:54.410> the<00:00:55.410> reason<00:00:55.770> why

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
important for your health the reason why

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.209 
important for your health the reason why
is<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.280> slow<00:00:56.910> juicer<00:00:57.420> doesn't<00:00:57.989> oxidize<00:00:58.350> it

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
is that slow juicer doesn't oxidize it

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.840 
is that slow juicer doesn't oxidize it
doesn't<00:00:59.699> strip<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:01.109> nutrients<00:01:02.070> away<00:01:02.430> from

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
doesn't strip the nutrients away from

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.969 
doesn't strip the nutrients away from
the<00:01:03.180> whole<00:01:03.390> food<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.870> actually<00:01:04.320> leaves<00:01:04.559> more

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
the whole food it actually leaves more

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.280 
the whole food it actually leaves more
of<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> nutrients<00:01:05.580> intact<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.900> gets<00:01:06.990> into

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
of the nutrients intact so it gets into

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.740 
of the nutrients intact so it gets into
your<00:01:07.350> glass<00:01:07.680> but<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.520> other<00:01:08.549> thing<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:09.450> really

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
your glass but the other thing I really

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.450 
your glass but the other thing I really
like<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.260> think<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.650> specific<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
like and I think this is specific to the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.000 
like and I think this is specific to the
Fagor<00:01:11.760> system<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.750> there's<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.530> two-step

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
Fagor system is that there's a two-step

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.310 
Fagor system is that there's a two-step
process<00:01:14.040> where<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.970> actually<00:01:15.180> squeezes<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
process where it actually squeezes the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.460 
process where it actually squeezes the
fruits<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.979> vegetables<00:01:17.549> twice<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.960> which

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
fruits and vegetables twice so which

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.970 
fruits and vegetables twice so which
allows<00:01:20.040> for<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.430> nutrients<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.090> get<00:01:21.270> into

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
allows for the nutrients to get into

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.130 
allows for the nutrients to get into
you<00:01:22.070> choose<00:01:22.460> which<00:01:23.450> is<00:01:23.600> really<00:01:23.930> beneficial

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
you choose which is really beneficial

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.010 
you choose which is really beneficial
and<00:01:24.680> again<00:01:24.860> for<00:01:25.100> your<00:01:25.190> health<00:01:25.810> what<00:01:26.810> I<00:01:26.840> like

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
and again for your health what I like

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.780 
and again for your health what I like
about<00:01:27.050> this<00:01:27.290> particular<00:01:27.710> system<00:01:28.160> the<00:01:28.550> Fagor

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
about this particular system the Fagor

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.390 
about this particular system the Fagor
system<00:01:29.270> is<00:01:29.450> that<00:01:29.660> its<00:01:29.930> energy<00:01:30.320> efficient<00:01:30.830> so

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
system is that its energy efficient so

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.980 
system is that its energy efficient so
it's<00:01:31.580> good<00:01:31.790> for<00:01:31.910> the<00:01:32.000> planet<00:01:32.300> or<00:01:32.570> better<00:01:32.780> for

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
it's good for the planet or better for

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.450 
it's good for the planet or better for
the<00:01:33.080> planet<00:01:33.230> we're<00:01:33.710> all<00:01:33.770> trying<00:01:33.980> to<00:01:34.100> do<00:01:34.190> things

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
that are better for our planet and it is

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.000 
that are better for our planet and it is
also<00:01:37.340> bpa-free<00:01:37.940> so<00:01:38.450> go<00:01:39.140> ahead<00:01:39.230> and<00:01:39.320> is<00:01:39.770> on<00:01:39.920> the

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
also bpa-free so go ahead and is on the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.530 
also bpa-free so go ahead and is on the
top<00:01:40.190> rack<00:01:40.430> of<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.640> dishwasher<00:01:41.270> you<00:01:41.360> don't
