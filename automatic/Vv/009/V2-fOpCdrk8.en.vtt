gets into the into the microphone and

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.860 
gets into the into the microphone and
really<00:00:44.550> affects<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.030> electrics<00:00:45.420> with<00:00:45.570> inside

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
really affects the electrics with inside

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.750 
really affects the electrics with inside
it<00:00:46.020> because<00:00:46.200> they<00:00:46.350> are<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:47.250> know<00:00:47.370> quite

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
for the shock mount which is going to

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.969 
for the shock mount which is going to
come<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.659> handy<00:01:39.930> if<00:01:39.990> they<00:01:40.110> do<00:01:40.170> happen<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.680> snap

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
come in handy if they do happen to snap

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.270 
come in handy if they do happen to snap
after<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.369> lot<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.579> wear<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:41.790> tear<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:43.280> then

after a lot of wear and tear and then

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.289 
after a lot of wear and tear and then
the<00:01:44.399> next<00:01:44.610> thing<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.850> course<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
the next thing of course is the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.620 
the next thing of course is the
microphone<00:01:45.750> itself<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.350> black<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.450> truly

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
microphone itself in black and it truly

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.859 
microphone itself in black and it truly
is<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.869> stunning<00:01:49.290> piece<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.470> kit<00:01:50.540> it's<00:01:51.540> ball<00:01:51.750> so

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
is a stunning piece of kit it's ball so

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.749 
is a stunning piece of kit it's ball so
vacuum<00:01:52.140> wrapped<00:01:52.560> as<00:01:52.740> well<00:01:52.920> which<00:01:53.340> i<00:01:53.490> think<00:01:53.549> is

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
vacuum wrapped as well which i think is

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.969 
vacuum wrapped as well which i think is
quite<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> nice<00:01:54.210> touch<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.840> inside<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.829> vacuum

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
quite a nice touch and inside the vacuum

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.310 
quite a nice touch and inside the vacuum
wrap<00:01:56.310> they've<00:01:56.490> actually<00:01:57.229> wrapped<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
wrap they've actually wrapped the

a<00:02:32.370> standard<00:02:33.300> microphone<00:02:33.690> thread<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:36.260> I'd

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
a standard microphone thread and I'd

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.920 
a standard microphone thread and I'd
like<00:02:37.530> some<00:02:37.800> other<00:02:37.950> shock<00:02:38.220> mounts<00:02:38.640> which<00:02:38.930> work

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
like some other shock mounts which work

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.750 
like some other shock mounts which work
on<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.200> operation<00:02:40.650> of<00:02:40.740> screwing<00:02:41.100> in<00:02:41.400> from<00:02:41.670> the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
on the operation of screwing in from the

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.490 
on the operation of screwing in from the
bottom<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:42.480> one<00:02:42.720> actually<00:02:42.870> works<00:02:43.200> on<00:02:43.440> a

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
bottom this one actually works on a

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.160 
bottom this one actually works on a
clamp<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:43.950> release<00:02:44.190> system<00:02:44.840> so<00:02:45.840> if<00:02:45.900> we<00:02:45.990> just

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
clamp and release system so if we just

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.360 
clamp and release system so if we just
demonstrate<00:02:46.740> that<00:02:46.920> all<00:02:49.010> we<00:02:50.010> need<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.220> make

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
demonstrate that all we need to make

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.700 
demonstrate that all we need to make
sure<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.640> do<00:02:50.790> is<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:53.100> push<00:02:53.310> down<00:02:53.490> on<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.760> clamp

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
sure you do is to push down on the clamp

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.080 
sure you do is to push down on the clamp
and<00:02:55.710> then<00:02:55.830> what<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.100> phone<00:02:56.280> will<00:02:56.460> fit<00:02:56.490> right

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
and then what the phone will fit right

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.540 
and then what the phone will fit right
in<00:02:57.330> there<00:02:57.510> into<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.870> mountain<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:59.310> then<00:02:59.430> when

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
in there into the mountain and then when

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.710 
in there into the mountain and then when
you<00:02:59.640> release<00:02:59.790> it's<00:03:00.150> going<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.360> hold<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.660> in

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
you release it's going to hold it in

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:09.550 
you release it's going to hold it in
place<00:03:00.900> by<00:03:01.830> pressure

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560
