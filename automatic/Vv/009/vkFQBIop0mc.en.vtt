to the first part of my unity 2d
tutorial<00:00:06.980> this<00:00:07.980> video<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.670> actually<00:00:09.000> just<00:00:09.599> a

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
tutorial this video is actually just a

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.169 
tutorial this video is actually just a
short<00:00:10.050> introduction<00:00:10.710> video<00:00:11.099> where<00:00:11.580> I<00:00:11.610> discuss

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
short introduction video where I discuss

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.470 
short introduction video where I discuss
a<00:00:12.389> few<00:00:12.450> things<00:00:12.840> not<00:00:13.679> only<00:00:13.980> about<00:00:14.480> this

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
a few things not only about this

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.320 
a few things not only about this
tutorial<00:00:16.020> but<00:00:16.710> also<00:00:16.890> about<00:00:17.369> learning<00:00:17.670> unity

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
tutorial but also about learning unity

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.390 
tutorial but also about learning unity
2d<00:00:18.510> in<00:00:18.930> general<00:00:19.439> so<00:00:20.430> first<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.420> all<00:00:21.980> my<00:00:22.980> reason

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
2d in general so first of all my reason

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.939 
2d in general so first of all my reason
for<00:00:23.609> making<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:24.109> tutorial<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.560> because

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
for making this tutorial is because

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.300 
for making this tutorial is because
unity<00:00:26.609> 2d<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.180> fairly<00:00:27.840> new<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.410> it's<00:00:29.039> still

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
unity 2d is fairly new and it's still

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.299 
unity 2d is fairly new and it's still
pretty<00:00:29.340> much<00:00:30.109> lacking<00:00:31.109> any<00:00:31.349> good<00:00:31.650> tutorials

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
pretty much lacking any good tutorials

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.970 
pretty much lacking any good tutorials
on<00:00:32.520> YouTube<00:00:32.960> well<00:00:33.960> it's<00:00:34.170> actually<00:00:34.440> pretty

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
on YouTube well it's actually pretty

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.090 
on YouTube well it's actually pretty
easy<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.340> learn<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:36.570> I'll<00:00:36.930> be<00:00:37.140> making<00:00:37.559> this

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
easy to learn so I'll be making this

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.580 
easy to learn so I'll be making this
store<00:00:38.430> for<00:00:38.790> beginners<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.510> do<00:00:39.989> not<00:00:40.170> require

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
store for beginners and do not require

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.100 
store for beginners and do not require
you<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.860> have<00:00:41.160> any<00:00:41.430> experience<00:00:42.059> with<00:00:42.149> engines

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
you to have any experience with engines

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.540 
you to have any experience with engines
or<00:00:43.440> scripting<00:00:44.160> at<00:00:44.309> all<00:00:45.170> during<00:00:46.170> my<00:00:46.550> tutorials

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
or scripting at all during my tutorials

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.529 
or scripting at all during my tutorials
I'll<00:00:48.210> be<00:00:48.570> making<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.050> top-down<00:00:49.620> 2d<00:00:49.829> game<00:00:50.250> and

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
I'll be making a top-down 2d game and

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.470 
I'll be making a top-down 2d game and
I'll<00:00:51.539> discover<00:00:52.020> different<00:00:52.289> things<00:00:52.890> like

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
I'll discover different things like

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.910 
I'll discover different things like
basic<00:00:54.860> animation<00:00:55.860> as<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.460> can<00:00:56.610> see<00:00:56.850> here

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
basic animation as you can see here

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.950 
basic animation as you can see here
camera<00:00:58.920> movement<00:00:59.460> character<00:01:00.270> movement

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
camera movement character movement

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.649 
camera movement character movement
AI<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.899> and<00:01:03.899> I'll<00:01:04.049> slowly<00:01:05.659> begin

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
AI and so on and I'll slowly begin

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.690 
AI and so on and I'll slowly begin
discussing<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.530> more<00:01:08.220> advanced<00:01:08.670> Li<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:12.229> like

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
discussing it more advanced Li and like

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.240 
discussing it more advanced Li and like
more<00:01:14.700> advanced<00:01:15.299> animations<00:01:16.020> with<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.799> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
more advanced animations with the the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.840 
more advanced animations with the the
unity<00:01:18.210> systems<00:01:18.770> you<00:01:19.770> can<00:01:19.920> see<00:01:20.159> something<00:01:20.640> I

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
unity systems you can see something I

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.280 
unity systems you can see something I
here<00:01:21.240> with<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.840> animator<00:01:22.830> I've<00:01:23.280> made<00:01:24.000> a

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
here with the animator I've made a

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.030 
here with the animator I've made a
character<00:01:25.290> controller<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:27.140> it<00:01:28.140> looks<00:01:28.590> really

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
character controller and it looks really

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.760 
character controller and it looks really
really<00:01:29.340> uh

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
really uh

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.920 
really uh
difficult<00:01:31.770> but<00:01:31.979> it's<00:01:32.670> actually<00:01:33.390> pretty<00:01:33.570> easy

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
difficult but it's actually pretty easy

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.390 
difficult but it's actually pretty easy
