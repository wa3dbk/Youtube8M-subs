what you see hey David how we doing all
right

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
right

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.450 
right
the<00:00:33.360> interior<00:00:33.870> you'll<00:00:34.050> see<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.649> carbon

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
the interior you'll see that the carbon

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.790 
the interior you'll see that the carbon
has<00:00:35.579> burned<00:00:35.879> off<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.480> bricks<00:00:36.780> that's<00:00:37.530> why

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
has burned off the bricks that's why

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.090 
has burned off the bricks that's why
they're<00:00:38.040> white<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.300> instead<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.360> black<00:00:39.720> and

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
they're white and instead of black and

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.910 
they're white and instead of black and
that<00:00:41.100> also<00:00:41.309> tells<00:00:41.460> me<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:42.149> it's<00:00:42.920> temperature

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
that also tells me that it's temperature

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.000 
that also tells me that it's temperature
you'd<00:00:44.160> wanted<00:00:44.519> we<00:00:44.640> were<00:00:44.760> doing<00:00:45.649> this<00:00:46.649> entire

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
you'd wanted we were doing this entire

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.840 
you'd wanted we were doing this entire
face<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.699> going<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.030> be<00:00:48.379> covered<00:00:49.379> with<00:00:50.190> very

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
face is going to be covered with very

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.549 
face is going to be covered with very
decorative<00:00:51.269> arches<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.960> granite

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
decorative arches of granite

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.819 
decorative arches of granite
so<00:00:54.920> we're<00:00:55.460> about<00:00:56.079> three<00:00:57.079> quarters<00:00:57.469> of<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:57.680> way

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
so we're about three quarters of the way

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.889 
so we're about three quarters of the way
with<00:00:58.280> the<00:00:58.399> installation<00:00:59.030> right<00:00:59.180> now<00:00:59.420> would

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
with the installation right now would

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.250 
with the installation right now would
you<00:01:00.019> say<00:01:00.489> two<00:01:01.489> thirds<00:01:01.820> so<00:01:02.449> I<00:01:02.480> could<00:01:02.690> see<00:01:02.870> so

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
you say two thirds so I could see so

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.320 
you say two thirds so I could see so
this<00:01:03.469> break<00:01:03.980> we<00:01:04.190> talked<00:01:04.460> about<00:01:04.729> is<00:01:04.940> the<00:01:05.119> fire

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
this break we talked about is the fire

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.190 
this break we talked about is the fire
brick<00:01:05.630> which<00:01:06.290> by<00:01:06.649> the<00:01:06.710> way<00:01:06.830> is<00:01:07.250> actually<00:01:08.200> room

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
brick which by the way is actually room

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.580 
brick which by the way is actually room
temperature<00:01:09.860> to<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:10.700> touch<00:01:10.970> and<00:01:11.299> it's<00:01:11.750> as

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
temperature to the touch and it's as

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.100 
temperature to the touch and it's as
David<00:01:12.979> said<00:01:13.130> about<00:01:13.399> 600<00:01:13.940> degrees<00:01:14.000> inside<00:01:14.720> the

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
David said about 600 degrees inside the

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.139 
David said about 600 degrees inside the
the<00:01:15.560> oven<00:01:15.860> where<00:01:16.220> you<00:01:16.369> would<00:01:16.490> cook<00:01:16.789> your<00:01:16.970> food

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
the oven where you would cook your food

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.469 
the oven where you would cook your food
so<00:01:17.420> it's<00:01:17.570> pretty<00:01:17.840> amazing<00:01:18.080> that<00:01:19.009> in<00:01:19.820> a<00:01:19.970> 5-foot

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
so it's pretty amazing that in a 5-foot

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.889 
so it's pretty amazing that in a 5-foot
depth<00:01:21.159> you<00:01:22.159> have<00:01:22.190> very<00:01:22.759> little<00:01:23.000> output<00:01:23.750> of

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
depth you have very little output of

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:25.630 
depth you have very little output of
heat<00:01:24.140> because<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:24.770> insulation<00:01:25.190> and<00:01:25.520> the

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
heat because the insulation and the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:35.660 
heat because the insulation and the
brick<00:01:25.819> itself

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.540 

because<00:01:36.670> there's

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
because there's

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.120 
because there's
Gasquet<00:01:38.480> between<00:01:38.900> how<00:01:39.320> all<00:01:39.530> right<00:01:39.560> here

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
Gasquet between how all right here

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.950 
Gasquet between how all right here
between<00:01:40.370> the<00:01:40.730> face<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:41.390> actual<00:01:41.720> oven

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
between the face and the actual oven

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.010 
between the face and the actual oven
okay<00:01:42.590> it's<00:01:42.740> in<00:01:42.920> me<00:01:43.070> but<00:01:43.610> no<00:01:44.000> matter<00:01:44.210> what<00:01:44.450> if

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
okay it's in me but no matter what if

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.020 
okay it's in me but no matter what if
somebody<00:01:45.650> wanted<00:01:45.950> one<00:01:46.130> of<00:01:46.160> these<00:01:46.340> units<00:01:46.790> they

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
somebody wanted one of these units they

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.880 
somebody wanted one of these units they
probably<00:01:47.330> still<00:01:47.750> need<00:01:47.960> that<00:01:48.170> depth<00:01:48.530> of<00:01:48.740> about

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
probably still need that depth of about

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.380 
probably still need that depth of about
five<00:01:49.340> feet

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.969 

yeah<00:01:55.510> right<00:01:56.050> so<00:01:56.260> we've<00:01:56.380> solved<00:01:56.710> that<00:01:56.770> problem

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
yeah right so we've solved that problem

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:04.390 
yeah right so we've solved that problem
some<00:01:57.520> installation

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.450 

all<00:02:05.400> right<00:02:06.150> company<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.960> death<00:02:07.250> on<00:02:08.250> my

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
all right company that death on my

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.040 
all right company that death on my
website<00:02:08.880> you<00:02:09.060> can<00:02:09.180> see<00:02:09.330> pictures<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.869> one

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
website you can see pictures of one

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.190 
website you can see pictures of one
kitchen<00:02:10.440> which<00:02:10.710> you<00:02:10.920> would<00:02:11.040> assume<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
kitchen which you would assume the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.600 
kitchen which you would assume the
but<00:02:14.200> it's<00:02:14.319> because<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:14.799> extended<00:02:15.310> on<00:02:15.489> the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
but it's because it extended on the

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.319 
but it's because it extended on the
outside<00:02:16.030> of<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.239> house<00:02:17.879> that's<00:02:18.879> right<00:02:19.120> which

outside of the house that's right which
a<00:02:19.629> good<00:02:19.989> builder<00:02:20.319> can<00:02:20.500> do<00:02:20.650> which<00:02:20.860> we<00:02:21.040> can<00:02:21.310> that

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
a good builder can do which we can that

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.720 
a good builder can do which we can that
