explain<00:04:36.250> things<00:04:36.460> in<00:04:36.610> a<00:04:36.699> way<00:04:36.729> that<00:04:36.819> someone

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
explain things in a way that someone

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.029

who's<00:04:37.419> not<00:04:37.599> a<00:04:37.659> web<00:04:38.050> geek<00:04:38.289> can<00:04:38.470> understand

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
who's not a web geek can understand

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:40.830 
who's not a web geek can understand
because<00:04:39.310> we<00:04:39.550> don't<00:04:39.729> need<00:04:39.940> a<00:04:39.970> web<00:04:40.330> geek<00:04:40.569> to<00:04:40.750> be

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
because we don't need a web geek to be

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.330 
because we don't need a web geek to be
able<00:04:40.960> to<00:04:41.110> put<00:04:41.229> up<00:04:41.379> these<00:04:41.500> sites<00:04:41.830> we<00:04:42.039> can<00:04:42.220> do

them<00:04:42.550> ourselves<00:04:43.030> with<00:04:44.020> a<00:04:44.050> little<00:04:44.349> bit<00:04:44.440> of

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
them ourselves with a little bit of

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.110 
them ourselves with a little bit of
