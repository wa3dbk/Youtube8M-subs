and I'm going to divide it into three
equal<00:00:36.870> sections<00:00:37.620> for<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.399> braid<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:40.700> I'm

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
equal sections for the braid and I'm

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.130 
equal sections for the braid and I'm
just<00:00:41.850> going<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.090> take<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.360> section<00:00:42.840> and

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
place it over the middle and then take

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.880 
place it over the middle and then take
the<00:00:45.629> one<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.020> left<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.500> place<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.829> over

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the one on the left and place it over

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.590 
the one on the left and place it over
the<00:00:47.070> middle<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.640> starts<00:00:48.000> our<00:00:48.180> braid<00:00:48.420> off

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
the middle and that starts our braid off

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.840 
the middle and that starts our braid off
now<00:00:49.590> from<00:00:49.829> here<00:00:50.010> I'm<00:00:50.129> going<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.430> incorporate

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
hair into the Strand so with that right

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.229 
hair into the Strand so with that right
strand<00:00:53.190> I'm<00:00:53.309> picking<00:00:53.610> up<00:00:53.730> hair<00:00:53.940> from<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
strand I'm picking up hair from the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.630 
strand I'm picking up hair from the
front<00:00:54.920> putting<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.039> together<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.399> then

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
placing it over the middle strand and

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.060 
placing it over the middle strand and
make<00:01:00.149> sure<00:01:00.300> everything<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.870> neat<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.859> hold

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
tightly and then pick up hair from the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.990 
tightly and then pick up hair from the
left<00:01:04.110> side<00:01:04.559> incorporate<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.610> with<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.820> left

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
left side incorporate it with the left

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.250 
left side incorporate it with the left
strand<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.450> place<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.780> over<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.049> middle

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
strand and place it over the middle

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.920 
strand and place it over the middle
strand<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.610> continue<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.180> do<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.479> until

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
strand and you continue to do this until

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:46.610 
strand and you continue to do this until
you<00:01:10.049> reach<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.439> very<00:01:10.590> bottom

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.900 

so<00:01:47.620> with<00:01:47.800> the<00:01:47.920> last<00:01:48.130> round<00:01:48.340> I'm<00:01:48.460> just<00:01:48.640> going<00:01:48.850> to

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
so with the last round I'm just going to

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.090 
so with the last round I'm just going to
incorporate<00:01:49.450> it<00:01:49.570> into<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:50.050> braid<00:01:50.320> and<00:01:50.680> then

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
incorporate it into the braid and then

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.860 
incorporate it into the braid and then
now<00:01:51.340> from<00:01:51.730> here<00:01:51.940> I'm<00:01:52.090> going<00:01:52.300> to<00:01:52.420> just<00:01:52.600> start

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
now from here I'm going to just start

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.010 
now from here I'm going to just start
braiding<00:01:53.110> my<00:01:53.350> hair<00:01:53.380> regularly<00:01:54.600> if<00:01:55.600> you<00:01:55.780> want

braiding my hair regularly if you want
you<00:01:56.200> can<00:01:56.440> braid<00:01:56.890> your<00:01:57.070> hair<00:01:57.100> all<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.460> way<00:01:57.580> to

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
you can braid your hair all the way to

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.980 
you can braid your hair all the way to
the<00:01:57.880> bottom<00:01:58.150> but<00:01:58.270> I'm<00:01:58.420> actually<00:01:58.600> going<00:01:58.900> to

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
the bottom but I'm actually going to

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.440 
the bottom but I'm actually going to
just<00:01:59.050> stop<00:01:59.440> halfway<00:01:59.740> and<00:02:00.310> tie<00:02:00.610> it<00:02:00.670> off<00:02:00.970> with<00:02:01.000> an

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
just stop halfway and tie it off with an

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:10.020 
just stop halfway and tie it off with an
elastic<00:02:01.480> band<00:02:08.310> now<00:02:09.310> I'm<00:02:09.399> going<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:09.760> release

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
elastic band now I'm going to release

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.850 
elastic band now I'm going to release
the<00:02:10.210> strand<00:02:10.480> I<00:02:10.570> left<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:10.929> side<00:02:11.110> earlier<00:02:11.470> and

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
the strand I left the side earlier and

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.500 
the strand I left the side earlier and
I'm<00:02:12.100> going<00:02:12.400> to<00:02:12.520> continue<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.150> braid<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.480> rest

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
I'm going to continue and braid the rest

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.900 
I'm going to continue and braid the rest
of<00:02:13.840> my<00:02:13.960> hair<00:02:14.140> on<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.380> other<00:02:14.410> side<00:02:14.860> now<00:02:15.700> when

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
of my hair on the other side now when

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.520 
of my hair on the other side now when
you're<00:02:16.000> done<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.450> should<00:02:16.600> look<00:02:16.660> like<00:02:16.810> this<00:02:17.200> if

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530
