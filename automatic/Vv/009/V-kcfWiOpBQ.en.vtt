trying<00:04:19.739> to<00:04:19.829> get<00:04:19.979> it<00:04:20.070> on<00:04:20.160> camera<00:04:20.190> working<00:04:21.890> and

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
trying to get it on camera working and

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.910 
trying to get it on camera working and
that<00:04:23.010> be<00:04:23.190> made<00:04:23.400> Gloria<00:04:23.820> man

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
that be made Gloria man

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.590 
that be made Gloria man
oh<00:04:27.340> well<00:04:28.340> as<00:04:28.460> far<00:04:28.640> as<00:04:28.670> i<00:04:28.880> know<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.180> doing<00:04:29.450> that

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
oh well as far as i know the doing that

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.690 
oh well as far as i know the doing that
it's<00:04:29.840> got<00:04:30.020> family<00:04:30.620> min<00:04:30.800> which<00:04:31.040> is<00:04:31.160> a<00:04:31.190> peptide

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
it's got family min which is a peptide

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.130 
it's got family min which is a peptide
binding<00:04:31.910> when<00:04:32.210> the<00:04:32.270> forward<00:04:32.570> in<00:04:32.750> it<00:04:32.870> which<00:04:33.020> is

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
binding when the forward in it which is

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.410 
binding when the forward in it which is
a<00:04:33.200> peptide<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:33.980> it<00:04:34.070> rebuilds<00:04:34.670> our<00:04:34.790> skin<00:04:35.090> cells

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
a peptide and it rebuilds our skin cells

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.660 
a peptide and it rebuilds our skin cells
soon<00:04:35.810> as<00:04:35.930> we<00:04:36.110> age<00:04:36.260> it<00:04:36.710> was<00:04:36.770> bring<00:04:37.010> the<00:04:37.130> sun<00:04:37.400> and

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
the is lift long-term we should share

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.560 
the is lift long-term we should share
those<00:05:00.770> lines<00:05:01.040> something<00:05:01.640> up<00:05:01.820> and<00:05:02.180> you<00:05:02.450> know

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
those lines something up and you know

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.780 
those lines something up and you know
and<00:05:02.870> getting<00:05:03.140> better<00:05:03.320> and<00:05:03.500> softer<00:05:04.010> so<00:05:04.310> just

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
and getting better and softer so just

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.690 
and getting better and softer so just
talking<00:05:05.180> talking<00:05:05.360> about<00:05:06.280> can<00:05:07.280> you<00:05:07.340> see<00:05:07.550> it
