00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 this interference is a monster that of 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.660
 yellowstone in the united states are entered 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.700
 in eruption would cover a surface 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.250
 great as France of many 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.349
 kilometers thick lava the 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.940
 surveillance of this super volcano is 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.480
 now more accurate sent special 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.570
 Valerie Astruc Regis Masini seen from above 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.609
 the crater looks like a volcano 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.109
 reality that that multicolored is 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.510
 that a basin of boiling water 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.650
 there are hundreds in the park 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:35.250
 of yellowstone the real volcano is him 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.760
 invisible to the naked eye it measures 60 km of 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.579
 diameter 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.829
 tourists can just guess 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:48.120
 its presence the water of the geysers that 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.070
 gushes to nearly 90 degrees printing 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.860
 to be in touch with the center of the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.050
 earth but visitors have only one 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.600
 very vague idea of ​​the sleeping monster 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.480
 under their feet a lot of heat a 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.510
 big bag of tricks by 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.840
 finally something is a super 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.880
 volcano that could if there were to be 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.820
 a rash to be cataclysmic 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.110
 yeah ok I'm going super volcano 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.540
 the expression is not chosen at random 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.369
 just listen to the park guide 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.580
 yellowstone to understand the 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.740
 terrible meaning only a 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.330
 super volcano if it explodes can change 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.369
 climate and even life on earth 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.400
 it can also cause the end of the world 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.020
 but that's still in debate or the 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.460
 doubts about a mega eruption at 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.979
 yellowstone are becoming less and less 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.900
 recently allowed scientists have 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.650
 makes a discovery really not 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.200
 reassuring 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.079
 under the first chamber of magma you already 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.140
 known another tank whose size 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.240
 cold in the back it's a cavity 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.329
 huge that contains ten thousand 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.250
 cubic kilometers of magma of what 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.329
 to bury the surface of France under 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.369
 15 m of material the director of 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.380
 the volcanic observatory redouble 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.540
 vigilance he measures the many 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.369
 earthquakes and activity 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.290
 geothermal yellowstone 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.510
 and that's 60 degrees a temperature 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.709
 usual this source is enough 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.760
 recent changes all the time here 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.040
 researchers have a point of 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.159
 comparison the eruption of Mount volcano 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.959
 saint helene in 1981 a slip of 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:30.849
 field exposes the magma pocket that 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:33.700
 explodes 57 dead 380 square kilometers 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.319
 vitrified forest henry yellowstone 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.470
 would be two thousand times more powerful 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.220
 that the holy mount helene it exceeds 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.810
 imagination 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.849
 it would be a scale event 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.859
 continental is like a 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.819
 meteorite or a comet entered into 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:51.280
 collision with the land 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:53.349
 we can not prepare for that 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.109
 scientists have found traces of 3 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.180
 mega eruption at around 700,000 years 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:01.000
 of interval the last took place there is 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.090
 640 thousand years but impossible to predict 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.519
 the date of the next cataclysm alone 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.260
 certainty the supervolcan should not 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.620
 explode before several thousand 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.209
 years 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.060
 enough to leave us time 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.940
 to appreciate the disturbing beauty of 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.510
 yellowstone and as promised 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.510
 so we
