00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.710
 watch ladies and gentlemen in a 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.710
 moment we will start 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.320
 I am author of the current ford in 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.030
 the school of my integrative project 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.179
 today I'm talking to you the race to 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.710
 foot there are several people who have 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.750
 thought the running technique 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.820
 and friend who plays my contract is in that 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.189
 is still good technique at most 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.840
 to have better times then 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.820
 how do I proceed today I had 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.019
 compose the technique from the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.019
 upper body goes the beautiful speech 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:39.870
 when running is important to keep the 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:41.789
 head held high 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.469
 this sense allow us to have a 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:46.109
 good fluidity at the level of the stride 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.609
 then also what is your tax 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:49.530
 tests on a comet to see far 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:51.839
 the front told himself that it will avoid us 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:01:03.809
 some collisions that can sometimes 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:01:05.880
 cause certain injuries has 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.780
 inspired by the mouth what is that 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.080
 it 25 allows me to inspire more hours 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.340
 so in fact even better sexy embarrassed by 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.009
 against several people believe me 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.720
 that it's more important to 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.659
 breathe through the nose because I believe 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.479
 that point level fans filter the 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.959
 particles but have only seen one 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.420
 shareholder 

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:29.100
 we inspire lesser also the time of 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.770
 the expiration must hope that the most 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.110
 strongest possible strength is that 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.069
 next time we push to enter a 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.069
 largest amount of data 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:56.549
 as it will wait must carry towards 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:09.690
 front 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:12.690
 my leg the two opposite sections of 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:17.280
 to maximize our energy sometimes 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.760
 know at the level of the clavicle or 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.760
 points 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.650
 the torturers poet of tense what is it 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.890
 we can do is we can 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.660
 simply to bay saint jean with the elbow 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.080
 then time our hands the must 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.950
 important that this fake plaster as his 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:40.049
 firm and that must be really 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:41.880
 close to fly backwards and 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.590
 had as far as possible that 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.260
 is able while remaining comfortable 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.260
 it allows us to grow 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.820
 breaks it down into three parts the 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.800
 first it's going to be the new living room I 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.320
 was starting important of fanja my faith 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.010
 must the two if not much it will be 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.340
 over 50 years old to 15 new first 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.750
 step 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.180
 second step it's going to be the tax 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.570
 frame back claw the ground like 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.850
 just a killing done for you I 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.160
 come back with a butt butt you want 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.170
 it's to keep compact enough to 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.290
 Roman maximize my energy 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:36.780
 and then go out of a crowd is faster 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:38.880
 but it was always the crowd talking 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.000
 of the three types of attacked attacked him at 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.030
 breast is the way of god that is 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.640
 interesting is the way to be 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.510
 talent it is for people nothing 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:57.540
 excess weight wanted to decrease the 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:59.700
 knee pain very 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.210
 advantageous and not count that technical 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.130
 will tell him ten minutes because we 're going 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:08.550
 make more contact a curriculum 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.250
 with the influx your less fast more 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.200
 could generate characters smoke 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.530
 as they go too I'll land with 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.500
 the heel dropped directly under the point 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.960
 of contact with this post a huge 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.540
 pressure now the second way 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:27.570
 this the head with the plant of the site 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.010
 important the head to learn this arm of 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.020
 iron with the sole of the foot 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.280
 what is it going to do that allow us 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.640
 allows to look for a bigger 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.130
 speed is all this service to 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.590
 people for short distance air 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.920
 you really want to go to a more 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.990
 high level at the levers of this evil maxi 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:49.170
 to consult this technique it is 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.630
 the one mentioned by name the mills the 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.790
 achilles tendon and the student but at 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.670
 see reduce the pressure of the taste of 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.280
 knee and fairy the third face to 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.960
 one between two sets the head with the meaning 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.669
 foot 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.699
 drought to spend as little as possible 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.620
 of our talent goes into attack with the 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:09.990
 foot soles or dick or currents 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.560
 wanted to mitigate the risks of pressure 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.720
 if it really made me feel the same 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.210
 Pressure was sure from you 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:22.319
 really there all the limbs of the leg 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:24.449
 are then held the injuries I 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:26.190
 said before that it's addressed in 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:28.259
 face we want to force us to note that 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.000
 the long-awaited foot we will opt for 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:32.310
 this technique if during a certain 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.270
 time because it will be his little 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:39.270
 same technical journal of running 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.580
 by cons it's technical it came a 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.139
 little bit the theses of courage but 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.410
 I would like saint pantaleon at the level of 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.960
 foot 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.970
 it's going to be the stink bending cause is 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.979
 very important to make his stride in 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.979
 having the hotels bike 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:01.759
 the technique in motion 

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:03.770
 my first race is going to be a 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:05.389
 attack with the heel my second race 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.369
 with an attack with the middle of the foot 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:10.839
 and the third with the sole of the foot 

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:10.839
 so we can take action
