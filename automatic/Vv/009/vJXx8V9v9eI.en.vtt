but<00:01:57.370> as<00:01:57.460> I<00:01:57.610> start<00:01:57.850> coming<00:01:58.120> closer<00:01:58.360> to<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.690> fret

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
but as I start coming closer to the fret

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.080 
but as I start coming closer to the fret
it's<00:01:59.380> easier<00:01:59.890> I<00:02:00.040> have<00:02:00.100> to<00:02:00.400> apply<00:02:00.670> less

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
it's easier I have to apply less

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.320 
it's easier I have to apply less
pressure<00:02:01.510> to<00:02:01.810> actually<00:02:02.070> make<00:02:03.070> on<00:02:03.370> make<00:02:03.820> the

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
pressure to actually make on make the

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.930 
pressure to actually make on make the
string<00:02:04.690> make<00:02:05.590> contact<00:02:06.070> with<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.310> fret<00:02:06.550> okay

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
string make contact with the fret okay

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:07.700 
string make contact with the fret okay
so

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
have your hands on the guitar you'll

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.920 
have your hands on the guitar you'll
know<00:02:55.720> that<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:57.310> knuckle<00:02:57.760> can<00:02:57.970> always<00:02:58.480> curl

know that that knuckle can always curl

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.620 
know that that knuckle can always curl
way<00:02:59.620> more<00:02:59.980> than<00:03:00.220> you<00:03:00.340> have<00:03:00.520> it<00:03:00.640> curled<00:03:01.090> now<00:03:01.570> the

way more than you have it curled now the

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.260 
way more than you have it curled now the
reason<00:03:02.140> that<00:03:02.170> we<00:03:02.320> want<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.560> do<00:03:02.709> that<00:03:02.860> is<00:03:03.070> if<00:03:03.580> our

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
reason that we want to do that is if our

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.479 
reason that we want to do that is if our
hands<00:03:04.750> are<00:03:04.900> more<00:03:05.050> like<00:03:05.200> this<00:03:05.530> our<00:03:06.220> knuckles

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
hands are more like this our knuckles

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.610 
hands are more like this our knuckles
are<00:03:06.790> more<00:03:06.970> like<00:03:07.090> this<00:03:07.330> and<00:03:07.600> I<00:03:07.660> go<00:03:07.810> to<00:03:07.870> play<00:03:08.380> a

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
are more like this and I go to play a

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.199 
are more like this and I go to play a
chord

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
chord

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:16.589 
chord
get<00:03:10.630> a<00:03:10.660> lot<00:03:10.840> of<00:03:10.959> muted<00:03:11.260> notes<00:03:14.340> okay<00:03:15.340> but<00:03:16.030> the

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
get a lot of muted notes okay but the

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.089 
get a lot of muted notes okay but the
only<00:03:16.780> thing<00:03:16.930> I<00:03:17.020> have<00:03:17.200> to<00:03:17.349> do<00:03:17.440> is<00:03:17.560> curl<00:03:17.920> that

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
only thing I have to do is curl that

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:25.650 
only thing I have to do is curl that
knuckle<00:03:18.580> just<00:03:18.790> a<00:03:18.970> little<00:03:19.810> bit<00:03:20.020> and<00:03:20.319> now<00:03:24.660> now

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
knuckle just a little bit and now now

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.660 
knuckle just a little bit and now now
I'm<00:03:25.840> hearing<00:03:26.260> every<00:03:26.590> single<00:03:26.920> note<00:03:27.130> just

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
I'm hearing every single note just

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.790 
I'm hearing every single note just
because<00:03:28.030> I<00:03:28.209> curled<00:03:28.540> that<00:03:28.720> last<00:03:28.930> knuckle<00:03:29.230> okay

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
because I curled that last knuckle okay

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.589 
because I curled that last knuckle okay
so<00:03:30.459> that's<00:03:30.580> number<00:03:30.730> three<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.120> fourth<00:03:31.360> thing

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
so that's number three the fourth thing

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.110 
so that's number three the fourth thing
is<00:03:31.660> you<00:03:32.410> want<00:03:32.769> to<00:03:32.890> try<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.340> leave<00:03:33.610> a<00:03:33.640> little<00:03:33.970> bit

position that it needs to be to play the
chords<00:03:48.100> correctly<00:03:48.670> now<00:03:49.500> you<00:03:50.500> probably<00:03:50.830> are

saying<00:03:51.160> to<00:03:51.250> me<00:03:51.310> but<00:03:51.519> all<00:03:51.640> my<00:03:51.940> all<00:03:52.269> the<00:03:52.330> pros

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
saying to me but all my all the pros

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.660 
saying to me but all my all the pros
that<00:03:53.230> I<00:03:53.290> watch<00:03:53.620> always<00:03:53.950> have<00:03:54.130> their<00:03:54.280> thumb<00:03:54.489> up

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
that I watch always have their thumb up

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.070 
that I watch always have their thumb up
here<00:03:54.880> they<00:03:55.000> rest<00:03:55.209> their<00:03:55.299> thumb<00:03:55.630> up<00:03:55.660> here

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
here they rest their thumb up here

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.630 
here they rest their thumb up here
that's<00:03:56.440> true<00:03:56.830> because<00:03:57.010> they've<00:03:57.310> been<00:03:57.400> playing

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
that's true because they've been playing

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.789 
that's true because they've been playing
for<00:03:57.819> a<00:03:57.880> long<00:03:58.120> time<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:58.980> as<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:01.769> get<00:04:02.769> more

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
for a long time and as you get more

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.860 
for a long time and as you get more
experienced<00:04:03.489> on<00:04:03.610> the<00:04:03.700> guitar<00:04:04.000> you<00:04:04.239> can<00:04:04.390> do

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
experienced on the guitar you can do

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.320 
experienced on the guitar you can do
that<00:04:05.080> you<00:04:05.410> can<00:04:05.590> actually<00:04:05.830> have<00:04:06.549> your<00:04:06.760> hands<00:04:07.209> in

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
that you can actually have your hands in

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.030 
that you can actually have your hands in
different<00:04:07.720> positions<00:04:08.110> ones<00:04:08.410> that<00:04:08.620> are<00:04:08.739> not

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
different positions ones that are not

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.710 
different positions ones that are not
very<00:04:09.900> plot<00:04:10.900> or<00:04:11.110> not<00:04:11.349> very<00:04:11.590> good<00:04:12.040> for<00:04:12.340> beginners

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
very plot or not very good for beginners

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.849 
very plot or not very good for beginners
but<00:04:13.720> if<00:04:14.049> you've<00:04:14.200> been<00:04:14.320> playing<00:04:14.500> for<00:04:14.620> a<00:04:14.769> while

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
but if you've been playing for a while

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:17.490 
but if you've been playing for a while
it<00:04:15.250> actually<00:04:15.310> becomes<00:04:16.150> easier<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:17.169> do<00:04:17.320> that

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
it actually becomes easier to do that

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.860 
it actually becomes easier to do that
