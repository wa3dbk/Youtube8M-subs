00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.170

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:06.060
 let's kill so on property 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:10.610
 each mob is also killed 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.710
 naturally four skeletons appeared 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.939
 three or even small 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:21.150
 the next mutant is this zombie mutant here 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:25.400
 this is a big zombie actually if you kill 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.229
 4 or 3 zombies will come out too 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.270

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.790

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.170

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.960

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:08.459

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.989
