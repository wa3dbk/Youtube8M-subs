of reinforced toe area without it

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.010 
of reinforced toe area without it
looking<00:01:10.700> like<00:01:10.910> a<00:01:11.060> hunk<00:01:11.300> of<00:01:11.390> plastic<00:01:11.630> that's

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
looking like a hunk of plastic that's

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.900 
looking like a hunk of plastic that's
sewn<00:01:12.229> onto<00:01:12.440> the<00:01:12.680> top<00:01:12.860> of<00:01:13.040> the<00:01:13.130> shoe<00:01:13.310> which<00:01:13.880> I

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
sewn onto the top of the shoe which I

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.639 
sewn onto the top of the shoe which I
really<00:01:14.330> like<00:01:14.570> we've<00:01:14.750> integrated<00:01:14.990> into<00:01:15.530> the

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
really like we've integrated into the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:17.800 
really like we've integrated into the
design<00:01:15.680> really<00:01:16.490> nicely<00:01:16.700> and<00:01:17.119> it's<00:01:17.630> going<00:01:17.750> to

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
design really nicely and it's going to

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.630 
design really nicely and it's going to
obviously<00:01:17.990> not<00:01:18.410> wear<00:01:18.649> out<00:01:18.680> in<00:01:19.070> that<00:01:19.220> area<00:01:19.280> on

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
obviously not wear out in that area on

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.150 
obviously not wear out in that area on
the<00:01:19.729> left<00:01:19.759> shoe<00:01:20.149> when<00:01:20.330> you're<00:01:20.450> shifting<00:01:20.780> a<00:01:20.869> lot

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
the left shoe when you're shifting a lot

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.650 
the left shoe when you're shifting a lot
that's<00:01:22.160> going<00:01:22.280> to<00:01:22.399> stay<00:01:22.610> looking<00:01:23.270> fresh<00:01:23.390> and

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
that's going to stay looking fresh and

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.710 
that's going to stay looking fresh and
nice<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:24.700> internal<00:01:25.700> internally<00:01:26.420> you<00:01:26.510> have

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
nice the internal internally you have

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.780 
nice the internal internally you have
some<00:01:26.990> small<00:01:27.170> ankle<00:01:27.710> protectors<00:01:28.220> so<00:01:28.490> there's<00:01:28.729> a

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
some small ankle protectors so there's a

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.230 
some small ankle protectors so there's a
little<00:01:28.909> bit<00:01:29.060> of<00:01:29.830> polyurethane<00:01:30.830> inside<00:01:31.430> both

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
little bit of polyurethane inside both

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.690 
little bit of polyurethane inside both
the<00:01:32.420> inside<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:32.900> out<00:01:33.290> outer<00:01:33.740> portion<00:01:34.280> of<00:01:34.460> the

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
the inside and out outer portion of the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.700 
the inside and out outer portion of the
ankle<00:01:35.150> and<00:01:35.330> what<00:01:35.750> that<00:01:35.780> does<00:01:36.049> is<00:01:36.110> if<00:01:36.290> you<00:01:36.409> do<00:01:36.560> go

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
ankle and what that does is if you do go

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.710 
ankle and what that does is if you do go
down<00:01:36.740> this<00:01:37.369> is<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:37.549> leather<00:01:37.760> upper<00:01:38.000> but<00:01:38.510> if<00:01:38.630> it

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
down this is a leather upper but if it

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.969 
down this is a leather upper but if it
wears<00:01:38.900> through<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:39.350> leather<00:01:39.560> you're

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
wears through the leather you're

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:41.200 
wears through the leather you're
actually<00:01:40.159> going<00:01:40.400> to<00:01:40.490> have<00:01:40.610> a<00:01:40.640> little<00:01:40.850> bit<00:01:40.970> of<00:01:41.090> a

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
actually going to have a little bit of a

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.210 
actually going to have a little bit of a
reinforced<00:01:41.869> area<00:01:42.530> there<00:01:42.710> so<00:01:42.920> it<00:01:42.979> doesn't

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
reinforced area there so it doesn't

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.340 
reinforced area there so it doesn't
grind<00:01:43.460> down<00:01:43.670> to<00:01:43.970> your<00:01:44.090> ankle<00:01:44.360> bone<00:01:44.510> obviously

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
grind down to your ankle bone obviously

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.710 
grind down to your ankle bone obviously
that<00:01:45.470> wouldn't<00:01:45.619> be<00:01:45.770> fun<00:01:46.060> toe<00:01:47.060> box<00:01:47.270> is<00:01:47.450> pretty

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
that wouldn't be fun toe box is pretty

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.270 
that wouldn't be fun toe box is pretty
narrow<00:01:47.930> so<00:01:48.229> you<00:01:48.380> can<00:01:48.500> get<00:01:48.619> under<00:01:48.830> the<00:01:48.920> shifter

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
narrow so you can get under the shifter

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.880 
narrow so you can get under the shifter
easily<00:01:49.610> and<00:01:49.790> then<00:01:50.210> the<00:01:50.509> soul<00:01:50.780> of<00:01:50.810> these<00:01:51.110> is<00:01:51.320> a

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
easily and then the soul of these is a

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.950 
easily and then the soul of these is a
nice<00:01:52.220> anti-slip<00:01:52.970> soul<00:01:53.270> you'll<00:01:53.509> see<00:01:53.659> it's<00:01:53.780> nice

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960
