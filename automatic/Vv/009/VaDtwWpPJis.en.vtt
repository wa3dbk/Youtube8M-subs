00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello welcome if the man andrea of 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.900
 these intimates I was going to make a rich 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.280
 gherkin sauce to eat 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.280
 The ingredients are the following 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.390
 here we have a pack of pickles in 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.220
 vinegar because with will allow I think that I 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.510
 they love terminal things but if 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.510
 you want a slightly softer sauce 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.750
 they can buy water as they can 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:39.010
 see as finite as possible so that this 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.010
 be a sauce to like 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:47.309
 taste and wine is super extreme 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.510
 I like it so much so if you do not 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.059
 like gherkins can 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.030
 replace them with readings already here 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.229
 we have pickles and the only thing 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.850
 we have to do is mix all 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:00.040
 our ingredients until we have a 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.100
 sauce to taste and sight 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.460
 stay perfect 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.200
 we have love in the life of only so the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.990
 mine can perform and even write 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.820
 in vacuum and cut it in a cube and this one 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.220
 be I want it to be noticed a little more 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:22.640
 the ham so it did not behave so small 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:22.640
 like the pickle we put ham 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.890
 we stir a little 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.149
 and 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.119
 here we have white natural yogurt without 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.490
 taste and how important you are 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.979
 fix if you have sugar or not because there 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.649
 some natural yogurt that says 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.289
 precisely without sugar but they add 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.970
 saccharin or sucralose the same so that the 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.390
 salsa like the idea that there is a sauce 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.500
 salad look at that here we have 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.500
 our yogurt 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.030
 and 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.030
 we see this 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.459
 two tablespoons of mayonnaise already totally 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:24.940
 objective if they want to have a 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.550
 first they put less if they want not 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.300
 they put 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.300
 we return 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.030
 let's talk a little bit spreading the 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.030
 sauce 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.120
 ah 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.870
 I'm missing 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:50.080
 what another spoonful of mayonnaise because not 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.860
 I do it with just mayonnaise it could be 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.560
 simply so that it is not so 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.150
 heavy that simple 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.660
 if you are left doing it without yogurt and out 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.400
 mayonnaise pay for flight from there rich 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.530
 and now to give a touch but just a 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.240
 touch because remember we had 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.780
 pretty strong and good a little 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.780
 delineating 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.650
 do not 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.420
 here we have our finished sauce 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.420
 and I'm going to try it again 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.960
 how 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.960
 great 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:38.230
 Brand new favorite masses for cocktail 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.510
 simply very quick and easy to be 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.790
 quite economical just enough that 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.800
 you see the balance that you have to 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.100
 exist between the ham and the inpe pinillo 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:51.190
 and they will be like kings or queens like that 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.630
 that they would try to prove it that has been 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.760
 everything for today continues on my facebook 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.620
 subscribe to youtube and remember that 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.740
 This is easy this is very broad we 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.740
 we see 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.070
