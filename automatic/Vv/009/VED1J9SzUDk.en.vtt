00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.710
 ocelot good let's create 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.380

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.240
 ready ready or not good 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.760
 what happens what happens what happens what happens 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.329
 for magazines 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.219
 well I'm here in mode 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.219
 survival but let's go 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.860
 we're not going to put it in a creative way 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.860
 yes 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.390
 we put 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.390
 or I have it 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.690
 or six lots 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:19.420
 and well the other thing we're going to need is 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:22.390
 raw fish fish fish as they want 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.950
 the ready creator state let's put 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.950
 about 11 lots 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.780
 we can not be fish but we have 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.560
 to be very quiet because if we 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.450
 we move a little it throws good 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.570
 for example I feel like this they come out 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.570
 running 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.210
 and they have already lost the Internet 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.560
 let's put more 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.850
 and we put this fish 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.630
 when they are seeing us in this way 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:02.350
 we give them is good to save becomes 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.800
 in trained cats and good these at 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.570
 just as dogs attack 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.630
 they all get up when you click them 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.890

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:16.110

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.480
