doing<00:02:47.580> good<00:02:47.760> with<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:48.560> water<00:02:49.560> intake<00:02:50.370> is

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
doing good with that water intake is

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.240 
doing good with that water intake is
still<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.780> know<00:02:51.930> not<00:02:52.140> as<00:02:52.290> much<00:02:52.530> as<00:02:52.740> I<00:02:52.980> probably

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
still you know not as much as I probably

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.780 
still you know not as much as I probably
should<00:02:53.580> be<00:02:54.590> it's<00:02:55.590> really<00:02:55.950> difficult<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.460> drink

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
should be it's really difficult to drink

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.710 
should be it's really difficult to drink
pina<00:02:57.330> your<00:02:57.480> fluids<00:02:57.960> it's<00:02:58.350> really<00:02:58.620> hard<00:02:58.920> to

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
pina your fluids it's really hard to

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.330 
pina your fluids it's really hard to
make<00:03:00.720> sure<00:03:00.750> that<00:03:01.110> you're<00:03:01.260> getting<00:03:01.410> all<00:03:01.890> that

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
make sure that you're getting all that

make sure that you're getting all that
in<00:03:05.090> so<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:06.660> for<00:03:07.380> Christmas<00:03:07.800> I<00:03:07.980> got<00:03:08.010> my<00:03:08.970> boyfriend

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
bought me a bunch of water bottles so I

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.300 
bought me a bunch of water bottles so I
just<00:03:11.100> try<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.310> keep<00:03:11.550> a<00:03:11.730> lot<00:03:11.910> of<00:03:11.940> bottle<00:03:12.330> with<00:03:12.480> me

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
just try to keep a lot of bottle with me

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.190 
just try to keep a lot of bottle with me
all<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.640> time<00:03:14.670> I'm<00:03:15.180> just<00:03:15.360> joking<00:03:15.900> with<00:03:16.050> you

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
know if its water crystal right or you

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.800 
know if its water crystal right or you
know<00:03:19.020> even<00:03:19.970> Hawaiian<00:03:20.970> Punch<00:03:21.150> came<00:03:21.540> out<00:03:21.690> with

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
know even Hawaiian Punch came out with

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.460 
know even Hawaiian Punch came out with
like<00:03:21.840> sugar<00:03:22.320> free<00:03:22.910> option<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:24.750> make<00:03:24.960> just<00:03:25.290> kind

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
like sugar free option to make just kind

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.290 
like sugar free option to make just kind
of<00:03:25.500> like<00:03:25.650> this<00:03:25.860> delay<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:26.550> it's<00:03:26.790> really<00:03:27.060> good

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
of like this delay and it's really good

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.020 
of like this delay and it's really good
and<00:03:27.710> it's<00:03:28.710> an<00:03:28.920> easy<00:03:29.070> way<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.370> get<00:03:29.490> your<00:03:29.640> fluids

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
and it's an easy way to get your fluids

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.550 
and it's an easy way to get your fluids
in<00:03:30.210> and<00:03:32.570> so<00:03:33.570> but<00:03:33.750> I<00:03:33.780> still<00:03:34.020> struggle<00:03:34.380> with<00:03:34.410> that

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
in and so but I still struggle with that

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.290 
in and so but I still struggle with that
and<00:03:34.920> getting<00:03:35.190> better<00:03:35.400> with<00:03:35.670> my<00:03:35.820> protein

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
and getting better with my protein

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.350 
and getting better with my protein
intake<00:03:36.890> I<00:03:37.890> still<00:03:38.730> drink<00:03:39.060> my<00:03:39.480> premier<00:03:39.870> protein

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
intake I still drink my premier protein

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.960 
intake I still drink my premier protein
chocolate<00:03:42.360> shakes<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:43.380> also<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.730> found

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
chocolate shakes and also I found

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.420 
chocolate shakes and also I found
premier<00:03:45.450> protein<00:03:45.900> makes<00:03:46.790> protein<00:03:47.790> bars<00:03:48.000> and

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
premier protein makes protein bars and

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.620 
premier protein makes protein bars and
there<00:03:50.430> was<00:03:50.550> the<00:03:50.640> best<00:03:50.820> tasting<00:03:51.270> ones<00:03:51.450> that

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
there was the best tasting ones that

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.600 
there was the best tasting ones that
I've<00:03:51.750> found<00:03:52.140> and<00:03:52.740> they<00:03:52.920> have<00:03:53.130> very<00:03:53.550> little

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
I've found and they have very little

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.170 
I've found and they have very little
sugar<00:03:54.030> and<00:03:55.100> 30<00:03:56.100> grams<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.520> protein<00:03:56.580> per<00:03:57.150> bar

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
sugar and 30 grams of protein per bar

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.870 
sugar and 30 grams of protein per bar
and<00:03:57.510> then<00:03:57.600> they<00:03:57.690> also<00:03:57.840> have<00:03:58.580> another<00:03:59.580> thing

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
and then they also have another thing

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.730 
and then they also have another thing
called<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.270> protein<00:04:00.630> crisp<00:04:00.960> which<00:04:01.350> they<00:04:01.560> have

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
called a protein crisp which they have

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.720 
called a protein crisp which they have
15<00:04:02.310> grams<00:04:02.550> of<00:04:02.790> protein<00:04:03.950> in<00:04:04.950> each<00:04:05.460> one<00:04:05.670> I

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
15 grams of protein in each one I

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.070 
15 grams of protein in each one I
haven't<00:04:06.000> tried<00:04:06.330> this<00:04:06.450> yet<00:04:06.510> but<00:04:06.840> I<00:04:06.930> was

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
haven't tried this yet but I was

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.480 
haven't tried this yet but I was
planning<00:04:07.470> on<00:04:07.560> picking<00:04:07.770> some<00:04:08.100> of<00:04:08.220> those<00:04:08.310> up

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
planning on picking some of those up

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.960 
planning on picking some of those up
this<00:04:08.700> weekend<00:04:09.350> at<00:04:10.350> Costco<00:04:10.980> Costco<00:04:11.340> carries

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
this weekend at Costco Costco carries

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.820 
this weekend at Costco Costco carries
them<00:04:12.270> and<00:04:12.540> I<00:04:12.750> hope<00:04:12.990> it's<00:04:13.170> not<00:04:13.290> a<00:04:13.350> temporary

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
them and I hope it's not a temporary

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.180 
them and I hope it's not a temporary
thing<00:04:14.190> with<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:14.850> protein<00:04:15.270> bars<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:15.780> that<00:04:17.540> and

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
thing with the protein bars and that and

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.010 
thing with the protein bars and that and
the<00:04:20.190> protein<00:04:20.669> pissed<00:04:21.000> because<00:04:21.299> I<00:04:21.510> really

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
the protein pissed because I really

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.630 
the protein pissed because I really
think<00:04:22.919> that's<00:04:23.070> a<00:04:23.220> good<00:04:23.250> place<00:04:23.669> to<00:04:23.700> get<00:04:24.060> them

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.020

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
let's see so I weigh myself pretty much

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.960 
let's see so I weigh myself pretty much
every<00:04:31.420> day<00:04:31.450> it's<00:04:32.200> horrible<00:04:32.680> but<00:04:33.220> I<00:04:35.820> don't<00:04:36.820> know

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
every day it's horrible but I don't know
