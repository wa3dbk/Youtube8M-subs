out<00:01:36.400> so<00:01:37.400> the<00:01:37.730> question<00:01:38.060> is<00:01:38.180> can<00:01:38.870> you<00:01:38.930> believe

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
out so the question is can you believe

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.710 
out so the question is can you believe
your<00:01:39.500> bike<00:01:39.650> also<00:01:40.220> under<00:01:40.640> these<00:01:40.970> conditions<00:01:41.510> I

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
your bike also under these conditions I

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.960 
your bike also under these conditions I
have<00:01:42.290> never<00:01:42.470> tried<00:01:42.770> it<00:01:42.920> but<00:01:43.340> let's<00:01:43.520> see<00:01:43.670> if<00:01:43.700> I

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
have never tried it but let's see if I

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.590 
have never tried it but let's see if I
can<00:01:44.150> lift<00:01:44.300> the<00:01:44.480> cesium<00:01:44.870> 450<00:01:45.440> with<00:01:45.620> about<00:01:45.950> 150

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
can lift the cesium 450 with about 150

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.170 
can lift the cesium 450 with about 150
453<00:01:47.600> kilograms<00:01:48.110> with<00:01:48.650> just<00:01:48.950> one<00:01:49.340> arm<00:01:49.550> let's

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
453 kilograms with just one arm let's

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.090 
453 kilograms with just one arm let's
see

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.830 

so<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.369> bag<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.579> down<00:01:56.850> can<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.390> left<00:01:57.539> it<00:01:57.719> with
