00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.010
 hi girls so today we get 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.980
 find for a new you I'm going 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:16.060
 show you how I made that echo 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.290
 so I got a little inspiration from 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.279
 reasons we find quite a lot in this 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.189
 moment on clothes 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.320
 so with little swallows for 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.079
 his decor I already applied my varnish lm 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.180
 cosmetics 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:31.660
 it's number 51 which is part of the 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:38.390
 collection but hall and I will use 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:39.670
 a brush make raphael with some 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.200
 painting the black grid 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.460
 so to make millions of her I 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.460
 start with making head 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:57.160
 then I do a little hollow 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:57.160
 here world day the same on the other side 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.270
 then 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:14.050
 continually I resume showing and in 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:18.620
 I'm doing little waves 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:27.320
 then with a little rounded I 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:30.320
 start there that two birds see I 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:34.960
 do something between a bit of a 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.970
 I do not rounded strokes straight 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:42.290
 he sails for there I do a 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:51.320
 little r'n'b does not host according to I 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:56.530
 put it away and then I have more than 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.530
 fill with black paint 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:14.620
 and finally I make him a little beak 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.620
 So here it is always the same 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.700
 you're still trying to do something 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.260
 homogeneous enough thing of spaced a small 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.260
 little early and so vaudoise high 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.390
 so here you see you do some 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.220
 birds a little in every way 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.890
 if there are some who do not have wings 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.430
 completely but parallel it's not 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.850
 very serious 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.040
 on the contrary actually birds they 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:21.709
 are not a tivoli do not have wings 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.820
 completely flat is the same so here we go 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.030
 I believe that everything I wanted you 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.800
 say on the other hand you do it in all 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.060
 the senses but you try more or less 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.840
 he's doing them in the same size 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.310
 now he uses them and 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.989
 glitter diagonal white with 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.400
 reflections I take them with the back of my 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:45.290
 brush because that's what I under 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:04:01.160
 hand to paste a layer I 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:04:02.870
 pats here is not worth it 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.470
 overload a payet it's just for 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.190
 give a touch of brilliance and more 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.110
 for the next year 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.750
 mookie panama from your top layer 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:15.549
 final coat I hope you enjoyed it 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.549
 and I'll see you soon in shambles
