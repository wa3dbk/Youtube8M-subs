start at the end of our season I think

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.830

if<00:00:26.220> we<00:00:26.310> can<00:00:26.460> do<00:00:26.640> well<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.060> FA<00:00:27.359> Cup<00:00:27.599> we<00:00:27.720> can

if we can do well in the FA Cup we can

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.390 
if we can do well in the FA Cup we can
take<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.260> form<00:00:28.590> on<00:00:28.769> into<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.039> league<00:00:29.189> and

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
chance in this week's fantasy 4450 I

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.020 
chance in this week's fantasy 4450 I
think<00:01:04.559> everybody<00:01:04.920> knows<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.280> forgot<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.820> not

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
think everybody knows I forgot it's not

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.190 
think everybody knows I forgot it's not
the<00:01:06.150> first<00:01:06.299> time<00:01:06.510> I've<00:01:06.720> forgotten<00:01:07.020> this

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the first time I've forgotten this

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.380 
the first time I've forgotten this
season<00:01:07.590> I've<00:01:07.830> cup-tied<00:01:08.189> but<00:01:08.640> there<00:01:08.820> we<00:01:08.970> go<00:01:09.150> em

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
season I've cup-tied but there we go em

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.320 
season I've cup-tied but there we go em
so<00:01:09.990> we'll<00:01:10.500> get<00:01:10.619> into<00:01:10.799> any<00:01:11.100> way<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.460> salmon<00:01:12.150> mini

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
so we'll get into any way a salmon mini

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.480 
so we'll get into any way a salmon mini
angle<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.840> think<00:01:13.110> Buckley's<00:01:13.619> probably<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.400> way

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
angle I think Buckley's probably the way

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.100 
angle I think Buckley's probably the way
that<00:01:14.520> will<00:01:14.790> go<00:01:15.030> although<00:01:15.270> obviously<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.960> can

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
that will go although obviously you can

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.660 
that will go although obviously you can
understand<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.619> back<00:01:16.830> for<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.369> all<00:01:17.520> as
