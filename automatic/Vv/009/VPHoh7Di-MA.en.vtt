00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:12.460
 It was a slow song as I said earlier that this accompaniment could be as easy as possible 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:17.920
 I did 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.550
 This time I'd like to do a song of 8 beats that is a bit early on Jesus Seaser Live 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.020
 But 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.020
 Version Lan 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.380
 During ~ 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.510
 hauhau 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.250
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.170
 me 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.230
 For a moment 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.230
 me 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.230
 me 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.070
 eor 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:52.920
 Oh yeah 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:55.820
 First of all, the range used is the same as I mentioned earlier 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.960
 Don't use 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.079
 Somewhat this 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.790
 I think it is better to put together in the lower 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.479
 It is basic 6 so I think that it is okay to use the higher ones when putting some side dishes 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.060
 Even though I 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:16.390
 The basics are somewhat lower 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.710
 The right hand plays this chord and the bass with the left hand 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.650
 so 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.650
 Harley fraction I think the first and course 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.360
 Next is g of b minutes so the main 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.460
 me 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.930
 This as good as possible not to fly this 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.659
 Coffee 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.979
 Coffee or 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.399
 Make it close together so as not to fly one 5 minutes 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.399

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:00.960
 If the race is 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.960
 I think it sounds better if you pull the body and the negative either way 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.610
 We are 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.900

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.160
 Yup 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:19.760
 It sounds too good to be be better to use the bottom 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:39.120
 But at the time of 8 beats that important thing is where to put accent though
