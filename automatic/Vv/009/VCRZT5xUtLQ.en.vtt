00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
sensor at the back like the z1 Sony said

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.990 
sensor at the back like the z1 Sony said
one<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:13.409> will<00:01:13.590> also<00:01:13.740> pack<00:01:14.100> up<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.840> 3gb<00:01:15.860> ldp<00:01:17.000> ddr3

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
one it will also pack up a 3gb ldp ddr3

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.020 
one it will also pack up a 3gb ldp ddr3
RAM<00:01:18.299> like<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.229> note<00:01:19.409> 3<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.520> kind<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.850> like

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
RAM like the note 3 so it kind of like

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.960 
RAM like the note 3 so it kind of like
it's<00:01:21.180> similar<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.810> note<00:01:22.020> 3<00:01:22.350> with<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.490> little

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
like the galaxy s4 and the North 3 the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.420 
like the galaxy s4 and the North 3 the
kind<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.310> like<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> bounce<00:01:32.880> from<00:01:33.770> s-series<00:01:34.770> to

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
kind of like a bounce from s-series to

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.600 
kind of like a bounce from s-series to
the<00:01:35.549> North<00:01:35.820> series<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.950> also<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.430> look

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
the North series and also in the look

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.910 
the North series and also in the look
wise<00:01:38.850> they're<00:01:39.540> going<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.900> same<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.380> note<00:01:40.560> 3

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
wise they're going to same the note 3
