00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.820
 hello kids welcome to a new 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.029
 carrey video in any game is a 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.610
 trick to get out of the maps in what 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:13.959
 where there are falls and they can kill you 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.959
 in which I do not like for example 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:23.060
 is for example in express I think there is no 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:26.010
 no consistency 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.660
 a recent failure 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.410
 Y 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.410
 do not improve 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.190
 come out 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.190
 you have to put him on the edge of everything 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.760
 they do not come out 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.790
 God even the balls do not go with me 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.110
 so I had to continue 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.010
 perfect the faster 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.200
 As you can see, you have to put it on the edge of the 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.790
 everything and just when you are falling right 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.380
 before you fall you have to give to the 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.990
 shoot button and do not release the button 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.060
 to shoot and you will start to fall is 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.550
 simple the flight to be applied only 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.740
 puts the initiation on the edge you fall and 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.149
 while wanting to shoot and one in 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.159
 this moment is what goes down I'm going to 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.420
 miss a thing and it's time 40 of 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.880
 zombies that I'm going to try to do in 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.830
 some zombie modes, we're going to 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.030
 leave in broken 30 rounds because I'm 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.300
 even the balls to try and not 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.929
 nothing happens 40 so there's the tip of the 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.810
 because I have little patience and I 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:47.440
 it tires quickly so it goes up 30 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.150
 these days since I think I hope that it 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.680
 I have recorded 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:55.290
 the game I 've done leads to the 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.290
 31 does not get you up to 35 good 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.940
 very many 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.140
 so see you in the next video 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.030
