I'm so excited about it it is the iPad 2
and<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:39.540> actually<00:00:40.140> ordered<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.710> over<00:00:40.860> three

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
and I actually ordered it over three

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.580 
and I actually ordered it over three
weeks<00:00:41.430> ago<00:00:41.640> but<00:00:42.000> because<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.719> don't<00:00:43.050> know<00:00:43.230> Apple

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
weeks ago but because I don't know Apple

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.250 
weeks ago but because I don't know Apple
have<00:00:43.680> had<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> short<00:00:44.640> supply<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.329> these<00:00:45.840> you

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
have had a short supply of these you

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.840 
have had a short supply of these you
know<00:00:46.410> I've<00:00:46.800> had<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.160> wait<00:00:47.309> for<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.610> come

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
know I've had to wait for it to come

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.560 
know I've had to wait for it to come
from<00:00:48.120> China

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
from China

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.940 
from China
I<00:00:48.719> believe<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.260> that's<00:00:49.410> why<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.590> took<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:49.800> long

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
I believe so that's why it took so long

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.830 
I believe so that's why it took so long
that<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.850> was<00:00:51.000> most<00:00:51.180> definitely<00:00:51.270> worth<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
that it was most definitely worth the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.740 
that it was most definitely worth the
wait<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.949> I'm<00:00:53.640> just<00:00:53.850> just<00:00:54.270> placed<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.600> on<00:00:54.660> my

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
wait so I'm just just placed it on my

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.010 
wait so I'm just just placed it on my
