00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 scented products we have plenty of 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.299
 all kinds 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.480
 already for the body of the perfumes of the gels 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.980
 antibacterial full wipes 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.110
 full of scented products 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.549
 but today I decided to 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.859
 talk about my five scented products 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.449
 favorite for the summer if victoria stick 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.520
 louette they are really very february 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.070
 to make perfumes that are really 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.269
 really amazing that really feels 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.580
 that they are too pleasant 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.130
 my favorite for summer is the sky 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.890
 bright from the bright sony lineup that was 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.480
 released last summer actually is that I 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.890
 still have not finished anyway end it 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.840
 I'm not bad but I use them 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.520
 not so much because I actually 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.200
 afraid to finish everything and I know that 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.600
 it's a range that actually exists 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.610
 more that was done last year 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.530
 So it's a shower gel that 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.660
 exfoliating he has plenty of small by mx 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.719
 orleans inside and that's it 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.640
 really - favorite shower gels of all 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.390

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.219

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.480

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.829
 bomb from victoria's stick louette 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.050
 but I thought I'm talking about it 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.770
 has stayed largely on my channel and 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.480
 on my blog 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.939

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.500

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.790

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.560

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.210
