00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.179
 Hello dear video listeners with 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.700
 you are a platoon of Kiev m and today our eyes 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.150
 fell to tank level five chinese 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.400
 branches type t-34 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.500
 Let's understand how behaves 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.470
 this car is among its fellows and 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:31.550
 what equipment modules do you need for it 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:34.890
 ship from my personal experience I know what 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:39.600
 engine masthead put on this car 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.180
 in general, it is not necessary because the power 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.270
 engine total example exceeds 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.760
 stock capacity for 20 units is 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.750
 add you a maximum of half a kilometer 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.550
 at one o'clock I think the experience you spend is not 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.680
 I want therefore installed engine is not 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:01.440
 need the same walkie talkie 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.600
 stuff ass and go on line 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.340
 which one you choose further that is 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:11.460
 set the tower top gun and 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.710
 caterpillar to the battles, we do not go a 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.280
 until we figure out what equipment is needed 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.009
 upload to our medium tank 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.970
 the first is of course improved 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.580
 ventilation class 2 gun rammer 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:29.210
 Well, the following I will certainly advise 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.070
 install reinforced aiming drives 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.530
 because this tank has information 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.280
 long and or you can 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.380
 to establish 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.100
 clarified optics to improve 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:45.320
 review, it will also be a good plus to 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:49.579
 this car is a standard set 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:53.460
 gear crew we swing at all easy 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:57.230
 remembered very quickly skill first 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.800
 sixth sense sweat 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.200
 other crew members have this repair 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:07.310
 the second profession will be better of course 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.350
 masking pitching oh well the third it was 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.660
 nothing at all 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.640
 I do not see 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.990
 consider the advantages of our car and immediately 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.510
 I will say that it is not a plus 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:24.080
 booking body and tower 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:27.410
 at the same time because from unit hull 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.720
 is 45 units and towers total 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.840
 only 52 millimeters what is it well for 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:37.010
 We are of course nothing, but if we stand under no 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.340
 bad angle you can often catch 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.050
 bounce so take advantage of the moment 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.120
 We look further at the review of the tank, too 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.430
 makes up good units but how am I 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.340
 said can upload enlightened 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.220
 optics communication range is also weak but 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.670
 option as I said download is not necessary 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.300
 because of the loss of experience big after that 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.880
 damage is 64 106 units in general 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.150
 not bad especially with its fast perry 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.390
 charge two and a half seconds 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:11.570
 the following look it we have it good 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:16.459
 the speed of rotation of the tower and the chassis 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:19.220
 too good to weight also mean 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.739
 you can beat a ram those who love ram 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.560
 can load medium 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:29.030
 anti-splinter podboy almost be 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:33.700
 okay in general on the pros we finished 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.700
 You can go directly to the battles 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:47.599
 and what we see as I already said them 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:51.000
 lower broneliste q-1 is sewed to cheer but 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:54.330
 now we see an unexpected turn 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.670
 which I wanted to talk about but still 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:02.550
 reserved it for later as well as a look 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:06.110
 our units of strength kv-1s sews us 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.910
 just with a bang so we repent 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:12.269
 We train to play on our technology 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:16.889
 the main thing is not to go for trouble in this fight 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:19.430
 I did nothing we observe the following 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.930
 moments we see that 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.530
 the opponent of the fifth level is our technique 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:29.210
 sews with a bang so take advantage of the moment 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:33.240
 and destroy our opponents 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:36.060
 remember and listen carefully on this 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:40.139
 car can not climb under fire 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:43.740
 opponents as well as easily lost hop 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.370
 due to lack of armor so lovers 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.640
 tyazhey 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:52.500
 I do not advise to rush forward as you do. 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:58.010
 do most of the cache how there 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:03.419
 let's say well shorter on tyazhy on tyazh 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:08.070
 so st lovers are listening i remember 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:11.160
 I think you are not noobs so you 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.140
 lucky as we see also has a chance 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.960
 ricochet as seen from the forehead 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:20.130
 bounce well again got 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:22.410
 damage and rebound well as I said for 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:26.729
 lack of armor this tank loses a lot 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:29.370
 lives in general, we have considered 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:32.789
 the behavior of our tank in battles among 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.340
 sixth and fifth levels as i hope you 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.860
 remember that you can not explode on the rampage 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.590
 due to lack of armor it's me 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:46.650
 I speak for the third time just in case 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:48.930
 and who did not remember the whole class in general 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:55.520
 this car and funny 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:59.340
 I didnâ€™t show them to you 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:02.330
 skill playing this tank and all with 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:06.120
 work with you were cocked kiev m
