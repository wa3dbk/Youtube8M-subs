00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.100
 Tuesday, how rich are you going and how rich are you? 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.690
 of death for you right now we are going to do 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.240
 some shrimp lying down that is a 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.590
 recipe very easy to make very nutritious 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.390
 very rich the union will love 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.490
 apart with the roll of that camaroncito 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.169
 I'm lying down with three streams because it gives me 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.179
 some chicken can also get there 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:24.339
 to use for these kind of scenes 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.990
 this way more canvas form that already 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:27.519
 about the holiday season then 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.070
 you can start using this type of 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:33.250
 recipes then to avoid feeling like 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.910
 goals pedrito well while screaming many 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.370
 versions of the cold cinema not with this one 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.870
 be warm, I'm not cold either 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.030
 here with our heats re well 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.960
 serious faces of to disappear is the 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.550
 recipe a little bit is needed 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.800
 butter also garlic 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.950
 let's obviously use shrimp 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.590
 they have to be shrimp to hang me 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.239
 because if you 're not art, we can not 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.750
 cook if it's not with cameras the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.750
 justice no 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:08.299
 frescoed really chidos 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.299
 they keep moving they're still alive 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.810
 mushrooms you in house can 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.640
 also use another type of 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.740
 mushrooms can be portovelo can 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.119
 being mushroom can really be the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.830
 mushroom that you crave 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.050
 we got the mushroom 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.000
 traditional because it's much easier to 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.119
 find and well we already know that then 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.500
 in the house there is an address where they see us 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.229
 find all the products and 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.000
 good little cheat not check 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.590
 very simple what are we going to do 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.060
 I put to heat my pan is already a 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.770
 little hot so I'm going to withdraw 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.860
 of the fire but I invite you to 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.020
 house let him start to warm up 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.210
 a medium fire and already on that fire 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.510
 half let's throw the butter in the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.580
 skillet 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.260
 to start melting 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.260
 oh he already took off olive out there 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.080
 Let's see 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.820
 and it comes out 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.250
 Olive oil will work for me 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.010
 for the butter to caramelize but 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.550
 I do not know that I really walk then thank you 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.810
 mom thank you thanks we're going to 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.970
 pour a little bit of olive oil to 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.270
 that the oil temperature of the 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.400
 butter I can stand here the 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.610
 butter as you would say butter 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.860
 coffee appointment and that's how we're going to put 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.930
 us our eyes 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.360
 as to grip color 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.770
 butter with some slight circles 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.750
 mild 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.650
 and on that we are going to put our 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.500
 fresh fresh shrimp from the coast 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.220
 well I'm going to take a refractory 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.230
 this redondito 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.820
 we already removed our shrimp from 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.950
 fire let's let them run out of 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.710
 do there and what we are going to do is that 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.820
 let's place on top of each mushroom 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.200
 a shrimp quoted in this case I'm going to put 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.020
 first the mushrooms so they do not 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.610
 I'm going to mouth you guys have 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.030
 mushrooms a little bit bigger 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.290
 they can open the mushroom 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.900
 and put the shrimp 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.080
 if he got married portovelo in the port what 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.510
 you know very rich 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.970
 So what we are going to do is put 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.000
 the mushroom part is a food 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.890
 with a lot of protein and this makes 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.230
 those who want to go to the gym 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.510
 this that this type of dishes are the 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.100

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.430

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.770
 so here we already have this and we removed 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.600
 the trunk 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.210
