00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.169 

this<00:00:10.030> is<00:00:10.209> my<00:00:10.450> water<00:00:10.809> heater<00:00:11.049> stove<00:00:11.889> with

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
this is my water heater stove with

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.569 
this is my water heater stove with
inserted<00:00:13.179> water<00:00:13.750> pot<00:00:15.420> like<00:00:16.420> that<00:00:17.520> there<00:00:18.520> are

00:00:18.569 --> 00:00:18.579 
inserted water pot like that there are

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.140 
inserted water pot like that there are
fire<00:00:18.820> breaks<00:00:19.300> around<00:00:19.660> the<00:00:20.110> fire<00:00:20.349> chamber<00:00:21.150> they

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
fire breaks around the fire chamber they

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.380 
fire breaks around the fire chamber they
protect<00:00:22.750> the<00:00:23.079> steel<00:00:23.349> plate<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:25.029> when<00:00:25.240> they

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
protect the steel plate and when they

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.040 
protect the steel plate and when they
are<00:00:25.480> hot<00:00:25.720> they<00:00:26.410> keep<00:00:26.769> the<00:00:26.980> water<00:00:27.220> warm<00:00:27.990> for<00:00:28.990> a

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
are hot they keep the water warm for a

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:36.990 
are hot they keep the water warm for a
long<00:00:29.199> time<00:00:34.830> let's<00:00:35.830> see<00:00:36.010> how<00:00:36.190> my<00:00:36.430> water<00:00:36.730> heater

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
long time let's see how my water heater

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.829 
long time let's see how my water heater
work<00:00:37.930> so<00:00:38.379> I<00:00:39.180> stack<00:00:40.180> the<00:00:40.300> pot<00:00:40.480> full<00:00:40.930> of<00:00:41.110> snow

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:42.839 
work so I stack the pot full of snow

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:49.590 
work so I stack the pot full of snow
let's<00:00:43.839> see<00:00:44.019> how<00:00:44.110> it's<00:00:44.260> going<00:00:46.140> okay<00:00:47.140> so<00:00:48.570> now<00:00:49.570> I

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
let's see how it's going okay so now I

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.750 
let's see how it's going okay so now I
started<00:00:49.989> to<00:00:50.140> melt<00:00:50.350> so<00:00:50.619> I<00:00:50.680> had<00:00:50.860> to<00:00:51.040> add<00:00:51.400> some

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
started to melt so I had to add some

00:00:51.760 --> 00:01:07.999 
started to melt so I had to add some
more<00:00:52.000> snow<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.890> get<00:01:03.750> okay

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.800 

you<00:01:09.009> have<00:01:09.130> to<00:01:09.280> poke<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.790> snow<00:01:10.090> pretty<00:01:10.509> often

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
you have to poke the snow pretty often

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.620 
you have to poke the snow pretty often
because<00:01:11.080> as<00:01:11.950> you<00:01:12.100> can<00:01:12.250> see<00:01:12.520> it<00:01:12.730> shrinks<00:01:13.420> and

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
because as you can see it shrinks and

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.800 
because as you can see it shrinks and
then<00:01:14.320> it<00:01:14.500> doesn't<00:01:14.710> as<00:01:15.310> a<00:01:15.700> gap<00:01:16.060> on<00:01:16.330> either<00:01:16.510> side

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
then it doesn't as a gap on either side

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.310 
then it doesn't as a gap on either side
then<00:01:17.020> it<00:01:17.170> doesn't<00:01:17.500> melt<00:01:17.920> properly

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.110 

the<00:01:23.320> pot<00:01:23.530> is<00:01:23.560> very<00:01:23.770> hot<00:01:24.390> because<00:01:25.390> of<00:01:25.540> the<00:01:25.659> cat

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
the pot is very hot because of the cat

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:35.160 
the pot is very hot because of the cat
now<00:01:28.120> it<00:01:28.180> just<00:01:28.450> stays<00:01:28.780> there<00:01:29.260> now<00:01:29.890> it's<00:01:30.460> better

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.719 

okay<00:01:36.170> now<00:01:36.439> it's<00:01:36.560> almost<00:01:36.740> boiling<00:01:39.250> it<00:01:40.250> actually

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
okay now it's almost boiling it actually

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.389 
okay now it's almost boiling it actually
takes<00:01:41.090> much<00:01:41.479> longer<00:01:41.780> time<00:01:42.110> to<00:01:42.830> melt<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.340> snow

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
takes much longer time to melt the snow

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.190 
takes much longer time to melt the snow
than<00:01:44.320> to<00:01:45.320> heat<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.070> water<00:01:46.100> they<00:01:46.490> took<00:01:46.670> about

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
than to heat the water they took about

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.679 
than to heat the water they took about
wood<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:48.350> would<00:01:48.439> have<00:01:48.619> full<00:01:49.250> fire<00:01:49.670> it<00:01:50.330> took

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
wood it would have full fire it took

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.660 
wood it would have full fire it took
about<00:01:50.810> ten<00:01:51.500> minutes<00:01:51.710> about<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.250> snow<00:01:52.490> and

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
about ten minutes about the snow and

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.940 
about ten minutes about the snow and
five<00:01:52.939> minutes<00:01:53.299> to<00:01:53.750> heat<00:01:53.929> the<00:01:54.080> water<00:01:54.320> near<00:01:54.890> the

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
five minutes to heat the water near the

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.160 
five minutes to heat the water near the
boiling<00:01:55.310> point

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.170 

the<00:02:00.470> internal<00:02:01.010> structure<00:02:01.400> is<00:02:01.430> very<00:02:01.670> simple

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
the internal structure is very simple

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.230 
the internal structure is very simple
the<00:02:02.330> burning<00:02:02.630> gases<00:02:02.960> flow<00:02:03.200> up<00:02:03.350> from<00:02:03.560> here<00:02:03.800> and

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
the burning gases flow up from here and

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.160 
the burning gases flow up from here and
then<00:02:05.470> below<00:02:06.470> and<00:02:06.950> besides<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:08.060> water<00:02:08.479> pot<00:02:08.899> and

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
then below and besides the water pot and

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.880 
then below and besides the water pot and
the<00:02:09.770> end<00:02:09.860> of<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.100> chimney<00:02:10.490> I<00:02:11.590> made<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:12.620> hole<00:02:12.860> on

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
the end of the chimney I made a hole on

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.980 
the end of the chimney I made a hole on
the<00:02:13.130> upper<00:02:13.400> plate<00:02:13.730> so<00:02:14.270> I'll<00:02:14.330> go<00:02:14.450> put<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.750> water

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
the upper plate so I'll go put the water

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.910 
the upper plate so I'll go put the water
put<00:02:15.350> there<00:02:15.760> like<00:02:16.760> that

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
put there like that

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.920 
put there like that
tightly
