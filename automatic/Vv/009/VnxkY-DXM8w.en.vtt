00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
I like it so doesn't reset and the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.420 
I like it so doesn't reset and the
specialist<00:02:01.170> thing<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.979> whole<00:02:02.130> part<00:02:02.399> of

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
specialist thing that the whole part of

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.670 
specialist thing that the whole part of
that<00:02:02.579> it's<00:02:02.790> not<00:02:03.000> going<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.509> change<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.500> game

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
that it's not going to change the game

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.679 
that it's not going to change the game
drastically<00:02:05.430> once<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.210> complete<00:02:06.659> a

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
drastically once you complete a

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.809 
drastically once you complete a
specialist<00:02:07.229> thing<00:02:07.409> you'll<00:02:07.560> get<00:02:07.819> somewhat

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
specialist thing you'll get somewhat

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.360 
specialist thing you'll get somewhat
like<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> perk<00:02:09.379> metal<00:02:10.379> know<00:02:10.709> if<00:02:10.770> innocent<00:02:11.069> and

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
like a perk metal know if innocent and

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.770 
like a perk metal know if innocent and
calling<00:02:11.610> them<00:02:11.640> pursed<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:12.150> apologize<00:02:12.540> if<00:02:12.660> I'm

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
calling them pursed I apologize if I'm

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.390 
calling them pursed I apologize if I'm
using<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.110> wrong<00:02:13.200> terminology

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
using the wrong terminology

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.699 
using the wrong terminology
it's<00:02:14.970> kind<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.599> perk<00:02:15.840> based<00:02:16.079> but<00:02:16.379> basically

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
it's kind of perk based but basically

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.009 
it's kind of perk based but basically
one<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:17.069> them<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.489> you<00:02:18.120> can<00:02:18.450> assassinate

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
one of them is you can assassinate

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.869 
one of them is you can assassinate
people<00:02:19.500> faster<00:02:20.040> like<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.370> animation<00:02:20.790> is

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
people faster like the animation is

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.300 
people faster like the animation is
faster<00:02:21.269> so<00:02:21.870> it's<00:02:22.379> it's<00:02:22.680> little<00:02:22.980> stuff<00:02:23.189> it's

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
faster so it's it's little stuff it's

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.740 
faster so it's it's little stuff it's
not<00:02:23.459> really<00:02:23.700> going<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.849> change<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.209> game<00:02:24.360> but

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
not really going to change the game but

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.000 
not really going to change the game but
it's<00:02:24.900> kind<00:02:25.019> of<00:02:25.079> cool<00:02:25.260> little<00:02:25.530> stuff<00:02:25.769> that<00:02:25.950> you

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
it's kind of cool little stuff that you

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.309 
it's kind of cool little stuff that you
can<00:02:26.129> pick<00:02:26.280> up<00:02:26.569> now<00:02:27.569> as<00:02:27.720> far<00:02:27.840> as<00:02:27.900> how<00:02:28.110> this

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
can pick up now as far as how this

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.259 
can pick up now as far as how this
ranking<00:02:28.829> system<00:02:29.220> is<00:02:29.340> going<00:02:29.459> to<00:02:29.519> go<00:02:29.670> I'm<00:02:29.909> not

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
ranking system is going to go I'm not

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.030 
ranking system is going to go I'm not

ruining the game no but now my thoughts
have<00:02:43.859> changed<00:02:44.189> on<00:02:44.310> that<00:02:44.480> because<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.930> feel<00:02:46.260> like

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
have changed on that because I feel like

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.199 
have changed on that because I feel like
really<00:02:48.269> how<00:02:48.540> how<00:02:48.870> how<00:02:49.109> many<00:02:49.440> people<00:02:49.799> have<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.819> 50

really how how how many people have a 50

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.789 
really how how how many people have a 50
in<00:02:51.359> halo<00:02:51.569> 3<00:02:51.840> depending<00:02:52.079> on<00:02:52.290> how<00:02:52.409> hard<00:02:52.650> this

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
in halo 3 depending on how hard this

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.759

ranking<00:02:53.069> system<00:02:53.430> will<00:02:53.549> be<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.810> how<00:02:55.680> many

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
ranking system will be and how many

people are going to be able to get one
inhale<00:02:57.000> for<00:02:57.389> so<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:58.019> would<00:02:58.409> assume<00:02:58.560> it's

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
inhale for so I would assume it's

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.039 
inhale for so I would assume it's

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
probably going to be credit or XP base

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.470 
probably going to be credit or XP base

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.020 
do this commentary on Thursday when I

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.520 
was really bummed about it cuz my
initial<00:03:57.389> thought<00:03:57.599> was<00:03:57.750> it's<00:03:58.109> probably

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
initial thought was it's probably

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.280 
initial thought was it's probably
definitely<00:03:58.799> going<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.489> be<00:03:59.639> an<00:03:59.879> XP<00:04:00.659> or<00:04:00.690> credit

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
definitely going to be an XP or credit

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.930 
definitely going to be an XP or credit
based<00:04:01.470> system<00:04:02.069> and<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.940> was<00:04:03.090> like<00:04:03.299> that<00:04:03.659> is<00:04:04.019> just

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
based system and I was like that is just

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.360 
based system and I was like that is just
terrible<00:04:05.940> for<00:04:06.209> me<00:04:06.419> because<00:04:06.959> I<00:04:07.260> just<00:04:07.739> I<00:04:08.310> was

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
terrible for me because I just I was

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.819 
terrible for me because I just I was
really<00:04:08.459> upset<00:04:08.669> when<00:04:09.209> I<00:04:09.989> first<00:04:10.199> found<00:04:10.470> out<00:04:10.650> the

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
really upset when I first found out the

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.430 
really upset when I first found out the
news<00:04:11.010> but<00:04:11.459> I'm<00:04:11.669> pretty<00:04:12.120> stoked<00:04:12.510> now<00:04:12.599> and<00:04:12.959> I

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
news but I'm pretty stoked now and I

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.050 
news but I'm pretty stoked now and I
think<00:04:13.470> overall<00:04:14.040> it's<00:04:14.430> going<00:04:14.609> to<00:04:14.669> be<00:04:14.760> able<00:04:14.909> to

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
think overall it's going to be able to

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.240 
think overall it's going to be able to
bring<00:04:15.180> in<00:04:15.269> some<00:04:16.079> younger<00:04:16.440> players<00:04:16.709> some<00:04:17.070> less

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
bring in some younger players some less

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.710 
bring in some younger players some less
skilled<00:04:17.579> players<00:04:17.849> going<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:18.299> give<00:04:18.419> some

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
skilled players going to give some

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.430 
skilled players going to give some
incentive<00:04:19.289> to<00:04:20.630> to<00:04:21.630> pull<00:04:21.840> on<00:04:21.989> those<00:04:22.169> players

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
incentive to to pull on those players

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.469 
incentive to to pull on those players
because<00:04:22.889> there<00:04:23.370> is<00:04:23.520> definitely<00:04:24.000> at<00:04:24.150> least<00:04:24.180> as

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
because there is definitely at least as

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:25.879 
because there is definitely at least as
far<00:04:24.630> as<00:04:24.750> halo<00:04:25.020> 3<00:04:25.229> there's<00:04:25.409> a<00:04:25.469> pretty<00:04:25.710> big

far as halo 3 there's a pretty big

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.670
