somewhat<00:01:36.540> high<00:01:36.659> stats<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.110> think<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.530> 50

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
somewhat high stats I think it's like 50

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.550 
somewhat high stats I think it's like 50
slayer<00:01:38.640> like<00:01:39.030> 60<00:01:39.540> smithing<00:01:40.020> stuff<00:01:40.259> like<00:01:40.409> that

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
slayer like 60 smithing stuff like that

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.289 
slayer like 60 smithing stuff like that
and<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.250> can<00:01:41.369> go<00:01:41.520> back<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.790> forth<00:01:41.939> even<00:01:42.180> when

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
and you can go back and forth even when

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.240 
and you can go back and forth even when
you're<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.450> combat<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.869> everything<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:44.130> this

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
you're in combat and everything so this

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.080 
you're in combat and everything so this
is<00:01:44.340> gonna<00:01:44.460> be<00:01:44.579> really<00:01:44.670> good<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:44.970> there<00:01:45.060> is

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
is gonna be really good and there is

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.370 
is gonna be really good and there is
actually<00:01:45.390> one<00:01:45.540> other<00:01:45.630> shortcut<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.259> one

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
actually one other shortcut and this one

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.499 
actually one other shortcut and this one
requires<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.950> hard<00:01:47.280> diaries<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.420> be

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
requires the hard diaries and it can be

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.389 
requires the hard diaries and it can be
another<00:01:48.689> possible<00:01:49.079> option<00:01:49.200> for<00:01:49.710> escaping

another possible option for escaping

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.210 
another possible option for escaping
peakers<00:01:51.350> this<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.530> probably<00:01:52.799> much<00:01:53.009> more

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
peakers this is probably much more

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.130 
peakers this is probably much more
common<00:01:53.579> location<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.240> actually<00:01:54.630> encounter

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.179 
pk's and if you're killing lava dragons
you<00:01:58.079> probably<00:01:58.350> would<00:01:58.500> have<00:01:58.619> an<00:01:58.740> anti<00:01:58.920> dragon
