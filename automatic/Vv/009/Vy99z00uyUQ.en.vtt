00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.620
 everything I'm using in your prime a 

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:11.080
 Beauty except for my eyeliner 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.719
 eyelashes false eyebrows and brand 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.599
 being I am going to quickly review what 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:19.060
 I have put I have the corrector in tone 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:23.230
 medium I applied it around my eyes 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:29.679
 of my nose and then for my face mix 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:32.769
 the base in my well and the 24k illuminator and 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:38.589
 you do not really notice much the 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:41.420
 luminosity but I did notice that the base 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:45.469
 It has a light coverage 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.649
 maybe from light to medium if you want 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:51.199
 work the most but it's pretty light 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.600
 and one layer was not enough to cover 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.760
 the area of ​​my nose so re apply 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.519
 the base in my nose and I wanted to use the 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.489
 illuminator alone to see if it looks 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.170
 so I took the rose gold tone and put it 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.170
 arribita of my cheeks 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.689
 if you can see the brightness is the illuminator 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.289
 the blush I'm using is that of 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:15.710
 ignite and you know it's very pigmented a 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:19.069
 Little was enough for shadows 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.770
 I'm using cappuccino and 24k the 

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:25.429
 application was very simple so too 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.770
 is the concealer as prime of the eyes and 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:30.560
 I have to say that my favorite product 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.500
 after trying it is the lipstick I'm 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.069
 using the super feather for some reason not 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.659
 I hoped it was a shiny lipstick and 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:41.270
 sticky and I'm surprised 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.490
 finished and that it feels very soft 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.829
 I like it even though the base is very 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.880
 clear I think I was able to work with 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.610
 she 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.219
 it looks so bad so let's see the proof 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.039
 of the photograph with flash and we'll see if 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:59.380
 it's very clear to me I want to say I'm 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.380
 using artificial light , so 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.460
 bonelli 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.490
 it looked very white ok 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.130
 I will use this throughout the day and it is the 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.210
 ume on point so I'll be back in a 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.210
 hour with natural light 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:21.920
 it's been like an hour and it's 2:15 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.500
 pm the base looks very good and notice that even 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.780
 it looks natural and if you can see the brightness 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.849
 around my face 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.239
 I forgot to mention that I'm also 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:34.189
 using the powder on my face around 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.670
 my forehead my nose 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:40.760
 and my chin and you can see the reflection in 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.700
 my cheeks if I liked the illuminator 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.939
 I thought it's going to be too subtle but 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.510
 it is also seen in natural light so 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:53.530
 I will return at the end of the night is the 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.530
 debut with equal 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:06.370
 It's the end of the day and they're like nine o'clock 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:08.860
 sharp and I see the base super shiny 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.690
 it fell around my nose and no longer 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.680
 You can see the blush around my 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.410
 cheeks looks like washed out leaves alone 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.459
 touch me a little with the dust and 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.459
 we'll see what it looks like 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.409
 that does not look very good stuck to my 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.409
 areas 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.100
 dry 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.230
 my thoughts or opinion about the 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.650
 premium beauty line after trying it 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.770
 all day is that I would not buy again 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.710
 the liquid base for that price that are 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.800
 almost 15 dollars I can find a 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:54.550
 better commercial base that not only has 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.880
 better selection of colors but 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.920
 would take much dust that 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.630
 I would skip it there are many better 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.870
 commercial powders in the market and 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:08.650
 probably cheaper if I liked the 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:11.800
 illuminator would use it alone to 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.440
 create a subtle shine it looks good and 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.200
 natural in particular I liked the lipstick 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.320
 just replicate it twice and after 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.600
 what committee did not come at all do not know 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.910
 happened of the lines maybe you see a 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:29.080
 little washed out but mostly 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:31.420
 stayed fixed you know that my blush is not 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.400
 it was put but you can still see my 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.770
 to pronounce like that is that I think the blush 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.599
 it did not have very good duration 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:42.400
 in summary I think the line is fine 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:46.000
 personally I would not call it line 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.150
 premium beauty I mean it's for over 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.490
 tony wang is just I do not mean cheap 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.479
 but 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.910
 they are known to be economical and 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.220
 I do not think this line of makeup is 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.500
 necessarily economic but if my 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.370
 favorites of this line are the raiels 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:08.280
 and the illuminators the rest is like look 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.590
 Anyway, so if this was my review 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.330
 please, I like it if it was 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.979

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.139

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:19.560
 soon dance that you see what the 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:23.190
 true color definitely not me 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:27.180

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:31.849
