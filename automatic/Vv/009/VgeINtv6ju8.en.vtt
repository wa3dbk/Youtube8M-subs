00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.110 

and<00:04:43.900> some<00:04:44.110> people<00:04:44.199> wonder<00:04:44.530> like<00:04:45.310> my<00:04:45.490> EDC<00:04:45.789> why

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
and some people wonder like my EDC why

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.589 
and some people wonder like my EDC why
carry<00:04:46.449> so<00:04:46.689> much<00:04:46.840> weapons<00:04:47.349> and<00:04:47.620> whatnot<00:04:48.599> all

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
right I'm going to probably go off on a

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.260 
right I'm going to probably go off on a
tangent<00:04:50.680> talking<00:04:51.370> about<00:04:51.520> my<00:04:51.610> philosophy<00:04:52.180> at

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
tangent talking about my philosophy at

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.020 
tangent talking about my philosophy at
fighting<00:04:52.509> so<00:04:52.719> bear<00:04:52.900> with<00:04:52.930> me<00:04:53.080> because<00:04:54.030> the

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
fighting so bear with me because the

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.499 
fighting so bear with me because the
basic<00:04:55.419> thing<00:04:55.599> is<00:04:56.340> fighting<00:04:57.340> isn't<00:04:57.520> there<00:04:58.030> so

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:58.509 
basic thing is fighting isn't there so

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:01.290 
basic thing is fighting isn't there so
don't<00:04:58.659> fight<00:04:58.990> fair<00:04:59.610> you<00:05:00.610> always<00:05:00.939> want<00:05:01.120> to<00:05:01.180> be

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:03.939 
one notch above the other person the

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:05.369 
one notch above the other person the
only<00:05:04.210> way<00:05:04.300> fighting<00:05:04.629> is<00:05:04.750> fairs<00:05:05.050> if<00:05:05.259> you're

00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:05.379 
only way fighting is fairs if you're

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:08.640 
only way fighting is fairs if you're
fighting<00:05:05.710> a<00:05:05.770> clone<00:05:06.360> cousin<00:05:07.360> no<00:05:07.990> two<00:05:08.050> people

is strong as it is in better fit better
shape<00:05:17.490> sometimes<00:05:18.490> you<00:05:18.610> need<00:05:18.699> an<00:05:18.819> equalizer

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
shape sometimes you need an equalizer

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.029 
shape sometimes you need an equalizer
and<00:05:21.520> my<00:05:21.759> philosophy<00:05:22.330> is<00:05:22.889> anything<00:05:23.889> worth

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
and my philosophy is anything worth

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.550 
and my philosophy is anything worth
fighting<00:05:24.460> for<00:05:24.669> is<00:05:24.940> worth<00:05:25.120> dying<00:05:25.330> for<00:05:25.560> or

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
fighting for is worth dying for or

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.510 
fighting for is worth dying for or
killing<00:05:27.159> for<00:05:27.719> so<00:05:28.719> you<00:05:28.810> better<00:05:29.020> be<00:05:29.169> prepared

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
killing for so you better be prepared

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.860

you<00:05:30.520> have<00:05:30.669> to<00:05:30.789> have<00:05:30.879> that<00:05:31.000> mindset<00:05:31.180> if<00:05:31.690> you're

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
you have to have that mindset if you're

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.879 
you have to have that mindset if you're
going<00:05:31.960> to<00:05:32.020> survive<00:05:32.169> in<00:05:32.590> this<00:05:32.680> world<00:05:34.440> okay<00:05:35.440> so

going to survive in this world okay so

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.899 
going to survive in this world okay so
enough<00:05:36.490> of<00:05:36.580> that<00:05:36.659> so<00:05:37.659> 2<00:05:38.440> inch<00:05:38.620> blade<00:05:38.909> some

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:39.909 
enough of that so 2 inch blade some
