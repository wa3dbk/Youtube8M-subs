this one here is just a really dark spot
so<00:03:51.540> if<00:03:51.630> you're<00:03:51.750> trying<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:52.020> play<00:03:52.230> surge

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
so if you're trying to play surge

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.370 
so if you're trying to play surge
conservative<00:03:53.790> whatever<00:03:54.209> high-traffic<00:03:55.020> area

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
conservative whatever high-traffic area

it's really dark really hard to see us

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.770 
it's really dark really hard to see us
so<00:03:56.820> we<00:03:56.910> thought<00:03:57.030> would<00:03:57.150> include<00:03:57.450> that<00:03:57.600> in

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
so we thought would include that in

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.100 
so we thought would include that in
there<00:03:58.610> here<00:03:59.610> this<00:03:59.790> is<00:03:59.910> a<00:03:59.940> nice<00:04:00.209> little<00:04:00.480> shot

there here this is a nice little shot

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.140 
there here this is a nice little shot
spot<00:04:01.410> you<00:04:01.560> could<00:04:01.680> use<00:04:01.860> for<00:04:02.220> montages<00:04:03.060> or

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
spot you could use for montages or

spot you could use for montages or
something<00:04:03.360> like<00:04:03.420> that<00:04:03.510> this<00:04:04.080> is<00:04:04.200> a<00:04:04.260> jump

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
something like that this is a jump

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.590 
something like that this is a jump
noscope<00:04:04.920> maybe<00:04:05.130> pull<00:04:05.400> 360<00:04:06.000> shoot<00:04:06.209> back<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:06.510> the
