00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.100 
game is developing and how it's just not
as<00:01:07.650> exciting<00:01:08.130> as<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.369> used<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.729> be<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.119> don't

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
as exciting as it used to be and don't

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.020 
as exciting as it used to be and don't
really<00:01:10.229> care<00:01:10.680> as<00:01:10.710> much<00:01:10.920> about<00:01:11.100> Marvel<00:01:11.670> anymore

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
really care as much about Marvel anymore

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.130 
really care as much about Marvel anymore
even<00:01:12.180> though<00:01:12.390> it's<00:01:12.540> technically<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> most

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
even though it's technically the most

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.499 
even though it's technically the most
hyped<00:01:13.470> game<00:01:13.740> out<00:01:13.890> there<00:01:13.920> but<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.460> felt<00:01:15.000> like<00:01:15.119> the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
hyped game out there but I felt like the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.090 
hyped game out there but I felt like the
overall<00:01:15.900> scene<00:01:16.140> from<00:01:16.320> Marvel<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.920> game

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
overall scene from Marvel and the game

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.890 
overall scene from Marvel and the game
itself<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.520> kind<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:17.909> like<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.330> slow

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
itself is kind of on like a slow

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.080 
itself is kind of on like a slow
downtrend<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.950> made<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.310> discussion<00:01:20.880> and

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
downtrend I made this discussion and

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.990

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
interestingly enough a similar or a very

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.700 
interestingly enough a similar or a very
unique<00:01:24.270> response<00:01:24.689> came<00:01:24.930> from<00:01:25.110> bisque<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.500> who

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710
