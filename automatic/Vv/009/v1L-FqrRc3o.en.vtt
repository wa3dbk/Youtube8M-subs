00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
to eat until you're satisfied I've been

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.029 
to eat until you're satisfied I've been
on<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.780> life<00:00:57.960> stuff<00:00:58.170> for<00:00:58.320> quite<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> while<00:00:58.710> and

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
on this life stuff for quite a while and

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.560 
on this life stuff for quite a while and
I<00:00:59.160> feel<00:00:59.370> more<00:00:59.579> comfortable<00:00:59.850> eating<00:01:00.180> till<00:01:00.480> I'm

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
I feel more comfortable eating till I'm

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.290 
I feel more comfortable eating till I'm
satisfied<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.010> that's<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.789> simple

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
satisfied so that that's a simple

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.660 
satisfied so that that's a simple
question<00:01:03.899> but<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.589> has<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> complicated<00:01:05.339> answer

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
question but it has a complicated answer

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.060 
question but it has a complicated answer
and<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.570> think<00:01:06.960> if<00:01:07.409> you're<00:01:07.619> going<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.860> ask<00:01:07.950> a

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
and so I think if you're going to ask a

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.289 
and so I think if you're going to ask a
question<00:01:08.369> like<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.790> have<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.090> first

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
question like that you have to first

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.990 
question like that you have to first
define<00:01:09.510> what<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:10.470> means<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.799> be<00:01:10.920> satisfied<00:01:11.220> so

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
define what it means to be satisfied so

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.490 
define what it means to be satisfied so
satisfaction<00:01:12.689> means<00:01:12.869> different<00:01:13.049> things<00:01:13.229> to

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
satisfaction means different things to

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.679 
satisfaction means different things to
different<00:01:13.619> people<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.490> if<00:01:14.820> you're<00:01:15.479> eating

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
different people and if you're eating

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:16.940

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
til you're satisfied is going to be

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.740 
til you're satisfied is going to be
completely<00:01:17.310> different<00:01:17.759> then<00:01:18.150> someone<00:01:18.450> else

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
completely different then someone else

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.660 
completely different then someone else
eating<00:01:19.140> till<00:01:19.290> they're<00:01:19.409> satisfied<00:01:19.560> what<00:01:20.400> does

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.569 
it's not as simple as I'd like it to be
and<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:49.350> have<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.680> say<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:50.040> when<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.189> started

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
and I have to say that when I started

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.819 
and I have to say that when I started
this<00:01:50.700> journey<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.210> stuck<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.930> number<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.710> it
