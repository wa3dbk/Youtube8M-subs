00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
was younger and then I remember when I

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.040 
was younger and then I remember when I
was<00:02:32.460> younger<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.790> used<00:02:32.820> to<00:02:33.030> draw<00:02:33.330> all<00:02:33.570> these<00:02:33.780> on

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
was younger I used to draw all these on

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.750 
was younger I used to draw all these on
paper<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.950> then<00:02:35.070> I<00:02:35.190> just<00:02:35.370> have<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.520> little

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
paper and then I just have a little

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.530 
paper and then I just have a little
collection<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.240> mr.<00:02:36.480> men<00:02:36.630> so<00:02:36.960> I<00:02:37.610> mean<00:02:38.610> I'm<00:02:39.480> a

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
collection of mr. men so I mean I'm a

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.300 
collection of mr. men so I mean I'm a
little<00:02:39.960> old<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.260> have<00:02:40.440> something<00:02:40.800> like<00:02:40.950> this<00:02:41.130> I

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
little old to have something like this I

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.640 
little old to have something like this I
suppose<00:02:41.460> but<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.600> know<00:02:42.690> what<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:43.140> think<00:02:43.470> all<00:02:43.620> of

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
suppose but you know what I think all of

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.230 
suppose but you know what I think all of
us<00:02:43.860> go<00:02:44.040> back<00:02:44.220> at<00:02:44.430> one<00:02:44.550> point<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:44.970> collect

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
us go back at one point and collect

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.940 
us go back at one point and collect
stuff<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:45.750> we<00:02:45.810> used<00:02:45.960> to<00:02:46.050> have<00:02:46.170> his<00:02:46.320> kids<00:02:46.650> and

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
stuff that we used to have his kids and

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.360 
stuff that we used to have his kids and
this<00:02:47.880> is<00:02:48.060> probably<00:02:48.240> my<00:02:48.990> earliest<00:02:49.370> childhood

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
this is probably my earliest childhood

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.330 
this is probably my earliest childhood
memory<00:02:50.940> was<00:02:51.120> having<00:02:51.420> these<00:02:51.540> books<00:02:51.890> so<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:52.920> would

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
memory was having these books so I would

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.880 
memory was having these books so I would
say<00:02:53.520> for<00:02:53.730> that<00:02:53.820> reason<00:02:54.240> alone<00:02:54.410> it's<00:02:55.410> worth<00:02:55.500> the

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
say for that reason alone it's worth the

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.600 
say for that reason alone it's worth the
collection<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:57.920> don't<00:02:58.920> think<00:02:59.160> this<00:02:59.280> sets

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
collection I don't think this sets

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.970 
collection I don't think this sets
available<00:02:59.730> anymore<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.540> bought<00:03:00.930> this<00:03:01.140> off<00:03:01.440> of<00:03:01.710> I

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
available anymore I bought this off of I

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.470 
available anymore I bought this off of I
think<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.460> was<00:03:02.490> Amazon<00:03:03.120> when<00:03:03.540> they<00:03:03.660> had<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.130> I

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
think it was Amazon when they had it I

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.400 
think it was Amazon when they had it I
don't<00:03:06.480> think<00:03:06.540> like<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:06.900> said<00:03:07.080> I<00:03:07.140> don't<00:03:07.200> think

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
don't think like I said I don't think

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.130 
don't think like I said I don't think
it's<00:03:07.650> around<00:03:07.890> anymore<00:03:08.430> but<00:03:09.150> if<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.690> can<00:03:09.870> find

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
it's around anymore but if you can find

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.590 
it's around anymore but if you can find
this<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:10.620> you're<00:03:11.460> like<00:03:11.610> me<00:03:11.880> who<00:03:12.270> wants<00:03:12.570> to

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
this and you're like me who wants to

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.230 
this and you're like me who wants to
relive<00:03:12.930> as<00:03:13.110> his<00:03:13.410> childhood<00:03:13.980> memories<00:03:14.100> I<00:03:14.700> would

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
relive as his childhood memories I would

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.700 
relive as his childhood memories I would
probably<00:03:15.360> say<00:03:15.600> pick<00:03:15.900> this<00:03:16.020> guy<00:03:16.230> up<00:03:16.260> if<00:03:16.590> you

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
probably say pick this guy up if you

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.940 
probably say pick this guy up if you
find<00:03:16.920> him<00:03:17.190> if<00:03:18.120> not<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:19.140> individual<00:03:19.590> books<00:03:19.830> I

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
find him if not the individual books I

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.620 
find him if not the individual books I
think<00:03:20.160> go<00:03:20.310> for<00:03:20.520> about<00:03:20.700> three<00:03:20.970> dollars<00:03:21.330> a<00:03:21.360> piece

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
think go for about three dollars a piece

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.150 
think go for about three dollars a piece
or<00:03:21.900> two<00:03:22.050> or<00:03:22.170> three<00:03:22.200> dollars<00:03:22.620> a<00:03:22.650> piece<00:03:22.890> so<00:03:23.130> I

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
or two or three dollars a piece so I

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.130 
or two or three dollars a piece so I
mean<00:03:23.340> if<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:23.880> look<00:03:24.060> at<00:03:24.180> all<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.480> books<00:03:24.900> in<00:03:25.050> the

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
mean if you look at all the books in the

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.130 
mean if you look at all the books in the
library<00:03:26.030> that's<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.210> it's<00:03:27.420> a<00:03:27.480> bit<00:03:27.630> of<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:27.810> steep

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
library that's a it's a bit of a steep

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.440 
library that's a it's a bit of a steep
collection<00:03:28.740> I<00:03:28.920> think<00:03:29.820> this<00:03:30.000> was<00:03:30.180> probably

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
collection I think this was probably

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.420 
collection I think this was probably
about<00:03:30.950> maybe<00:03:31.950> $70<00:03:32.820> $60<00:03:33.780> but<00:03:34.590> well<00:03:35.130> worth<00:03:35.280> the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
about maybe $70 $60 but well worth the

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.350 
about maybe $70 $60 but well worth the
money<00:03:36.620> it's<00:03:37.620> not<00:03:37.800> for<00:03:38.220> everybody<00:03:38.490> I<00:03:38.760> know<00:03:38.940> it's

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
money it's not for everybody I know it's

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.320 
money it's not for everybody I know it's
it's<00:03:39.720> I<00:03:40.020> know<00:03:40.080> it's<00:03:40.380> I<00:03:40.650> have<00:03:41.640> a<00:03:41.670> soft<00:03:41.970> spot<00:03:42.270> for

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
it's I know it's I have a soft spot for

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.380 
it's I know it's I have a soft spot for
it<00:03:42.720> but<00:03:42.960> I<00:03:43.640> would<00:03:44.640> say<00:03:44.790> if<00:03:44.910> you're<00:03:45.030> in<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.240> same

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
it but I would say if you're in the same

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.450 
it but I would say if you're in the same
boat<00:03:45.450> as<00:03:45.780> me<00:03:45.810> I<00:03:46.200> would<00:03:46.350> probably<00:03:46.380> pick<00:03:47.310> this

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
boat as me I would probably pick this

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.080 
boat as me I would probably pick this
