to<00:02:56.590> be<00:02:56.829> fairly<00:02:57.129> honest<00:02:57.340> that<00:02:57.489> since<00:02:57.670> we

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
to be fairly honest that since we

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.170 
to be fairly honest that since we
switched<00:02:57.909> bonds<00:02:58.299> and<00:02:59.099> there<00:03:00.099> was<00:03:00.220> an<00:03:00.370> LMG<00:03:00.909> so<00:03:01.150> I

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
switched bonds and there was an LMG so I

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.690 
switched bonds and there was an LMG so I
did<00:03:01.629> get<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:01.840> bit<00:03:01.989> worried<00:03:02.319> I<00:03:02.530> probably<00:03:03.340> said

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
did get a bit worried I probably said

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.399 
did get a bit worried I probably said
this<00:03:03.849> car<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.180> be<00:03:04.209> fairly<00:03:04.480> honest<00:03:04.810> cause<00:03:04.989> it<00:03:05.170> is

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
this car to be fairly honest cause it is

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.970 
this car to be fairly honest cause it is
really<00:03:05.890> a<00:03:05.920> good<00:03:06.220> position<00:03:06.849> to<00:03:07.120> hold<00:03:07.799> in<00:03:08.799> the

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
really a good position to hold in the

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.289 
really a good position to hold in the
middle<00:03:09.220> of<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:09.340> map<00:03:11.370> just<00:03:12.370> helps<00:03:12.939> me<00:03:13.060> increase

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
middle of a map just helps me increase

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.759 
middle of a map just helps me increase
my<00:03:13.329> accuracy<00:03:13.720> as<00:03:14.019> well<00:03:16.019> but<00:03:17.019> that's<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.560> only

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
my accuracy as well but that's the only

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.470 
my accuracy as well but that's the only
downside<00:03:17.950> so<00:03:18.400> now<00:03:18.579> I<00:03:18.609> can<00:03:18.879> go<00:03:19.000> back<00:03:19.209> there

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
downside so now I can go back there

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.330 
downside so now I can go back there
because<00:03:19.689> it<00:03:20.079> hasn't<00:03:20.319> it's<00:03:20.650> been<00:03:20.829> blown<00:03:21.069> up<00:03:21.189> you

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
because it hasn't it's been blown up you

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.539 
because it hasn't it's been blown up you
say<00:03:21.519> so<00:03:22.000> now<00:03:22.239> it<00:03:22.510> won't<00:03:22.870> really<00:03:23.049> matter<00:03:23.769> me<00:03:24.400> too

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
say so now it won't really matter me too

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:30.509 
say so now it won't really matter me too
much<00:03:24.730> sir
