spreadsheet<00:04:24.210> was<00:04:24.570> scanned<00:04:24.870> in<00:04:25.080> and<00:04:25.260> quite

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
spreadsheet was scanned in and quite

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.530 
spreadsheet was scanned in and quite
often<00:04:25.860> when<00:04:26.070> you<00:04:26.130> scan<00:04:26.370> a<00:04:26.430> spreadsheet<00:04:26.760> in

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
often when you scan a spreadsheet in

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.890 
often when you scan a spreadsheet in
it's<00:04:27.960> off<00:04:28.740> centered<00:04:29.490> a<00:04:29.640> little<00:04:29.670> bit<00:04:30.120> it<00:04:30.360> said

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
it's off centered a little bit it said

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.570 
it's off centered a little bit it said
so<00:04:31.560> it<00:04:31.710> has<00:04:31.860> a<00:04:31.890> little<00:04:32.070> bit<00:04:32.190> of<00:04:32.250> trouble

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
so it has a little bit of trouble

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.070 
so it has a little bit of trouble
finding<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:32.940> roads<00:04:33.210> you<00:04:33.420> can<00:04:33.540> see<00:04:33.720> here<00:04:33.990> it

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
finding the roads you can see here it

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.420 
finding the roads you can see here it
found<00:04:34.290> some<00:04:34.530> of<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.710> roads<00:04:34.920> and<00:04:35.130> some<00:04:35.280> of<00:04:35.370> the

found some of the roads and some of the

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.130 
found some of the roads and some of the
columns<00:04:35.790> but<00:04:36.000> this<00:04:36.120> whole<00:04:36.270> bottom<00:04:36.660> half<00:04:36.870> it

didn't get the rows and columns for what

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.300 
didn't get the rows and columns for what
we<00:04:39.960> need<00:04:40.110> to<00:04:40.200> do<00:04:40.320> is<00:04:40.470> actually<00:04:40.620> straighten<00:04:41.130> the

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
we need to do is actually straighten the

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.250 
we need to do is actually straighten the
page<00:04:41.520> because<00:04:41.880> when<00:04:42.000> it<00:04:42.060> was<00:04:42.180> scanned<00:04:42.900> in<00:04:43.110> it

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
page because when it was scanned in it

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.350 
page because when it was scanned in it
was<00:04:43.350> a<00:04:43.380> little<00:04:43.530> crooked<00:04:43.770> and<00:04:44.180> we've<00:04:45.180> got<00:04:45.330> a

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
was a little crooked and we've got a

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.870 
was a little crooked and we've got a
straight<00:04:45.720> and<00:04:45.870> page<00:04:46.020> button<00:04:46.290> here<00:04:46.820> what<00:04:47.820> this

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
straight and page button here what this

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.340 
straight and page button here what this
is<00:04:48.000> going<00:04:48.090> to<00:04:48.150> do<00:04:48.360> it's<00:04:48.510> going<00:04:48.540> to<00:04:48.690> rotate<00:04:48.990> the

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
is going to do it's going to rotate the

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.730 
is going to do it's going to rotate the
page<00:04:49.590> slightly

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.010 

hose<00:04:53.099> it's<00:04:53.819> not<00:04:54.000> a<00:04:54.030> hundred<00:04:54.300> percent<00:04:54.419> accurate

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
hose it's not a hundred percent accurate

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.140 
hose it's not a hundred percent accurate
say<00:04:55.169> usually<00:04:56.099> it'll<00:04:56.520> do<00:04:56.669> a<00:04:56.699> pretty<00:04:56.940> good<00:04:57.030> job

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
say usually it'll do a pretty good job

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.080 
say usually it'll do a pretty good job
so<00:04:57.630> you<00:04:58.380> can<00:04:58.500> see<00:04:58.710> the<00:04:58.860> progress<00:04:59.220> as<00:04:59.729> it's

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
so you can see the progress as it's

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.290 
so you can see the progress as it's
working<00:05:00.509> calculating<00:05:01.169> the<00:05:01.319> new<00:05:02.220> rose<00:05:02.460> and<00:05:02.789> new

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
working calculating the new rose and new

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.279 
working calculating the new rose and new
columns<00:05:06.889> it'll<00:05:07.889> just<00:05:07.919> take<00:05:08.220> a<00:05:08.280> moment<00:05:08.550> here

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
columns it'll just take a moment here

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.260 
columns it'll just take a moment here
when<00:05:10.289> it's<00:05:10.410> complete<00:05:10.830> there<00:05:11.220> we<00:05:11.370> go<00:05:11.520> it<00:05:11.759> shows

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
when it's complete there we go it shows

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.150 
when it's complete there we go it shows
me<00:05:12.449> the<00:05:12.599> new<00:05:12.720> columns<00:05:13.139> and<00:05:13.319> rows<00:05:13.440> and<00:05:13.740> it's

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
me the new columns and rows and it's

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.089 
me the new columns and rows and it's
pretty<00:05:14.819> much<00:05:14.940> bang<00:05:15.300> on<00:05:15.569> with<00:05:15.900> the<00:05:16.229> my<00:05:16.770> columns

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
pretty much bang on with the my columns

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:18.620 
pretty much bang on with the my columns
and<00:05:17.250> rows<00:05:17.340> so<00:05:17.940> I'm<00:05:18.030> going<00:05:18.150> to<00:05:18.210> convert<00:05:18.449> this<00:05:18.569> to

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
and rows so I'm going to convert this to

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.230 
and rows so I'm going to convert this to
a<00:05:18.750> spreadsheet<00:05:19.050> now<00:05:20.009> this<00:05:20.250> time<00:05:20.580> because<00:05:20.940> it's

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
a spreadsheet now this time because it's

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.510 
a spreadsheet now this time because it's
a<00:05:21.360> scanned<00:05:21.750> image<00:05:21.990> there's<00:05:22.560> actually<00:05:22.919> no<00:05:23.099> text

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
a scanned image there's actually no text

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.969 
a scanned image there's actually no text
in<00:05:23.610> this<00:05:23.759> it's<00:05:24.030> just<00:05:24.120> an<00:05:24.509> image<00:05:24.870> I<00:05:25.050> need<00:05:25.770> to

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
in this it's just an image I need to

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.390 
in this it's just an image I need to
click<00:05:26.419> use<00:05:27.419> OCR<00:05:27.710> so<00:05:28.710> that<00:05:28.860> it'll<00:05:28.979> use<00:05:29.250> the

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
click use OCR so that it'll use the

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.610 
click use OCR so that it'll use the
optical<00:05:29.849> character<00:05:30.270> recognition<00:05:30.620> feature

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
optical character recognition feature

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.740 
optical character recognition feature
and<00:05:31.949> I'm<00:05:32.460> once<00:05:32.639> again<00:05:32.759> just<00:05:33.150> gonna<00:05:33.270> do<00:05:33.539> one

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
and I'm once again just gonna do one

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:39.529 
and I'm once again just gonna do one
page<00:05:34.520> 121<00:05:35.520> and<00:05:36.710> I'll<00:05:37.710> start<00:05:38.039> it<00:05:38.130> off<00:05:38.250> now<00:05:39.030> we're

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
page 121 and I'll start it off now we're
