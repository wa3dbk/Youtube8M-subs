wellnot okay I should put a 10 there not
a<00:00:15.269> zero<00:00:15.630> otherwise<00:00:15.750> I'm<00:00:16.199> not<00:00:16.410> correct<00:00:16.740> here

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010

from<00:00:17.430> 10<00:00:17.609> degree<00:00:17.850> centigrade<00:00:18.060> all<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.570> way<00:00:18.660> up

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
from 10 degree centigrade all the way up

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.019 
from 10 degree centigrade all the way up

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
to 100 degree centigrade and notice how

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.720 
to 100 degree centigrade and notice how
the<00:00:21.090> viscosity<00:00:21.810> drops<00:00:22.769> off<00:00:23.220> quite

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
the viscosity drops off quite

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.400 
the viscosity drops off quite
dramatically<00:00:24.420> now<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.689> can<00:00:24.869> see<00:00:25.019> it's<00:00:25.170> kind

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
dramatically now you can see it's kind

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.560 
dramatically now you can see it's kind
of<00:00:25.470> like<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> 1<00:00:25.890> over<00:00:26.160> X<00:00:26.340> function<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.449> can

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
of like a 1 over X function so you can

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.349 
of like a 1 over X function so you can
see<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.990> typical<00:00:28.500> curve<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.130> 1<00:00:29.279> over<00:00:29.490> X<00:00:29.699> but

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
see the typical curve of 1 over X but

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.600 
see the typical curve of 1 over X but
you<00:00:30.869> can<00:00:31.019> see<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.410> viscosity<00:00:31.650> continues

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
you can see that the viscosity continues

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.639 
you can see that the viscosity continues
to<00:00:32.730> decline<00:00:32.880> after<00:00:33.660> water<00:00:33.899> reaches

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
to decline after water reaches

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.410 
to decline after water reaches
temperatures<00:00:35.040> higher<00:00:35.280> than<00:00:35.309> 100<00:00:35.790> degrees<00:00:36.030> and

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
temperatures higher than 100 degrees and

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.729 
temperatures higher than 100 degrees and
when<00:00:36.600> it's<00:00:36.750> several<00:00:36.989> hundred<00:00:37.110> degrees<00:00:37.590> you

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
when it's several hundred degrees you

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.319 
when it's several hundred degrees you
can<00:00:37.890> see<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.309> viscosity<00:00:38.520> gets<00:00:39.030> rather

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
can see that the viscosity gets rather

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.600 
can see that the viscosity gets rather
small<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.410> there's<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.710> dramatic<00:00:40.920> difference

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
small so there's a dramatic difference

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.580 
small so there's a dramatic difference
between<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.480> viscosity<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:43.050> water<00:00:43.110> at<00:00:43.379> very

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
between the viscosity of water at very

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.920 
between the viscosity of water at very
high<00:00:43.649> temperatures<00:00:44.280> versus<00:00:45.030> water<00:00:45.360> very<00:00:45.750> low

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
high temperatures versus water very low

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.930 
high temperatures versus water very low
temperatures<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.500> course<00:00:46.710> how<00:00:47.579> do<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.789> get

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
temperatures of course how do you get

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.610 
temperatures of course how do you get
water<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.390> be<00:00:48.539> at<00:00:48.750> higher<00:00:49.200> temperatures

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
water to be at higher temperatures

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.090 
water to be at higher temperatures
beyond<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.100> 100<00:00:51.230> 100<00:00:52.230> degrees<00:00:52.500> centigrade<00:00:52.649> then

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
beyond a 100 100 degrees centigrade then

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.290 
beyond a 100 100 degrees centigrade then
of<00:00:53.219> course<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.520> would<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.969> be<00:00:54.000> under

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
of course that would have to be under

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.880 
of course that would have to be under
pressure<00:00:54.329> you'd<00:00:54.899> have<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.260> put<00:00:55.440> water<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.739> a

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
pressure you'd have to put water and a

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.369 
pressure you'd have to put water and a
lot<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.160> pressure<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.699> keep<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.510> water<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.289> a

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
lot of pressure to keep that water in a

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.979 
lot of pressure to keep that water in a
liquid<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.129> liquid<00:00:59.160> form<00:00:59.960> viscosity<00:01:00.960> of

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
liquid in the liquid form viscosity of

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.990 
liquid in the liquid form viscosity of
water<00:01:01.109> vapor<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.829> course<00:01:02.070> would<00:01:02.280> be<00:01:02.309> very<00:01:02.730> very

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
water vapor of course would be very very

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.119 
water vapor of course would be very very
small<00:01:03.359> because<00:01:04.019> all<00:01:04.260> gases<00:01:04.710> have<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.949> much

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
small because all gases have a much

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.179 
small because all gases have a much
lower<00:01:05.460> viscosity<00:01:05.790> than<00:01:06.750> liquids<00:01:07.260> but<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
lower viscosity than liquids but the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.039 
lower viscosity than liquids but the
typical<00:01:08.790> curve<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.390> see<00:01:09.600> there<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.930> 1

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
typical curve that we see there the 1

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
over X curve that we see for water is

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.260 
over X curve that we see for water is
very<00:01:12.600> typical<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:13.110> all<00:01:13.170> fluids<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:14.610> don't<00:01:15.180> know

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
very typical for all fluids I don't know

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.820 
very typical for all fluids I don't know
of<00:01:15.390> any<00:01:15.509> exceptions<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.259> there<00:01:16.439> may<00:01:16.560> be<00:01:16.590> but

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
of any exceptions to it there may be but

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.620 
of any exceptions to it there may be but
I<00:01:16.950> don't<00:01:17.159> know<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.400> any<00:01:17.549> where<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.509> viscosity

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
I don't know of any where the viscosity

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.870 
I don't know of any where the viscosity
simply<00:01:19.439> decreases<00:01:20.159> with<00:01:20.369> increasing

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
simply decreases with increasing

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.760 
simply decreases with increasing
temperature<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.990> has<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.170> lot<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.560> do<00:01:22.740> with

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
temperature that has a lot to do with

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.850 
temperature that has a lot to do with
the<00:01:23.420> motion<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.900> molecules<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
the motion of the molecules in the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
liquid as the temperature goes up

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.210 
liquid as the temperature goes up
they're<00:01:27.630> more<00:01:27.840> likely<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.350> travel<00:01:28.710> over<00:01:29.070> one

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
they're more likely to travel over one

they're more likely to travel over one
another<00:01:29.250> there<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.420> makes<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.840> easier<00:01:31.229> for

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.590 
molecules tend to adhere to each other a
little<00:01:40.710> bit<00:01:40.829> more<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.670> molecular<00:01:42.240> bonds<00:01:42.450> a

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
little bit more the molecular bonds a

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.060 
little bit more the molecular bonds a
little<00:01:42.630> stronger<00:01:43.079> makes<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.740> more<00:01:43.860> difficult

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
little stronger makes it more difficult

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.830 
little stronger makes it more difficult
for<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> fluid<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.090> flow<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.450> therefore<00:01:45.600> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
for the fluid to flow and therefore the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.690 
for the fluid to flow and therefore the
viscosity<00:01:46.200> goes<00:01:46.619> up<00:01:46.829> but<00:01:47.250> here<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.549> have<00:01:47.670> a

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
viscosity goes up but here you have a

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.139 
viscosity goes up but here you have a
nice<00:01:47.939> example<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.750> what<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.409> looks<00:01:49.619> like

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
nice example of what that looks like

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.840 
nice example of what that looks like
notice<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.270> it's<00:01:51.479> roughly<00:01:51.869> about<00:01:52.729> 20%<00:01:53.729> of

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
notice that it's roughly about 20% of

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.050 
notice that it's roughly about 20% of
the<00:01:54.000> skull<00:01:54.299> city<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.799> hundred<00:01:55.799> degrees<00:01:56.100> versus

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
the skull city a hundred degrees versus

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.780 
the skull city a hundred degrees versus
the<00:01:57.860> temperatures<00:01:58.860> at<00:01:59.040> 10<00:01:59.250> degrees<00:01:59.549> so<00:01:59.670> it's

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
the temperatures at 10 degrees so it's

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.789 
the temperatures at 10 degrees so it's
about<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.030> 5<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.479> 1<00:02:00.509> ratio<00:02:00.659> between<00:02:01.170> 10<00:02:01.530> degrees

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
about a 5 to 1 ratio between 10 degrees

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.440 
about a 5 to 1 ratio between 10 degrees
100<00:02:02.159> weeks<00:02:02.280> it's<00:02:02.610> quite<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> bit<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.119> difference

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
100 weeks it's quite a bit of difference

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.109 
100 weeks it's quite a bit of difference
so<00:02:03.630> if<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.320> want<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.680> move<00:02:04.860> fluids<00:02:05.340> through<00:02:06.090> a

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
so if you want to move fluids through a

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.240 
so if you want to move fluids through a
pipe<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.990> want<00:02:07.380> viscosity<00:02:07.920> be<00:02:08.069> lower

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
pipe you want viscosity be lower

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.190 
pipe you want viscosity be lower
definitely<00:02:08.910> raising<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.539> temperature<00:02:09.929> would

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
definitely raising the temperature would

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.619 
definitely raising the temperature would
be<00:02:10.379> one<00:02:10.590> way<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.830> make<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.220> easier<00:02:12.060> less

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
be one way to make that easier less

be one way to make that easier less

viscosity<00:02:16.830> when<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.580> happens<00:02:17.910> when<00:02:18.150> you

viscosity when that happens when you

viscosity when that happens when you
increase<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.720> temperature<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.350> there<00:02:19.980> you

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
increase the temperature and there you

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.230 
increase the temperature and there you
go<00:02:20.190> that's<00:02:20.550> how<00:02:20.670> we<00:02:20.870> know<00:02:21.870> these<00:02:22.080> things
