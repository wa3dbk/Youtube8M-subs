hair masks a couple of times before and

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.600 
hair masks a couple of times before and
I<00:01:52.170> know<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.470> it's<00:01:52.829> really<00:01:53.159> good<00:01:53.310> for<00:01:53.460> your

hair yogurt contains proteins as well

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.149 
hair yogurt contains proteins as well
and<00:01:56.100> then<00:01:56.399> just<00:01:56.759> fat<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.689> lactic<00:01:58.290> acid<00:01:58.740> which<00:01:58.979> is

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
and then just fat a lactic acid which is

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.850 
and then just fat a lactic acid which is
pretty<00:01:59.880> much<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.450> same<00:02:00.659> as<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.170> oils<00:02:01.590> and

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860

pretty much the same as the oils and
vinegar<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.729> mayonnaise<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.110> yogurt

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
vinegar in mayonnaise so the yogurt

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.240 
vinegar in mayonnaise so the yogurt
should<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.920> any<00:02:05.009> case<00:02:05.280> not<00:02:06.000> diminish<00:02:06.659> the

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
should in any case not diminish the

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.699 
should in any case not diminish the
effects<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.550> mayonnaise<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.619> what<00:02:10.619> I'm

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
effects of the mayonnaise so what I'm

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.090 
effects of the mayonnaise so what I'm
going<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.950> do<00:02:11.099> now<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.489> that

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
going to do now is that

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.010 
going to do now is that
my<00:02:12.190> hair<00:02:12.490> and<00:02:13.000> then<00:02:13.960> apply<00:02:14.700> this<00:02:15.700> into<00:02:16.630> it<00:02:16.780> I'm

my hair and then apply this into it I'm
not<00:02:17.290> sure<00:02:17.350> how<00:02:17.680> much<00:02:17.830> against<00:02:18.160> me<00:02:18.490> I<00:02:18.520> think<00:02:18.790> I'm

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
not sure how much against me I think I'm

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.180 
not sure how much against me I think I'm
just<00:02:19.060> going<00:02:19.270> to<00:02:19.330> cover<00:02:19.690> my<00:02:19.930> hair<00:02:20.110> and<00:02:20.350> see<00:02:20.620> how

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
just going to cover my hair and see how

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.470 
just going to cover my hair and see how
much<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:21.520> use<00:02:21.820> and<00:02:22.180> then<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:23.140> am<00:02:23.500> going<00:02:23.740> to<00:02:24.330> put<00:02:25.330> my

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
much I use and then I am going to put my

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.460 
much I use and then I am going to put my
hair<00:02:25.660> up<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:27.250> will<00:02:28.240> be<00:02:28.390> back<00:02:28.690> I<00:02:28.960> guess

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
hair up and I will be back I guess

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.130 
hair up and I will be back I guess
alright<00:02:30.190> so<00:02:30.490> I<00:02:30.520> ended<00:02:30.880> up<00:02:30.970> using<00:02:31.180> about<00:02:31.420> four

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
alright so I ended up using about four

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.790 
alright so I ended up using about four
tablespoons<00:02:32.440> of<00:02:33.250> mayonnaise<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:34.800> first

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
tablespoons of mayonnaise and first

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.390 
tablespoons of mayonnaise and first
thing<00:02:36.010> they<00:02:36.130> notice<00:02:36.250> is<00:02:36.690> smell<00:02:38.040> isn't<00:02:39.040> too

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
thing they notice is smell isn't too

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.790 
thing they notice is smell isn't too
great<00:02:39.700> I<00:02:40.210> mean<00:02:40.270> it<00:02:41.140> doesn't<00:02:41.410> smell<00:02:41.740> like

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
great I mean it doesn't smell like

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.590 
great I mean it doesn't smell like
something<00:02:42.400> that<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:42.850> want<00:02:43.090> to<00:02:43.210> put<00:02:43.390> on<00:02:43.480> your

something that you want to put on your
hair<00:02:43.990> but<00:02:44.680> I'm<00:02:45.040> hoping<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:45.820> smell<00:02:46.030> will<00:02:46.240> just

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
hair but I'm hoping the smell will just

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.540 
hair but I'm hoping the smell will just
disappear<00:02:46.540> when<00:02:46.960> I<00:02:47.020> wash<00:02:47.200> my<00:02:47.350> hair<00:02:47.590> so<00:02:48.130> I'm

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
think if I wouldn't use a heat protector

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.010 
think if I wouldn't use a heat protector
which<00:03:27.730> I<00:03:27.820> usually<00:03:28.150> would<00:03:28.360> if<00:03:28.480> I<00:03:28.630> were<00:03:28.780> to<00:03:28.900> blow
