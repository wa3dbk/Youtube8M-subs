00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.349 
here I'm not going to go over every drag
I'm<00:00:28.710> not<00:00:28.859> going<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.070> talk<00:00:29.250> about<00:00:29.519> every<00:00:29.880> dragon

I'm not going to talk about every dragon

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.420 
I'm not going to talk about every dragon

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
but you can view it on the video I'm

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.920 
but you can view it on the video I'm
just<00:00:32.489> going<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.820> talk<00:00:33.000> about<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.480> important

ones and I guess the the ones that have
a<00:00:37.860> special<00:00:38.250> requirement<00:00:39.410> so<00:00:40.410> if<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.649> want<00:00:40.829> the
