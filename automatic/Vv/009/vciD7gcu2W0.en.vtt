00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
so we had one specific set of metal at

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.440 
so we had one specific set of metal at
one<00:01:48.350> specific<00:01:48.700> leather<00:01:49.700> texture<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:50.240> skin

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
one specific leather texture and skin

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.820 
one specific leather texture and skin
texture<00:01:50.720> that<00:01:50.869> we<00:01:50.960> could<00:01:51.110> then<00:01:51.229> share<00:01:51.470> across

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
texture that we could then share across

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.890 
texture that we could then share across
all<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.490> locust<00:01:52.790> characters<00:01:53.150> and<00:01:53.330> in<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.630> end

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
all the locust characters and in the end

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.480 
all the locust characters and in the end
this<00:01:54.170> made<00:01:54.470> them<00:01:54.560> feel<00:01:54.799> all<00:01:55.009> like<00:01:55.159> they<00:01:55.250> belong

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
this made them feel all like they belong

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.980 
this made them feel all like they belong
in<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.610> same

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
in the same

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.840 
in the same
and<00:01:56.470> like<00:01:56.590> they<00:01:56.680> all<00:01:56.800> came<00:01:56.980> from<00:01:57.100> that<00:01:57.190> one<00:01:57.460> one

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
and like they all came from that one one

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.720 
and like they all came from that one one
place<00:01:58.090> you<00:01:58.450> even<00:01:58.780> see<00:01:59.110> elements<00:01:59.800> of<00:02:00.040> kind<00:02:00.670> of

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
place you even see elements of kind of

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.340 
place you even see elements of kind of
real-world<00:02:00.940> things<00:02:01.450> in<00:02:01.630> there<00:02:01.810> so<00:02:02.020> where<00:02:02.200> are

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
real-world things in there so where are

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.560 
real-world things in there so where are
my<00:02:02.380> six<00:02:03.040> against<00:02:03.340> skin<00:02:03.730> you<00:02:03.940> start<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.300> see<00:02:04.390> the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
my six against skin you start to see the

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.850 
my six against skin you start to see the
skin<00:02:04.870> looks<00:02:05.140> ill<00:02:05.410> and<00:02:05.850> worn<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:07.440> thought<00:02:08.440> for

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
skin looks ill and worn and thought for

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.320 
skin looks ill and worn and thought for
everyone<00:02:09.100> that<00:02:09.220> that<00:02:09.460> were<00:02:09.610> hood<00:02:09.729> you<00:02:10.240> know

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
everyone that that were hood you know

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.700 
everyone that that were hood you know
one<00:02:10.420> of<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.570> nice<00:02:10.690> things<00:02:10.929> about<00:02:10.990> remastering

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
one of the nice things about remastering

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.320 
one of the nice things about remastering
and<00:02:12.190> sort<00:02:12.370> of<00:02:12.400> this<00:02:12.490> modernization<00:02:12.940> that

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
and sort of this modernization that

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.820 
and sort of this modernization that
we're<00:02:13.450> doing<00:02:13.570> is<00:02:13.810> we<00:02:13.900> have<00:02:13.930> more<00:02:14.320> time<00:02:14.560> to

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
we're doing is we have more time to

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.020 
we're doing is we have more time to
think<00:02:15.010> about<00:02:15.100> these<00:02:15.340> things<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:15.820> I<00:02:15.970> think

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
think about these things and I think

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.880 
think about these things and I think
that<00:02:16.360> one<00:02:16.720> of<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.810> bigger<00:02:16.990> ones<00:02:17.200> is<00:02:17.350> ROM<00:02:17.560> as<00:02:17.800> an

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
that one of the bigger ones is ROM as an

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.460 
that one of the bigger ones is ROM as an
example<00:02:18.160> you<00:02:18.820> know<00:02:18.850> ROM<00:02:19.180> used<00:02:19.990> that<00:02:20.140> kind<00:02:20.380> of

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
example you know ROM used that kind of

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.900 
example you know ROM used that kind of
an<00:02:20.560> enemy<00:02:20.800> that<00:02:20.890> came<00:02:21.010> on<00:02:21.160> late<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.640> we<00:02:21.760> ended

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
an enemy that came on late and we ended

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.150 
an enemy that came on late and we ended
up<00:02:22.030> doing<00:02:22.090> they<00:02:22.840> were<00:02:22.990> behind<00:02:23.530> in<00:02:23.740> production

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
up doing they were behind in production

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.980 
up doing they were behind in production
so<00:02:24.310> he<00:02:24.370> sort<00:02:24.520> of<00:02:24.580> took<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.790> simpler<00:02:25.120> path<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:25.660> so

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
so he sort of took a simpler path and so

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.690 
so he sort of took a simpler path and so
one<00:02:26.140> instead<00:02:26.530> of<00:02:26.590> putting<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.490> same

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
one instead of putting the same

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.060 
one instead of putting the same
production<00:02:28.090> kind<00:02:29.020> of<00:02:29.110> limitations<00:02:29.920> and

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
production kind of limitations and

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.979 
production kind of limitations and
constraints<00:02:30.220> we<00:02:30.550> had<00:02:30.700> on<00:02:30.820> us<00:02:30.970> back<00:02:31.209> then<00:02:31.510> ten

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
constraints we had on us back then ten

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.930 
constraints we had on us back then ten
years<00:02:32.230> ago<00:02:32.350> is<00:02:32.920> there<00:02:33.130> a<00:02:33.190> way<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.400> sort<00:02:33.730> of<00:02:33.820> say

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
years ago is there a way to sort of say

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.479 
years ago is there a way to sort of say
if<00:02:34.120> we<00:02:34.270> had<00:02:34.360> given<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.290> original<00:02:35.709> artists<00:02:36.100> an

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
if we had given the original artists an

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.490 
if we had given the original artists an
extra<00:02:36.850> month<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.270> make<00:02:37.450> him<00:02:37.690> what<00:02:38.320> would<00:02:38.410> they

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
extra month to make him what would they

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.260 
extra month to make him what would they
have<00:02:38.530> potentially<00:02:39.070> done<00:02:39.190> differently<00:02:39.580> and<00:02:40.090> so

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
have potentially done differently and so

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.180 
have potentially done differently and so
now<00:02:40.450> you<00:02:40.510> see<00:02:40.870> that<00:02:40.900> in<00:02:41.230> his<00:02:41.350> visuals<00:02:41.770> and<00:02:41.980> and

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
now you see that in his visuals and and

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.770 
now you see that in his visuals and and
in<00:02:42.430> his<00:02:42.550> texture<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:43.180> his<00:02:43.270> shape<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.690> his

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
in his texture and his shape and his

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.360 
in his texture and his shape and his
size<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:43.989> his<00:02:44.200> coloring<00:02:44.470> is<00:02:44.650> like<00:02:44.770> it's<00:02:45.130> still

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
size and his coloring is like it's still

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.510 
size and his coloring is like it's still
true<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.910> what<00:02:46.120> ROM<00:02:46.360> was<00:02:47.050> but<00:02:47.709> it's<00:02:47.860> tweaked<00:02:48.400> a

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
true to what ROM was but it's tweaked a

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.130 
true to what ROM was but it's tweaked a
little<00:02:48.790> bit<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.360> taking<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.750> little<00:02:49.840> step

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
little bit and taking a little step

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.990 
little bit and taking a little step
further<00:02:50.200> because<00:02:50.620> we<00:02:50.830> had<00:02:51.100> that<00:02:51.280> time<00:02:51.520> and<00:02:51.790> so

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
further because we had that time and so

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000 
further because we had that time and so
what<00:02:52.690> we<00:02:52.780> tried<00:02:52.989> to<00:02:53.020> do<00:02:53.230> is<00:02:53.350> kind<00:02:53.620> of<00:02:53.680> be<00:02:53.800> really

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
what we tried to do is kind of be really

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.160 
what we tried to do is kind of be really
pay<00:02:54.730> honor<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.090> what<00:02:55.390> was<00:02:55.540> there<00:02:55.840> in<00:02:55.870> the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
pay honor to what was there in the

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.449 
pay honor to what was there in the
original<00:02:56.530> vision<00:02:56.709> that<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.040> original

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
original vision that the original

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.790 
original vision that the original
artists<00:02:57.850> had<00:02:58.000> yet<00:02:58.600> take<00:02:58.959> it<00:02:59.110> to<00:02:59.260> kind<00:02:59.620> of<00:02:59.680> a

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
artists had yet take it to kind of a

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:20.059 
artists had yet take it to kind of a
slightly<00:03:00.070> newer<00:03:00.400> place

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069
