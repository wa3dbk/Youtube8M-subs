00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.540
 Hello everyone today on our review 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.760
 old but nevertheless great game 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.070
 by ubisoft 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.460
 assassin's creed brotherhood collectors 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.929
 edition 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.650
 This is a collector's edition for xbox 360 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:23.820
 Now I'll show you how it looks 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:29.099
 box which are depicted on it 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:34.950
 drawings box is originally 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.090
 such plastic boxes that can 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.210
 take off 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:45.680
 even need and we are already opening 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.680
 directly cardboard 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.730
 a new edition in the sense that it is not 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:57.270
 opened did not print asya earlier 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:03.930
 a box looks worn apparently this 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:10.670
 such an idea of ​​developers now 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.670
 open and see what is there 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.610
 take a look 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:30.210
 little box and first thing we have here 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:35.030
 the key fell out is due to tilt further 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:38.460
 we are having more and smaller box 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.290
 extra section with the game and 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:46.160
 artbook materials 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:52.740
 from the card here and so looks like a key 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:54.380
 plastic key well, nothing in it 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.810
 no 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.810
 exquisite and unusual ordinary plastic 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.630
 so here too 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:20.110
 and here we have a map map of Rome and 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:24.239
 autographs most likely 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.239
 developer autograph 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.030
 by the way cool mask at the doctor 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.030
 who is to the right of the assassin 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.940
 on the back of the card 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.530
 unlike the last assassin unity 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.380
 where the same action takes place in europe 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:08.770
 I liked the action brother where to 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:12.610
 Rome so that there are such areas 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:17.290
 maps that is to say there are areas with dense 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:19.720
 urban development and there are plots on 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.070
 which virtually no 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:27.250
 building this is most likely 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:29.020
 collisions because this object is bigger 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.400
 nothing like 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:36.040
 and around the coliseum there are plenty few 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.640
 built-up plots and rural 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.050
 locality 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:46.430
 what makes such a big plus for 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:49.569
 gameplay brings a variety 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.569
 Consider the artbook 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.920
 how god we have here 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.080
 artbook cover 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.150
 made gloss 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:13.980
 made of thick cardboard with glossy 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:21.570
 coated page both matte and 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:27.150
 fashion glossy is present more than 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.150
 pages such as matte and glossy 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:40.769
 Yes, I do not even know how to go right 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:44.029
 sort of and glitter at the same time and not 

00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:44.029
 high-grade glance 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:05.660
 the colosseum we saw on the cards 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:23.800
 Many characters are represented and 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:26.770
 game tits factions in this artbooks 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:30.130
 here it seems the team 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:33.449
 developers and this is probably only 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:36.930
 small part of this team 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:43.669
 put them bow look in the box 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:46.710
 with a fresh unpacked game here are codes 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:50.039
 CD with extra bonus content 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:55.309
 there are two cards for a single player like 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:55.309
 written on the box and drive the game itself and 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:13.050
 for dessert, we still have this 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:15.389
 casket she and plastic chairs then 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:19.229
 whether it is metallized in general here 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:23.669
 there are various materials such 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:28.050
 the elements are made of plastic and this 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:31.580
 like some kind of metal at 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.580
 as far as sound is concerned 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.370
 box with patterns 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:42.849
 we have the key to this box 

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:45.659
 Now we will open it and watch 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:45.659
 what have u not 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:04.629
 here is a doctor sitting there if you don’t know 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:10.060
 then very suddenly he jumps out 

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:20.080
 can someone scare one more now 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:23.740
 just look at him so very sharp 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:28.050
 a masked doctor who wants to do 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:31.479
 whether someone is shot 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:34.750
 that's what he wants to do there 

00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:37.740
 unknown such a cool box 

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:40.840
 very original collection editions 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:46.560
 although there is no such a full figure 

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:46.560
 but this decision is also very interesting 

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:56.060
