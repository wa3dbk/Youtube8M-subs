00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 fukushima emergency aas today again 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.930
 scared the Japanese in the morning on the third 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.220
 power unit stations have risen clubs 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.620
 thick smoke 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.900
 experts assured people that this is not smoke 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.610
 rainwater apparatus but calm 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.379
 population this is unlikely to help too 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.330
 a lot of disturbing news comes from 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.430
 fukushima late ex 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.560
 director a with supervised work on 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.650
 accident liquidation died last week 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.580
 in 58 years around the plant grow plants 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.380
 mutants and roam very strange animals 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.610
 they saw our sokkor sergey mingazhev he 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.000
 got close to fukushima 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.280
 for the minimum allowable distance for 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.320
 more than two years after the accident, the border 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.360
 restricted areas approached in this place 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.040
 to the station for three and a half kilometers and 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.770
 and the pipes are now hidden by a dense veil 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.360
 mist territory in front of me declared 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.640
 livable japanese authorities 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.620
 but not a single living soul 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.539
 people are in no hurry to come back here 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.170
 here still lifeless desert 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.180
 overgrown with weeds everywhere 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.670
 foundation he crush their homes and radiation 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.650
 three times the norm by local standards it 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.140
 By the way a little coastal part of the village 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.270
 futaba north of aas from radiation 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.970
 suffered not so much but the consequences 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.100
 from the tsunami disastrous despite 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.380
 official ban on visiting 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.110
 in fact, this place remains the zone 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.509
 rift on this lifeless wasteland 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.310
 now and then there are such 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.750
 eloquent monuments of disaster like 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.759
 this is high school 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.340
 it was built just a year before 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.860
 the arrival of the tsunami during this time is nothing here 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.439
 did not change the clock shows 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.150
 when time stopped here in that 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.970
 someday she will go forward again 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.470
 now it is impossible to believe the only ones 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.689
 who we managed to meet here 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.970
 volunteers after hitting the tsunami they 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.680
 helped to find the dead away from 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.590
 the shores of the effects of the elements are wrong 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.600
 obvious most houses survived on 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.530
 the first time here is allowed to be 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.420
 for 7 hours a day almost 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.920
 only earthquakes affected by earthquakes 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.689
 need to 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.520
 rule of course I want to return as 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.040
 as soon as possible but radiation is still being said 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.659
 high levels of radiation in areas where 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.450
 people are allowed to return everywhere 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.390
 different for example here it is 30 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.340
 microsievert per hour 100 times higher than normal 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.650
 eat in those seven hours a person gets 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.510
 one and a half month radiation dose like this 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.459
 impact on health data yet 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.709
 Tokyo officials don't see 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.080
 links between radiation and death from cancer 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.840
 former station director weight at isis 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.150
 he is in charge of liquidation 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.730
 accidents and died July 9th of this kravchenko 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.709
 here they call the child fukushima he was born 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.200
 no ears in the village where the grass is rich 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.940
 whether cesium is this form 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.010
 mutations result from overpriced 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.959
 radioactive background remains only 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.269
 guess at all the riot of nature 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.519
 hallmark of fukushima today 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.280
 such a crop was harvested in gardens and 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.500
 gardens in the vicinity of a cabbage 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.420
 sizes close to watermelon or pumpkin 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.519
 and as if eggplants crossed with 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.440
 banana rejoice this can 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.810
 that macaques that look with interest 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.940
 on people who did not appear here last 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.400
 two years after the fog cleared 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.590
 from the observation deck schools became visible 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.780
 Fukushima nuclear power plants-1 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.459
 work to eliminate the accident pass 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.950
 very slow radiation levels 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.079
 still deadly high at the same time 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.910
 continue and and emissions to the ocean 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.700
 one of the latest disturbing news from 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.500
 stations in groundwater under ios was 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.049
 radioactive content detected 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.329
 cesium radiation test procedure 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.000
 pass all who have been in the forbidden or 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:31.250
 adjacent to her zone we seem to be 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.380
 excess not found at least 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.160
 excess of the average background in the area 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.010
 fukushima 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.209
 and he is above all Sergei rules 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.380
 Mingazhev Alexey Pichko 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.380
 lead the Fukushima Prefecture
