this<00:01:12.570> debate<00:01:12.869> without<00:01:13.020> any<00:01:13.380> major<00:01:13.740> incident<00:01:14.340> I

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
this debate without any major incident I

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.980 
this debate without any major incident I
think<00:01:14.909> he's<00:01:15.030> probably<00:01:15.150> set<00:01:15.510> fair<00:01:15.750> for<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
think he's probably set fair for the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.609 
think he's probably set fair for the
rest<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.290> campaign<00:01:17.540> as<00:01:18.540> far<00:01:18.750> as<00:01:18.900> McCain<00:01:19.409> is

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
rest of the campaign as far as McCain is

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.990 
rest of the campaign as far as McCain is
concerned<00:01:20.010> the<00:01:20.100> mistake<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.430> he<00:01:20.580> needs<00:01:20.909> to

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
concerned the mistake that he needs to

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.690 
concerned the mistake that he needs to
avoid<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.510> becoming<00:01:21.960> too<00:01:21.990> aggressive<00:01:22.710> there's

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
avoid is becoming too aggressive there's

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.340 
avoid is becoming too aggressive there's
been<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.850> lot<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.030> attacks<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.630> Obama's

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
been a lot of attacks on Obama's

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.070 
been a lot of attacks on Obama's
character<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.400> last<00:01:26.640> few<00:01:27.090> weeks<00:01:27.150> not<00:01:27.930> from

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
character in the last few weeks not from

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.330 
character in the last few weeks not from
McCain<00:01:28.350> himself<00:01:28.710> but<00:01:28.830> from<00:01:29.010> some<00:01:29.160> of<00:01:29.250> his

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
McCain himself but from some of his

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.490 
McCain himself but from some of his
supporters<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.750> think<00:01:31.020> if<00:01:31.110> he<00:01:31.200> comes<00:01:31.350> over

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
supporters and I think if he comes over

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.290 
supporters and I think if he comes over
too<00:01:31.800> aggressive<00:01:32.340> he<00:01:32.550> could<00:01:32.730> well<00:01:32.850> lose<00:01:33.120> the

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
too aggressive he could well lose the

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.600 
too aggressive he could well lose the
sympathy<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.990> American<00:01:34.410> people<00:01:34.610> from

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
sympathy of the American people from

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.460 
sympathy of the American people from
Obama's<00:01:36.180> point<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.570> view<00:01:36.690> I<00:01:36.750> think<00:01:37.140> he<00:01:37.260> needs

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
Obama's point of view I think he needs

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.380 
Obama's point of view I think he needs
to<00:01:37.590> avoid<00:01:37.980> looking<00:01:38.460> too<00:01:38.760> smug<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.210> superior

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
to avoid looking too smug and superior

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.870 
to avoid looking too smug and superior
he<00:01:40.380> hasn't<00:01:40.680> won<00:01:40.830> yet<00:01:40.860> there's<00:01:41.460> still<00:01:41.550> quite<00:01:41.820> a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
he hasn't won yet there's still quite a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.880 
he hasn't won yet there's still quite a
long<00:01:42.060> way<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.810> go<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.170> think<00:01:43.320> he's<00:01:43.470> campaign

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
long way to go and I think he's campaign

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.680 
long way to go and I think he's campaign
realize<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.460> but<00:01:44.940> if<00:01:45.060> he<00:01:45.120> comes<00:01:45.330> over<00:01:45.510> is

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
realize that but if he comes over is

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.030 
realize that but if he comes over is
looking<00:01:45.930> as<00:01:46.020> though<00:01:46.050> he's<00:01:46.260> already<00:01:46.470> won<00:01:46.770> this

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
looking as though he's already won this

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.830 
looking as though he's already won this
and<00:01:47.310> looking<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.580> bit<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.790> presidential<00:01:48.210> that

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
and looking a bit to presidential that

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.620 
and looking a bit to presidential that
could<00:01:49.020> do<00:01:49.170> badly<00:01:49.380> against<00:01:49.710> him<00:01:49.830> too<00:01:50.010> I<00:01:50.630> think

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
could do badly against him too I think

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.570 
could do badly against him too I think
despite<00:01:51.960> all<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.860> coaching<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.400> all<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
despite all of the coaching and all the

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.550 
despite all of the coaching and all the
attention<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.000> detail<00:01:54.120> that's<00:01:54.659> been<00:01:54.900> paid<00:01:55.530> to

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
attention to detail that's been paid to

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.680 
attention to detail that's been paid to
buy<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.130> campaign<00:01:56.700> staff<00:01:56.970> over<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.420> last<00:01:57.540> few

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
buy the campaign staff over the last few

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.940 
buy the campaign staff over the last few
weeks<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.930> don't<00:01:58.170> think<00:01:58.260> they<00:01:58.590> debate

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
weeks I don't think they debate

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.170 
weeks I don't think they debate
performance<00:01:59.430> has<00:01:59.520> improved<00:01:59.550> a<00:01:59.970> great<00:02:00.000> deal

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
performance has improved a great deal

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.760 
performance has improved a great deal
they<00:02:00.600> were<00:02:00.659> both<00:02:00.810> pretty<00:02:01.110> good<00:02:01.320> debaters

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
they were both pretty good debaters

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.500 
they were both pretty good debaters
anyway<00:02:02.130> before<00:02:02.370> they<00:02:02.610> came<00:02:02.760> into<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.150> and<00:02:03.390> I

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
anyway before they came into this and I

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.880 
anyway before they came into this and I
think<00:02:03.570> they've<00:02:03.900> pretty<00:02:04.350> much<00:02:04.409> been<00:02:04.650> going

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
think they've pretty much been going

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.590 
think they've pretty much been going
through<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.159> motions<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.729> don't<00:02:06.510> think

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
through the motions I don't think

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.270 
through the motions I don't think
there's<00:02:07.290> been<00:02:07.320> any<00:02:07.440> particular<00:02:07.860> improvement

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
there's been any particular improvement

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.639 
there's been any particular improvement
either<00:02:08.429> from<00:02:08.670> McCain<00:02:08.970> or<00:02:09.209> from<00:02:09.450> Obama<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:10.080> think

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
either from McCain or from Obama I think

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.720 
either from McCain or from Obama I think
they've<00:02:10.830> said<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.159> right<00:02:11.280> things<00:02:11.550> at<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
they've said the right things at the

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.100 
they've said the right things at the
right<00:02:11.790> times<00:02:12.180> but<00:02:12.510> i<00:02:12.540> don't<00:02:12.959> think<00:02:12.989> that

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
right times but i don't think that

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.220 
right times but i don't think that
actually<00:02:13.409> up<00:02:13.590> their<00:02:13.860> standard<00:02:14.220> at<00:02:14.310> all<00:02:14.489> i

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
actually up their standard at all i

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.140 
actually up their standard at all i
think<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.349> the<00:02:16.379> main<00:02:16.680> lesson<00:02:17.099> for<00:02:17.459> business
