00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:30.669 
chance to print out the handouts and

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.519 
chance to print out the handouts and
we're<00:00:30.880> going<00:00:31.029> to<00:00:31.060> go<00:00:31.210> right<00:00:31.480> through<00:00:31.509> them<00:00:32.199> in

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
we're going to go right through them in

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.430 
we're going to go right through them in
order<00:00:32.769> so<00:00:33.519> I'd<00:00:33.699> like<00:00:33.910> to<00:00:34.149> move<00:00:34.300> us<00:00:34.570> to<00:00:34.960> the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
order so I'd like to move us to the

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.970 
order so I'd like to move us to the
second<00:00:35.890> slide<00:00:36.280> as<00:00:36.550> as<00:00:36.730> we<00:00:37.300> begin<00:00:37.690> and<00:00:38.050> as<00:00:38.800> you

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
second slide as as we begin and as you

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.299 
second slide as as we begin and as you
can<00:00:39.160> see<00:00:39.430> I'm<00:00:39.670> starting<00:00:40.149> off<00:00:40.239> talking<00:00:40.780> about

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
can see I'm starting off talking about

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.920 
can see I'm starting off talking about
standards<00:00:42.309> of<00:00:42.430> practice<00:00:42.729> because<00:00:43.420> I<00:00:43.659> think

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
standards of practice because I think

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.350 
standards of practice because I think
sometimes<00:00:44.620> in<00:00:45.070> case<00:00:45.250> management<00:00:45.760> we<00:00:46.120> don't

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
sometimes in case management we don't

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.049 
sometimes in case management we don't
think<00:00:46.839> about<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.409> body<00:00:47.620> of<00:00:47.860> knowledge<00:00:48.430> that

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
think about the body of knowledge that

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.020 
think about the body of knowledge that
is<00:00:49.659> sitting<00:00:50.379> right<00:00:50.409> behind<00:00:50.949> our<00:00:51.250> daily<00:00:51.760> work

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
is sitting right behind our daily work

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.710 
is sitting right behind our daily work
and<00:00:52.329> how<00:00:53.140> it<00:00:53.530> affects<00:00:54.339> what<00:00:54.940> we<00:00:55.089> do<00:00:55.299> and<00:00:55.509> what

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
and how it affects what we do and what

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.890 
and how it affects what we do and what
we<00:00:55.750> don't<00:00:56.080> do<00:00:56.379> as<00:00:56.680> case<00:00:57.369> managers<00:00:58.059> so

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
we don't do as case managers so

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.619 
we don't do as case managers so
standards<00:00:59.439> of<00:00:59.559> practice<00:00:59.799> apply<00:01:00.699> to<00:01:00.759> all<00:01:01.269> of<00:01:01.479> us

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
standards of practice apply to all of us

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.929 
standards of practice apply to all of us
whether<00:01:01.960> we're<00:01:02.229> nurses<00:01:02.470> or<00:01:02.979> social<00:01:03.489> workers

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:03.939 
whether we're nurses or social workers

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:07.980 
whether we're nurses or social workers
and<00:01:04.239> I<00:01:05.049> really<00:01:05.560> give<00:01:06.250> us<00:01:06.400> definitions<00:01:07.240> and<00:01:07.479> a

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
and I really give us definitions and a

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.830 
and I really give us definitions and a
frame<00:01:08.439> of<00:01:08.619> reference<00:01:08.650> for<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.759> work<00:01:10.540> that<00:01:10.570> we

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
frame of reference for the work that we

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.350 
frame of reference for the work that we
perform<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:12.220> first<00:01:12.520> standards<00:01:13.060> of<00:01:13.150> practice

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
perform the first standards of practice

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.550 
perform the first standards of practice
for<00:01:13.810> case<00:01:14.020> management<00:01:14.530> were<00:01:15.090> introduced<00:01:16.090> in

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
for case management were introduced in

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.289 
for case management were introduced in
1995<00:01:17.560> by<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:17.979> case<00:01:18.220> management<00:01:18.610> Society<00:01:19.270> of

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
1995 by the case management Society of

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.510 
1995 by the case management Society of
America<00:01:19.840> and<00:01:20.259> those<00:01:20.409> have<00:01:20.710> been<00:01:20.920> updated

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
America and those have been updated

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.649 
America and those have been updated
we're<00:01:21.640> going<00:01:21.759> to<00:01:21.820> look<00:01:21.939> at<00:01:22.060> the<00:01:22.180> updated

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
we're going to look at the updated

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.649 
we're going to look at the updated
version<00:01:22.960> in<00:01:23.649> a<00:01:23.799> little<00:01:24.070> bit<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:25.270> as<00:01:25.450> I<00:01:25.600> said

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
version in a little bit and as I said

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.380 
version in a little bit and as I said
these<00:01:26.049> do<00:01:26.320> provide<00:01:26.799> you<00:01:27.100> as<00:01:27.430> case<00:01:27.790> managers

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
these do provide you as case managers

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.040 
these do provide you as case managers
with<00:01:29.170> a<00:01:29.850> foundation<00:01:30.850> for<00:01:31.180> your<00:01:31.270> practice<00:01:31.540> and

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
with a foundation for your practice and

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.950 
with a foundation for your practice and
this<00:01:32.500> is<00:01:32.710> regardless<00:01:33.580> of<00:01:33.940> setting<00:01:34.360> or<00:01:34.630> or

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
this is regardless of setting or or

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.670 
this is regardless of setting or or
discipline<00:01:35.620> and<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:37.240> as<00:01:37.570> we<00:01:37.780> think<00:01:37.810> more<00:01:38.409> and

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
discipline and so as we think more and

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.160 
discipline and so as we think more and
more<00:01:38.950> about<00:01:39.460> case<00:01:39.790> management<00:01:40.390> across<00:01:40.810> the

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
more about case management across the

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.670 
more about case management across the
continuum<00:01:41.880> not<00:01:42.880> a<00:01:42.909> hospital<00:01:43.240> model<00:01:43.960> not<00:01:44.620> a

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
continuum not a hospital model not a

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.880 
continuum not a hospital model not a
community<00:01:45.250> model<00:01:45.430> but<00:01:45.790> really<00:01:46.120> how<00:01:46.360> we

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
community model but really how we

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.100 
community model but really how we
seamlessly<00:01:47.890> transition<00:01:48.670> patients<00:01:49.360> across

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
seamlessly transition patients across

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.200 
seamlessly transition patients across
the<00:01:50.320> continuum<00:01:50.890> we<00:01:51.370> really<00:01:51.670> want<00:01:51.909> to<00:01:52.000> think

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
the continuum we really want to think

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.940 
the continuum we really want to think
about<00:01:52.330> case<00:01:52.720> management<00:01:53.260> more<00:01:53.500> in<00:01:53.710> that

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
about case management more in that

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.180 
about case management more in that
generic<00:01:54.490> sense<00:01:54.909> in<00:01:55.210> terms<00:01:55.780> of<00:01:56.140> applying<00:01:56.860> the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
generic sense in terms of applying the

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.700 
generic sense in terms of applying the
concept<00:01:57.790> regardless<00:01:58.750> of<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.260> practice

concept regardless of the practice
setting<00:01:59.979> so<00:02:00.909> on<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.330> next<00:02:01.510> slide<00:02:01.950> let's<00:02:02.950> get

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
setting so on the next slide let's get

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.800 
setting so on the next slide let's get
into<00:02:03.430> some<00:02:03.640> of<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:03.850> components<00:02:04.570> of<00:02:04.690> the

into some of the components of the

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.469 
into some of the components of the
standards<00:02:05.290> of<00:02:05.409> practice<00:02:05.619> those<00:02:06.580> include<00:02:07.090> the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
standards of practice those include the

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.350 
standards of practice those include the
definition<00:02:08.409> and<00:02:08.849> what<00:02:09.849> I<00:02:09.879> always<00:02:10.149> recommend

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
definition and what I always recommend

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.839 
definition and what I always recommend
is<00:02:10.989> you<00:02:11.140> put<00:02:11.379> your<00:02:11.560> policy<00:02:12.099> and<00:02:12.129> procedure

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
is you put your policy and procedure

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.570

you<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:55.810> did<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:56.140> literature<00:02:56.680> couple<00:02:57.280> of<00:02:57.370> years

you I did a literature couple of years

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.539 
you I did a literature couple of years
ago<00:02:57.819> and<00:02:58.180> I<00:02:58.269> found<00:02:58.540> approximately<00:02:59.549> 40

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
ago and I found approximately 40

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.509 
ago and I found approximately 40
different<00:03:01.170> definitions<00:03:02.170> of<00:03:02.500> case<00:03:02.980> management

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
different definitions of case management

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.240 
different definitions of case management
in<00:03:04.329> the<00:03:04.540> literature<00:03:04.870> they<00:03:05.530> all<00:03:05.739> did<00:03:06.040> however

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
in the literature they all did however

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.869 
in the literature they all did however
have<00:03:06.760> some<00:03:06.790> common<00:03:07.510> themes<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.260> I<00:03:08.709> think<00:03:09.069> it

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
have some common themes and I think it

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.759 
have some common themes and I think it
doesn't<00:03:10.120> matter<00:03:10.510> so<00:03:10.930> much<00:03:11.109> which<00:03:11.379> one<00:03:11.620> you

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
doesn't matter so much which one you

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.009 
doesn't matter so much which one you
pick<00:03:11.980> as<00:03:12.280> long<00:03:13.030> as<00:03:13.209> you<00:03:13.329> pick<00:03:13.540> one<00:03:13.810> that's

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
pick as long as you pick one that's

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.500 
pick as long as you pick one that's
reflective<00:03:14.739> of<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.760> work<00:03:15.970> that<00:03:16.239> you're<00:03:16.480> doing

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
reflective of the work that you're doing

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.869 
reflective of the work that you're doing
and<00:03:17.109> I<00:03:17.230> think<00:03:17.440> this<00:03:17.709> one<00:03:17.950> is<00:03:17.980> generic<00:03:18.700> enough

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
and I think this one is generic enough

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.330 
and I think this one is generic enough
but<00:03:19.420> specific<00:03:20.230> enough<00:03:20.500> at<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.799> same<00:03:21.040> time

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
but specific enough at the same time

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.610 
but specific enough at the same time
that<00:03:21.640> you<00:03:21.760> can<00:03:21.940> use<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.359> anywhere<00:03:22.959> across<00:03:23.470> the

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
that you can use it anywhere across the

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.369 
that you can use it anywhere across the
healthcare<00:03:24.370> continuum<00:03:24.879> so<00:03:25.720> we<00:03:25.930> know<00:03:26.079> it's<00:03:26.290> a

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
healthcare continuum so we know it's a

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.250 
healthcare continuum so we know it's a
collaborative<00:03:26.799> process<00:03:27.760> it<00:03:28.420> includes

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
collaborative process it includes

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.399 
collaborative process it includes
