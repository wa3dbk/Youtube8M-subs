00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.960 
what I got out of this product so it

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970

hold<00:02:09.239> heavy<00:02:09.509> old<00:02:09.810> water<00:02:10.080> mace<00:02:10.370> but<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.520> me<00:02:11.640> it

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
hold heavy old water mace but to me it

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.070 
hold heavy old water mace but to me it
actually<00:02:11.970> wasn't<00:02:12.480> that

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
actually wasn't that

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.260 
actually wasn't that
much<00:02:13.200> different<00:02:14.100> from<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.090> original

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
much different from the original

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.420 
much different from the original
prospectors<00:02:16.200> which<00:02:16.410> was<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.650> bit<00:02:17.040> of<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.220> letdown

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
prospectors which was a bit of a letdown

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.680 
prospectors which was a bit of a letdown
so<00:02:17.840> scooping<00:02:18.840> out<00:02:19.730> almost<00:02:20.730> nothing<00:02:21.270> it's<00:02:21.480> a

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
so scooping out almost nothing it's a

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.930 
so scooping out almost nothing it's a
literally<00:02:22.380> feels<00:02:22.620> like<00:02:22.740> almost<00:02:23.220> no<00:02:23.490> tension

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
literally feels like almost no tension

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.000 
literally feels like almost no tension
at<00:02:24.030> all<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.390> then<00:02:24.900> in<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.230> hands<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.950> feels

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
at all and then in the hands it feels

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.810 
at all and then in the hands it feels
rather<00:02:27.170> sticky<00:02:28.170> almost<00:02:29.070> kind<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.370> sticky<00:02:29.640> in

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
rather sticky almost kind of sticky in

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.410 
rather sticky almost kind of sticky in
the<00:02:29.880> hands<00:02:31.040> but<00:02:32.040> yeah<00:02:32.250> as<00:02:32.550> far<00:02:33.030> as<00:02:33.090> on<00:02:33.330> the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
the hands but yeah as far as on the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.690 
the hands but yeah as far as on the
whole<00:02:33.630> spectrum<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:34.410> would<00:02:35.010> say<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.370> original

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
whole spectrum I would say the original

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.190 
whole spectrum I would say the original
prospectors<00:02:36.360> is<00:02:36.630> like<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:38.510> light<00:02:39.510> medium<00:02:39.780> and

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
prospectors is like a light medium and

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.140 
prospectors is like a light medium and
this<00:02:40.410> one<00:02:40.560> is<00:02:40.680> just<00:02:40.860> like<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:41.010> medium<00:02:41.490> so<00:02:41.850> if

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
this one is just like a medium so if

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.990 
this one is just like a medium so if
you're<00:02:42.720> expecting<00:02:43.140> an<00:02:43.560> ultimate<00:02:44.100> super<00:02:44.670> super

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
you're expecting an ultimate super super

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.520 
you're expecting an ultimate super super
heavy<00:02:45.180> you're<00:02:45.780> not<00:02:45.960> going<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.200> get<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.440> with

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
heavy you're not going to get it with

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.250 
heavy you're not going to get it with
this<00:02:46.880> but<00:02:47.880> still<00:02:48.120> scoops<00:02:48.420> out<00:02:48.540> very<00:02:48.750> nice<00:02:48.960> and

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
this but still scoops out very nice and

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.720 
this but still scoops out very nice and
that<00:02:49.410> scent<00:02:49.770> just<00:02:50.310> gets<00:02:50.490> everywhere<00:02:51.800> now<00:02:52.800> I<00:02:53.250> do

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
that scent just gets everywhere now I do

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.990 
that scent just gets everywhere now I do
have<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.180> say<00:02:54.390> as<00:02:54.660> far<00:02:54.720> as<00:02:55.020> this<00:02:55.260> pomade<00:02:55.500> goes

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
have to say as far as this pomade goes

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.949 
have to say as far as this pomade goes
in<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.480> whole<00:02:57.690> scheme<00:02:58.080> of<00:02:58.110> things<00:02:58.500> with<00:02:59.100> the

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
in the whole scheme of things with the

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.260 
in the whole scheme of things with the
overall<00:03:00.959> performance<00:03:01.610> it<00:03:02.610> was<00:03:02.730> actually<00:03:03.240> a

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
overall performance it was actually a

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.490 
overall performance it was actually a
bit<00:03:03.510> disappointing<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.320> me<00:03:05.990> for<00:03:06.990> some<00:03:07.290> things

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
bit disappointing to me for some things

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.710 
bit disappointing to me for some things
that<00:03:07.709> we'll<00:03:07.830> get<00:03:07.980> into<00:03:08.160> later<00:03:08.280> about<00:03:08.940> why<00:03:09.660> this

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
that we'll get into later about why this

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.640 
that we'll get into later about why this
stuff<00:03:10.080> was<00:03:10.230> disappointing<00:03:10.860> so<00:03:12.650> application

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
stuff was disappointing so application

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.990 
stuff was disappointing so application
is<00:03:14.130> a<00:03:14.430> bit<00:03:14.850> sticky<00:03:16.340> still<00:03:17.340> goes<00:03:17.550> away<00:03:17.790> in<00:03:17.910> the

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
is a bit sticky still goes away in the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.490 
is a bit sticky still goes away in the
hands<00:03:18.330> nice<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.570> still<00:03:19.019> goes<00:03:19.200> in<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.380> hair

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
hands nice and still goes in the hair

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.699 
hands nice and still goes in the hair
nice<00:03:19.650> but<00:03:19.980> it's<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.790> lot<00:03:21.180> stickier<00:03:21.750> than<00:03:22.400> the

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
nice but it's a lot stickier than the

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.979 
nice but it's a lot stickier than the
original<00:03:25.709> prospectors<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.430> if<00:03:27.060> I<00:03:27.269> can<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:27.510> can

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
original prospectors and if I can I can

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.420 
original prospectors and if I can I can
see<00:03:28.200> where<00:03:28.380> if<00:03:28.470> your<00:03:28.620> hair<00:03:28.800> is<00:03:28.890> completely<00:03:29.010> dry

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.370 
see where if your hair is completely dry
when<00:03:29.880> you<00:03:30.000> apply<00:03:30.209> this<00:03:30.269> stuff<00:03:30.570> it<00:03:30.750> could<00:03:31.019> have

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
when you apply this stuff it could have

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.259 
when you apply this stuff it could have
a<00:03:31.650> bit<00:03:32.130> of<00:03:32.250> tugging<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.670> pulling<00:03:32.730> but<00:03:33.120> I

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
a bit of tugging and pulling but I

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.520 
a bit of tugging and pulling but I
always<00:03:33.540> apply<00:03:33.750> damp<00:03:35.090> but<00:03:36.090> yes<00:03:36.360> it's<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:37.019> pretty

always apply damp but yes it's a pretty
pretty<00:03:37.830> sticky<00:03:38.310> but<00:03:39.239> still<00:03:39.540> only<00:03:39.870> feels<00:03:40.260> about

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
pretty sticky but still only feels about

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.060 
pretty sticky but still only feels about
a<00:03:40.560> medium<00:03:41.070> so<00:03:42.200> got<00:03:43.200> all<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.440> pomade<00:03:43.800> in<00:03:43.950> there

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070

what they thought about them
was<00:04:26.400> that<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.669> original<00:04:26.790> had<00:04:27.240> hemp<00:04:27.600> oil<00:04:27.810> and

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
was that the original had hemp oil and

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.850 
was that the original had hemp oil and
it<00:04:28.560> made<00:04:28.800> it<00:04:29.010> so<00:04:29.340> your<00:04:29.520> hair<00:04:29.790> wasn't<00:04:30.440> it<00:04:31.440> wasn't

dry<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:32.639> it<00:04:32.730> didn't<00:04:32.970> suck<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.300> life<00:04:33.450> out<00:04:33.600> of

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
dry and it didn't suck the life out of

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.720 
dry and it didn't suck the life out of
your<00:04:33.810> hair<00:04:33.900> and<00:04:33.990> whatnot<00:04:35.090> but<00:04:36.090> this<00:04:36.300> stuff<00:04:36.620> I

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
your hair and whatnot but this stuff I

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.550 
your hair and whatnot but this stuff I
washed<00:04:38.730> it<00:04:38.970> out<00:04:39.150> of<00:04:39.270> my<00:04:39.360> hair<00:04:39.570> my<00:04:39.780> hair<00:04:39.960> was<00:04:40.139> so

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
washed it out of my hair my hair was so

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.580 
washed it out of my hair my hair was so
dry<00:04:41.310> and<00:04:41.730> I<00:04:42.480> don't<00:04:42.750> know<00:04:42.840> if<00:04:42.990> that's<00:04:43.200> because

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
dry and I don't know if that's because

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.290 
dry and I don't know if that's because
they<00:04:43.770> didn't<00:04:44.070> put<00:04:44.340> hemp<00:04:44.610> oil<00:04:44.820> in<00:04:45.000> this<00:04:45.120> one

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
they didn't put hemp oil in this one

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.879 
they didn't put hemp oil in this one
because<00:04:45.630> the<00:04:46.080> hemp<00:04:46.230> oil<00:04:46.440> is<00:04:46.560> what<00:04:46.710> made<00:04:46.860> it

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
because the hemp oil is what made it

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.420 
because the hemp oil is what made it
weaker<00:04:47.510> but<00:04:48.510> I<00:04:48.840> don't<00:04:49.740> know<00:04:49.800> what<00:04:49.980> it<00:04:50.070> is<00:04:50.220> but

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
weaker but I don't know what it is but

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.020 
weaker but I don't know what it is but
my<00:04:50.639> hair<00:04:51.000> it<00:04:51.240> just<00:04:51.450> got<00:04:51.660> super<00:04:52.380> super<00:04:52.800> dry

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030
