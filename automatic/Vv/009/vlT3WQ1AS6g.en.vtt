nutrition<00:02:10.360> I<00:02:11.360> need<00:02:12.050> for<00:02:12.319> green<00:02:12.560> leaves<00:02:12.769> is

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
nutrition I need for green leaves is

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.740 
nutrition I need for green leaves is
really<00:02:13.370> really<00:02:13.670> high<00:02:13.819> and<00:02:14.060> we<00:02:14.450> look<00:02:14.599> at

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
really really high and we look at

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.460 
really really high and we look at
primates<00:02:15.519> primarily<00:02:16.519> half<00:02:16.970> of<00:02:17.239> their<00:02:17.360> diet<00:02:17.629> as

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
primates primarily half of their diet as

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.229 
primates primarily half of their diet as
as<00:02:18.769> green<00:02:19.160> leaves<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.700> other<00:02:19.819> half<00:02:20.060> is

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
as green leaves and the other half is

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.940 
as green leaves and the other half is
true<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:20.720> only<00:02:20.840> maybe<00:02:21.230> about<00:02:21.470> five<00:02:21.799> percent

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
true and only maybe about five percent

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.030 
true and only maybe about five percent
of<00:02:22.310> seeds<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:23.019> when<00:02:24.019> people<00:02:24.410> hear<00:02:24.590> about<00:02:24.620> life

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
of seeds and when people hear about life

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.979 
of seeds and when people hear about life
plant<00:02:25.340> nutrition<00:02:25.700> they<00:02:26.360> really<00:02:26.629> want<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.870> do

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
plant nutrition they really want to do

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.140 
plant nutrition they really want to do
it<00:02:27.140> completely<00:02:28.069> the<00:02:28.220> opposite<00:02:28.549> way<00:02:28.700> they<00:02:28.910> want

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
it completely the opposite way they want

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.270 
it completely the opposite way they want
to<00:02:29.209> do<00:02:29.299> about<00:02:29.420> and<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:30.470> half<00:02:30.680> their<00:02:30.890> diet<00:02:31.099> is

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
to do about and a half their diet is

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.400 
to do about and a half their diet is
nuts<00:02:31.610> and<00:02:31.849> seeds<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.930> other<00:02:33.080> half<00:02:33.260> is

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
nuts and seeds and the other half is

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.259 
nuts and seeds and the other half is
fruits<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:33.920> maybe<00:02:34.069> one<00:02:34.310> green<00:02:34.580> leaf<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:35.030> that

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
fruits and maybe one green leaf and that

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.410 
fruits and maybe one green leaf and that
is<00:02:35.450> that<00:02:35.750> that's<00:02:36.290> a<00:02:36.410> really<00:02:36.920> bad<00:02:37.130> ratio<00:02:37.489> what

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
is that that's a really bad ratio what

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.420 
is that that's a really bad ratio what
we<00:02:38.540> got<00:02:38.690> to<00:02:38.780> remember<00:02:39.019> is<00:02:39.380> that<00:02:39.410> the<00:02:40.190> green

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
we got to remember is that the green

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.300 
we got to remember is that the green
leaf<00:02:40.640> itself<00:02:40.819> is<00:02:41.269> actually<00:02:41.450> what<00:02:42.349> animals<00:02:43.190> are

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
leaf itself is actually what animals are

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.860 
leaf itself is actually what animals are
made<00:02:43.489> out<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.730> so<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.209> lot<00:02:44.450> of<00:02:44.480> us<00:02:44.690> have<00:02:44.810> been

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
made out of so a lot of us have been

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.039 
made out of so a lot of us have been
coming<00:02:45.200> from<00:02:45.700> animal-based<00:02:46.700> diet<00:02:47.180> will<00:02:47.810> be

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
coming from animal-based diet will be

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.009 
coming from animal-based diet will be
meeting<00:02:48.440> red<00:02:48.980> meat<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:49.519> what<00:02:50.390> that<00:02:50.569> actually

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
meeting red meat and what that actually

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.990 
meeting red meat and what that actually
is<00:02:51.049> this<00:02:51.379> is<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.530> recycled<00:02:52.190> green<00:02:52.430> light<00:02:52.640> green

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
is this is a recycled green light green

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.009 
is this is a recycled green light green
leaf<00:02:53.920> so<00:02:54.920> we're<00:02:55.700> going<00:02:55.910> on<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.209> animal

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
leaf so we're going on the animal

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.750 
leaf so we're going on the animal
products<00:02:57.379> which<00:02:57.530> is<00:02:57.680> a<00:02:57.709> recycled<00:02:58.400> green<00:02:58.579> leaf

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
products which is a recycled green leaf

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.390 
products which is a recycled green leaf
we<00:02:59.299> need<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.540> go<00:02:59.690> direct<00:03:00.079> and<00:03:00.349> start<00:03:01.010> in<00:03:01.129> green

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
we need to go direct and start in green

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.979 
we need to go direct and start in green
leaves<00:03:01.579> we<00:03:01.760> just<00:03:01.940> can't<00:03:02.150> live<00:03:02.360> on<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:02.540> diet<00:03:02.750> full

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
leaves we just can't live on a diet full

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.720 
leaves we just can't live on a diet full
of<00:03:03.110> nuts<00:03:03.290> and<00:03:03.470> mangoes<00:03:03.860> that<00:03:03.890> that's<00:03:04.370> not<00:03:04.549> that

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
of nuts and mangoes that that's not that

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.240 
of nuts and mangoes that that's not that
that<00:03:04.940> would<00:03:05.090> be<00:03:05.120> unbalanced<00:03:05.989> yeah<00:03:06.860> but<00:03:07.129> it's

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
that would be unbalanced yeah but it's

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.759 
that would be unbalanced yeah but it's
when<00:03:07.400> you<00:03:07.879> come<00:03:08.120> from<00:03:08.329> eating<00:03:09.170> seven<00:03:09.560> meats

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
when you come from eating seven meats

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.860 
when you come from eating seven meats
and<00:03:10.160> some<00:03:10.670> other<00:03:10.819> things<00:03:10.910> than<00:03:11.420> you<00:03:11.630> think

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
and some other things than you think

that you're gonna not have enough and

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.940

your<00:03:14.420> stomach<00:03:14.930> that's<00:03:15.139> a<00:03:15.319> preconceived

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
your stomach that's a preconceived

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.830 
your stomach that's a preconceived
notion<00:03:16.400> because<00:03:16.519> yesterday<00:03:17.150> we<00:03:17.329> were<00:03:17.450> telling

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
notion because yesterday we were telling

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.120 
notion because yesterday we were telling
me<00:03:17.870> that<00:03:18.190> when<00:03:19.190> you<00:03:19.430> actually<00:03:19.639> eat<00:03:20.150> more<00:03:21.130> food

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
me that when you actually eat more food

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.430 
me that when you actually eat more food
that<00:03:22.310> is<00:03:22.489> that<00:03:22.940> is<00:03:23.060> highly<00:03:23.299> nutriments<00:03:24.260> then

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
that is that is highly nutriments then

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.009 
that is that is highly nutriments then
you<00:03:24.620> fill<00:03:24.920> yourself<00:03:25.609> up<00:03:25.819> faster<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:26.900> your

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
bodies are just looking for nutrition

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.129 
bodies are just looking for nutrition
they<00:03:34.700> just<00:03:34.910> like<00:03:35.000> Tiffany<00:03:35.359> chili<00:03:35.660> sauce<00:03:35.870> in<00:03:36.109> it

and most of us are really been coming
from<00:03:39.829> diets<00:03:40.190> will<00:03:40.370> have<00:03:40.459> been<00:03:40.579> eating<00:03:40.940> food

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
from diets will have been eating food

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.490 
from diets will have been eating food
has<00:03:41.989> been<00:03:42.200> heavily<00:03:43.040> process<00:03:43.669> creates<00:03:44.660> devoid

has been heavily process creates devoid

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.830 
has been heavily process creates devoid
of<00:03:45.620> nutrition<00:03:45.680> a<00:03:46.400> lot<00:03:46.819> of<00:03:46.970> white<00:03:47.239> food<00:03:47.630> in

like that Ortiz and I miss pretty no

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.920 
like that Ortiz and I miss pretty no
nutrition<00:03:58.130> in<00:03:58.250> back<00:03:58.489> it's<00:03:58.760> it<00:03:59.540> might<00:03:59.720> be<00:03:59.900> just

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
nutrition in back it's it might be just

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.259 
nutrition in back it's it might be just
enough<00:04:00.200> to<00:04:00.440> get<00:04:00.590> us<00:04:00.620> by<00:04:01.030> until<00:04:02.030> it<00:04:02.150> makes

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
enough to get us by until it makes

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:03.789 
enough to get us by until it makes
melter<00:04:02.750> fun<00:04:02.959> but<00:04:03.169> in<00:04:03.290> terms<00:04:03.470> of<00:04:03.620> nutrition

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
melter fun but in terms of nutrition

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.890
