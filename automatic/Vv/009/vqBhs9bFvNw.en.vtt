00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.960
 hello everyone in this delivery is going to 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.160
 teach how to get their support in 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.799
 the app store then how can 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.900
 change without a Senate from your app store 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.420
 well basically let's go to the app 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.490
 store that is an icon that looks like this is 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.890
 click on that what they want and 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.260
 basically the easiest thing to do is to go to 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.810
 then the first option is 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.460
 of the little star click on that and 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.250
 they're just going to go totally to 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.989
 down if totally down they will see your 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.570
 support for 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.280
 or maybe you see here maybe you tell them 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.469
 sign in or without outs if it usually sign in 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.350
 equally if they have nothing they have the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.640
 option to create your support and within 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.970
 Here then let's go give click here 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.610
 above yes and he will give you these options 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:00.060
 from here you can see their support can 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.010
 heal designing if at this moment I'm going 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.750
 they're out so they can see what the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.850
 Six-minute process curious and not 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.010
 right now to change support me and inside 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.770
 from here I will use my other then 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.110
 here he tells me to use the existing field or 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.210
 create a new stable support you 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.920
 have these options if you do not have a 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.540
 wall and can create at this time not 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.610
 they need no credit card or 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:26.710
 nothing like that worry us 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:29.080
 in my case I have created three supports in 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.360
 all its increases I use only one but 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.120
 the other time is because I have two 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.840
 countries it is possible to have a 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.149
 bit 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.229
 of more options to download applications 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.649
 is in all the countries of the 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.750
 crowds I have another video even 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.630
 that teaches them how to create a source of 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.270
 another way for without a credit card 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.649
 by tsja to this form can also 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.840
 do it without a credit card but 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.179
 I have another video dedicated only that but 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.179
 create one supported in this I'm just 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:02.539
 teaching how they can enter and exit 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:07.509
 his api to exchange then boyacÃ¡ 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.509
 there they put their support to haiti 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.329
 your support is only 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:20.379
 your hymen plus your password 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.080
 Then they put their password and bets 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.340
 password are going to be able only and can already 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.790
 can look for any adaptation 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.099

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.840
 if they want to download their application or 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.239
 any other application that 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.010
 would like to get off the app store 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.830
