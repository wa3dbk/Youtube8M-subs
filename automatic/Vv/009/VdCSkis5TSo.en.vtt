00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
know it would have to be built super

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.860 
know it would have to be built super
tough<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.399> these<00:00:59.579> obviously<00:01:00.090> got<00:01:00.390> these<00:01:00.570> built

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
tough so these obviously got these built

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.110 
tough so these obviously got these built
really<00:01:01.199> really<00:01:01.590> strong<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.250> I've<00:01:02.879> been

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
really really strong so I've been

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.939 
really really strong so I've been
pushing<00:01:03.390> snow<00:01:03.629> with<00:01:03.930> these<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.559> set<00:01:04.800> up<00:01:04.920> here

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
pushing snow with these this set up here

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.040 
pushing snow with these this set up here
for<00:01:05.160> quite<00:01:05.550> a<00:01:05.580> few<00:01:05.850> for<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.300> last<00:01:06.539> two<00:01:06.780> years

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
for quite a few for the last two years

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.410 
for quite a few for the last two years
and<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:08.310> know<00:01:08.399> I've<00:01:08.610> run<00:01:08.789> into<00:01:08.970> some<00:01:09.090> pretty

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
and you know I've run into some pretty

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.380 
and you know I've run into some pretty
soggy<00:01:09.720> stuff<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.440> even<00:01:11.369> push<00:01:11.580> all<00:01:11.789> snow<00:01:12.060> banks

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
soggy stuff and even push all snow banks

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.389 
soggy stuff and even push all snow banks
back<00:01:12.539> in<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.410> I've<00:01:13.560> yet<00:01:13.800> to<00:01:13.830> break<00:01:14.100> anything

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
back in and I've yet to break anything

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.969 
back in and I've yet to break anything
so<00:01:14.759> I'm<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.390> kind<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.289> think<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.649> as<00:01:16.830> now

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
so I'm I kind of think of this as now

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.609 
so I'm I kind of think of this as now
it's<00:01:17.220> just<00:01:17.399> like<00:01:17.550> it's<00:01:17.670> bulletproof<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.619> so

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
it's just like it's bulletproof so so

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.740 
it's just like it's bulletproof so so
now<00:01:19.740> I'll<00:01:19.890> set<00:01:20.069> the<00:01:20.099> camera<00:01:20.520> up<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.849> show<00:01:21.569> you

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
now I'll set the camera up and show you

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.330 
now I'll set the camera up and show you
pushing<00:01:22.140> me<00:01:22.229> some<00:01:22.560> snow<00:01:22.740> it's<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.190> know<00:01:23.280> I

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
pushing me some snow it's you know I

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.800 
pushing me some snow it's you know I
probably<00:01:23.520> got<00:01:23.729> about<00:01:23.849> six<00:01:24.569> or<00:01:24.690> eight<00:01:24.780> inches

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
probably got about six or eight inches

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.240 
probably got about six or eight inches
here<00:01:25.319> and<00:01:25.440> it's<00:01:25.560> getting<00:01:25.679> heavy<00:01:25.950> because<00:01:26.160> it's

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
here and it's getting heavy because it's

00:01:26.250 --> 00:05:02.250 
here and it's getting heavy because it's
raining<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:26.789> uh<00:01:27.110> be<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> good<00:01:28.380> test<00:01:28.619> for<00:01:28.709> this

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:11.180 

you

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.890 

so<00:05:11.790> what<00:05:11.970> I'm<00:05:12.060> going<00:05:12.180> to<00:05:12.210> do<00:05:12.330> now<00:05:12.480> is<00:05:12.690> I'm<00:05:12.810> going

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
so what I'm going to do now is I'm going

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.870 
so what I'm going to do now is I'm going
to<00:05:12.960> set<00:05:13.140> the<00:05:13.230> camera<00:05:13.590> up<00:05:13.620> and<00:05:13.860> then<00:05:14.130> I'll<00:05:14.340> get

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880
