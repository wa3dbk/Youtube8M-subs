I had bought these with the intention of
my<00:01:43.710> husband<00:01:44.159> using<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.090> set<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.299> liked<00:01:45.570> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
my husband using the set I liked the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.940 
my husband using the set I liked the
blue<00:01:45.840> color<00:01:46.080> thought<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.500> would<00:01:46.590> work<00:01:46.710> but<00:01:46.890> it

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
blue color thought it would work but it

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.800 
blue color thought it would work but it
turns<00:01:47.280> out<00:01:47.460> they<00:01:47.820> were<00:01:47.880> actually<00:01:48.299> too<00:01:48.509> small

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
turns out they were actually too small
