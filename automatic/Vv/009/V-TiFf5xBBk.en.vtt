00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.100
 face volume then to 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.170
 understand the face with a figure 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.599
 three-dimensional and see how it reacts to the 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.999
 light when it hits our face we have 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.759
 than to turn it into a prismatic figure 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:16.100
 in that way to tend more easily 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:18.080
 for that we are going to take into account the 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:23.109
 principles seen in the previous class 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.109
 where we understood the canon of the face 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.430
 we have to build our so that 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.590
 to provide more of it 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.130
 exercise of the previous class we are going to 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.200
 build the face with this scheme 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.690
 then I make these two bones 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.030
 temporary 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.920
 I look for the axis of the eyes 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.559
 I look for the axis of the mouth 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.829
 half of this space and this one that 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.860
 it can be a third of this distance or 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:54.130
 well a quarter 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.260
 and we are going to build the face that can 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.100
 be the chin 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.100
 lower jaw 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.600
 and the ears 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.980
 having that initial scheme I can already 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.190
 start to build the figure then 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.410
 was to take the referents that are the 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.470
 distance from the eyes remember that it is 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.450
 this space divided into 5 I'm going to take 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.700
 another one that is my nose 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.899
 the width of my nose I'm going to take another 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.700
 which is the height of the mouth which is the 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.520
 internal part of the distinction of the limit 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.729
 in everything 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.850
 it's something like this those points are key 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.159
 for the construction of the prism 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.090
 I will also consider the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.090
 hair birth 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.620
 the height of the eyebrows 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.890
 then I will project this distance 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.890
 upwards 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.210
 We're going to start getting what 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.210
 corresponds so that we can 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.420
 I'm going to project this line here, I'm going to 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.970
 project this here 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.530
 then I'm going to take these two points and 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.530
 I'm going to project these 2 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.530
 try as much as possible to make the figure go 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.530
 being symmetrical 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.129
 let's take out 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.960
 I accept straight lines here 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.909
 now I'm going to project this line up 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.909
 in the mouth 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.100
 it can be the line of the mouth 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.780
 I'm going to do the chin later I want 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.070
 look at these two points that correspond 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.940
 to this line that back and initially 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.940
 I'm going to take it 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.540
 I'm going to make my mouth 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.010
 nose 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.750
 I'm going to try to make these lines look 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.850
 as if it were a tourism then I'm going to 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.850
 turn this into figures 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.810
 but project these lines up 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.770
 I'm going to do a little 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.770
 volume here 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:16.060
 now how the light reacts on the face 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:18.370
 then how is this a prism 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.419
 part to receive direct light wants 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.910
 say that I'm going to light it 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.560
 completely 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.560
 in terms of back I'm going to apply 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.520
 no trace here I will make a 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:33.090
 stroke 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.090
 a medium tone just like in this area 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.200
 just like in this area where it 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.220
 share that space 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.860
 on this side it 's clear just as it is what 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.230
 ideal is that you yourselves try 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.380
 interpret with a living model how 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:56.070
 will react on the body in the face and 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:59.450
 let's try to apply a tone to each one 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.450
 from these sides of the prism
