mince<00:02:29.209> has<00:02:29.420> turned<00:02:29.690> brown<00:02:30.260> color<00:02:30.680> whereas<00:02:31.010> it

was slightly red painted before take a

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.720 
was slightly red painted before take a
mixture<00:02:34.670> of<00:02:34.820> the<00:02:34.940> hate<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:36.500> we<00:02:37.130> know<00:02:37.459> that's

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
mixture of the hate and we know that's

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.530 
mixture of the hate and we know that's
where<00:02:38.030> you'll<00:02:38.209> be<00:02:38.390> making<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.650> samosas

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.330 

all<00:02:43.540> right<00:02:43.750> so<00:02:44.080> basically<00:02:44.680> we've<00:02:45.070> got<00:02:45.100> some

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
all right so basically we've got some

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.710 
all right so basically we've got some
pre-made<00:02:46.140> samosa<00:02:47.140> heads<00:02:47.740> here<00:02:48.130> now<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:49.600> way

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
pre-made samosa heads here now the way

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.370 
pre-made samosa heads here now the way
to<00:02:49.780> make<00:02:50.140> this<00:02:50.410> is<00:02:50.740> take<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:52.150> pre-made<00:02:52.990> samosa

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
to make this is take the pre-made samosa

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.080 
to make this is take the pre-made samosa
pad<00:02:53.800> and<00:02:54.540> fold<00:02:55.540> over<00:02:55.750> once<00:02:56.080> in<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:57.070> middle<00:02:57.400> so

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
pad and fold over once in the middle so

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.050 
pad and fold over once in the middle so
you<00:02:58.120> have<00:02:58.480> one<00:02:59.350> section<00:02:59.740> like<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:00.610> like<00:03:00.820> so

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
you have one section like this like so

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.540 
you have one section like this like so
and<00:03:01.300> one<00:03:01.660> set<00:03:01.840> something<00:03:02.080> like<00:03:02.200> this<00:03:02.550> from

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
and one set something like this from

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.800 
and one set something like this from
some<00:03:03.820> beaten<00:03:04.150> egg<00:03:04.180> into<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:05.650> open<00:03:05.980> section

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
some beaten egg into the open section

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.380 
some beaten egg into the open section
and<00:03:07.830> fold<00:03:08.830> over<00:03:09.250> so<00:03:09.970> you<00:03:10.030> have<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:11.490> cone<00:03:12.490> and<00:03:12.880> the

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
and fold over so you have a cone and the

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.460 
and fold over so you have a cone and the
conception<00:03:13.930> here<00:03:14.200> is<00:03:14.410> completely<00:03:14.770> closed<00:03:16.470> you

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
conception here is completely closed you

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.770 
conception here is completely closed you
have<00:03:17.500> a<00:03:17.680> cone<00:03:17.920> like<00:03:18.130> this<00:03:18.370> with<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:18.910> pastry

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
have a cone like this with the pastry

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.380 
have a cone like this with the pastry
has<00:03:19.959> over<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.380> top<00:03:20.650> like<00:03:20.920> that<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:21.970> open<00:03:22.330> the

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
has over the top like that so open the

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.190 
has over the top like that so open the
cone<00:03:22.570> up<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:23.550> add<00:03:24.550> in<00:03:24.760> about<00:03:25.209> 3/4<00:03:26.020> of<00:03:26.050> a

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
cone up and add in about 3/4 of a

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.530 
cone up and add in about 3/4 of a
tablespoon<00:03:26.800> for<00:03:27.459> just<00:03:27.670> over<00:03:27.880> a<00:03:27.910> half<00:03:28.120> of<00:03:28.450> this

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
tablespoon for just over a half of this

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.240 
tablespoon for just over a half of this
thing

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250
