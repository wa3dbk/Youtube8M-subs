00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:03.930

 Boo Boo do not challenge 8 o well 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:49.430
 Because it is an American brand, it is the American birth with eight wins 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.330
 It is a brand that started as a dj brand from the time it started 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.520
 No 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.670
 But it referred to in the history and 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:59.300
 8 Of course before I get involved 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:03.130
 Atsuro who has a history of about 40 years 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:06.880
 That's right I'm a Nabe old brand 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:12.490
 What was 40 years ago, is it fine? 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.940
 Ki seen in the Do will in ยง What this level meter and whether the disregard of antennae like a mating sound d 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:19.730
 Oh, and it was 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:24.800
 I told you that something like Mr. Village's can not be inserted 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:25.550
 Go do not feel design skin in such Well, after all of this have to thing seems to America brand 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.980
 I mean that 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:33.930
 All the top plate has grown its own little germicidal flagella of Italy like chrome plating 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:38.220
 Or Na mutually check enters like a resonance Toka 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:42.479
 It doesn't enter, and it says that I have nose hair out when saying so, but I can check all that there 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:46.470
 It is such a breakthrough product Imaimashi likely it was a society that 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:50.729
 I I'd came Emma dje 3 is so ne 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:53.950
 After all was said this Mochoi Well if your country in terms of the kind that 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:57.760
 A controller Gar another for the PC 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:05:01.680
 I think but 8 originally or Mao 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:05.920
 Although the people of the home country the United States is got to be 8 continue to stand or 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.560
 I think it is a brand that can be said the integrated brand of dj 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.910
 I see. 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:14.340
 8, for example I'm not doing cd but is also doing a turn table in the company's lighting 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.669
 Many are bought with the contents I detective areas that get along 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.480
 I think I have a manufacturer who does not do this but I'm doing controller 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.950
 But 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.720
 or rather from the cd and bait pcdj for this kind of dj from the turntable 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.580
 From the category of digital dj 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:33.849
 I 'm going through all the way if you have a needle 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:35.020
 It looks like it 's getting more and more, and I've been doing old-fashioned loaded dj and it's pretty American 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:39.219
 It is something 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.810
 8 If you are a person who likes dg pretty much, is it a kind of brand that you have you 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:44.830
 Say 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:50.590
 Well you know it d If you like it, it's a plan with a long time ago
