00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.309
 please 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.879
 eye 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.009
 but 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.289
 Yes Yes Yes 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.310
 - the attitude 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.810
 the model that will be to change the paradigm of the high-end brand 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.810
 of the rhombus 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.730
 an executive order that throughout his four Cubans of radio meters to 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.070
 elegance of rage representation trade 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.810
 in which we have to stop its format are given with three bodies 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.000
 defined unlike 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.500
 of their elevators like for example the cetis 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.500
 they had speech body 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.630
 pointing to a conventional user happy about things of good quality and 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.710
 the representation 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.920
 this car uses good efe a few of these are taken as per 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.869
 example is 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.950
 it seems that part of him prints strength clean and massiveness of the big trunk 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.020
 headlights with but very good bi-xenon sectors and made almost four long what 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.689
 that also accentuates its image of high-end saloons 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.520
 This profile is also very elegant defined by a high waist and with 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.399
 some sales is luxury like for example 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.750
 the metallic fillet that skirts all the sale masses 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.670
 the car also attractive in this list where you can also see it settle 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.010
 mind its four as no meters long but for me the best sector 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.359
 solved is the butt with a tail 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:27.479
 p Monaco the earth and the sun and is more a bit like the German cars 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:32.130
 with great optics a ribbon as well as accentuating its character 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.710
 of luxurious vehicle so in general we have a design 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.910
 conventional and modern coffee growers, and at the same time with a guarantee of 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.910
 those crimes 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.269
 getting more functional we can highlight good not only the 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.859
 elegant design the headquarters santa but also the adoption of tires 47 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.469
 to the state of the roads are from our country 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:04.359
 genaro of the 17-inch wheels the width of the 25 to the smallest of a 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:05.730
 profile 50 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.939
 if you want to say 50% of the width of the band which defines 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:15.529
 the apologies before a heel of a considerable height for which efe not 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:19.739
 only does not degrade the march but also for the one who posed 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.079
 cuts vows street accident 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.909
 we do not run unsuccessful to break island santa pola or martí gómez 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.600
 I think our unit that we have here in dark color is not noticeable 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.740
 the roof is made for consumption in the san cristóbal fairy mine ie for 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.329
 friends plus the edges the athletic future 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.760
 they make up an informal segment 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.739
 in dark color that continues 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.270
 with the windshield and also with the rear window 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.430
 that is to say that if we had active in latitude in light color 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.750
 we would see previously in a single piece windshield in fact and Monday to a resource 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.160
 also luxury that is used in several high-end models 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:27.340
 and continuing with the functional mirrors very good size 

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:32.240
 aerodynamic design good vision more severe and with the addition of pilots 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.509
 laterally in prominent positions obviously the regulation is electrical 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:39.059
 on both sides 

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:41.639
 when we speak in cars do 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.080
 from the button on the driver's door 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.640
 from the buttons on the card or just walking away with the card 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:49.640
 bosism 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.640
 the festivities close automatically 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:56.530
 and a detail no less you will look for the antenna 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.940
 miranda lambert love to our latitude is not visible 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.389
 and it is a good resource I took this device many times this element can be 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.479
 to mess up a clean design 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.539
 gené latitude that is hidden and that sanctioners what favors the good 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:11.290
 reception 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.059
 of the stations pamplona 

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:16.059
 like the premiere 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:27.820
 We said recently in general latitude a car 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.210
 conventional, a car that radiates representative luxury but also has a 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.880
 small sports touch this is given in the posterior sector not only by the 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.930
 same image d by sector of the body but by two letters the 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:47.370
 subtle wing on the top of the trunk and the noble exhaust in front of this 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.919
 besser version 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:52.160
 and to close this chapter of this year we can highlight 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.380
 Moran questioned not only the work of the 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.370
 auto also wipers with its hidden arms to not hinder 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.999
 just the aerodynamic penetration 

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:05.559
 also the bi-xenon projectors 

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:08.680
 p with on the cover of course in polycarbonate 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.530
 in other back sectors with technology read that is lights more 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.650
 visible addressing much faster than with the lamps 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:17.030
 conventional
