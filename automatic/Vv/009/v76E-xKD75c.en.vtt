hey everybody finally finishing up the

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:04.940 
hey everybody finally finishing up the
two-stroke<00:00:03.810> go-kart<00:00:04.500> that<00:00:04.620> I<00:00:04.650> was<00:00:04.770> building

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
two-stroke go-kart that I was building

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.320 
two-stroke go-kart that I was building
got<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.029> steering<00:00:06.299> on<00:00:06.509> got<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.560> seat<00:00:07.770> mounted

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330 
got the steering on got the seat mounted

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.629 
got the steering on got the seat mounted
gas<00:00:09.330> tanks<00:00:09.690> mounted<00:00:10.250> we<00:00:11.250> get<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.400> chain

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
gas tanks mounted we get a chain

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.970 
gas tanks mounted we get a chain
tensioner<00:00:12.090> over<00:00:12.360> there<00:00:12.650> I'll<00:00:13.650> show<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:13.889> how

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
tensioner over there I'll show you how

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.050 
tensioner over there I'll show you how
that<00:00:14.009> works<00:00:14.250> it's<00:00:14.490> pretty<00:00:14.670> neat<00:00:16.160> it's<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.400> flat

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
that works it's pretty neat it's a flat

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.980 
that works it's pretty neat it's a flat
pulley<00:00:18.330> attached<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.350> some<00:00:19.830> flat<00:00:20.039> steel<00:00:20.340> and

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
pulley attached to some flat steel and

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.880 
pulley attached to some flat steel and
there's<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.080> shaft<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.439> runs<00:00:22.560> through<00:00:22.769> that

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
there's a shaft that runs through that

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.679 
there's a shaft that runs through that
tube<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:23.519> piece<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.760> flat<00:00:24.029> steel<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.660> the

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
tube to this piece of flat steel to the

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.820 
tube to this piece of flat steel to the
spring<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.920> whole<00:00:26.039> thing<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.310> kind<00:00:26.640> of

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
spring and the whole thing is kind of

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.679 
spring and the whole thing is kind of
spring-loaded<00:00:29.060> good<00:00:30.060> amount<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.330> tension<00:00:30.480> on

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
spring-loaded good amount of tension on

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.630 
spring-loaded good amount of tension on
there<00:00:30.929> it's<00:00:31.349> perfect<00:00:31.740> for<00:00:31.769> this<00:00:32.070> size<00:00:32.279> chain

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
there it's perfect for this size chain

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.910 
there it's perfect for this size chain
so<00:00:32.940> chain<00:00:33.870> hasn't<00:00:34.140> fallen<00:00:34.260> off<00:00:34.440> yet<00:00:34.770> I've

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
so chain hasn't fallen off yet I've

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.500 
so chain hasn't fallen off yet I've
driven<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.430> about<00:00:35.610> five<00:00:35.850> minutes<00:00:35.880> with<00:00:36.390> it

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
driven in about five minutes with it

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.000 
driven in about five minutes with it
like<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:36.870> before<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.260> painted<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.770> just<00:00:37.950> to

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
like this before I painted it just to

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.100 
like this before I painted it just to
make<00:00:38.129> sure<00:00:38.160> everything<00:00:38.700> was<00:00:38.790> all<00:00:38.910> good<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.480> it

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
make sure everything was all good and it

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.619 
make sure everything was all good and it
was<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:41.190> slapped<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.940> coat<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.239> black<00:00:42.390> paint

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
was so I slapped the coat of black paint

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.970 
was so I slapped the coat of black paint
on<00:00:42.870> there<00:00:43.219> wired<00:00:44.219> everything<00:00:44.550> back<00:00:44.879> up<00:00:44.910> and

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
on there wired everything back up and

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.160 
on there wired everything back up and
yeah<00:00:46.980> now<00:00:47.520> it's<00:00:47.640> pretty<00:00:47.789> much<00:00:47.879> done<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:49.050> yeah

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
yeah now it's pretty much done so yeah

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.450 
yeah now it's pretty much done so yeah
let's<00:00:49.410> start<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.770> thing<00:00:49.950> up<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.219> drive<00:00:50.340> it

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
let's start this thing up and drive it

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.500 
let's start this thing up and drive it
around<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.700> little<00:00:50.789> bit<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.030> want<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.360> show<00:00:51.449> you

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
around a little bit I want to show you

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.740 
around a little bit I want to show you
how<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.719> goes<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.829> not<00:00:52.949> crazy<00:00:53.370> fast<00:00:53.820> but<00:00:54.660> it's

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
how it goes it's not crazy fast but it's

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.939 
how it goes it's not crazy fast but it's
about<00:00:54.899> as<00:00:54.989> fast<00:00:55.110> as<00:00:55.350> you'd<00:00:55.469> want<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.680> go<00:00:55.800> on

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
about as fast as you'd want to go on

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.610 
about as fast as you'd want to go on
anything<00:00:56.280> without<00:00:56.399> brakes<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:57.629> probably<00:00:58.140> does

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
anything without brakes it probably does

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.260 
anything without brakes it probably does
about<00:00:58.859> 15<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.340> 20<00:00:59.550> miles<00:00:59.670> an<00:00:59.820> hour<00:00:59.910> through<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
about 15 to 20 miles an hour through the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.840 
about 15 to 20 miles an hour through the
grass<00:01:00.739> it's<00:01:01.739> really<00:01:01.949> good<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.219> driveways<00:01:02.460> but

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
grass it's really good on driveways but

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.070 
grass it's really good on driveways but
if<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.030> weight<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.449> thing<00:01:03.660> with<00:01:03.780> more<00:01:03.989> than

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
if you weight this thing with more than

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.840 
if you weight this thing with more than
like<00:01:04.229> 150<00:01:04.769> pounds<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.159> bogs<00:01:05.339> down<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.610> lot

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
like 150 pounds of bogs down a lot

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.219 
like 150 pounds of bogs down a lot
because<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.180> frame<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.479> pretty<00:01:06.600> heavy<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.140> it

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
because the frame is pretty heavy and it

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.250 
because the frame is pretty heavy and it
is<00:01:07.260> only<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.710> little<00:01:07.860> 43<00:01:08.369> cc<00:01:08.760> engine<00:01:08.930> so<00:01:09.930> chances

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
is only a little 43 cc engine so chances

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.510 
is only a little 43 cc engine so chances
are<00:01:10.409> I'll<00:01:10.560> probably<00:01:10.770> end<00:01:10.950> up<00:01:11.070> selling<00:01:11.430> this

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
are I'll probably end up selling this

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.510 
are I'll probably end up selling this
thing<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:12.270> someone<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.229> their<00:01:14.159> kid<00:01:14.369> will

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
thing to someone and their kid will

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.219 
thing to someone and their kid will
probably<00:01:14.549> love<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.270> if<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.810> had<00:01:15.990> somebody

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
probably love it if you had somebody

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.210 
probably love it if you had somebody
that<00:01:16.470> was<00:01:16.590> less<00:01:16.740> than<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.920> hundred<00:01:17.130> pounds

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
that was less than a hundred pounds

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.649 
that was less than a hundred pounds
riding<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.700> thing<00:01:17.759> around<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.240> driveway

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
riding this thing around in a driveway

00:01:18.659 --> 00:04:00.030 
riding this thing around in a driveway
or<00:01:18.840> dirt<00:01:19.020> road<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.500> would<00:01:19.590> be<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> blast

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.729 

as<00:04:01.040> you<00:04:01.219> can<00:04:01.310> see<00:04:01.519> works<00:04:02.209> pretty<00:04:02.390> good

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
as you can see works pretty good

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.369 
as you can see works pretty good
everything<00:04:03.739> functions<00:04:04.159> as<00:04:04.280> it<00:04:04.400> should<00:04:05.379> it's

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
everything functions as it should it's

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.110 
everything functions as it should it's
pretty<00:04:06.620> fun<00:04:06.769> to<00:04:06.799> ride<00:04:07.069> it's<00:04:07.400> not<00:04:07.549> super<00:04:07.879> fast

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
pretty fun to ride it's not super fast

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.000 
pretty fun to ride it's not super fast
and<00:04:08.450> if<00:04:08.659> I<00:04:08.780> wait<00:04:08.959> anymore<00:04:09.260> probably<00:04:09.799> wouldn't

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
and if I wait anymore probably wouldn't

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.709 
and if I wait anymore probably wouldn't
be<00:04:10.069> nearly<00:04:10.280> as<00:04:10.459> fun<00:04:10.730> but<00:04:10.760> tops<00:04:11.359> out<00:04:11.540> around

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:11.719 
be nearly as fun but tops out around

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:15.309 
be nearly as fun but tops out around
15-20<00:04:12.379> miles<00:04:12.530> an<00:04:12.709> hour<00:04:13.269> so<00:04:14.269> you<00:04:14.870> know<00:04:14.989> brakes

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
15-20 miles an hour so you know brakes

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:16.930 
15-20 miles an hour so you know brakes
are<00:04:15.499> probably<00:04:15.829> optional<00:04:16.370> it<00:04:16.549> just<00:04:16.699> makes<00:04:16.849> you

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
are probably optional it just makes you

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.879 
are probably optional it just makes you
a<00:04:17.000> better<00:04:17.120> driver<00:04:17.509> but<00:04:18.440> I'm<00:04:18.530> probably<00:04:18.650> going

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
a better driver but I'm probably going
