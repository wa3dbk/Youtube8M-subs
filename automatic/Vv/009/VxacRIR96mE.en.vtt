00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.750
 hi hello youtube friends in this 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:06.939
 video will teach them how to load 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.880
 your p esp without the need of your charger 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:12.670
 since there are some there are some 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.590
 that do not have a charger and so in this 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.650
 video I will bring you on how to load it 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.390
 no need for your good charger if you 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.920
 would like to stay if you would like to charge 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.900
 your psp 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.320
 without the help of the original charger you 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.990
 I recommend watching this video 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.880
 good as I told you what 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.009
 first that they have to have is all the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.160
 material that I just finished that I just 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.480
 say right now this first thing 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.649
 will have to do is take the usb cable 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.649
 what will this be 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.190
 that will be this and many the half for 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.540
 removing one of these two cables will be a 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.250
 one black and one red good first thing the 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.410
 next step that they will have to do is 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.739
 hit it here to dry a 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.840
 little copper here, that's what 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.000
 they will have to be with the two with the two 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.040
 cables with red and black and then 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.800
 also also for the team removed the 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.530
 usb cable to be able to be for 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.930
 to be able to open the cables well 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.070
 second thing that they will have to do is 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.250
 connect your psp good 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.070
 here as you will see we take the pcpe and 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.630
 we take the black wire to the black wire 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.600
 when the throat that has been removed 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.030
 a little bit of this only isolated what 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.060
 they roll like that and they do it and they do it 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.360
 can form a u as they will see 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.050
 here 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.670
 well take it take your psp and put it in 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.200
 the front 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.299
 and you put the usb cable 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.329
 what is the part where the winds go 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:50.149
 Well, they put it in there and once it's 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:52.520
 been connected there take the red wire 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.189
 and they do the same thing that they roll it up and 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.750
 they make it in the shape of a and they put it where 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.750
 they go to the charger entrance 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.550
 well here with the wiki I'm going to connect the 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.550
 charger 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.560
 and we connect it to the light 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.300
 well here it does not connect very well 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.209
 good cables with the connect very well 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.709
 but I assure you that it will work 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:33.590
 100% as good only because they 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.050
