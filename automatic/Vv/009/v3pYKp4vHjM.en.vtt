00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
the parrot ar.drone first of all it's

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.170 
the parrot ar.drone first of all it's
super<00:01:00.230> lightweight<00:01:00.440> it's<00:01:01.219> mostly<00:01:01.730> this<00:01:01.879> foam

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
super lightweight it's mostly this foam

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.509 
super lightweight it's mostly this foam
shell<00:01:02.539> and<00:01:02.840> you<00:01:03.410> can<00:01:03.559> actually<00:01:03.739> take<00:01:04.190> this

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
shell and you can actually take this

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.460 
shell and you can actually take this
foam<00:01:04.820> shell<00:01:05.119> off<00:01:05.330> and<00:01:05.630> fly<00:01:05.840> it<00:01:05.900> with<00:01:06.080> a<00:01:06.110> smaller

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
foam shell off and fly it with a smaller

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.940 
foam shell off and fly it with a smaller
shell<00:01:06.799> it<00:01:07.520> has<00:01:07.549> two<00:01:08.180> cameras<00:01:08.869> built-in<00:01:09.320> it<00:01:09.920> has

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
shell it has two cameras built-in it has

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.340 
shell it has two cameras built-in it has
a<00:01:10.580> forward-looking<00:01:11.000> camera<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:11.869> a<00:01:11.960> camera<00:01:12.260> on

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
a forward-looking camera and a camera on

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.060 
a forward-looking camera and a camera on
the<00:01:12.439> bottom<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:13.420> that<00:01:14.420> doesn't<00:01:15.409> have<00:01:15.590> it<00:01:15.860> has

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
the bottom and that doesn't have it has

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.469 
the bottom and that doesn't have it has
one<00:01:16.369> camera<00:01:16.729> I<00:01:16.790> guess<00:01:16.880> you<00:01:17.180> could<00:01:17.330> probably

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
one camera I guess you could probably

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.690 
one camera I guess you could probably
spend<00:01:18.200> a<00:01:18.380> lot<00:01:18.530> of<00:01:18.560> extra<00:01:18.860> money<00:01:18.890> to<00:01:19.070> get<00:01:19.280> two

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
spend a lot of extra money to get two

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.310 
spend a lot of extra money to get two
cameras<00:01:20.119> maybe<00:01:20.330> you<00:01:20.570> don't<00:01:20.720> eat<00:01:20.840> two<00:01:20.990> cameras

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
cameras maybe you don't eat two cameras

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.960 
cameras maybe you don't eat two cameras
because<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:22.130> camera<00:01:22.430> is<00:01:22.549> remote

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
because the camera is remote

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.580 
because the camera is remote
controllable<00:01:23.570> you<00:01:23.810> can<00:01:23.960> pivot<00:01:24.140> it<00:01:24.290> and<00:01:24.439> turn

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
controllable you can pivot it and turn

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.990 
controllable you can pivot it and turn
it<00:01:24.619> with<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:24.950> push<00:01:25.100> of<00:01:25.220> a<00:01:25.310> button<00:01:25.340> I<00:01:25.700> can<00:01:25.759> go

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
it with the push of a button I can go

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.670 
it with the push of a button I can go
from<00:01:26.210> straight<00:01:26.630> ahead<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:27.170> straight<00:01:27.439> down

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
from straight ahead to straight down

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.120 
from straight ahead to straight down
also<00:01:28.009> this<00:01:28.700> thing<00:01:28.970> is<00:01:29.479> extremely<00:01:30.130> resilient

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
also this thing is extremely resilient

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.670 
also this thing is extremely resilient
the<00:01:31.579> foam<00:01:31.790> is<00:01:31.970> easily<00:01:32.390> repairable<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:33.259> if<00:01:33.590> you

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
the foam is easily repairable and if you

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.859 
the foam is easily repairable and if you
run<00:01:33.860> into<00:01:34.159> something<00:01:34.400> it's<00:01:35.210> not<00:01:35.479> gonna<00:01:35.630> get

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
run into something it's not gonna get

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.749 
run into something it's not gonna get
damaged<00:01:36.350> probably<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.250> most<00:01:37.369> interesting

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
damaged probably the most interesting

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.550 
damaged probably the most interesting
thing<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.360> thing<00:01:38.540> that's<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:38.810> most<00:01:38.930> fun

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
thing the thing that's the most fun

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.710 
thing the thing that's the most fun
