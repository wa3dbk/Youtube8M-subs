00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.160 
stoll actually has the best faceoffs of
any<00:01:00.910> player<00:01:01.149> and<00:01:01.180> it's<00:01:01.449> been<00:01:01.570> continued<00:01:02.020> like

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
any player and it's been continued like

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.479 
any player and it's been continued like
that<00:01:02.199> but<00:01:02.440> his<00:01:02.530> face<00:01:02.680> all<00:01:02.890> saw<00:01:03.010> everything<00:01:03.160> 90
