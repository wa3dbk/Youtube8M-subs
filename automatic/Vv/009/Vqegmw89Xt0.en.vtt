00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
think that's right i think for

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.340 
think that's right i think for
democratic<00:02:22.150> partisans<00:02:22.600> that's<00:02:22.840> why<00:02:23.080> i<00:02:23.110> mean<00:02:23.320> i

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
democratic partisans that's why i mean i

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.110 
democratic partisans that's why i mean i
think<00:02:23.470> you<00:02:23.950> know<00:02:23.980> your<00:02:24.070> first<00:02:24.790> questions

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
really asked me sort of befuddle that i

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.030 
really asked me sort of befuddle that i
don't<00:02:28.150> know<00:02:28.390> why<00:02:28.630> people<00:02:28.660> don't<00:02:29.500> cover<00:02:29.770> this<00:02:29.980> i

don't know why people don't cover this i

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.500 
don't know why people don't cover this i
mean<00:02:30.160> i<00:02:30.310> have<00:02:30.460> a<00:02:30.490> theory<00:02:30.910> if<00:02:31.000> you<00:02:31.120> go<00:02:31.240> back<00:02:31.450> to

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
mean i have a theory if you go back to

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.960 
mean i have a theory if you go back to
the<00:02:31.990> time<00:02:32.620> right<00:02:33.220> after<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.670> Benghazi

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
the time right after the Benghazi

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.700 
the time right after the Benghazi

attacks happened in the media decided in

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.020 
attacks happened in the media decided in
fact<00:02:36.010> we're<00:02:36.280> not<00:02:36.460> going<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.700> cover<00:02:36.820> this

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
fact we're not going to cover this

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.150

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
because we're in the middle middle of a

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.800 
because we're in the middle middle of a
political<00:02:39.480> environment<00:02:40.480> this<00:02:40.630> is<00:02:40.690> a

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
judgment that the story is not important

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.110 
judgment that the story is not important
at<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.540> time<00:02:53.250> covering<00:02:54.250> it<00:02:54.340> later<00:02:54.580> covering

at that time covering it later covering
it<00:02:55.209> now<00:02:55.390> suggests<00:02:56.200> that<00:02:56.290> you<00:02:56.470> were<00:02:56.590> wrong<00:02:56.830> in
