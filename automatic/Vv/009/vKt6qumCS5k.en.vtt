shop<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.539> looked<00:00:19.020> around<00:00:19.109> for<00:00:19.289> a

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
shop I looked around for a

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.630 
shop I looked around for a
behind-the-scenes<00:00:19.710> video<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.430> couldn't

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
behind-the-scenes video and I couldn't

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.849 
behind-the-scenes video and I couldn't
find<00:00:20.880> one<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.750> decided<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.410> go<00:00:22.500> about<00:00:22.650> at<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
find one so I decided to go about at the

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.259 
find one so I decided to go about at the
good<00:00:22.980> old<00:00:23.070> fashioned<00:00:23.430> way<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.760> just<00:00:23.789> really

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
good old fashioned way and I just really

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.060 
good old fashioned way and I just really
studied<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.600> photo<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.769> came<00:00:25.920> up<00:00:26.010> with

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
studied the photo and I came up with

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.529 
studied the photo and I came up with
this<00:00:26.310> lighting<00:00:26.550> solution<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.269> think<00:00:27.449> is

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
this lighting solution that I think is

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.419 
this lighting solution that I think is
very<00:00:27.720> similar<00:00:27.990> for<00:00:28.380> our<00:00:28.890> photo<00:00:29.070> shoot<00:00:29.160> with

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
very similar for our photo shoot with

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
coming from the front to give big open

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.860 
coming from the front to give big open

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
lighting

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.690 
lighting
but<00:00:34.200> we<00:00:34.559> have<00:00:34.680> black<00:00:34.920> cards<00:00:35.250> on<00:00:35.370> either<00:00:35.460> side

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
but we have black cards on either side

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.920 
but we have black cards on either side
of<00:00:35.730> her<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.120> give<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.270> little<00:00:36.540> bit<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.750> shadow

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
of her to give a little bit of shadow

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.420 
of her to give a little bit of shadow
under<00:00:37.290> her<00:00:37.350> chin<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.680> give<00:00:37.770> some<00:00:37.890> shape<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.129> it

schmira soft boxes they're both plugged

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.670 
schmira soft boxes they're both plugged

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
into a Profoto acute pack and they're

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.350 
into a Profoto acute pack and they're
powered<00:00:47.039> equally<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:47.910> just<00:00:48.030> giving<00:00:48.300> a

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
powered equally this is just giving a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.209 
powered equally this is just giving a
blast<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.840> light<00:00:48.870> across<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.289> front<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.829> have

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
blast of light across the front I have

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.889 
blast of light across the front I have
it<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.520> know<00:00:50.610> above<00:00:50.969> her<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.420> get<00:00:51.660> shadow

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
it you know above her so I get shadow

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.420 
it you know above her so I get shadow
under<00:00:52.140> her<00:00:52.230> chin<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.620> add<00:00:52.710> definition<00:00:52.890> and

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
under her chin to add definition and

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.850 
under her chin to add definition and
coming<00:00:54.090> straight<00:00:54.329> at<00:00:54.390> her<00:00:54.629> now<00:00:55.440> because<00:00:55.559> of

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
coming straight at her now because of

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.799 
coming straight at her now because of
the<00:00:55.980> distance<00:00:56.370> from<00:00:56.610> my<00:00:56.850> my<00:00:57.239> lights<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.690> my

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
the distance from my my lights to my

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.569 
the distance from my my lights to my
subject<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.320> my<00:00:58.440> subject<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.980> wall<00:00:59.160> I'm

subject and my subject to the wall I'm
getting<00:00:59.969> nice<00:01:00.120> fall-off<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.750> my<00:01:00.899> white<00:01:01.140> wall

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
getting nice fall-off so my white wall

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.540 
getting nice fall-off so my white wall
is<00:01:01.440> turning<00:01:01.770> gray<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.250> don't<00:01:02.370> have<00:01:02.430> to

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
is turning gray so I don't have to

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.590 
is turning gray so I don't have to
bother<00:01:02.730> with<00:01:02.850> lighting<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.239> background

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
bother with lighting the background

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.630 
bother with lighting the background
because<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.870> want<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.110> gray<00:01:04.260> background<00:01:04.640> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
because I want a gray background the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.100 
because I want a gray background the
other<00:01:05.880> thing<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.180> added<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.659> just<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:06.990> kind

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
other thing I added to this just to kind

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.539 
other thing I added to this just to kind
of<00:01:07.229> fill<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.560> more<00:01:07.799> because<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.070> noticed<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.520> in

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
of fill in more because I noticed it in

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.280 
of fill in more because I noticed it in
the<00:01:08.640> original<00:01:09.030> shot<00:01:09.240> she<00:01:09.720> had<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> lot<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.049> feel

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
the original shot she had a lot of feel

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.929 
the original shot she had a lot of feel
light<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.590> her<00:01:10.650> face<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.040> think<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.340> was<00:01:11.460> from<00:01:11.729> a

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
light in her face I think it was from a

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.280 
light in her face I think it was from a
big<00:01:12.119> open<00:01:12.420> daylight<00:01:12.689> studio

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
big open daylight studio

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.690 
big open daylight studio
unfortunately<00:01:14.010> my<00:01:14.159> windows<00:01:14.430> are<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
unfortunately my windows are on the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.039 
unfortunately my windows are on the
wrong<00:01:14.850> side<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.240> studio<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.720> get<00:01:15.840> that

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
wrong side of the studio to get that

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.980 
wrong side of the studio to get that
look<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.710> added<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.250> Profoto<00:01:17.580> b1<00:01:17.880> back<00:01:18.689> here

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
look so I added the Profoto b1 back here

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.990 
look so I added the Profoto b1 back here
I'm<00:01:19.470> just<00:01:19.590> bouncing<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.100> into<00:01:20.400> foam<00:01:20.700> core

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
I'm just bouncing this into foam core

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.340 
I'm just bouncing this into foam core
and<00:01:21.270> it's<00:01:21.570> not<00:01:21.720> really<00:01:21.960> changing<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
and it's not really changing the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.200 
and it's not really changing the
exposure<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:23.070> just<00:01:23.310> giving<00:01:23.580> more<00:01:23.850> light<00:01:24.090> in

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
plugged into my Mac over here and Dave's

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.080

working<00:01:41.009> capture<00:01:41.400> one<00:01:41.520> software

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
working capture one software

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.760 
working capture one software
so<00:01:42.240> we've<00:01:42.750> already<00:01:42.930> tweaked<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.350> color<00:01:43.560> and

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
so we've already tweaked the color and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.410 
so we've already tweaked the color and
stuff<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.100> get<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.340> close<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.700> where<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.030> want<00:01:45.270> to

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
stuff to get it close to where I want to

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.880 
stuff to get it close to where I want to
be<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.110> remember<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.409> I'm<00:01:46.530> shooting<00:01:46.770> in

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
be but I remember that I'm shooting in

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.499 
be but I remember that I'm shooting in
RAW<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.490> when<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.729> get<00:01:47.790> into<00:01:48.000> Photoshop<00:01:48.360> I'm

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
RAW so when I get into Photoshop I'm

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.730 
RAW so when I get into Photoshop I'm
actually<00:01:48.630> gonna<00:01:48.869> do<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.140> for<00:01:49.290> real<00:01:49.470> but<00:01:49.649> this

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
actually gonna do it for real but this

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.580 
actually gonna do it for real but this
gives<00:01:49.950> me<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> good<00:01:50.399> starting<00:01:50.759> point<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.750> the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
gives me a good starting point so the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.289 
gives me a good starting point so the
other<00:01:52.740> change<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.250> made<00:01:53.430> was<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:54.000> took

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
other change I made was that I took

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.480 
other change I made was that I took
photos<00:01:54.509> in<00:01:55.350> all<00:01:55.500> different<00:01:55.649> directions<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.369> I

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
photos in all different directions and I

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.030 
photos in all different directions and I
think<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.820> Beca<00:01:56.969> looks<00:01:57.210> better<00:01:57.360> looking<00:01:58.079> to

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
think that Beca looks better looking to

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.370 
think that Beca looks better looking to
the<00:01:59.130> right<00:01:59.420> versus<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.659> left<00:02:00.840> like<00:02:01.259> the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
the right versus to the left like the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.690 
the right versus to the left like the
original<00:02:01.740> photo<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.070> we're<00:02:02.189> gonna<00:02:02.280> work<00:02:02.520> her

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
original photo so we're gonna work her

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.160 
original photo so we're gonna work her
in<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:02.880> direction<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.750> beauty<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:03.990> this

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
in that direction and the beauty of this

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.630 
in that direction and the beauty of this
kind<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.560> light<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.159> works<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.490> all

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
kind of light is that it works in all

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.950 
kind of light is that it works in all
directions<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.210> can<00:02:06.299> move<00:02:06.450> around<00:02:06.600> and

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
directions so you can move around and

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.779 
directions so you can move around and
she'll<00:02:07.290> be<00:02:07.409> lit<00:02:07.619> evenly<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.190> every<00:02:08.640> direction

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
she'll be lit evenly in every direction

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:25.410 
she'll be lit evenly in every direction
so<00:02:09.360> let's<00:02:09.509> shoot<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.660> few

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.820 

so<00:02:26.420> I<00:02:26.450> love<00:02:26.690> to<00:02:26.810> find<00:02:26.990> inspiration<00:02:27.320> in<00:02:27.710> other
