00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.710
 about his first skill that is it 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.200
 that's about the rise in short it is called 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.210
 telekinesis everyone knows him everyone knows that 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.890
 he got to know how he acts but how 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.080
 few hands would know how and with the help of it 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.329
 drag on the highground ie xx 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.219
 in fact it is very very easy but 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.980
 the majority admits a huge 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.839
 amount of error for example you go both 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.910
 the crown, that is, two dudes, that is, 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:44.579
 this buzz stands and waits for thunder Rubik 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.359

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.359

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.800

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.210
 lift and then take and leads 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.610
 by xg 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.210
 that is, how would they get this blue 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.739
 ucoz they seem to suggest exactly 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.540
 Highground I do not want to 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.700
 surface but it is wrong just 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.200
 that's wrong and how to do 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.360
 right now I'll show you how to do 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.360
 real men real sell or 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:20.240
 need to go to the dude like to click on 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.409
 him and transfer come in and then you for sure 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.600
 teleport 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.119
 any character on a highground 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.880
 that is, it is necessary to press without finding 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.939
 and it is necessary to press for hg I think you 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.770
 understand me let's try an example 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.990
 why did you here choked dude let's 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.270
 do it here that is we raise 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.090
 and omit it for hg 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.890
 all we have at the moment is a ghoul or 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.319
 any of your character is on 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.569
 highground so this is actually 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:49.610
