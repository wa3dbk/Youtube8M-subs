00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 and then take all beauty wherever he goes has 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.060
 Welcome to show you something. 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.970
 so you're careful when it comes to 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.670
 Do you buy a car for yourself? 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.690
 because sometimes if I make a video it's 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.580
 Speaking 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.220
 not expensive has to be the most expensive car 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.680
 that the edict there you just is not talk 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.420
 You like so I better show 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.189
 something for you I touched the end of a 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.010
 mark that I will not speak a death in 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.779
 big field the expectation that I will 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.000
 show when you go to buy 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:47.730
 a car you do that followed 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:50.300
 directly on the uplink switch from ap 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.300
 car 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:13.789
 the car is causing it in the sound and he 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:15.770
 Does your sound mean what medicine? 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:21.170
 take only one case here as a reference one 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:26.950
 better cable is a nice win 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.950
 and he will not have that kind of problem 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:54.429
 around here 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.259
 saw then when it was time to buy the cable 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.429
 Take care of it today, it was not for 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.640
 you have 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.990
 I personally know two companies 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.680
 In Brazil they make the first cable is 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:25.300
 that you can buy with eye closed 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:28.780
 cause it would not stay 19 for not 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.290
 prejudice others but opt for the 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.290
 drywall 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.890
 and this 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:58.360
 so this is when focused on forehead and this 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.430
 nor the monad car there that rocks it 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.700
 knock your foot on the floor 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.120
 if the noise of playing on the loudspeaker 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.010
 did not understand published good to give 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.450
 cool cars low victory 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.670
 resistance 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.100
 you know why sometimes the cheap is expensive 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.600
 you buy a car from a simpler 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:23.170
 And there you play on your guitar is very 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.090
 100% the sign of avoiding that house 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.060
 they mean they 're kind of in the nose 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.950
 and noise and interference in a lot of 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.880
 thing and you do not understand what it is and 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:37.239
 It's the car so it's important too. 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:42.750
 make an investment in cables 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.750
 You saw the test, that 's it.
