install the sdk android sdk so what
we're<00:02:05.610> going<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.790> do<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.119> we're<00:02:06.270> going<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.450> 83

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
we're going to do is we're going to 83

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.809 
we're going to do is we're going to 83
and<00:02:08.819> then<00:02:09.000> we're<00:02:09.119> going<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.300> have<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> few<00:02:09.690> vices

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
and then we're going to have a few vices

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.910 
and then we're going to have a few vices
fast<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.780> server<00:02:12.049> on<00:02:12.230> it<00:02:12.319> and<00:02:12.499> looks<00:02:12.650> for<00:02:12.859> the

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
fast the server on it and looks for the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.640 
fast the server on it and looks for the
concepts<00:02:13.689> and<00:02:14.689> then<00:02:14.840> we<00:02:14.930> have<00:02:15.049> it<00:02:15.200> so<00:02:15.379> there's

screencasts just have a lower price

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.149 
screencasts just have a lower price
right<00:02:58.459> so<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:59.719> can<00:03:00.379> be<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.590> little<00:03:00.769> bit<00:03:00.949> slow<00:03:01.129> at

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:01.159 
right so it can be a little bit slow at

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:09.059 
right so it can be a little bit slow at
times<00:03:01.430> which<00:03:02.329> will<00:03:02.510> probably<00:03:02.719> about<00:03:02.959> this<00:03:03.139> way

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.099 

and<00:03:10.069> there<00:03:10.790> you<00:03:10.879> go<00:03:10.939> front<00:03:11.359> to<00:03:11.449> screen<00:03:11.870> right

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109
