this<00:00:00.719> video<00:00:01.020> is<00:00:01.380> on<00:00:01.429> to<00:00:02.429> Diablo<00:00:02.730> corrections

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
this video is on to Diablo corrections

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.289 
this video is on to Diablo corrections
and<00:00:04.370> there's<00:00:05.370> some<00:00:05.520> good<00:00:05.640> insights<00:00:06.000> that<00:00:06.240> I

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
and there's some good insights that I

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.110 
and there's some good insights that I
have<00:00:06.509> for<00:00:06.899> correcting<00:00:07.350> two<00:00:07.529> Diablos<00:00:08.010> when<00:00:08.970> the

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
have for correcting two Diablos when the

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.180 
have for correcting two Diablos when the
Diablo<00:00:09.510> is<00:00:09.540> coming<00:00:09.929> around<00:00:10.170> it's<00:00:10.980> usually

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
Diablo is coming around it's usually

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.970 
Diablo is coming around it's usually
coming<00:00:11.670> down<00:00:12.030> from<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.900> right<00:00:13.110> side<00:00:13.410> over<00:00:13.769> to

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
coming down from the right side over to

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.720 
coming down from the right side over to
the<00:00:14.070> left<00:00:14.280> up<00:00:14.580> then<00:00:15.269> back<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.719> right<00:00:15.870> side

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
the left up then back to the right side

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.429 
the left up then back to the right side
so<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:17.880> means<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.420> have<00:00:18.570> two<00:00:19.109> different

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
so that means you have two different

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.710 
so that means you have two different
options<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:20.100> correcting<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.730> either<00:00:21.330> on<00:00:21.600> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
options of correcting it either on the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.490 
options of correcting it either on the
bottom<00:00:21.930> or<00:00:22.320> on<00:00:22.400> the<00:00:23.400> top<00:00:23.630> now<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.689> helpful

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
bottom or on the top now the helpful

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.290 
bottom or on the top now the helpful
insight<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.039> wanted<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.369> tell<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.789> was

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
insight that I wanted to tell you was

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.099 
insight that I wanted to tell you was
pull<00:00:27.900> down<00:00:28.500> pull<00:00:28.920> down<00:00:29.849> as<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.630> Diablo<00:00:31.080> is

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
pull down pull down as the Diablo is

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.440 
pull down pull down as the Diablo is
going<00:00:31.500> around<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.430> touch<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.880> bottom<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.300> it

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
going around you touch the bottom of it

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.040 
going around you touch the bottom of it
it<00:00:33.600> pulls<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:35.040> Cup<00:00:35.370> down<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.540> touching<00:00:36.930> right

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
it pulls that Cup down so touching right

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.530 
it pulls that Cup down so touching right
here<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.380> gonna<00:00:37.500> pull<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.070> cup<00:00:38.280> down<00:00:38.540> touching

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
here is gonna pull the cup down touching

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.119 
here is gonna pull the cup down touching
right<00:00:39.660> here<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.079> going<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.260> pull<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.710> cup<00:00:40.890> down

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
right here is going to pull the cup down

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.819 
right here is going to pull the cup down
so<00:00:41.820> pulling<00:00:42.360> down<00:00:42.600> that's<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.230> key<00:00:43.410> insight

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
so pulling down that's the key insight

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.799 
so pulling down that's the key insight
to<00:00:43.980> remember<00:00:44.340> for<00:00:44.579> correcting<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.300> that's

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
to remember for correcting it and that's

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.470 
to remember for correcting it and that's
the<00:00:46.340> horizontal<00:00:47.340> correction<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.180> corrects

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
the horizontal correction that corrects

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.350 
the horizontal correction that corrects
it<00:00:48.570> horizontally<00:00:49.260> by<00:00:49.739> pulling<00:00:50.190> down<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:51.000> pull

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
it horizontally by pulling down so pull

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.900 
it horizontally by pulling down so pull
down<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.750> side<00:00:51.989> goes<00:00:52.770> down<00:00:52.800> pull<00:00:53.610> down<00:00:53.760> this

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
down this side goes down pull down this

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.610 
down this side goes down pull down this
side<00:00:54.090> tap<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.539> right<00:00:54.690> here<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.230> goes<00:00:55.410> down

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
side tap it right here and it goes down

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.310 
side tap it right here and it goes down
the<00:00:55.949> other<00:00:56.640> correction<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.660> rotational

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
the other correction is the rotational

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.119 
the other correction is the rotational
correction<00:00:58.980> now<00:00:59.820> that's<00:01:00.120> touching<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.629> on<00:01:00.750> top

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
correction now that's touching it on top

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.770 
correction now that's touching it on top
so<00:01:02.129> for<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.609> horizontal<00:01:02.969> that's<00:01:03.390> touching<00:01:03.600> it

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
so for the horizontal that's touching it

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.479 
so for the horizontal that's touching it
on<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.960> bottom<00:01:04.260> going<00:01:04.470> down<00:01:04.710> for<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.280> top

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
on the bottom going down for the top

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.560 
on the bottom going down for the top
that's<00:01:06.060> push<00:01:06.570> away<00:01:06.750> push<00:01:07.260> away<00:01:08.090> so<00:01:09.090> it's<00:01:09.450> going

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
that's push away push away so it's going

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.810 
that's push away push away so it's going
to<00:01:09.630> be<00:01:09.780> coming<00:01:10.020> down<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.560> way<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.130> here's

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
to be coming down this way and here's

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.120 
to be coming down this way and here's
the<00:01:12.000> horizontal<00:01:12.540> down<00:01:12.689> here<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.110> here's<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
the horizontal down here and here's the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.640 
the horizontal down here and here's the
rotational<00:01:14.850> correction<00:01:15.420> up<00:01:15.570> here<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.110> it's

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
rotational correction up here and it's

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.640 
rotational correction up here and it's
push<00:01:17.009> away<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:18.180> hitting<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.140> right<00:01:19.290> here<00:01:19.560> is

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
push away so hitting it right here is

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.520 
push away so hitting it right here is
going<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.830> push<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.340> cup<00:01:20.640> away<00:01:21.350> hanger<00:01:22.350> right

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
going to push this cup away hanger right

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.950 
going to push this cup away hanger right
here<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:22.890> going<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.040> push<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.460> cup<00:01:23.729> away<00:01:24.240> so

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
here is going to push this cup away so

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.620 
here is going to push this cup away so
it's<00:01:25.170> like<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:26.009> pushing<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:27.299> pulling

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
it's like the pushing and the pulling

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.630 
it's like the pushing and the pulling
both<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.020> them<00:01:28.170> are<00:01:28.259> negative<00:01:28.430> pulling<00:01:29.430> down

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
both of them are negative pulling down

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.319 
both of them are negative pulling down
and<00:01:30.140> pushing<00:01:31.140> away<00:01:31.700> so<00:01:32.700> let's<00:01:32.939> go<00:01:33.060> ahead<00:01:33.180> and

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
and pushing away so let's go ahead and

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.890 
and pushing away so let's go ahead and
get<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.619> 2<00:01:34.799> diabolos<00:01:35.100> going<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.600> wanted<00:01:36.840> to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
get the 2 diabolos going and I wanted to

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.690 
get the 2 diabolos going and I wanted to
show<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.229> one<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.100> helpful<00:01:38.400> insights

show you one of the helpful insights

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:46.760 
show you one of the helpful insights
about<00:01:38.850> acceleration<00:01:39.780> also<00:01:45.290> so<00:01:46.290> as<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.680> gets

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
about acceleration also so as it gets

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.680 
about acceleration also so as it gets
started<00:01:47.189> do<00:01:47.880> any<00:01:48.030> basic<00:01:48.479> acceleration

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.870 

to<00:01:53.260> get<00:01:53.410> one<00:01:53.590> going<00:01:53.800> it's<00:01:54.340> really<00:01:54.520> helpful<00:01:54.700> to

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
to get one going it's really helpful to

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.680 
to get one going it's really helpful to
get<00:01:54.940> it<00:01:55.060> going<00:01:55.180> good

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
get it going good

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.610 
get it going good
get<00:01:56.410> it<00:01:56.500> started<00:01:56.680> and<00:01:56.860> get<00:01:57.070> it<00:01:57.130> going<00:01:57.250> good<00:01:57.730> and

the helpful insight about the

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.640 
the helpful insight about the
acceleration<00:02:00.910> is<00:02:01.720> pushing<00:02:02.230> with<00:02:02.320> that<00:02:02.440> right

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
acceleration is pushing with that right

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.030 
acceleration is pushing with that right

let's<00:02:03.700> get<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:03.910> second<00:02:04.210> one<00:02:04.300> going<00:02:04.480> one<00:02:05.380> and

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
let's get the second one going one and

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.000 
let's get the second one going one and
then<00:02:05.890> go<00:02:06.040> around<00:02:06.630> okay<00:02:07.630> see<00:02:08.320> I'm<00:02:08.470> pushing<00:02:08.890> with

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.010 
then go around okay see I'm pushing with

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.400 
then go around okay see I'm pushing with
that<00:02:09.160> right<00:02:09.399> hand<00:02:09.670> push<00:02:10.030> push<00:02:10.420> push<00:02:10.690> push<00:02:11.080> and

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
that right hand push push push push and

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.470 
that right hand push push push push and
then<00:02:11.770> I<00:02:11.800> start<00:02:12.040> lifting<00:02:12.610> it<00:02:12.910> up<00:02:13.000> with<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.300> left

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
then I start lifting it up with the left

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.740 
then I start lifting it up with the left
push<00:02:14.110> push<00:02:14.560> push<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.220> lifting<00:02:16.120> it<00:02:16.210> up<00:02:16.300> so<00:02:16.540> if

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
push push push and lifting it up so if

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.870 
push push push and lifting it up so if
you<00:02:16.840> want<00:02:16.990> to<00:02:17.050> do<00:02:17.170> one<00:02:17.320> at<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.500> time<00:02:17.740> push<00:02:18.700> with

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
you want to do one at a time push with

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.940 
you want to do one at a time push with
that<00:02:18.910> right<00:02:19.210> hand<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.750> I<00:02:20.440> can<00:02:20.590> already<00:02:20.710> see

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
that right hand and I can already see

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.070 
that right hand and I can already see
let's<00:02:21.130> do<00:02:21.250> some<00:02:21.460> corrections<00:02:21.910> here<00:02:22.090> I<00:02:22.300> need<00:02:22.930> to

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
let's do some corrections here I need to

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.060 
let's do some corrections here I need to
push<00:02:23.320> the<00:02:23.620> yellow<00:02:23.800> cup<00:02:24.130> away<00:02:24.400> I<00:02:25.740> need<00:02:26.740> to<00:02:26.830> pull

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
push the yellow cup away I need to pull

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.040 
push the yellow cup away I need to pull
the<00:02:27.250> yellow<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.790> orange<00:02:28.000> cup<00:02:28.420> down<00:02:28.660> that's

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
the yellow the orange cup down that's

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.760 
the yellow the orange cup down that's
closest<00:02:29.410> to<00:02:29.440> me<00:02:31.050> push<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.200> yellow<00:02:32.320> cup<00:02:32.590> away

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
closest to me push the yellow cup away

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.980 
closest to me push the yellow cup away
and<00:02:36.090> these<00:02:37.090> are<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.390> corrections<00:02:37.840> that<00:02:37.960> I

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
and these are the corrections that I

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.960 
and these are the corrections that I
want<00:02:38.140> been<00:02:38.260> doing<00:02:38.530> for<00:02:38.710> a<00:02:38.740> while<00:02:41.640> get<00:02:42.640> it<00:02:42.760> going

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
want been doing for a while get it going

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.530 
want been doing for a while get it going
again<00:02:43.060> now<00:02:44.880> that's<00:02:45.880> one<00:02:46.030> of<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.210> good<00:02:46.360> things

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
again now that's one of the good things

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.260 
again now that's one of the good things
about<00:02:46.690> this<00:02:46.930> acceleration<00:02:47.590> too<00:02:47.980> is<00:02:48.880> that<00:02:49.120> with

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
about this acceleration too is that with

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.390 
about this acceleration too is that with
this<00:02:49.420> method<00:02:49.840> we're<00:02:50.590> gonna<00:02:50.740> start<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.250> by

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
this method we're gonna start it by

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.500 
this method we're gonna start it by
cupping<00:02:51.850> on<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.480> outside<00:02:52.870> go<00:02:53.650> around<00:02:54.300> loop<00:02:55.300> it

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
cupping on the outside go around loop it

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.900 
cupping on the outside go around loop it
and<00:02:55.600> then<00:02:55.960> just<00:02:56.140> one<00:02:56.320> time<00:02:56.590> one<00:02:57.340> time<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.820> then

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
and then just one time one time and then

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.680 
and then just one time one time and then
move<00:02:58.180> back<00:02:58.209> into<00:02:58.660> it<00:02:58.780> a<00:03:00.120> little<00:03:01.120> bit<00:03:01.239> of<00:03:01.390> a<00:03:01.480> knot

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
move back into it a little bit of a knot

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.210 
move back into it a little bit of a knot
right<00:03:01.930> here<00:03:02.230> that's<00:03:02.560> what<00:03:02.680> I<00:03:02.739> got<00:03:02.920> caught<00:03:03.190> on

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
right here that's what I got caught on

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.090 
right here that's what I got caught on
it's<00:03:03.790> always<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.060> reason<00:03:04.510> for<00:03:04.630> something<00:03:05.020> if<00:03:05.920> it

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
it's always a reason for something if it

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.710 
it's always a reason for something if it
falls<00:03:06.810> it's<00:03:07.810> not<00:03:07.989> just<00:03:08.200> chaos<00:03:08.530> for<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.100> reason

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
falls it's not just chaos for a reason

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.140 
falls it's not just chaos for a reason
here<00:03:10.720> we<00:03:10.810> go<00:03:10.959> go<00:03:11.410> in<00:03:11.560> again<00:03:12.150> basic

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
here we go go in again basic

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.630 
here we go go in again basic
acceleration<00:03:13.870> cup<00:03:14.860> it<00:03:14.980> from<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.250> outside

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
acceleration cup it from the outside

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.810 
acceleration cup it from the outside
move<00:03:16.360> around<00:03:16.630> in<00:03:16.930> it<00:03:17.310> just<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.400> hand<00:03:18.640> get

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
move around in it just the hand get

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.990 
move around in it just the hand get
started<00:03:19.150> one<00:03:19.330> time<00:03:19.570> and<00:03:19.930> then<00:03:20.050> around<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:21.190> one

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
started one time and then around and one

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.030 
started one time and then around and one
time<00:03:22.269> seems<00:03:22.600> to<00:03:22.630> be<00:03:22.780> good<00:03:22.930> enough<00:03:23.200> getting<00:03:23.830> it

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
time seems to be good enough getting it

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.220 
time seems to be good enough getting it
started<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:24.489> then<00:03:24.970> one<00:03:25.239> little<00:03:25.420> acceleration

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
started and then one little acceleration

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.680 
started and then one little acceleration
does<00:03:26.890> really<00:03:27.130> help<00:03:27.280> likes<00:03:27.550> to<00:03:27.760> throw<00:03:27.940> in<00:03:28.209> to

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
does really help likes to throw in to

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.870 
does really help likes to throw in to
the<00:03:28.810> acceleration<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.459> shuffle<00:03:30.820> it

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
the acceleration to the shuffle it

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.540 
the acceleration to the shuffle it
sculpt<00:03:31.180> and<00:03:31.840> it<00:03:32.620> doesn't<00:03:32.920> get<00:03:32.980> spinning<00:03:33.310> fast

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
sculpt and it doesn't get spinning fast

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.430 
sculpt and it doesn't get spinning fast
enough<00:03:33.700> by<00:03:34.600> getting<00:03:34.870> it<00:03:34.959> started<00:03:35.110> on<00:03:35.350> the

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
enough by getting it started on the

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.840 
enough by getting it started on the
string<00:03:35.680> it<00:03:35.709> does<00:03:36.010> get<00:03:36.190> spinning<00:03:36.519> fast<00:03:36.730> enough

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
string it does get spinning fast enough

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.550 
string it does get spinning fast enough
okay<00:03:37.360> so<00:03:37.840> we're<00:03:37.959> gonna<00:03:38.050> go<00:03:38.230> ahead<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.440> do

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
okay so we're gonna go ahead and do

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.979 
okay so we're gonna go ahead and do
those<00:03:38.680> corrections<00:03:39.160> again<00:03:39.400> yellow<00:03:40.120> bar<00:03:40.720> side

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
those corrections again yellow bar side

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.400 
those corrections again yellow bar side
down<00:03:42.420> maybe<00:03:43.420> you<00:03:43.570> can<00:03:43.690> come<00:03:43.840> over<00:03:43.870> on<00:03:44.110> the<00:03:44.200> side

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
down maybe you can come over on the side

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:51.500 
down maybe you can come over on the side
and<00:03:44.560> take<00:03:44.650> a<00:03:44.709> look<00:03:44.950> go<00:03:45.850> ahead<00:03:46.000> and<00:03:46.090> do<00:03:46.150> that

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.820 

we<00:03:52.510> go<00:03:55.020> we're<00:03:56.020> gonna<00:03:56.110> go<00:03:56.320> ahead<00:03:56.410> and<00:03:56.650> correct

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
we go we're gonna go ahead and correct

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.500 
we go we're gonna go ahead and correct
that<00:03:57.010> yellow<00:03:57.220> cup<00:03:58.170> there<00:03:59.170> we<00:03:59.290> go

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
that yellow cup there we go

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.760 
that yellow cup there we go
and<00:04:01.510> one<00:04:01.780> of<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:01.930> things<00:04:02.110> I've<00:04:02.290> noticed<00:04:02.440> is<00:04:02.650> I

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
and one of the things I've noticed is I

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.350 
and one of the things I've noticed is I
like<00:04:02.980> correcting<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.490> ones<00:04:03.670> that<00:04:03.880> the<00:04:04.120> cup

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
like correcting the ones that the cup

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.660 
like correcting the ones that the cup
that's<00:04:04.600> closest<00:04:05.170> to<00:04:05.290> me<00:04:05.500> it<00:04:05.920> seems<00:04:06.220> to<00:04:06.400> knock

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
that's closest to me it seems to knock

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.730 
that's closest to me it seems to knock
it<00:04:06.910> back<00:04:07.240> in<00:04:07.780> place<00:04:08.080> a<00:04:08.110> little<00:04:08.260> bit<00:04:08.440> easier

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
it back in place a little bit easier

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.590 
it back in place a little bit easier
when<00:04:09.580> you're<00:04:09.700> doing<00:04:09.970> it<00:04:10.090> learning<00:04:10.510> the

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
when you're doing it learning the

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.930 
when you're doing it learning the
corrections<00:04:11.080> how<00:04:11.710> light<00:04:12.100> to<00:04:12.340> do<00:04:12.490> it<00:04:12.640> how<00:04:12.910> hard

corrections how light to do it how hard
to<00:04:13.300> do<00:04:13.420> it<00:04:13.570> is<00:04:14.230> something<00:04:14.530> that<00:04:14.620> takes

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
to do it is something that takes

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.740 
to do it is something that takes
practice<00:04:15.430> and<00:04:15.700> you'll<00:04:16.269> just<00:04:16.420> need<00:04:16.540> to<00:04:16.600> get

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
practice and you'll just need to get

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.199 
practice and you'll just need to get
used<00:04:16.930> to<00:04:17.019> it<00:04:17.200> we're<00:04:17.620> gonna<00:04:17.680> go<00:04:17.920> ahead<00:04:18.010> and

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
used to it we're gonna go ahead and

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:28.600 
used to it we're gonna go ahead and
bring<00:04:19.209> that<00:04:19.269> far<00:04:19.600> cup<00:04:19.810> down

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.490 

and<00:04:29.120> here<00:04:29.330> it<00:04:29.389> is<00:04:29.479> that<00:04:29.689> right<00:04:29.930> stick<00:04:30.229> again

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
and here it is that right stick again

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.740 
and here it is that right stick again
and<00:04:30.860> then<00:04:31.849> I<00:04:31.879> start<00:04:32.120> looping<00:04:32.270> it<00:04:32.479> with<00:04:32.599> the

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
and then I start looping it with the

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.540 
and then I start looping it with the
left<00:04:32.960> and<00:04:33.530> that's<00:04:33.680> a<00:04:33.800> good<00:04:33.949> way<00:04:34.099> to<00:04:34.159> get<00:04:34.430> it

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
left and that's a good way to get it

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.899 
left and that's a good way to get it
going<00:04:36.159> to<00:04:37.159> learn<00:04:37.340> how<00:04:37.490> to<00:04:37.520> do<00:04:37.729> that

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:37.909 
going to learn how to do that

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:39.749 
going to learn how to do that
acceleration<00:04:38.479> you<00:04:38.689> can<00:04:38.719> get<00:04:38.900> it<00:04:38.990> going<00:04:39.020> faster

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 
acceleration you can get it going faster

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:43.330 
acceleration you can get it going faster
right<00:04:40.759> stick<00:04:41.409> you<00:04:42.409> can<00:04:42.469> do<00:04:42.650> it<00:04:42.770> with<00:04:42.919> both<00:04:43.099> they

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
right stick you can do it with both they

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.240 
right stick you can do it with both they
say<00:04:43.960> that<00:04:44.960> up<00:04:45.500> and<00:04:45.680> down<00:04:45.800> at<00:04:46.490> the<00:04:46.520> same<00:04:46.819> time

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
say that up and down at the same time

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.070 
say that up and down at the same time
that<00:04:49.250> seem<00:04:49.430> to<00:04:49.520> get<00:04:49.580> close<00:04:49.879> so<00:04:50.180> what<00:04:50.780> I<00:04:50.810> like<00:04:51.020> to

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
that seem to get close so what I like to

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.540 
that seem to get close so what I like to
do<00:04:51.289> is<00:04:51.409> just<00:04:51.439> focus<00:04:51.860> on<00:04:51.979> that<00:04:52.009> right<00:04:52.219> stick

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
do is just focus on that right stick

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.459 
do is just focus on that right stick
first<00:04:52.789> then<00:04:53.419> start<00:04:53.659> pushing<00:04:54.080> it<00:04:54.289> with<00:04:54.349> the

00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:54.469 
first then start pushing it with the

00:04:54.469 --> 00:05:03.330 
first then start pushing it with the
left<00:04:58.060> so<00:04:59.060> remember<00:04:59.419> about<00:04:59.599> those<00:04:59.750> Corrections

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:12.300 

being<00:05:06.370> pull<00:05:07.370> down<00:05:07.610> pull<00:05:08.379> down<00:05:09.379> and<00:05:10.360> push<00:05:11.360> away

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
being pull down pull down and push away

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.510 
being pull down pull down and push away
okay

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
okay

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.189 
okay
good<00:05:13.789> luck<00:05:13.940> with<00:05:14.060> that<00:05:14.090> to<00:05:14.389> Diablo<00:05:14.659> it's<00:05:14.990> a<00:05:15.050> lot

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 
good luck with that to Diablo it's a lot

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.320 
good luck with that to Diablo it's a lot
of<00:05:15.229> fun<00:05:15.500> and<00:05:15.770> if<00:05:16.639> you<00:05:16.729> want<00:05:16.940> to<00:05:17.030> you<00:05:17.120> can<00:05:17.240> use

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
of fun and if you want to you can use

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.659 
of fun and if you want to you can use
the<00:05:17.479> same<00:05:17.770> principles<00:05:18.770> I'm<00:05:19.190> going<00:05:19.520> the<00:05:19.639> other

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
the same principles I'm going the other

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.659 
the same principles I'm going the other
direction<00:05:19.849> so<00:05:20.710> I<00:05:21.710> go<00:05:22.219> ahead<00:05:22.400> and<00:05:22.490> try<00:05:22.610> the

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
direction so I go ahead and try the

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:23.980 
direction so I go ahead and try the
other<00:05:22.759> direction<00:05:22.909> if<00:05:23.479> your<00:05:23.659> arm<00:05:23.750> gets<00:05:23.930> tired

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
other direction if your arm gets tired

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.409 
other direction if your arm gets tired
and<00:05:24.710> to<00:05:24.949> keep<00:05:25.099> everything<00:05:25.250> balanced<00:05:26.029> I<00:05:26.180> like

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
and to keep everything balanced I like

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.040 
and to keep everything balanced I like
to<00:05:26.539> do<00:05:26.629> it<00:05:26.750> also<00:05:26.870> and<00:05:28.000> it<00:05:29.000> helps<00:05:29.300> to<00:05:29.360> refine<00:05:29.810> the

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
to do it also and it helps to refine the

to do it also and it helps to refine the
principles<00:05:30.560> of<00:05:30.889> how<00:05:31.490> to<00:05:31.550> keep<00:05:31.729> things<00:05:32.000> the
