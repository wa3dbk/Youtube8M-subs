yourself guitar repair and maintenance
as<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:17.940> know<00:00:18.090> if<00:00:18.390> you've<00:00:18.510> tried<00:00:18.690> doing<00:00:18.960> it

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
as you know if you've tried doing it

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.870 
as you know if you've tried doing it
it's<00:00:19.320> very<00:00:19.500> difficult<00:00:20.010> especially<00:00:20.520> if<00:00:20.820> you

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
it's very difficult especially if you

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.509 
it's very difficult especially if you
don't<00:00:21.060> follow<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.359> right<00:00:21.510> procedures<00:00:21.600> if<00:00:22.260> you

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
don't follow the right procedures if you

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.070 
don't follow the right procedures if you
you<00:00:23.519> take<00:00:23.820> off<00:00:24.000> one<00:00:24.300> string<00:00:24.539> all<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.779> rest<00:00:24.960> of

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
you take off one string all the rest of

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.300 
you take off one string all the rest of
the<00:00:25.140> strings<00:00:25.410> go<00:00:25.560> out<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.710> tune<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.010> becomes

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
the strings go out of tune it becomes

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.769 
the strings go out of tune it becomes
very<00:00:26.460> frustrating<00:00:26.730> trying<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.330> get<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.570> trim

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
very frustrating trying to get the trim

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.960 
very frustrating trying to get the trim
back<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.170> tune<00:00:28.380> again<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.189> have<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.760> few

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
back in tune again so I have a few

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.279 
back in tune again so I have a few
tricks<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.359> show<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.779> makes<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.170> lot

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
tricks to show you that makes it a lot

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.979 
tricks to show you that makes it a lot
easier<00:00:31.520> so<00:00:32.520> step<00:00:33.149> one<00:00:33.390> before<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.840> do

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
easier so step one before you do

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.139 
easier so step one before you do
anything<00:00:34.230> get<00:00:35.010> something<00:00:35.370> like<00:00:35.520> an<00:00:35.670> eraser<00:00:36.120> or

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
anything get something like an eraser or

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.119 
anything get something like an eraser or
perhaps<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.989> piece<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.320> wine<00:00:37.500> corks<00:00:37.829> something

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
perhaps a piece of wine corks something

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.709 
perhaps a piece of wine corks something
like<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.820> can<00:00:39.000> put<00:00:39.210> onto<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.540> back

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
like that that you can put onto the back

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.420 
like that that you can put onto the back
of<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:39.960> tremolo<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.469> we<00:00:40.590> basically<00:00:41.010> push<00:00:41.190> down

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
of the tremolo so we basically push down

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.459 
of the tremolo so we basically push down
on<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.610> arm<00:00:41.790> insert<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.870> center<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.230> trim

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
on the arm insert the center the trim

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.260 
on the arm insert the center the trim
and<00:00:43.590> now<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.860> stabilizes<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> tremolo<00:00:45.000> so

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
and now that stabilizes a tremolo so

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.940 
and now that stabilizes a tremolo so
that<00:00:45.420> even<00:00:45.690> if<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.930> remove<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.410> strings<00:00:46.739> all

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
that even if I remove the strings all

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:47.990 
that even if I remove the strings all
the<00:00:47.070> rest<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.399> strings<00:00:47.670> will<00:00:47.820> stay

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
the rest of the strings will stay

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.569 
the rest of the strings will stay
relatively<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.750> tune<00:00:49.190> once<00:00:50.190> we've<00:00:50.370> done<00:00:50.520> that

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
relatively in tune once we've done that

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.369 
relatively in tune once we've done that
then<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:51.030> go<00:00:51.239> up<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.629> headstock<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.079> we

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
then we go up to the headstock and we

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.130 
then we go up to the headstock and we
loosen<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.100> nut<00:00:53.280> cap<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.480> basically<00:00:54.750> want

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
loosen the nut cap and we basically want

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.180 
loosen the nut cap and we basically want
to<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:55.379> take<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.680> out<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.010> way<00:00:56.129> because

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
to just take that out of the way because

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.340 
to just take that out of the way because
it's<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:57.270> our<00:00:57.360> way<00:00:57.539> as<00:00:57.690> far<00:00:57.899> as<00:00:57.989> we<00:00:58.109> stream

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
it's in our way as far as we stream

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.470 
it's in our way as far as we stream
we'll<00:00:58.530> put<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.770> back<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.070> after<00:00:59.280> okay<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.239> I'm

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
we'll put it back on after okay so I'm

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.939 
we'll put it back on after okay so I'm
just<00:01:00.539> going<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.809> set<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.230> over<00:01:01.590> here<00:01:01.739> out<00:01:01.859> of

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
just going to set that over here out of

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.060 
just going to set that over here out of
the<00:01:02.010> way<00:01:02.359> now<00:01:03.359> we<00:01:03.420> can<00:01:03.899> detune<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:06.420> string<00:01:07.070> and

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
the way now we can detune the string and

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.830 
the way now we can detune the string and
we<00:01:08.460> can<00:01:08.670> clip<00:01:08.939> off<00:01:10.939> the<00:01:11.939> string<00:01:12.210> itself<00:01:12.570> we'll

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
we can clip off the string itself we'll

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.480 
we can clip off the string itself we'll
go<00:01:12.990> over<00:01:13.170> here<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.439> we'll<00:01:13.619> remove<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.310> in

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
go over here and we'll remove that in

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.219 
go over here and we'll remove that in
from<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.820> tuning<00:01:15.450> machine<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.930> then<00:01:16.049> we'll

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
from the tuning machine and then we'll

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.530 
from the tuning machine and then we'll
go<00:01:16.950> down<00:01:16.979> here<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.430> we'll<00:01:17.640> release<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.000> clamp

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
go down here and we'll release the clamp

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.800 
go down here and we'll release the clamp
block<00:01:19.610> once<00:01:20.610> we<00:01:20.790> release<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.270> clamp<00:01:21.509> lock

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
block once we release the clamp lock

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.990 
block once we release the clamp lock
then<00:01:22.080> we'll<00:01:22.350> be<00:01:22.439> able<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.670> pull<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.759> string

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
then we'll be able to pull the string

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.570 
then we'll be able to pull the string
out<00:01:24.290> okay<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.320> we'll<00:01:25.710> take<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.310> get<00:01:26.460> it

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
out okay so we'll take that and get it

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.060 
out okay so we'll take that and get it
out<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.820> way<00:01:27.200> now<00:01:28.200> what<00:01:28.409> we<00:01:28.500> need<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.680> do<00:01:28.920> is

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
out of the way now what we need to do is

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.840 
out of the way now what we need to do is
we<00:01:29.189> need<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.490> get<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.790> new<00:01:29.970> string<00:01:30.920> so<00:01:31.920> we<00:01:31.950> pick

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
we need to get a new string so we pick

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.100 
we need to get a new string so we pick
our<00:01:33.000> set<00:01:33.240> here<00:01:34.430> and<00:01:35.430> we'll<00:01:35.729> pull<00:01:35.970> out<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.960> one

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
our set here and we'll pull out the one

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.359 
our set here and we'll pull out the one
that<00:01:37.290> we<00:01:37.409> need<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.710> notice<00:01:38.009> on<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.189> bottom

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
that we need you notice on the bottom

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.069 
that we need you notice on the bottom
smart<00:01:38.820> with<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.090> gauge<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.509> we<00:01:39.600> don't<00:01:39.780> confuse

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
smart with the gauge so we don't confuse

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.420 
smart with the gauge so we don't confuse
that<00:01:40.290> with<00:01:40.350> any<00:01:40.650> other<00:01:40.740> one<00:01:43.070> now<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.130> carefully

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
that with any other one now we carefully

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.160 
that with any other one now we carefully
unwind<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.149> it's<00:01:45.360> not<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.720> injure

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
unwind it so it's not to injure

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.350 
unwind it so it's not to injure
ourselves<00:01:46.460> now<00:01:47.460> what<00:01:47.640> we<00:01:47.729> have<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:48.000> do<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.240> we

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
ourselves now what we have to do is we

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.300 
ourselves now what we have to do is we
actually<00:01:48.689> have<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.990> trim<00:01:49.229> off<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.950> ball<00:01:50.159> in

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
actually have to trim off the ball in

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.010 
actually have to trim off the ball in
but<00:01:50.460> we<00:01:50.610> want<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.850> go<00:01:50.939> past<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.329> over<00:01:51.659> winding

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
but we want to go past the over winding

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.020 
but we want to go past the over winding
so<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:52.320> go<00:01:52.470> past<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.920> over<00:01:53.100> whining<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.579> then

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
so we go past the over whining and then

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.780 
so we go past the over whining and then
we<00:01:54.119> trim<00:01:54.420> off<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.780> excess<00:01:55.340> now<00:01:56.340> we<00:01:56.399> go<00:01:56.610> down

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
we trim off the excess now we go down

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.630 
we trim off the excess now we go down
here<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.409> we<00:01:58.409> insert<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.950> string<00:01:59.189> we<00:01:59.369> want<00:01:59.490> to

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
here and we insert the string we want to

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.859 
here and we insert the string we want to
get<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.850> right<00:01:59.969> in<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.119> middle<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.630> slot

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
get it right in the middle of the slot

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.810 
get it right in the middle of the slot
then<00:02:01.200> we're<00:02:01.320> going<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.469> take<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.920> cinch<00:02:02.610> up

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
then we're going to take and cinch up

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.539 
then we're going to take and cinch up
the<00:02:03.329> clamp<00:02:03.570> block<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:04.020> hold<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.320> in<00:02:04.409> place<00:02:04.549> now

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
the clamp block to hold it in place now

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.560 
the clamp block to hold it in place now
you<00:02:05.579> got<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.820> be<00:02:05.880> careful<00:02:05.969> not<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.390> over

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
you got to be careful not to over

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.789 
you got to be careful not to over
tighten<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.869> some<00:02:07.049> people<00:02:07.320> actually<00:02:07.409> tighten

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
tighten and some people actually tighten

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.100 
tighten and some people actually tighten
it<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.009> tight<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.399> they<00:02:08.520> break<00:02:08.759> the

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
it so tight that they break the

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.999 
it so tight that they break the
mechanism<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.259> then<00:02:10.349> they<00:02:10.440> have<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.709> replace

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
mechanism and then they have to replace

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.450 
mechanism and then they have to replace
the<00:02:11.190> whole<00:02:11.340> saddle<00:02:11.700> assembly

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
the whole saddle assembly

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.340 
the whole saddle assembly
we<00:02:12.520> don't<00:02:12.700> want<00:02:12.820> to<00:02:12.910> do<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.180> so<00:02:13.900> now<00:02:14.050> we<00:02:14.110> come

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
we don't want to do that so now we come

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.130 
we don't want to do that so now we come
down<00:02:14.380> here<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:15.030> we<00:02:16.030> want<00:02:16.240> to<00:02:16.330> see<00:02:16.510> how<00:02:16.990> much

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
down here and we want to see how much

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.900 
down here and we want to see how much
slack<00:02:17.410> we<00:02:17.560> need<00:02:17.710> so<00:02:17.860> basically<00:02:18.250> what<00:02:18.490> we<00:02:18.610> do<00:02:18.760> is

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
slack we need so basically what we do is

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.970 
slack we need so basically what we do is
we<00:02:19.030> go<00:02:19.180> about<00:02:19.390> two<00:02:19.690> inches<00:02:19.990> past<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.500> capstan

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
we go about two inches past the capstan

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.500 
we go about two inches past the capstan
and<00:02:21.190> that's<00:02:21.310> usually<00:02:21.490> adequate<00:02:22.180> amount<00:02:22.450> of

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
and that's usually adequate amount of

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.020 
and that's usually adequate amount of
slack<00:02:22.780> now<00:02:23.380> then<00:02:23.650> we<00:02:24.190> take<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.550> we<00:02:24.610> just<00:02:24.820> bend

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
slack now then we take and we just bend

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.850 
slack now then we take and we just bend
the<00:02:25.150> end<00:02:25.300> at<00:02:25.480> 90<00:02:25.780> degrees<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.440> now<00:02:26.560> we<00:02:26.620> take

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
the end at 90 degrees and now we take

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.150 
the end at 90 degrees and now we take
our<00:02:27.040> side<00:02:27.310> cutters<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:28.060> we<00:02:28.360> trim<00:02:28.630> off<00:02:28.810> oh<00:02:29.160> any

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
our side cutters and we trim off oh any

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.660 
our side cutters and we trim off oh any
all<00:02:30.400> upset<00:02:30.880> for<00:02:31.030> maybe<00:02:31.240> half<00:02:31.480> an<00:02:31.600> inch<00:02:32.610> now<00:02:33.610> we

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
all upset for maybe half an inch now we

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.490 
all upset for maybe half an inch now we
can<00:02:33.910> take<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.210> string<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.720> we<00:02:34.840> can<00:02:34.990> insert<00:02:35.350> it

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
can take the string and we can insert it

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.070 
can take the string and we can insert it
in<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.680> hole<00:02:35.800> in<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.340> capstan<00:02:36.880> until<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:37.930> goes

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
in the hole in the capstan until it goes

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.640 
in the hole in the capstan until it goes
down<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:38.680> now<00:02:39.190> we<00:02:39.520> can<00:02:39.730> wind<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:41.170> remainder

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
down and now we can wind the remainder

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.380 
down and now we can wind the remainder
on<00:02:41.830> to<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.130> capstan<00:02:42.580> it's<00:02:42.910> always<00:02:43.180> good<00:02:43.360> to

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
on to the capstan it's always good to

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.610 
on to the capstan it's always good to
try<00:02:43.570> and<00:02:43.720> keep<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:43.930> little<00:02:44.080> tension<00:02:44.170> on<00:02:44.530> the

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
try and keep a little tension on the

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.130 
try and keep a little tension on the
string<00:02:44.860> as<00:02:44.980> you're<00:02:45.130> winding<00:02:45.490> it<00:02:45.610> so<00:02:45.790> that

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
string as you're winding it so that

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.680 
string as you're winding it so that
there<00:02:47.140> isn't<00:02:47.260> slack<00:02:47.650> built<00:02:47.950> in<00:02:48.630> now<00:02:49.630> you

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
there isn't slack built in now you

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.240 
there isn't slack built in now you
notice<00:02:50.020> I<00:02:50.080> put<00:02:50.110> it<00:02:50.380> under<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.710> string<00:02:50.950> -<00:02:51.070> you

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
notice I put it under the string - you

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.290 
notice I put it under the string - you
always<00:02:51.460> want<00:02:51.640> to<00:02:51.670> make<00:02:51.820> sure<00:02:51.940> you<00:02:52.030> get<00:02:52.150> it

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
always want to make sure you get it

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.180 
always want to make sure you get it
under<00:02:52.540> there<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.050> reason<00:02:53.380> that<00:02:53.410> retainer

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
under there and the reason that retainer

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.420 
under there and the reason that retainer
is<00:02:54.370> on<00:02:54.520> there<00:02:54.790> is<00:02:55.300> to<00:02:55.570> keep<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.930> string<00:02:56.430> down

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
is on there is to keep the string down

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.460 
is on there is to keep the string down
so<00:02:57.730> that<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.060> string<00:02:58.330> rest<00:02:58.570> fully<00:02:58.900> in<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.260> nut

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
so that the string rest fully in the nut

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.500 
so that the string rest fully in the nut
that<00:03:00.100> way<00:03:00.250> when<00:03:00.460> you<00:03:00.550> put<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.850> clamp<00:03:01.090> block<00:03:01.300> on

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
that way when you put the clamp block on

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.790 
that way when you put the clamp block on
and<00:03:01.660> tighten<00:03:01.780> it<00:03:01.930> up<00:03:02.020> it<00:03:02.200> doesn't<00:03:02.380> throw<00:03:02.650> the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
and tighten it up it doesn't throw the

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.710 
and tighten it up it doesn't throw the
guitar<00:03:03.100> out<00:03:03.130> of<00:03:03.220> tune<00:03:03.310> if<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.180> string<00:03:04.450> was<00:03:04.570> to

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
guitar out of tune if the string was to

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.390 
guitar out of tune if the string was to
be<00:03:04.840> higher<00:03:05.200> up<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:05.710> you<00:03:05.770> tighten<00:03:05.950> it<00:03:06.070> down<00:03:06.280> you

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
be higher up and you tighten it down you

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.470 
be higher up and you tighten it down you
would<00:03:06.490> actually<00:03:06.820> sharpen<00:03:07.240> the<00:03:07.330> note

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
would actually sharpen the note

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.240 
would actually sharpen the note
substantially<00:03:09.870> now<00:03:10.870> once<00:03:11.170> we<00:03:11.350> get<00:03:11.470> it<00:03:11.620> tuned

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.780 

we<00:03:15.250> can<00:03:15.430> take<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:15.870> eraser<00:03:16.870> out<00:03:17.370> now<00:03:18.370> listen<00:03:18.700> to

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
we can take the eraser out now listen to

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:27.850 
we can take the eraser out now listen to
it

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.110 

so<00:03:28.860> what<00:03:29.010> we<00:03:29.130> want<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.370> do<00:03:29.520> now<00:03:29.640> is<00:03:29.670> you<00:03:29.880> want<00:03:29.910> to

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
so what we want to do now is you want to

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.090 
so what we want to do now is you want to
take<00:03:30.510> up<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.690> slack<00:03:31.050> of<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.290> string<00:03:31.620> so<00:03:31.650> we

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
take up the slack of the string so we

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.490 
take up the slack of the string so we
want<00:03:32.520> to<00:03:32.610> pre<00:03:32.790> stretch<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:33.330> by<00:03:33.480> just<00:03:34.110> bending<00:03:34.290> a

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
want to pre stretch it by just bending a

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.680 
want to pre stretch it by just bending a
little<00:03:34.620> out<00:03:34.800> of<00:03:34.830> a<00:03:34.980> line<00:03:35.190> like<00:03:35.400> this<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.820> then

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
little out of a line like this and then

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.930 
little out of a line like this and then
we'll<00:03:36.810> retune<00:03:39.050> we'll<00:03:40.050> keep<00:03:40.200> doing<00:03:40.410> that<00:03:40.710> until

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
we'll retune we'll keep doing that until

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:58.270 
we'll retune we'll keep doing that until
it<00:03:41.940> stays<00:03:42.270> in<00:03:42.480> pitch

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.820 

now<00:03:58.850> on<00:03:59.030> the<00:03:59.120> fine<00:03:59.300> tuners<00:03:59.660> back<00:04:00.260> here<00:04:00.560> you

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
now on the fine tuners back here you

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.620 
now on the fine tuners back here you
want<00:04:01.010> to<00:04:01.130> back<00:04:01.790> them<00:04:02.000> out<00:04:02.120> if<00:04:02.300> they're<00:04:02.420> all<00:04:02.540> the

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
want to back them out if they're all the

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.260 
want to back them out if they're all the
way<00:04:02.750> down<00:04:02.990> if<00:04:03.230> they're<00:04:03.620> too<00:04:04.490> far<00:04:04.760> up<00:04:04.970> then

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
way down if they're too far up then

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.550 
way down if they're too far up then
you'll<00:04:05.510> run<00:04:05.660> out<00:04:05.720> of<00:04:05.930> adjustment<00:04:06.170> in<00:04:06.500> the

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
you'll run out of adjustment in the

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.810 
you'll run out of adjustment in the
other<00:04:06.680> direction<00:04:06.860> so<00:04:07.130> you<00:04:07.220> need<00:04:07.370> to<00:04:07.460> have<00:04:07.610> just

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
other direction so you need to have just

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.670 
other direction so you need to have just
a<00:04:07.970> little<00:04:08.210> bit<00:04:08.330> at<00:04:08.570> the<00:04:08.990> top<00:04:09.200> but<00:04:09.410> you<00:04:09.530> need

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
a little bit at the top but you need

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.140 
a little bit at the top but you need
most<00:04:09.920> of<00:04:10.070> it<00:04:10.160> at<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:10.340> bottom<00:04:10.610> because<00:04:10.730> as<00:04:10.970> you

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
most of it at the bottom because as you

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.970 
most of it at the bottom because as you
play<00:04:11.390> the<00:04:11.420> strings<00:04:11.930> tend<00:04:12.170> to<00:04:12.260> get<00:04:12.350> flat<00:04:12.740> and

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
play the strings tend to get flat and

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.800 
play the strings tend to get flat and
you<00:04:13.430> need<00:04:13.460> to<00:04:13.730> be<00:04:13.880> able<00:04:13.940> to<00:04:14.090> adjust<00:04:14.210> the<00:04:14.510> tuner

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
you need to be able to adjust the tuner

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.319 
you need to be able to adjust the tuner
to<00:04:14.840> sharpen<00:04:15.320> them<00:04:15.470> back<00:04:15.620> to<00:04:15.800> pitch<00:04:16.010> so<00:04:16.880> once

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
to sharpen them back to pitch so once

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.990 
to sharpen them back to pitch so once
you<00:04:17.450> get<00:04:17.600> the<00:04:17.720> fine<00:04:17.900> tuner<00:04:18.200> adjusted<00:04:19.000> retune

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
you get the fine tuner adjusted retune

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.920 
you get the fine tuner adjusted retune
it<00:04:21.550> now<00:04:22.550> we<00:04:22.610> basically<00:04:22.970> take<00:04:23.390> the<00:04:23.540> neck<00:04:23.720> cap

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
it now we basically take the neck cap

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.570 
it now we basically take the neck cap
and<00:04:24.200> we<00:04:24.260> put<00:04:24.440> that<00:04:24.470> back<00:04:24.830> in<00:04:25.010> place<00:04:25.040> and<00:04:25.250> we

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
and we put that back in place and we

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.490 
and we put that back in place and we
make<00:04:25.760> sure<00:04:25.880> it's<00:04:26.030> oriented<00:04:26.480> the<00:04:26.600> right<00:04:26.630> way<00:04:26.930> it

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
make sure it's oriented the right way it

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.260 
make sure it's oriented the right way it
has<00:04:27.620> like<00:04:27.800> two<00:04:27.980> flat<00:04:28.250> spots<00:04:28.610> on<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:28.910> bottom<00:04:29.060> of

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
has like two flat spots on the bottom of

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.850 
has like two flat spots on the bottom of
the<00:04:29.360> nut<00:04:29.510> cap<00:04:29.720> and<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:29.990> flat<00:04:30.200> spots<00:04:30.530> have<00:04:30.710> to

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
the nut cap and the flat spots have to

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.640 
the nut cap and the flat spots have to
go<00:04:30.980> across<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.490> strings<00:04:31.820> and<00:04:32.090> so<00:04:32.930> it<00:04:33.410> looks

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
go across the strings and so it looks

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.350 
go across the strings and so it looks
like<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:33.919> roof<00:04:34.070> on<00:04:34.250> a<00:04:34.280> house<00:04:34.550> and<00:04:34.880> I<00:04:35.090> want<00:04:35.270> the

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
like the roof on a house and I want the

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.070 
like the roof on a house and I want the
little<00:04:35.570> peak<00:04:35.750> of<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.770> roof<00:04:37.610> to<00:04:37.910> be<00:04:38.360> parallel

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
little peak of the roof to be parallel

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.110 
little peak of the roof to be parallel
to<00:04:39.110> the<00:04:39.320> string<00:04:39.560> alignment<00:04:39.980> and<00:04:40.130> then<00:04:40.730> once<00:04:40.940> we

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
to the string alignment and then once we

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.580 
to the string alignment and then once we
get<00:04:41.300> that<00:04:41.480> in<00:04:41.600> place<00:04:41.630> we<00:04:41.990> carefully<00:04:42.230> seen

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
get that in place we carefully seen

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.409 
get that in place we carefully seen
setup<00:04:42.950> again<00:04:43.190> don't<00:04:43.490> get<00:04:43.580> too<00:04:43.760> crazy<00:04:43.910> with<00:04:44.270> the

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
setup again don't get too crazy with the

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:45.820 
setup again don't get too crazy with the
wrench<00:04:44.600> just<00:04:44.870> kind<00:04:45.140> of<00:04:45.200> cinch<00:04:45.440> it<00:04:45.530> up<00:04:45.620> till

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
wrench just kind of cinch it up till

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.560 
wrench just kind of cinch it up till
it's<00:04:45.919> firm<00:04:46.220> you<00:04:46.700> could<00:04:46.880> actually<00:04:47.180> strip<00:04:47.419> out

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
it's firm you could actually strip out

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:53.620 
it's firm you could actually strip out
the<00:04:47.690> threads<00:04:47.960> if<00:04:48.110> you<00:04:48.230> over<00:04:48.410> tighten<00:04:48.590> it<00:04:52.630> then

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
the threads if you over tighten it then

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.870 
the threads if you over tighten it then
we<00:04:53.720> can<00:04:53.870> just<00:04:54.080> readjust<00:04:54.620> it<00:04:54.770> and<00:04:54.950> you're<00:04:55.730> ready

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
we can just readjust it and you're ready

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.730 
we can just readjust it and you're ready
to<00:04:56.030> go<00:04:56.180> then<00:04:56.540> move<00:04:56.780> on<00:04:56.930> to<00:04:57.080> the<00:04:57.200> next<00:04:57.410> string<00:04:57.560> if

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
to go then move on to the next string if

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.140 
to go then move on to the next string if
you<00:04:57.830> do<00:04:57.980> one<00:04:58.190> string<00:04:58.460> at<00:04:58.550> a<00:04:58.640> time<00:04:58.669> you'll<00:04:59.060> have

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
you do one string at a time you'll have

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.790 
you do one string at a time you'll have
the<00:04:59.330> best<00:04:59.540> results<00:04:59.990> because<00:05:00.290> if<00:05:00.440> you<00:05:00.530> do<00:05:00.680> them

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
the best results because if you do them

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.170 
the best results because if you do them
all<00:05:00.890> at<00:05:01.010> once<00:05:01.160> it<00:05:01.310> may<00:05:01.430> go<00:05:01.580> more<00:05:01.760> out<00:05:01.880> of<00:05:01.910> tune
