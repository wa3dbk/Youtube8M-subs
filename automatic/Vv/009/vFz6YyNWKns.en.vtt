okay this is an old injector pump right
here<00:00:05.540> I<00:00:06.550> believe<00:00:07.550> the<00:00:07.670> optical<00:00:08.090> sensor<00:00:08.480> right

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.170 
here I believe the optical sensor right

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.270 
here I believe the optical sensor right
there<00:00:09.410> is<00:00:09.560> out<00:00:09.769> in<00:00:09.890> this<00:00:10.010> thing

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
I left the pump bolted on from the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.790 
I left the pump bolted on from the
outside<00:00:58.730> here<00:00:59.090> and<00:00:59.719> from<00:00:59.930> here<00:00:59.989> I<00:01:00.230> bumped<00:01:00.710> it

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:05.380 
then the last bolt and took it out

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.529 
then the last bolt and took it out
didn't<00:01:06.380> bump<00:01:06.590> it<00:01:06.709> over<00:01:06.799> at<00:01:07.009> all<00:01:07.130> anymore<00:01:07.539> took

00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:08.539 
didn't bump it over at all anymore took

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:10.449 
didn't bump it over at all anymore took
the<00:01:08.659> pump<00:01:08.869> out<00:01:09.079> with<00:01:09.499> the<00:01:09.649> new<00:01:09.770> pump<00:01:10.009> back<00:01:10.189> in

00:01:10.449 --> 00:01:10.459 
the pump out with the new pump back in

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:13.330 
the pump out with the new pump back in
and<00:01:11.209> then<00:01:11.740> bolted<00:01:12.740> it<00:01:12.859> up<00:01:12.979> because<00:01:13.100> it<00:01:13.249> would

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
and then bolted it up because it would

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.559 
and then bolted it up because it would
already<00:01:13.459> line<00:01:13.729> up<00:01:13.909> and<00:01:14.060> then<00:01:14.119> I<00:01:14.209> bumped<00:01:14.420> it

00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:14.569 
already line up and then I bumped it

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:16.419 
already line up and then I bumped it
over<00:01:14.810> to<00:01:14.929> get<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:15.049> other<00:01:15.170> two<00:01:15.319> bolts<00:01:15.770> in<00:01:15.920> you

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:16.429 
over to get the other two bolts in you

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:17.499 
over to get the other two bolts in you
pump<00:01:16.700> it<00:01:16.789> over<00:01:16.969> with<00:01:17.119> that<00:01:17.240> one<00:01:17.389> of<00:01:17.450> those

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
pump it over with that one of those

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:18.879 
pump it over with that one of those
bolts<00:01:17.840> and<00:01:18.020> then<00:01:18.139> you're<00:01:18.259> at<00:01:18.380> two<00:01:18.529> retime

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:18.889 
bolts and then you're at two retime

used was the 19 millimeter that's what

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.069 
used was the 19 millimeter that's what
those<00:01:51.950> injector<00:01:52.399> lines<00:01:52.609> are<00:01:52.789> and<00:01:53.209> I<00:01:53.719> cut<00:01:53.959> this

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
those injector lines are and I cut this

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.779 
those injector lines are and I cut this
open<00:01:54.259> to<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.679> grinder<00:01:55.069> and<00:01:55.099> cut<00:01:55.340> it<00:01:55.429> open<00:01:55.549> that

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
open to the grinder and cut it open that

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.549 
open to the grinder and cut it open that
I<00:01:55.880> can<00:01:55.999> slide<00:01:56.270> it<00:01:56.419> on<00:01:56.539> use<00:01:56.810> it<00:01:56.959> as<00:01:57.049> like<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:57.259> flare

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:57.559 
I can slide it on use it as like a flare

00:01:57.559 --> 00:02:01.449 
I can slide it on use it as like a flare
nut<00:01:57.739> wrench<00:01:58.329> so<00:01:59.329> this<00:01:59.659> is<00:01:59.809> just<00:01:59.989> some<00:02:00.459> crappy

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
nut wrench so this is just some crappy

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.159 
nut wrench so this is just some crappy
quick<00:02:01.639> memory<00:02:01.880> so<00:02:02.239> it's<00:02:02.389> not<00:02:02.509> a<00:02:02.569> big<00:02:02.719> deal

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:03.169 
quick memory so it's not a big deal

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:05.319 
quick memory so it's not a big deal
you<00:02:03.739> got<00:02:03.829> to<00:02:03.919> need<00:02:04.009> one<00:02:04.130> of<00:02:04.159> these<00:02:04.279> mirrors<00:02:04.700> and

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
you got to need one of these mirrors and

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.279 
you got to need one of these mirrors and
that's<00:02:06.289> so<00:02:07.039> even<00:02:07.279> look<00:02:07.459> into<00:02:07.789> the<00:02:08.569> hole<00:02:08.750> which

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
that's so even look into the hole which

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.389 
that's so even look into the hole which
the<00:02:09.469> oil

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.509 
the oil
d'leh<00:02:10.819> tubes<00:02:11.060> now<00:02:11.330> in<00:02:11.599> to<00:02:12.500> see<00:02:13.069> when<00:02:13.400> you're

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
d'leh tubes now in to see when you're

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:14.770 
d'leh tubes now in to see when you're
bumping<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.849> motor<00:02:14.030> over<00:02:14.299> to<00:02:14.390> see<00:02:14.540> if<00:02:14.659> your

bumping the motor over to see if your

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.360 
bumping the motor over to see if your
bolts<00:02:15.080> are<00:02:15.200> exposed<00:02:15.560> so<00:02:15.709> you<00:02:15.799> can<00:02:15.950> get<00:02:16.099> to<00:02:16.220> them

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
bolts are exposed so you can get to them

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.500 
bolts are exposed so you can get to them
there's<00:02:16.519> only<00:02:16.580> three<00:02:16.940> of<00:02:17.060> them<00:02:17.180> there<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:17.480> a

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
there's only three of them there and a

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.530 
there's only three of them there and a
pin<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:18.190> that<00:02:19.190> depends<00:02:19.730> like<00:02:19.909> a<00:02:19.970> roll<00:02:20.180> pin<00:02:20.360> and

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
pin and that depends like a roll pin and

pin and that depends like a roll pin and
that<00:02:20.629> pin<00:02:20.870> will<00:02:21.049> guide<00:02:21.260> you<00:02:21.470> into<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.799> gear

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.220 

that's<00:02:26.690> it

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
that's it

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.259 
that's it
I'm<00:02:27.980> going<00:02:28.099> to<00:02:28.159> put<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.400> intake<00:02:28.730> back<00:02:28.940> on<00:02:29.180> I'm

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
going to vacuum out I had paper towels

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.240 
going to vacuum out I had paper towels
and<00:02:31.489> all<00:02:32.000> these<00:02:32.120> ports<00:02:32.510> here<00:02:32.750> I<00:02:33.069> pulled<00:02:34.069> those

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
and all these ports here I pulled those

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.470 
and all these ports here I pulled those
and<00:02:34.489> I'm<00:02:34.579> going<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.730> vacuum<00:02:35.030> it<00:02:35.120> out<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:35.360> throw

and I'm going to vacuum it out and throw

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.630 
and I'm going to vacuum it out and throw
the<00:02:35.599> intake<00:02:35.930> back<00:02:36.140> on<00:02:36.379> make<00:02:37.159> sure<00:02:37.340> you<00:02:37.459> tighten

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
the intake back on make sure you tighten

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.949 
the intake back on make sure you tighten
the<00:02:37.819> hell<00:02:37.909> out<00:02:38.060> of<00:02:38.090> these<00:02:38.239> things<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.780> these

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
the hell out of these things to these

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.300 
the hell out of these things to these
injector<00:02:39.379> lines<00:02:39.590> because<00:02:39.829> they're<00:02:39.980> at<00:02:40.099> some

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
injector lines because they're at some

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.000 
injector lines because they're at some
ungodly<00:02:40.670> psi<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.659> thing<00:02:41.840> is<00:02:41.959> running<00:02:42.170> and

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
ungodly psi and the thing is running and

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.240 
ungodly psi and the thing is running and
I'm<00:02:43.790> going<00:02:43.910> to<00:02:43.970> try<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.150> prime<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:44.450> a<00:02:44.629> little<00:02:45.250> by

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
I'm going to try to prime it a little by

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.819 
I'm going to try to prime it a little by
taking<00:02:46.849> the<00:02:47.000> filler<00:02:47.329> here<00:02:47.660> where<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.379> inlet

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
taking the filler here where the inlet

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.940 
taking the filler here where the inlet
is<00:02:49.120> there's<00:02:50.120> your<00:02:50.299> Inlet<00:02:50.569> and<00:02:51.440> then<00:02:51.620> this<00:02:51.769> one

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
is there's your Inlet and then this one

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.860 
is there's your Inlet and then this one
over<00:02:52.160> here<00:02:52.430> in<00:02:52.819> front<00:02:53.239> of<00:02:53.329> the<00:02:53.390> fuel<00:02:53.599> shutoff

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
over here in front of the fuel shutoff

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.259 
over here in front of the fuel shutoff
solenoid<00:02:54.470> is<00:02:54.620> your<00:02:54.739> return<00:02:55.060> I'm<00:02:56.060> going<00:02:56.209> to

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
solenoid is your return I'm going to

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:57.490 
solenoid is your return I'm going to
pour<00:02:56.420> a<00:02:56.450> little<00:02:56.540> Beisel<00:02:56.989> in<00:02:57.079> each<00:02:57.200> one<00:02:57.409> of

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
pour a little Beisel in each one of

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.660 
pour a little Beisel in each one of
these<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:57.859> hopefully<00:02:57.980> it<00:02:58.190> gets<00:02:58.280> going<00:02:58.519> a

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
these and hopefully it gets going a

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.789 
these and hopefully it gets going a
little<00:02:58.849> quicker<00:02:59.030> and<00:03:00.849> these<00:03:01.849> things<00:03:02.799> seams

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
little quicker and these things seams

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.849 
little quicker and these things seams
are<00:03:03.950> kind<00:03:04.099> of<00:03:04.129> a<00:03:04.220> pain<00:03:04.250> here<00:03:05.000> is<00:03:05.840> uh<00:03:05.900> all<00:03:06.680> these

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
are kind of a pain here is uh all these

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.399 
are kind of a pain here is uh all these
electrical<00:03:07.250> connections<00:03:08.060> you<00:03:08.150> have<00:03:08.230> but<00:03:09.230> each

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
electrical connections you have but each

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:10.390 
electrical connections you have but each
one<00:03:09.620> is<00:03:09.650> color-coded

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
one is color-coded

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.280 
one is color-coded
and<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:11.090> goes<00:03:11.239> to<00:03:11.359> different<00:03:11.540> stuff<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.140> a<00:03:12.170> lot

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
and it goes to different stuff and a lot

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.690 
and it goes to different stuff and a lot
of<00:03:12.319> more<00:03:12.530> different<00:03:12.859> pens<00:03:13.069> so<00:03:13.310> you<00:03:13.370> shouldn't

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
of more different pens so you shouldn't

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.030 
of more different pens so you shouldn't
have<00:03:13.819> a<00:03:13.849> problem<00:03:14.139> putting<00:03:15.139> that<00:03:15.349> back<00:03:15.530> up<00:03:15.799> for

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
have a problem putting that back up for

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.819 
have a problem putting that back up for

sorry<00:03:22.669> but<00:03:23.450> it's<00:03:23.569> pretty<00:03:23.750> similar<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:24.470> the

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
sorry but it's pretty similar to the

sorry but it's pretty similar to the
thermostat<00:03:25.340> one<00:03:25.790> which<00:03:26.090> you'll<00:03:26.269> probably

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
thermostat one which you'll probably

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.050 
thermostat one which you'll probably
unplug<00:03:27.079> just<00:03:27.319> to<00:03:27.410> make<00:03:27.530> it<00:03:27.560> easier<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.099> both

unplug just to make it easier and both

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.680 
unplug just to make it easier and both
of<00:03:29.090> those<00:03:29.329> are<00:03:29.389> pretty<00:03:29.780> similar<00:03:30.169> to<00:03:31.480> this<00:03:32.480> one

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
of those are pretty similar to this one

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.960 
of those are pretty similar to this one
right<00:03:32.930> here<00:03:33.290> which<00:03:34.099> goes<00:03:34.310> up<00:03:34.489> on<00:03:34.639> the<00:03:34.730> intake

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
right here which goes up on the intake

for<00:03:37.579> it<00:03:37.669> on<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:37.849> intake<00:03:38.120> manifold<00:03:38.599> is<00:03:38.690> gray<00:03:38.930> as

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
for it on the intake manifold is gray as

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.640 
for it on the intake manifold is gray as
well<00:03:39.910> these<00:03:40.910> are<00:03:40.970> both<00:03:41.239> white<00:03:41.540> and<00:03:41.840> these<00:03:42.530> are

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
well these are both white and these are

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.809 
well these are both white and these are
both<00:03:42.769> black<00:03:43.099> so<00:03:43.310> you<00:03:43.400> shouldn't<00:03:43.699> have<00:03:43.790> a

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
both black so you shouldn't have a

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.039 
both black so you shouldn't have a
problem<00:03:43.879> hooking<00:03:44.419> all<00:03:44.510> that<00:03:44.599> stuff<00:03:44.810> back<00:03:44.989> up

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
problem hooking all that stuff back up

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:46.659 
problem hooking all that stuff back up
it's<00:03:45.560> not<00:03:45.650> really<00:03:45.889> a<00:03:45.919> big<00:03:46.010> deal<00:03:46.190> make<00:03:46.430> sure<00:03:46.579> you

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.669 
it's not really a big deal make sure you

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.729 
it's not really a big deal make sure you
do<00:03:46.790> hook<00:03:46.940> everything<00:03:47.299> up<00:03:47.510> otherwise<00:03:47.900> you're

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
do hook everything up otherwise you're

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.400 
do hook everything up otherwise you're
going<00:03:48.829> to<00:03:48.919> be<00:03:48.980> fighting<00:03:49.190> around<00:03:49.489> with<00:03:49.699> it

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
going to be fighting around with it

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.859 
going to be fighting around with it
that's<00:03:51.410> it<00:03:51.620> for<00:03:51.769> now
