00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.270
 for her 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.310
 no 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.819
 no 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:49.479
 no 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:10.719
 not really 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:18.699
 nothing 

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:38.949
 you know it's very difficult 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:41.809
 we were not disappointed 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:43.279
 think at some point 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:46.279
 cuffy if the players to say if m 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.479
 m and still a lot to improve but 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:53.219
 I am happy to have followed up on the sources 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:55.919
 but common sense in this year a little bit 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.909
 we have seen it also voluntarily 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.589
 accept to back down for 

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:03.459
 normaction of experts in their backs 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.859
 but not in the other 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.449
 because I wanted it to be called 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:11.739
 the relaxation as emphasized him that it happens to us often and especially 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.389
 the eviction I am instructed to perform 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:17.150
 so hard to go back to work because 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.889
 the word I think it's a good thing 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.889
 the correct anyway with the help of a first half 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.229
 completely controlled mondeville the control of the draw 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:29.719
 not much to put on 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:33.089
 on the back as they say for IstrÃ©ens new two occasions 

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:34.419
 frank by toudic 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.740
 good unfortunately 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.330
 we do not concretize and then we take the match can crash 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.779
 beautiful is every day that the mage becomes much more complicated
