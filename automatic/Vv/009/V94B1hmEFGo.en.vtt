know but also very useful you can jump
up<00:00:21.779> here<00:00:22.080> or<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.590> can<00:00:22.740> go<00:00:22.859> directly<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.580> top

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
up here or you can go directly to top

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.839 
up here or you can go directly to top
mid<00:00:24.060> as<00:00:24.240> well<00:00:24.720> right<00:00:25.529> there<00:00:25.740> BAM<00:00:26.130> enemy

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
mid as well right there BAM enemy

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.880 
mid as well right there BAM enemy
doesn't<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.630> lot<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.869> times<00:00:28.050> expect<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.619> not<00:00:28.650> a

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
doesn't a lot of times expect it not a

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.519 
doesn't a lot of times expect it not a
ton<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.429> people<00:00:29.849> know<00:00:29.970> about<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.390> yet<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:30.869> BAM

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
ton of people know about that yet so BAM

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.290 
ton of people know about that yet so BAM
you<00:00:31.769> could<00:00:31.890> fly<00:00:32.130> income<00:00:32.399> boom<00:00:32.730> they're<00:00:33.000> dead

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
you could fly income boom they're dead

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.120 
you could fly income boom they're dead
another<00:00:33.930> way<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.110> can<00:00:34.260> access<00:00:34.620> tom<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.010> is

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
another way you can access tom it is

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.740 
another way you can access tom it is
actually<00:00:35.340> from<00:00:35.730> these<00:00:36.000> little<00:00:36.300> things<00:00:36.450> right

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
actually from these little things right

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.479 
actually from these little things right
here<00:00:36.899> now<00:00:37.230> not<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.469> lot<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:37.920> people<00:00:38.070> know<00:00:38.460> about

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
here now not a lot of people know about

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.090 
here now not a lot of people know about
these<00:00:39.180> it's<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.110> little<00:00:40.469> tricky<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.860> do

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
these it's a little tricky to do

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.340 
these it's a little tricky to do
sometimes<00:00:41.340> but<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.969> can<00:00:42.270> do<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.660> boom<00:00:42.989> right

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
sometimes but you can do it boom right

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.380 
sometimes but you can do it boom right
there<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:44.010> enemy<00:00:44.760> really<00:00:45.149> won't<00:00:45.329> be

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
there like that enemy really won't be

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.850 
there like that enemy really won't be
expecting<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.930> especially<00:00:46.410> if<00:00:46.500> he's<00:00:46.620> right

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
expecting that especially if he's right

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.680 
expecting that especially if he's right
on<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.100> landing<00:00:47.460> boom<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.180> can<00:00:48.329> take<00:00:48.539> them

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
on this landing boom you can take them

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.619 
on this landing boom you can take them
out<00:00:48.809> you're<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.800> lead<00:00:50.000> awesome<00:00:51.000> so

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
out you're in the lead awesome so

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:52.850 
out you're in the lead awesome so
another<00:00:51.960> thing<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.289> can<00:00:52.440> do<00:00:52.530> from<00:00:52.680> these

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
another thing you can do from these

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.860 
another thing you can do from these
things<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.280> actually<00:00:53.579> jump<00:00:53.940> around<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
things is actually jump around to the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.139 
things is actually jump around to the
landing<00:00:55.230> like<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.680> another<00:00:56.460> great<00:00:56.879> way<00:00:57.090> to

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
landing like that another great way to

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.319 
landing like that another great way to
flank<00:00:57.449> your<00:00:57.660> enemies<00:00:58.370> or<00:00:59.370> if<00:00:59.820> you're<00:01:00.180> getting

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
flank your enemies or if you're getting

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.330 
flank your enemies or if you're getting
chased<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.020> need<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.289> run<00:01:01.440> away<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:02.160> can

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
chased and need to run away you can

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.070 
chased and need to run away you can
actually<00:01:02.760> jump<00:01:03.030> from<00:01:03.270> these<00:01:03.480> little<00:01:03.870> ramp

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
actually jump from these little ramp

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.500 
actually jump from these little ramp
things<00:01:04.350> right<00:01:04.500> here<00:01:04.530> down<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.670> lift<00:01:05.909> boom

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
things right here down to the lift boom

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.679 
things right here down to the lift boom
like<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.409> can<00:01:07.560> escape<00:01:08.360> also<00:01:09.360> if

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
like that and you can escape also if

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.630 
like that and you can escape also if
you're<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.170> landing<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:10.979> your<00:01:11.310> enemies

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
you're on the landing and your enemies

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.440 
you're on the landing and your enemies
are<00:01:11.670> over<00:01:12.180> here<00:01:12.680> back<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:13.979> area<00:01:14.450> instead

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
are over here back in that area instead

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.820 
are over here back in that area instead
of<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.780> jumping<00:01:16.049> out<00:01:16.290> here<00:01:16.500> because<00:01:16.650> that's

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
of just jumping out here because that's

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.870 
of just jumping out here because that's
probably<00:01:17.159> what<00:01:17.369> they're<00:01:17.490> going<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.759> expect

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
probably what they're going to expect

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.219 
probably what they're going to expect
they're<00:01:18.299> gonna<00:01:18.390> expect<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.869> jump<00:01:19.110> out

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
they're gonna expect you to jump out

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.810 
they're gonna expect you to jump out
here<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.950> know<00:01:20.009> you're<00:01:20.310> gonna<00:01:20.369> fall<00:01:20.790> down

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
here you know you're gonna fall down

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.640 
here you know you're gonna fall down
here<00:01:21.180> your<00:01:21.360> Navy<00:01:21.750> you're<00:01:21.960> gonna<00:01:22.080> die<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.619> that

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
here your Navy you're gonna die and that

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.520 
here your Navy you're gonna die and that
sucks<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.240> can<00:01:24.330> actually<00:01:24.479> stand<00:01:25.110> on<00:01:25.380> these

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
sucks so you can actually stand on these

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.960 
sucks so you can actually stand on these
things<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.979> might<00:01:26.100> not<00:01:26.220> realize<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.880> it

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
things you might not realize that it

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.550 
things you might not realize that it
first<00:01:27.150> because<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.450> pretty<00:01:27.750> steep<00:01:28.080> angle

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
first because is a pretty steep angle

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.499 
first because is a pretty steep angle
but<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:28.829> stick<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.549> these<00:01:29.670> things<00:01:30.000> you

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
but you can stick to these things you

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.050 
but you can stick to these things you
jump<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:32.220> gives<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> really

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
jump on it and this gives you a really

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.030 
jump on it and this gives you a really
good<00:01:33.360> high<00:01:33.540> divan<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.170> made<00:01:34.409> people<00:01:34.650> behind

good high divan to made people behind
that<00:01:35.220> little<00:01:35.490> ramp<00:01:35.729> because<00:01:35.970> people<00:01:36.240> crouch

that little ramp because people crouch
behind<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.900> sometimes<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.680> strafe<00:01:38.070> around

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
behind that sometimes you strafe around

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.520 
behind that sometimes you strafe around
get<00:01:38.880> some<00:01:38.909> really<00:01:39.360> good<00:01:39.509> angles<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
get some really good angles on the the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.960 
get some really good angles on the the
guys<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.920> get<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.070> little<00:01:41.250> bit<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.460> cover<00:01:41.729> from

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
guys you get a little bit of cover from

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.580 
guys you get a little bit of cover from
these<00:01:42.119> ramps<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.720> wall<00:01:42.960> right<00:01:42.990> here<00:01:43.229> and

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
these ramps in this wall right here and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.380 
these ramps in this wall right here and
if<00:01:44.130> you're<00:01:44.280> getting<00:01:44.520> shot<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.119> you're<00:01:45.270> almost

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
if you're getting shot and you're almost

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.569 
if you're getting shot and you're almost
dead<00:01:45.659> it's<00:01:45.840> very<00:01:46.200> easy<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.619> pack<00:01:46.890> down<00:01:47.130> from<00:01:47.430> so

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
dead it's very easy to pack down from so

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.730 
dead it's very easy to pack down from so
that's<00:01:47.790> very<00:01:48.180> useful<00:01:48.420> as<00:01:48.720> well<00:01:48.869> also<00:01:49.619> if

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
that's very useful as well also if

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.929 
that's very useful as well also if
you're<00:01:49.860> getting<00:01:50.009> chased<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.579> can<00:01:50.700> actually

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
you're getting chased you can actually

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.060 
you're getting chased you can actually
jump<00:01:51.509> down<00:01:51.810> from<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.229> lift<00:01:52.439> there<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.920> might

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
jump down from the lift there that might

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.200 
jump down from the lift there that might
not<00:01:53.280> be<00:01:53.340> super<00:01:54.030> apparent<00:01:54.509> at<00:01:54.630> first<00:01:54.689> glance

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
not be super apparent at first glance

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.609 
not be super apparent at first glance
there's<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> couple<00:01:57.390> things<00:01:57.659> over<00:01:58.259> here<00:01:58.469> by

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
there's a couple things over here by

there's a couple things over here by
these<00:01:58.680> hallways<00:01:59.189> first<00:02:00.180> thing<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:01.290> right

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
these hallways first thing is this right

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.990 
these hallways first thing is this right
here<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.860> can<00:02:01.979> actually<00:02:02.100> jump<00:02:02.520> up<00:02:02.700> on<00:02:02.820> this

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
here you can actually jump up on this

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.760 
here you can actually jump up on this
little<00:02:03.270> nudge<00:02:03.630> sticking<00:02:04.200> out<00:02:04.290> right<00:02:04.320> there

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
little nudge sticking out right there

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.389 
little nudge sticking out right there
BAM<00:02:05.310> like<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.860> actually<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:08.129> lot

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
BAM like that this is actually a lot

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.949 
BAM like that this is actually a lot
better<00:02:08.640> than<00:02:08.910> just<00:02:09.119> jumping<00:02:09.450> out<00:02:09.569> here<00:02:09.750> people

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
better than just jumping out here people

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.449 
better than just jumping out here people
are<00:02:10.110> going<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.410> expect<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.860> jump<00:02:11.099> out<00:02:11.220> here

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
jump up here boom you got cover from

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.949 
jump up here boom you got cover from
this<00:02:17.760> thing<00:02:17.970> right<00:02:18.209> here<00:02:18.240> this<00:02:18.690> wall<00:02:18.930> right

right here boom you can jump up on this

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.670 
right here boom you can jump up on this
I<00:02:35.970> failed<00:02:36.239> right<00:02:36.420> there<00:02:36.600> but<00:02:37.170> if<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:37.440> hit<00:02:37.650> that

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
I failed right there but if you hit that

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.140 
I failed right there but if you hit that
little<00:02:38.010> corner<00:02:38.370> right<00:02:38.610> there<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.880> can't

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
little corner right there you can't

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.300 
little corner right there you can't
quite<00:02:39.390> jump<00:02:39.660> up<00:02:39.840> if<00:02:40.020> you're<00:02:40.470> just<00:02:40.680> doing<00:02:41.100> that

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
quite jump up if you're just doing that

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.820 
quite jump up if you're just doing that
but<00:02:41.850> if<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.090> see<00:02:42.360> that<00:02:43.020> you<00:02:43.350> hit<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.650> edge

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
but if you see that you hit that edge

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.830 
but if you see that you hit that edge
and<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.100> kind<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.340> slide<00:02:44.700> up<00:02:44.880> on<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.209> it<00:02:45.330> you

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
and you kind of slide up on to it you

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.630 
and you kind of slide up on to it you
can<00:02:45.989> get<00:02:46.170> up<00:02:46.290> onto<00:02:46.440> this<00:02:46.650> area<00:02:47.070> right<00:02:47.280> here<00:02:47.340> and

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
can get up onto this area right here and

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.190 
can get up onto this area right here and
this<00:02:47.760> can<00:02:47.940> be<00:02:48.180> also<00:02:48.420> very<00:02:48.660> useful<00:02:48.900> because

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
this can be also very useful because

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.229 
this can be also very useful because
sometimes<00:02:49.650> seems<00:02:50.220> like<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.550> kind<00:02:50.730> of<00:02:50.760> camp<00:02:51.060> out

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
sometimes seems like to kind of camp out

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.479 
sometimes seems like to kind of camp out
top<00:02:51.510> made<00:02:51.750> control<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.380> area<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.950> it's<00:02:53.220> very

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
top made control that area and it's very

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.850 
top made control that area and it's very
hard<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:53.850> take<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.209> back<00:02:54.360> so<00:02:54.600> this<00:02:54.930> can<00:02:55.530> really

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
hard to take it back so this can really

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.410 
hard to take it back so this can really
be<00:02:56.100> a<00:02:56.130> turning<00:02:56.400> point<00:02:56.550> if<00:02:56.850> you<00:02:56.940> get<00:02:57.060> up<00:02:57.180> here

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
be a turning point if you get up here

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.880 
be a turning point if you get up here
take<00:02:57.840> out<00:02:58.019> a<00:02:58.050> few<00:02:58.230> people<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.650> then<00:02:58.769> your

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
take out a few people and then your

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.449 
take out a few people and then your
teammates<00:02:59.220> can<00:02:59.370> regain<00:02:59.819> control<00:03:00.030> of<00:03:00.269> top<00:03:00.510> mid
