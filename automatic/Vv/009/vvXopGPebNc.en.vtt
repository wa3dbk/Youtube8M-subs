you afterwards
and<00:02:09.349> of<00:02:10.340> course<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.879> fig<00:02:11.060> one<00:02:11.239> is<00:02:11.360> not<00:02:11.569> able<00:02:11.720> to

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:12.189 
and of course the fig one is not able to

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:16.809 
and of course the fig one is not able to
put<00:02:13.189> it<00:02:13.280> well<00:02:13.459> on<00:02:13.730> it<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.750> then<00:02:15.680> let's<00:02:16.489> see

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
put it well on it and then let's see

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.509 
put it well on it and then let's see
their<00:02:17.150> personal<00:02:18.310> best<00:02:19.310> Mugen<00:02:19.849> and<00:02:20.110> here

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
their personal best Mugen and here

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.509 
their personal best Mugen and here
because<00:02:22.519> this<00:02:23.120> product<00:02:23.599> is<00:02:23.689> for<00:02:24.620> long<00:02:25.220> times

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
because this product is for long times

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.699 
because this product is for long times
product<00:02:26.000> so<00:02:26.180> this<00:02:26.900> part<00:02:27.200> becomes<00:02:27.470> oddish<00:02:27.920> and

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
product so this part becomes oddish and

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.190 
product so this part becomes oddish and
this<00:02:30.709> is<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.220> fake<00:02:31.549> one<00:02:31.579> the<00:02:32.230> fake<00:02:33.230> one<00:02:33.440> it's

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
this is the fake one the fake one it's

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.130 
this is the fake one the fake one it's
used<00:02:36.200> for<00:02:36.349> extent<00:02:37.239> and<00:02:39.489> the<00:02:40.489> real<00:02:40.670> one

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
used for extent and the real one

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.490 
used for extent and the real one
actually<00:02:42.140> just<00:02:42.379> a<00:02:42.769> little<00:02:43.220> bit<00:02:43.370> slightly<00:02:44.500> open

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
actually just a little bit slightly open

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.399 
actually just a little bit slightly open
and<00:02:45.890> close<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:49.030> it's<00:02:50.030> very<00:02:50.540> very<00:02:50.930> easy<00:02:51.139> to

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
and close and it's very very easy to

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:58.170 
and close and it's very very easy to
define<00:02:52.129> the<00:02:52.879> fake<00:02:53.209> one<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:53.859> the<00:02:54.859> real<00:02:55.069> one<00:02:56.829> and

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
define the fake one and the real one and

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.280 
define the fake one and the real one and
then<00:02:59.319> because<00:03:00.319> this<00:03:00.950> item<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:02.810> fake<00:03:02.959> one<00:03:03.109> is

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
then because this item the fake one is

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.289 
then because this item the fake one is
