00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.340
 hello friends welcome to the analyzes 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:14.700
 of trail running review dotcom today 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:17.860
 let's analyze the new balance mt 1010 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.300
 let's go to rules 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.300
 and you have it 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:30.610
 a shoe like I do not know if you can 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:34.090
 appreciate but really light light of 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:37.750
 wax a sneaker 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.430
 that without being 100% minimalist yes 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.850
 is in that trend in fact it's from the 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:47.050
 mini balance mousse series here what 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:49.550
 you can see I do not know if you get to read but 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.890
 It's from that series 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.290
 there is that as I tell you new has 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.860
 other totally minimalist sneakers 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:02.140
 but here, as you see in the media 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.670
 sole yes there is a profile more or less 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.130
 marked 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.590
 and a small drop of 4 millimeters 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.259
 exactly towards the front 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.509
 how is the fall of the back 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:16.670
 towards the front we will see by 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.560
 so let's start with parts for that 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.140
 let's see this sole so 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.920
 feature of balls like 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.200
 connected as practically neuronal and 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.390
 sole to start from the house vibrate 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.490
 Super abrasion resistant so 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:37.009
 we could see the moment as one to one 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.580
 we have tried but it is the impression 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:45.170
 that gives us and as you see very oriented 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:47.100
 set here the cut completely 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.310
 favoring the grip of all this 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.200
 front side fixes here the cut 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.790
 to favor all this part of the 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.850
 grip from the bridge backwards 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.740
 just the opposite teeth towards the other 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.570
 meaning to favor that when 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.110
 we stepped on heel in the descents 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:09.530
 Do not slip the shoe to stand out 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:12.800
 also the plate that incorporates 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:16.130
 fix here hard plastic to avoid the 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.740
 impact of the stones on our foot 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:24.690
 directly as you can see, not everything is sole 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:27.330
 but there are enough holes without material 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.550
 thing that makes you gain weight or lose 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.100
 weight that does not weigh so much the shoe and 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:36.750
 balance has chosen to put this plate 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:39.150
 here in between to avoid those those 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.590
 direct impacts of the fixed sole 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.569
 as well 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.160
 as the plate goes beyond 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.470
 and also prevents 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.200
 the lateral torsion of the shoe with 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.900
 which here the plate is going 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.410
 quite a bit more for back, notice that they weigh 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.610
 easy enough to be a sneaker 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.620
 these characteristics 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.800
 it even costs a little bit because of the 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:08.090
 plate but see how I can get to 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.810
 touch with the toe to the heel without many 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.870
 problems 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.450
 here also a small three tacos no 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.730
 it's a part where you usually support a lot 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.130
 weight where you tend to pull a lot 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.890
 but yes to give some stability 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.750
 also to the sole will have to see this 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.660
 stability because logically with these 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.550
 little dots here in the heel is going to be a 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.610
 topic to be taken into account although if 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:35.180
 you see here the width and especially from 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.340
 above, notice that the width here is 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.970
 quite important is a sneaker that 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:44.390
 it opens pretty forward let's see it 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.730
 up as you see a super person 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.739
 flimsy super light 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.319
 we do not think it's a per that endurance 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.109
 much although yes that all these parts 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.090
 of plastic here give you a certain 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:00.490
 structure again to be a 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:04.710
 Minimalist slipper can be 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:07.030
 quite subject here a side part 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:10.510
 here with the logo of the brand and here another 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.450
 part more in a synthetic material that 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.770
 they give certain this certain subjection to everything 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.860
 what would the foot be while the 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:21.340
 front part is somewhat wider 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:26.130
 for the toe area the heel 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.130
 also with structure here you see it 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.120
 set as the really the weight where 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:36.400
 is where this shoe has lost the 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.400
 weight is all in the part of the bitch 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:43.150
 and a tissue like micro leak 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.250
 excessively breathable is 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.250
 breathable but one of the most 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:52.420
 breathable but yes that is giving 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.590
 quite subject to all the part of the 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.110
 upper the least is the sensation 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.540
 that is transmitting to us we are going to 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.520
 open them now 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.790
 before that's why I want to show you the 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.660
 tongue 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:08.790
 also a characteristic account and it's 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.090
 that fixes practically is that they are two 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:14.190
 pieces of cloth is the minimum of the 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.180
 tongue expressions that we have seen 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.310
 in our analyzes 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.110
 for it as it does not have much tongue 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.380
 new balance has opted for laces 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:27.260
 quite broad and quite flat for 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.950
 that when we tensed 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.720
 do not bother much to the foot therefore 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:35.480
 here they have succeeded I think with 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.660
 very flat laces so it does not bother 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.950
 to the instep since the tongue as you see 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:43.190
 it's practically like a cigarette paper 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.830
 practically absolutely nothing we are going to 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.660
 see inside a heel a bit 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.780
 padded 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:53.270
 slightly outside also of normal 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.849
 what would be an ultra shoe 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.979
 minimalist and with 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:59.880
 with an interior absolutely without 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:02.940
 seams 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:06.420
 look here you can see this interior 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:10.980
 goes up to the front 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:13.710
 or super super comfortable fixes that the 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.330
 tongue here sewn what would be 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.470
 to prevent the entry of elements 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.160
 external 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:22.280
 here you see it with the minimum symbol 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.980
 from new balance 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:28.550
 you see how it also goes way back 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:31.370
 in the laces and not far ahead here 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.380
 You see it, therefore, quite subject in the 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:37.550
 part 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:40.160
 of the bridge of the instep and not so much in 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:42.520
 the fingers so a concept of 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.210
 shoe 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:48.340
 being minimalist you get a little bit of 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:50.800
 ultra minimalism with protections 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:53.919
 pretty marked as you see here in front 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.379
 as the shura goes up a little something that 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:59.760
 It also gives some marked stability 

00:06:56.379 --> 00:07:02.370
 heel structure on the heel 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.139
 so you can see it and we have our 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:08.620
 doubts about everything he 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:11.710
 the part is tacos here and how is it going to 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:14.139
 answer he was told especially if the 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.909
 time to step on we 're going to be able to 

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:17.590
 stabilize the foot well or not but good 

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:23.099
 that's something that we're going to have to do 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:25.710
 on the ground of these new balance mt 

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:30.460
 1010 are solid also gives the material 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:32.889
 of the midsole is the replay of a 

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:36.069
 material that according to new balance offers 

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:39.520
 much less weight with a better response 

00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:42.699
 specifically earning 30% respect to 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:46.029
 other materials similar to me 

00:07:42.699 --> 00:07:48.759
 particularly the design I love a 

00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:52.150
 shoe maybe to start with the 

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:55.599
 minimalism or not go so straight to 

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:58.180
 minimalism and you get a little 

00:07:55.599 --> 00:08:00.280
 enter and it's being a bit between the 

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.620
 medium 

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.750
 at the gates let's say what is the 

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:08.950
 Minimalism so here it 

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:11.380
 the new balance mt 1010 minimum analyzed 

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:14.340
 for bringing us running dotcom review 

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.340
 we see in the next analysis
