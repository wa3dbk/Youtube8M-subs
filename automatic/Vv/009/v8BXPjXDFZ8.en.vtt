00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
for that but I think we fixed it i think

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.310 
for that but I think we fixed it i think
it<00:00:39.329> was<00:00:39.450> an<00:00:39.570> issue<00:00:39.719> with<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.930> microphone<00:00:40.260> i

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
it was an issue with the microphone i

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.720 
it was an issue with the microphone i
think<00:00:40.620> we've<00:00:40.770> taken<00:00:41.040> care<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.430> from<00:00:41.640> now

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
think we've taken care of that from now

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.100 
think we've taken care of that from now
on<00:00:41.760> we'll<00:00:42.329> try<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.600> thought<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.870> happen

progress<00:04:18.710> our<00:04:18.979> board<00:04:19.280> so<00:04:19.549> we<00:04:19.580> can<00:04:19.790> drop

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
and kill a creature in the same pattern

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.440 
and kill a creature in the same pattern
so<00:04:25.100> it<00:04:25.220> doesn't<00:04:25.460> it<00:04:25.610> lets<00:04:25.790> us<00:04:25.910> not<00:04:26.090> fall<00:04:26.330> behind

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
bring in a lot of these and finally we

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.790 
bring in a lot of these and finally we
have<00:05:23.420> some<00:05:23.540> swamps<00:05:23.870> since<00:05:24.320> we<00:05:24.440> have<00:05:24.470> a<00:05:24.620> lot<00:05:24.770> of

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
black cards in the sideboard we can swap

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.890 
black cards in the sideboard we can swap
out<00:05:28.010> some<00:05:28.250> mountains<00:05:28.640> for<00:05:28.910> swamps<00:05:29.300> that's<00:05:29.660> one

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
out some mountains for swamps that's one

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.150 
out some mountains for swamps that's one
use<00:05:30.050> of<00:05:30.260> it<00:05:30.350> and<00:05:30.530> also<00:05:30.620> when<00:05:30.830> we<00:05:30.920> bring<00:05:31.040> in

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
use of it and also when we bring in

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.710

necrotic<00:05:31.460> ooze<00:05:31.700> not<00:05:31.970> only<00:05:32.240> is<00:05:32.360> he<00:05:32.540> more

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
necrotic ooze not only is he more

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.240 
necrotic ooze not only is he more
expensive<00:05:33.170> than<00:05:33.290> anything<00:05:33.650> in<00:05:33.740> the<00:05:33.830> deck<00:05:34.010> he

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
expensive than anything in the deck he

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.580 
expensive than anything in the deck he
costs<00:05:34.550> for<00:05:34.850> but<00:05:35.510> he's<00:05:35.630> also<00:05:35.750> double<00:05:36.110> black<00:05:36.290> so

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
costs for but he's also double black so

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.050 
costs for but he's also double black so
we<00:05:36.710> can<00:05:36.920> just<00:05:37.220> throw<00:05:37.460> in<00:05:37.730> these<00:05:37.910> swamps

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
we can just throw in these swamps

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.000 
we can just throw in these swamps
usually<00:05:38.990> we're<00:05:39.320> bringing<00:05:39.590> in<00:05:39.650> the<00:05:39.710> necrotic

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010
