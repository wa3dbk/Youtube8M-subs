00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:08.480 

I<00:00:02.629> built<00:00:03.629> this<00:00:04.310> pulse<00:00:05.310> motor<00:00:07.490> contraption

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
I built this pulse motor contraption

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:08.950 
I built this pulse motor contraption
here

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
here

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.509 
here
after<00:00:09.960> watching<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:11.130> video<00:00:12.440> by<00:00:13.440> Axel<00:00:14.099> zero

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
after watching the video by Axel zero

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.720 
after watching the video by Axel zero
zero<00:00:14.849> zero<00:00:14.969> one<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.750> it's<00:00:16.320> basically<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.340> same

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.790 

based<00:00:20.730> on<00:00:20.939> all<00:00:21.090> these<00:00:21.300> his<00:00:21.810> schematics<00:00:22.109> and

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
based on all these his schematics and

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.060 
based on all these his schematics and
all<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:24.050> other<00:00:25.050> parts<00:00:25.500> are<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.859> same

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
all of the other parts are the same

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.220 
all of the other parts are the same
except<00:00:26.550> he<00:00:26.849> was<00:00:27.000> using<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.390> light<00:00:27.570> disc<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.109> I'm

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
except he was using a light disc and I'm

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.310 
except he was using a light disc and I'm
using<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.859> quite<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.400> heavy<00:00:29.640> flywheel<00:00:30.000> here<00:00:30.630> and

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.840 

now<00:00:34.320> we're<00:00:34.590> going<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.860> connect<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> battery

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
now we're going to connect the battery

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:44.170 
now we're going to connect the battery
up<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.300> then<00:00:38.239> give<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.480> slight<00:00:40.050> nudge<00:00:40.410> and

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.920 

get<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.270> going<00:00:46.910> once<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.090> starts<00:00:48.450> going<00:00:48.690> it

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
get it going once it starts going it

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.630 
get it going once it starts going it
takes<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.260> while<00:00:49.440> for<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.829> flywheel<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.399> wind

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
takes a while for the flywheel to wind

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.260 
takes a while for the flywheel to wind
up<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:52.460> the<00:00:54.890> maximum<00:00:55.890> rpm<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.610> got<00:00:56.820> out<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.149> it

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
up and the maximum rpm I got out of it

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:06.289 
up and the maximum rpm I got out of it
was<00:00:59.899> 217<00:01:00.899> rpm<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.739> think<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.039> was<00:01:04.909> so<00:01:05.909> just<00:01:06.150> to

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
was 217 rpm I think it was so just to

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.850 
was 217 rpm I think it was so just to
shorten<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.780> up<00:01:06.990> I'm<00:01:07.170> going<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.380> help<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.770> out

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
shorten this up I'm going to help it out

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.429 
shorten this up I'm going to help it out
here<00:01:09.530> just<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.710> get<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.950> up<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.189> speed<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:12.439> once

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
here just to get it up to speed and once

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.499 
here just to get it up to speed and once
it's<00:01:13.650> running<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.520> just<00:01:14.549> keeps<00:01:15.060> going<00:01:15.479> and

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
it's running it just keeps going and

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.730 
it's running it just keeps going and
speed<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> graduated<00:01:17.130> gains<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.549> speed<00:01:17.880> until

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
speed a graduated gains in speed until

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.010 
speed a graduated gains in speed until
it<00:01:19.740> reaches<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.220> maximum<00:01:20.340> rpm<00:01:21.330> D<00:01:21.540> Reed

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
it reaches the maximum rpm D Reed

it reaches the maximum rpm D Reed
switches<00:01:22.380> at<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> back<00:01:23.009> over<00:01:23.369> here<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:24.860> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
switches at the back over here and the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.730 
switches at the back over here and the
coil<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.549> same<00:01:26.820> as<00:01:27.030> here<00:01:27.509> zero<00:01:27.840> axial<00:01:28.500> zero

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
zero or once except I didn't use LEDs in

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.340 
zero or once except I didn't use LEDs in
there<00:01:33.979> now<00:01:35.090> this<00:01:36.090> was<00:01:36.360> an<00:01:36.479> important<00:01:36.990> thing<00:01:37.170> I

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
there now this was an important thing I

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.200 
there now this was an important thing I
want<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.619> point<00:01:37.799> out<00:01:40.250> regarding<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:41.909> setup

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
want to point out regarding this setup

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.630 
want to point out regarding this setup
and<00:01:42.720> he<00:01:42.930> was<00:01:43.079> wondering<00:01:43.439> why<00:01:43.590> his<00:01:43.950> LED<00:01:44.430> was

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
and he was wondering why his LED was

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.480 
and he was wondering why his LED was
lighting<00:01:45.090> up<00:01:45.210> when<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.860> his<00:01:46.860> disc<00:01:47.280> was

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
lighting up when the his disc was

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.310 
lighting up when the his disc was
running<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.060> reason<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.750> think<00:01:48.810> is

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
running and the reason I think is

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.550 
running and the reason I think is
because<00:01:49.350> we're<00:01:50.070> getting<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:51.750> reverse<00:01:51.960> EMF

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
because we're getting the reverse EMF

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:03.020 
because we're getting the reverse EMF
back<00:01:55.560> into<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.100> battery<00:02:01.610> when<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.759> coil

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
back into the battery when the coil

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.639 
back into the battery when the coil
field<00:02:04.159> collapses<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.659> I'm<00:02:06.659> going<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.110> turn<00:02:07.439> the

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
field collapses so I'm going to turn the

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:14.360 
field collapses so I'm going to turn the
camera<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.959> to<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.370> meter<00:02:11.370> here

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.210 

and<00:02:15.370> then<00:02:15.519> I'm<00:02:15.700> going<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.239> connect<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.349> leads

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
and then I'm going to connect the leads

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.259 
and then I'm going to connect the leads
of<00:02:18.519> the<00:02:18.930> altimeter<00:02:19.930> on<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:24.459> I'd<00:02:24.879> like<00:02:25.030> you<00:02:25.180> to

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
of the altimeter on and I'd like you to

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.809 
of the altimeter on and I'd like you to
observe<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:27.120> battery<00:02:28.120> voltage<00:02:28.150> on<00:02:28.840> this

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
observe the battery voltage on this

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.649 
observe the battery voltage on this
little<00:02:30.819> utility<00:02:31.329> battery<00:02:31.989> here<00:02:33.390> this<00:02:34.390> is<00:02:34.540> the

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
little utility battery here this is the

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:40.490 
little utility battery here this is the
voltages<00:02:35.200> that<00:02:35.500> show<00:02:35.739> up<00:02:37.650> at<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.950> battery

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
voltages that show up at the battery

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:48.979 
voltages that show up at the battery
post<00:02:41.500> itself<00:02:46.200> quite<00:02:47.200> amazing<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:47.799> would<00:02:47.950> say

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
post itself quite amazing I would say

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:55.349 
post itself quite amazing I would say
I'm<00:02:49.989> getting<00:02:50.140> up<00:02:50.379> to<00:02:50.560> 20<00:02:50.739> volts<00:02:51.519> 35<00:02:52.329> 41<00:02:53.640> 12<00:02:54.640> 13

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:55.359 
I'm getting up to 20 volts 35 41 12 13

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.470 
I'm getting up to 20 volts 35 41 12 13
17<00:02:55.870> 26<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:57.430> on<00:02:57.579> and<00:02:57.760> on<00:02:57.819> and<00:02:58.030> goes<00:02:58.180> I<00:02:58.420> think

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
17 26 and on and on and goes I think

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.809 
17 26 and on and on and goes I think
it's<00:02:58.720> charging<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.709> battery<00:03:00.099> as<00:03:00.849> it<00:03:01.359> runs<00:03:02.819> so

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
it's charging the battery as it runs so

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:18.229 
it's charging the battery as it runs so
that's<00:03:04.239> quite<00:03:04.599> an<00:03:04.780> interesting<00:03:05.430> development

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.940 

and<00:03:19.239> there<00:03:19.599> you<00:03:19.720> have<00:03:19.930> it<00:03:21.900> for<00:03:22.900> magnets<00:03:23.380> with

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
and there you have it for magnets with

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:32.400 
and there you have it for magnets with
the<00:03:24.069> North<00:03:24.250> Pole<00:03:24.550> facing<00:03:24.910> outwards<00:03:29.130> that's<00:03:30.130> it
