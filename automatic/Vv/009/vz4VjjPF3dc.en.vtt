and<00:00:01.170> now<00:00:01.350> today<00:00:01.709> we're<00:00:01.860> going<00:00:01.949> to<00:00:02.040> talk<00:00:02.250> a

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
and now today we're going to talk a

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.039 
and now today we're going to talk a
little<00:00:02.460> bit<00:00:02.580> more<00:00:02.700> about<00:00:03.360> filtration<00:00:03.870> of<00:00:04.609> the

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:06.049 
little bit more about filtration of the

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.890 
little bit more about filtration of the
Nano<00:00:07.049> Lagoon<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.950> simple<00:00:08.340> inexpensive<00:00:09.179> reef

tank for newbies and in a previous video

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.220 
tank for newbies and in a previous video
we<00:00:13.110> talked<00:00:13.380> about<00:00:13.650> this<00:00:13.860> aqua<00:00:14.670> tech<00:00:15.230> 515

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
we talked about this aqua tech 515

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.950 
we talked about this aqua tech 515
filter<00:00:16.949> this<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.000> simple<00:00:18.359> hang<00:00:18.600> on<00:00:18.810> the

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
filter this is the simple hang on the

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.769 
filter this is the simple hang on the
back<00:00:19.109> filter<00:00:19.710> unit<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.460> we<00:00:21.000> showed<00:00:21.420> you

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
back filter unit and we showed you

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.000 
back filter unit and we showed you
what's<00:00:22.590> inside<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.359> simple<00:00:25.010> sponge

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
what's inside and it is a simple sponge

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.070 
what's inside and it is a simple sponge
type<00:00:26.400> filter<00:00:26.880> like<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.750> if<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.900> look

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
type filter like this and if you look

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.640 
type filter like this and if you look
carefully<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:29.250> can<00:00:29.400> see<00:00:29.460> some<00:00:29.880> little

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
carefully you can see some little

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.340 
carefully you can see some little
granules<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:32.009> activated<00:00:32.969> carbon<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.930> there

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
granules of activated carbon in there

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.310 
granules of activated carbon in there
and<00:00:34.590> those<00:00:35.190> granules<00:00:35.700> have<00:00:35.790> activated<00:00:36.690> carbon

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
and those granules have activated carbon

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.869 
and those granules have activated carbon
served<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.430> remove<00:00:38.969> some<00:00:39.450> dissolved<00:00:40.260> organic

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
served to remove some dissolved organic

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.760 
served to remove some dissolved organic
pollutants<00:00:41.879> from<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.390> water<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.989> might

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
pollutants from the water that might

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.479 
pollutants from the water that might
ordinarily<00:00:44.690> tint<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.930> water<00:00:46.219> yellow<00:00:47.219> and

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
ordinarily tint the water yellow and

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.479 
ordinarily tint the water yellow and
reduce<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.719> clarity<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.710> water<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.219> we<00:00:50.250> do

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
reduce the clarity of the water so we do

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.000 
reduce the clarity of the water so we do
think<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.350> activated<00:00:52.350> carbon<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.949> a

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
think that the activated carbon is a

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.310 
think that the activated carbon is a
good<00:00:53.399> thing<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.820> use<00:00:54.030> periodically<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.140> don't

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
good thing to use periodically you don't

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.910 
good thing to use periodically you don't
have<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:56.239> go<00:00:57.239> crazy<00:00:57.539> on<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.930> but<00:00:58.289> once<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.680> month

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
have to go crazy on it but once a month

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.959 
have to go crazy on it but once a month
is<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.820> recommended<00:01:00.739> change<00:01:01.739> interval<00:01:02.579> for

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
is the recommended change interval for

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.060 
is the recommended change interval for
these<00:01:03.120> filter<00:01:04.049> units<00:01:04.500> who<00:01:04.589> want<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.890> show<00:01:05.010> you

try to brush those amphipods back into
the<00:01:29.159> tank<00:01:29.460> now<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.840> manufacturer<00:01:31.409> would<00:01:32.130> like

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
the tank now the manufacturer would like

3-pack<00:01:40.470> picked<00:01:41.280> up<00:01:41.460> at<00:01:41.670> Walmart<00:01:42.229> for<00:01:43.229> about<00:01:43.320> $6

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
3-pack picked up at Walmart for about $6

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.490 
3-pack picked up at Walmart for about $6
so<00:01:44.549> they're<00:01:44.700> about<00:01:44.869> $2<00:01:45.869> apiece<00:01:45.899> for<00:01:46.439> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
so they're about $2 apiece for the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.370 
so they're about $2 apiece for the
replacement<00:01:46.860> units<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.869> can<00:01:49.049> go<00:01:49.200> that

route if you want but if you are like us
you<00:01:52.590> try<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.890> economize<00:01:53.790> at<00:01:54.060> every<00:01:54.360> step

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
you try to economize at every step

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.139 
you try to economize at every step
especially<00:01:55.590> if<00:01:56.040> you're<00:01:56.219> running<00:01:56.430> lots<00:01:56.880> of

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
especially if you're running lots of

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.030 
especially if you're running lots of
aquariums<00:01:57.780> if<00:01:58.049> you're<00:01:58.170> just<00:01:58.320> running<00:01:58.590> one

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
aquariums if you're just running one

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.039 
aquariums if you're just running one
it's<00:01:59.759> no<00:02:00.000> big<00:02:00.240> deal<00:02:00.450> but<00:02:00.659> what<00:02:00.810> if<00:02:00.930> you're

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
it's no big deal but what if you're

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.590 
it's no big deal but what if you're
running<00:02:01.200> six<00:02:01.619> or<00:02:01.950> ten<00:02:02.189> or<00:02:02.369> twenty<00:02:02.700> or<00:02:03.180> thirty

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
running six or ten or twenty or thirty

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.889 
running six or ten or twenty or thirty
then<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.710> look<00:02:04.920> for<00:02:04.950> ways<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.340> economize<00:02:06.090> so

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
then you look for ways to economize so

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.830 
then you look for ways to economize so
I'm<00:02:06.960> going<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.170> show<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.590> used<00:02:08.310> filter<00:02:09.300> pad

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
I'm going to show you a used filter pad

all the stuff off it after actually
saving<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.670> amphipods<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:22.049> living<00:02:22.379> things

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
saving the amphipods the living things

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.309 
saving the amphipods the living things
went<00:02:22.799> back<00:02:22.950> into<00:02:23.189> the<00:02:23.400> tank<00:02:23.670> we<00:02:24.200> rinsed<00:02:25.200> out

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
of cloudy muddy stuff and we actually

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.610 
of cloudy muddy stuff and we actually
took<00:02:31.019> a<00:02:31.590> box<00:02:32.310> cutter<00:02:32.640> or<00:02:33.239> a<00:02:33.870> pair<00:02:34.230> of<00:02:34.260> scissors

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
took a box cutter or a pair of scissors

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.009 
took a box cutter or a pair of scissors
just<00:02:35.340> indicating<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:35.879> kind<00:02:36.120> of<00:02:36.239> scissors<00:02:36.599> and

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
just indicating the kind of scissors and

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.369 
just indicating the kind of scissors and
we<00:02:37.260> made<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.739> little<00:02:37.950> opening<00:02:38.939> near<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.720> top<00:02:40.019> of

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
we made a little opening near the top of

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.860 
we made a little opening near the top of
the<00:02:40.620> pad<00:02:40.859> very<00:02:41.220> carefully<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:41.909> we<00:02:42.329> dumped<00:02:42.720> out

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
the pad very carefully and we dumped out

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.379 
the pad very carefully and we dumped out
the<00:02:43.470> carbon<00:02:43.890> granules<00:02:44.310> these<00:02:44.700> are<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:45.000> spent

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:45.389 
the carbon granules these are the spent

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:47.420 
the carbon granules these are the spent
granules<00:02:46.019> that<00:02:46.109> had<00:02:46.349> already<00:02:46.650> done<00:02:46.920> their<00:02:47.099> job

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
granules that had already done their job

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.229 
granules that had already done their job
and<00:02:47.459> and<00:02:47.909> absorb<00:02:48.720> some<00:02:48.950> organic<00:02:49.950> dyes<00:02:50.700> from

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
and and absorb some organic dyes from

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.390 
and and absorb some organic dyes from
the<00:02:51.450> water<00:02:51.690> so<00:02:52.019> we<00:02:52.049> can't<00:02:52.349> use<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.739> again<00:02:53.129> but

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
the water so we can't use that again but

carbon<00:03:44.870> into<00:03:45.870> your<00:03:46.650> filter<00:03:47.250> box<00:03:47.489> and<00:03:47.909> that's

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
carbon into your filter box and that's

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.960 
carbon into your filter box and that's
what<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.079> do<00:03:49.260> so<00:03:49.560> what<00:03:50.129> I'm<00:03:50.280> saying<00:03:50.549> is<00:03:50.760> that
