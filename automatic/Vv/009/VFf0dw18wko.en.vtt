00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.989 
that every just I expected everything
there<00:04:48.469> was<00:04:48.590> nothing<00:04:48.800> out<00:04:49.159> of<00:04:49.189> my<00:04:49.370> past<00:04:49.639> I

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:49.999 
there was nothing out of my past I

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:54.640 
there was nothing out of my past I
wasn't<00:04:50.389> afraid<00:04:50.479> to<00:04:50.599> answer<00:04:50.840> and<00:04:53.379> for<00:04:54.379> like<00:04:54.620> I
