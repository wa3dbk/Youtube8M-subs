00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.910
 and of course we have to talk about that 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.339
 presentation that was last week 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:11.030
 of the graduate who prepares monolith 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:13.280
 software and nintendo for wii and the truth 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.980
 is that impressive is that noble 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.380
 x chronicles which we fills the 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.690
 slippery slime mouth every time 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.670
 we talk about him and it is not for less 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.650
 this time we are going to stay with 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.300
 that cover because it's the cover 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.850
 Japanese of the title the truth is that a 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.719
 I find it spectacular and very successful 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:35.059
 and new images this time images 

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:37.100
 let's say in frozen vouchers are frames 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.190
 taken directly from the playable part 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.260
 of the title of a wii and attentive to the 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.050
 quality offered by the title I think that 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.489
 They are spoiling enough and appa to weigh 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.980
 that a lot of people are saying that there 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.170
 downgrade in this title a slump 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.079
 graphic I'm not in agreement at all 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.909
 in fact even in the faces that is what 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.789
 more criticized if you look closely at a 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.929
 of the images there is a face that to me 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.789
 it makes you think that 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:05.500
 effectively even the faces I think 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.479
 that are improving or at least I 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.890
 it looks like this in an image 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.350
 that has appeared worth of a character 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.180
 feminine in the rest is true that there 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.670
 another image in which the possible faces 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.220
 so I do not know is that they are I think it's 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.470
 the aesthetics that they want to give him but not 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.970
 good the rest of the awesome game 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.310
 at least what has been seen until the 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.679
 moment and the truth is that they have been said 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.539
 many things of the title up to 32 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.429
 players will be able to be connected 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.100
 passively to exchange 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:35.170
 strategic information and objects though 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.750
 your online capabilities do not end 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.270
 here because eye with this that noble and 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.009
 chronicles x because up to four 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.380
 users can collaborate together to 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.659
 fulfill missions in cooperative I think that 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.810
 this title is going to be incredible the 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.549
 resolution of the game will be 720p is 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.770
 another one of the things that have been said and 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.929
 we can connect a usb keyboard to 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.060
 communicate with the other players or 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.580
 well use the touch screen of the 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.680
 bulli gamepad to type I think to 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.900
 I find this more comfortable 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.610
 not be there with a keyboard even 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.360
 apart is a good use that can be 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.640
 give 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.740
 to that screen whose gamepad does not 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.600
 total we will have five continents 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.580
 complete to explore in this that 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.830
 noble the chronicles xy each of 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.860
 they will be formed by a large 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.450
 amount of gigantic areas the world 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.170
 of the game promises to be really 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.060
 amazing huge and great 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.880
 developers had already warned a 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.250
 immense title for wii and by the way 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.110
 It has also been said that we can not 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.600
 access all the sites 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.690
 only walking on foot we will have to 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.390
 use the so-called mecas good here 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.800
 they call them dolls that are those robots that 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.290
 we will use to go flying that the 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.239
 truth is that I repeat every time they leave 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.070
 the images that flying in the robots 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.780
 I think it's amazing, I think that 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.120
 noble and chronicles x is one of those 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.120
 titles that when it comes out we have to 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.239
 lock ourselves in our room in our 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.920
 fourth and not put another game until 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.410
 let's finish this great adventure that 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.520
 promises because I think it can be very 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.620
 exciting 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.150
 impressive of course we will continue 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.040
 talking about this title because the truth 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.620
 is that many things were said in that 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.740
 presentation and it's worth talking about 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.740
 the
