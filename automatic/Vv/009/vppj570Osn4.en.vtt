census is used in a variety of climates

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:13.630 
census is used in a variety of climates

you may not have gloves on this is to

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.930 
you may not have gloves on this is to
keep<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:24.560> metal<00:04:24.800> away<00:04:25.190> from<00:04:25.460> the<00:04:25.550> skin<00:04:25.820> of

keep the metal away from the skin of
your<00:04:26.060> hand<00:04:26.360> is<00:04:26.630> there<00:04:26.960> clamp<00:04:27.349> which<00:04:27.890> is<00:04:28.070> why

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
your hand is there clamp which is why

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.490 
your hand is there clamp which is why
the<00:04:28.310> handles<00:04:29.120> on<00:04:29.360> both<00:04:29.390> top<00:04:29.750> and<00:04:29.810> bottom

the handles on both top and bottom

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.040 
the handles on both top and bottom
are<00:04:30.560> raised<00:04:31.490> up<00:04:31.820> from<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:32.330> metal<00:04:32.600> itself<00:04:32.840> now

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
are raised up from the metal itself now

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.970 
are raised up from the metal itself now
in<00:04:33.170> actuality<00:04:33.560> it<00:04:34.520> doesn't<00:04:34.910> really<00:04:35.030> work

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
in actuality it doesn't really work

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.410 
in actuality it doesn't really work
there<00:04:36.980> are<00:04:37.130> points<00:04:37.430> you<00:04:37.610> can<00:04:37.760> feel<00:04:38.090> especially

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
there are points you can feel especially

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.860 
there are points you can feel especially
along<00:04:38.990> in<00:04:39.140> here<00:04:39.500> where<00:04:40.190> the<00:04:41.030> wood<00:04:41.240> is<00:04:41.270> just<00:04:41.660> not

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
along in here where the wood is just not

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.420 
along in here where the wood is just not
raised<00:04:42.140> up<00:04:42.320> enough<00:04:42.590> and<00:04:42.770> your<00:04:42.980> hand<00:04:43.250> will

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
raised up enough and your hand will

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.030 
raised up enough and your hand will
contact<00:04:43.910> the<00:04:44.120> metal<00:04:44.360> so<00:04:44.510> but<00:04:44.690> all<00:04:45.440> in<00:04:45.710> all<00:04:45.800> in

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
contact the metal so but all in all in

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.960 
contact the metal so but all in all in
theory<00:04:48.010> it<00:04:49.480> it<00:04:50.480> works<00:04:51.310> but<00:04:52.310> of<00:04:52.610> course<00:04:52.850> what

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
theory it it works but of course what

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.190 
theory it it works but of course what
I'll<00:04:53.060> do<00:04:53.180> is<00:04:53.300> I'll<00:04:53.420> probably<00:04:53.480> put<00:04:53.750> a<00:04:53.810> grip<00:04:54.050> on

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
I'll do is I'll probably put a grip on

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.320 
I'll do is I'll probably put a grip on
there<00:04:54.380> to<00:04:54.620> improve<00:04:54.950> control<00:04:55.460> I<00:04:55.670> don't<00:04:55.880> want<00:04:56.270> to

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
there to improve control I don't want to

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.330 
there to improve control I don't want to
destroy<00:04:56.720> these<00:04:57.020> these<00:04:57.470> handles<00:04:57.890> they're<00:04:58.070> very

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
destroy these these handles they're very

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.570 
destroy these these handles they're very
very<00:04:58.580> nicely<00:04:58.880> done<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.660> of<00:05:00.290> course<00:05:00.590> the<00:05:00.860> the

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
very nicely done and of course the the

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.200 
very nicely done and of course the the
copper<00:05:01.970> rivets<00:05:02.500> are<00:05:03.500> very<00:05:03.800> nice<00:05:04.070> and<00:05:04.490> I'd<00:05:05.030> like

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
copper rivets are very nice and I'd like

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.390 
copper rivets are very nice and I'd like
to<00:05:05.270> keep<00:05:05.510> them<00:05:05.750> intact<00:05:06.110> so<00:05:06.440> not<00:05:06.950> gonna<00:05:07.070> change

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
to keep them intact so not gonna change

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.590 
to keep them intact so not gonna change
these<00:05:07.669> at<00:05:07.850> all<00:05:07.970> I<00:05:08.000> was<00:05:08.120> thinking<00:05:08.150> about<00:05:08.360> maybe

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
these at all I was thinking about maybe

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.780 
these at all I was thinking about maybe
filling<00:05:09.050> them<00:05:09.140> in<00:05:09.200> with<00:05:09.260> silicone<00:05:09.919> on<00:05:10.430> the<00:05:10.610> top

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
filling them in with silicone on the top

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.220 
filling them in with silicone on the top
and<00:05:10.880> then<00:05:11.030> putting<00:05:11.210> a<00:05:11.330> grip<00:05:11.510> on<00:05:11.660> but<00:05:12.140> I<00:05:12.169> think

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
and then putting a grip on but I think

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.140 
and then putting a grip on but I think
I'll<00:05:12.440> just<00:05:12.470> leave<00:05:12.650> it<00:05:12.800> and<00:05:13.010> do<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:13.669> wrap<00:05:13.880> with

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
I'll just leave it and do the wrap with

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.950 
I'll just leave it and do the wrap with
a<00:05:14.180> tube<00:05:14.480> and<00:05:14.930> go<00:05:15.350> there<00:05:16.240> edge<00:05:17.240> is<00:05:17.480> very<00:05:17.720> good

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
a tube and go there edge is very good

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.270 
a tube and go there edge is very good
there's<00:05:18.140> a<00:05:18.230> little<00:05:18.440> bit<00:05:18.560> of<00:05:18.680> wear<00:05:18.830> on<00:05:18.860> this<00:05:19.130> you

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
there's a little bit of wear on this you

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.500 
there's a little bit of wear on this you
could<00:05:19.400> see<00:05:19.610> where<00:05:19.760> he<00:05:19.880> did<00:05:20.060> a<00:05:20.090> little<00:05:20.330> bit<00:05:20.419> of

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
could see where he did a little bit of

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.360 
could see where he did a little bit of
chopping<00:05:20.900> test<00:05:21.140> on<00:05:21.290> it<00:05:21.320> but<00:05:21.860> again<00:05:21.890> like<00:05:22.220> I

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
chopping test on it but again like I

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.260 
chopping test on it but again like I
said<00:05:22.430> he<00:05:22.700> took<00:05:22.850> that<00:05:23.000> into<00:05:23.180> consideration

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
said he took that into consideration

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.290 
said he took that into consideration
when<00:05:24.050> he<00:05:24.140> priced<00:05:24.440> it<00:05:24.650> and<00:05:25.070> all<00:05:25.850> in<00:05:26.000> all<00:05:26.120> I<00:05:26.150> think

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
when he priced it and all in all I think

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.970 
when he priced it and all in all I think
I<00:05:26.540> got<00:05:26.720> a<00:05:26.750> very<00:05:27.020> good<00:05:27.200> deal<00:05:27.410> out<00:05:27.590> of<00:05:27.620> it<00:05:27.740> now<00:05:27.919> the

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
I got a very good deal out of it now the

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.360 
I got a very good deal out of it now the
one<00:05:28.250> thing<00:05:28.520> that<00:05:29.300> I<00:05:29.330> didn't<00:05:29.870> like<00:05:30.080> about<00:05:30.380> this

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
one thing that I didn't like about this

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.550 
one thing that I didn't like about this
and<00:05:31.640> of<00:05:32.000> course<00:05:32.270> because<00:05:32.690> it<00:05:32.840> is<00:05:32.870> stock<00:05:33.320> issue

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
and of course because it is stock issue

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.590 
and of course because it is stock issue
and<00:05:33.770> they<00:05:33.830> made<00:05:34.010> these<00:05:34.160> by<00:05:34.310> the<00:05:34.370> millions<00:05:34.910> it's

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
and they made these by the millions it's

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.469 
and they made these by the millions it's
still<00:05:35.870> making<00:05:36.020> them<00:05:36.260> I<00:05:36.380> believe<00:05:37.150> the<00:05:38.150> sheaths

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
still making them I believe the sheaths

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:41.770 
still making them I believe the sheaths
