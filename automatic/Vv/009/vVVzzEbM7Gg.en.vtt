these<00:00:00.780> are<00:00:01.020> the<00:00:01.110> blades<00:00:01.800> these<00:00:01.979> are<00:00:02.250> the<00:00:02.310> main

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
these are the blades these are the main

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.230 
these are the blades these are the main
blades<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.659> relatively<00:00:04.170> flat<00:00:04.589> bottom<00:00:05.240> high

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
blades the relatively flat bottom high

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.930 
blades the relatively flat bottom high
camber<00:00:06.990> blades<00:00:07.319> so<00:00:08.010> that<00:00:08.220> means<00:00:08.460> they<00:00:08.730> produce

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
camber blades so that means they produce

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.780 
camber blades so that means they produce
a<00:00:09.240> lot<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.599> lift<00:00:09.870> at<00:00:10.410> relatively<00:00:11.070> low<00:00:11.219> speeds

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
a lot of lift at relatively low speeds

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.589 
a lot of lift at relatively low speeds
now<00:00:12.440> the<00:00:13.440> Icarus<00:00:13.830> royal<00:00:14.190> has<00:00:14.549> maximum<00:00:15.240> head

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
now the Icarus royal has maximum head

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.380 
now the Icarus royal has maximum head
speed<00:00:16.020> which<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.800> rotation<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.150> main

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
speed which is the rotation of the main

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.990 
speed which is the rotation of the main
rotor<00:00:18.630> head<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:21.380> 1,650<00:00:22.380> these<00:00:22.710> blades<00:00:23.640> need<00:00:23.939> to

rotor head of 1,650 these blades need to

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.509 
rotor head of 1,650 these blades need to
be<00:00:24.150> balanced<00:00:24.689> they<00:00:25.470> need<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.800> be<00:00:25.949> balanced

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
be balanced they need to be balanced

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.720 
be balanced they need to be balanced
both<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.500> themselves<00:00:28.670> finding<00:00:29.670> out

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
both in and of themselves finding out

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.120 
both in and of themselves finding out
where<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.060> center<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.480> gravity<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.560> then

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
where the center of gravity is and then

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.670 
where the center of gravity is and then
as<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.460> pair<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.630> make<00:00:33.840> sure<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.230> they<00:00:34.410> both

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
as a pair to make sure that they both

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.729 
as a pair to make sure that they both
were<00:00:35.120> exactly<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.210> same<00:00:36.300> now<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.200> also<00:00:37.530> have

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
were exactly the same now you also have

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.209 
were exactly the same now you also have
to<00:00:38.190> balance<00:00:38.450> the<00:00:39.450> tail<00:00:39.719> blades<00:00:40.079> now<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.190> a

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
to balance the tail blades now this is a

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.139 
to balance the tail blades now this is a
simple<00:00:41.550> jig<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.600> made<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:44.000> balance<00:00:45.000> the

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
simple jig that I made to balance the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.600 
simple jig that I made to balance the
blades<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.719> my<00:00:45.899> coaxial<00:00:46.800> helicopter<00:00:46.829> that

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
blades on my coaxial helicopter that

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.970 
blades on my coaxial helicopter that
you've<00:00:47.760> probably<00:00:48.030> seen<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.410> works<00:00:49.649> fine

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
you've probably seen and it works fine

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.540 
you've probably seen and it works fine
for<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:50.489> -<00:00:50.879> it's<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.809> threaded<00:00:52.350> rod<00:00:52.590> with

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
for this - it's just a threaded rod with

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.959 
for this - it's just a threaded rod with
a<00:00:53.579> collar<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.750> nut<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.260> one<00:00:55.500> end<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.730> can

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
a collar and a nut on one end and I can

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.569 
a collar and a nut on one end and I can
lay<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:59.160> jig<00:00:59.430> over<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> side<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:01.309> desk<00:01:02.309> or

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
lay the jig over the side of a desk or

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.880 
lay the jig over the side of a desk or
table<00:01:02.760> like<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.439> see<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
table like this and you can see the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.359 
table like this and you can see the
blades<00:01:05.640> rotating<00:01:06.320> now<00:01:07.320> as<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.650> can<00:01:07.830> see<00:01:08.040> these

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
blades rotating now as you can see these

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.910 
blades rotating now as you can see these
are<00:01:08.640> pretty<00:01:09.000> well<00:01:09.299> balanced<00:01:10.020> when<00:01:10.409> they<00:01:10.560> stop

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
are pretty well balanced when they stop

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.850 
are pretty well balanced when they stop
they'll<00:01:11.310> pretty<00:01:11.729> much<00:01:12.090> be<00:01:12.330> horizontal<00:01:13.110> which

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
they'll pretty much be horizontal which

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.649 
they'll pretty much be horizontal which
is<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> good<00:01:14.340> thing<00:01:14.610> that's<00:01:14.790> really<00:01:15.180> what<00:01:15.479> you

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
is a good thing that's really what you

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.130 
is a good thing that's really what you
want

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
want

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.649 
want
if<00:01:16.200> one<00:01:16.979> blade<00:01:17.280> was<00:01:17.580> significantly<00:01:18.330> heavier

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
if one blade was significantly heavier

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.929 
if one blade was significantly heavier
than<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.259> other<00:01:19.290> then<00:01:20.130> what<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.549> would<00:01:20.700> want

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
than the other then what you would want

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.940 
than the other then what you would want
to<00:01:21.000> do<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.479> take<00:01:21.750> some<00:01:21.780> clear<00:01:22.320> cellophane<00:01:22.740> tape

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
to do is take some clear cellophane tape

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.300 
to do is take some clear cellophane tape
and<00:01:23.600> then<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.110> flat<00:01:25.500> surface<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
and then on the flat surface of the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.679 
and then on the flat surface of the
blade<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.909> if<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.150> look<00:01:27.299> at<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.509> blade

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
blade and if you look at the blade

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.719 
blade and if you look at the blade
you'll<00:01:27.990> see<00:01:28.229> there's<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.500> curved<00:01:29.220> upper

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
you'll see there's a curved upper

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.149 
you'll see there's a curved upper
surface<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:31.140> flat<00:01:31.439> surface

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
surface and a flat surface

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.460 
surface and a flat surface
now<00:01:32.850> sometimes<00:01:33.390> they're<00:01:33.600> symmetrical<00:01:34.320> I

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
now sometimes they're symmetrical I

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.990 
now sometimes they're symmetrical I
believe<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:35.009> these<00:01:35.159> tail<00:01:35.490> blades<00:01:35.790> are

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
believe that these tail blades are

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.899 
believe that these tail blades are
symmetrical<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.380> want<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.950> put<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.430> piece

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
symmetrical so you want to put a piece

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.499 
symmetrical so you want to put a piece
of<00:01:39.119> tape<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:41.280> surface<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.270> blade

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
of tape on the surface of the blade

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.700 
of tape on the surface of the blade
towards<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.290> tip<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.920> these<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:45.000> doesn't<00:01:45.270> add

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
towards the tip on these it doesn't add

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.639 
towards the tip on these it doesn't add
the<00:01:46.710> static<00:01:47.189> balance<00:01:47.610> isn't<00:01:48.119> as<00:01:48.530> important<00:01:49.530> as

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
the static balance isn't as important as

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.050 
the static balance isn't as important as
the<00:01:49.770> big<00:01:49.920> rotor<00:01:50.189> blades<00:01:50.689> until<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.850> high

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
the big rotor blades until the high

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.230 
the big rotor blades until the high
blade<00:01:54.420> became<00:01:55.350> heavier<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.880> wind<00:01:57.090> up

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
blade became heavier and you wind up

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.990 
blade became heavier and you wind up
with<00:01:57.299> something<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:57.930> this<00:01:58.430> now<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.490> larger

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
with something like this now the larger

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.060 
with something like this now the larger
main<00:02:00.210> blades<00:02:00.570> can<00:02:00.960> be<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> little<00:02:01.619> bit<00:02:01.860> more

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
main blades can be a little bit more

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.249 
main blades can be a little bit more
difficult<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.790> balance<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.540> need<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.960> find

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
difficult to balance you need to find

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.210 
difficult to balance you need to find
the<00:02:05.219> static<00:02:06.000> balance<00:02:06.659> point<00:02:06.960> which<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.439> the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
the static balance point which is the

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.490 
the static balance point which is the
center<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.610> gravity<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.539> single<00:02:10.200> blade

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
center of gravity of the single blade

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.640 
center of gravity of the single blade
and<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.039> best<00:02:11.250> way<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.430> do<00:02:11.670> that

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
and the best way to do that

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.530 
and the best way to do that
is<00:02:13.650> using<00:02:14.070> something<00:02:14.460> like<00:02:14.760> this<00:02:14.910> architects

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
is using something like this architects

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.540 
is using something like this architects
scale<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:17.520> can<00:02:17.700> balance<00:02:17.910> this<00:02:18.330> blade<00:02:18.690> on

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
scale that you can balance this blade on

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.360 
scale that you can balance this blade on
until<00:02:20.550> you<00:02:20.700> get<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.140> until<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.470> find<00:02:22.830> the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
until you get it until you find the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.660 
until you get it until you find the
balance<00:02:23.550> point<00:02:23.880> on<00:02:24.390> this<00:02:24.570> blade<00:02:24.870> now<00:02:25.860> when<00:02:26.550> you

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
balance point on this blade now when you

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.580 
balance point on this blade now when you
find<00:02:26.910> this<00:02:27.060> balance<00:02:27.300> point<00:02:27.810> it's<00:02:28.080> good<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.350> put

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
find this balance point it's good to put

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.070 
find this balance point it's good to put
a<00:02:28.620> couple<00:02:29.220> of<00:02:29.310> very<00:02:29.640> small<00:02:30.030> reference<00:02:30.690> marks

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
a couple of very small reference marks

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.520 
a couple of very small reference marks
so<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.320> when<00:02:31.740> you<00:02:31.890> do<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.460> larger<00:02:33.530> dynamic

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
so that when you do the larger dynamic

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.920 
so that when you do the larger dynamic
balancing<00:02:35.130> of<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.400> blade<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.600> need<00:02:36.810> to

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
balancing of the blade and you need to

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.250 
balancing of the blade and you need to
add<00:02:37.110> tape<00:02:38.010> or<00:02:38.340> material<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.240> one<00:02:39.630> blade<00:02:39.960> or<00:02:40.170> the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
add tape or material to one blade or the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.410 
add tape or material to one blade or the
other<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:41.370> want<00:02:41.520> to<00:02:41.640> place<00:02:41.880> it<00:02:42.120> at<00:02:42.240> that

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
other you want to place it at that

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.190 
other you want to place it at that
center<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:42.930> gravity<00:02:44.240> okay<00:02:45.240> you<00:02:45.300> can<00:02:45.690> see<00:02:45.900> here

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
center of gravity okay you can see here

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.380 
center of gravity okay you can see here
this<00:02:46.440> blade<00:02:46.740> is<00:02:46.980> perfectly<00:02:47.730> balanced<00:02:48.210> on

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
this blade is perfectly balanced on

this blade is perfectly balanced on
there<00:02:48.690> it's<00:02:49.050> not<00:02:49.290> one<00:02:50.100> side<00:02:50.400> or<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.670> other<00:02:50.720> so

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
there it's not one side or the other so

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.720 
there it's not one side or the other so
I'm<00:02:51.810> going<00:02:51.990> to<00:02:52.050> take<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.260> very<00:02:52.980> small<00:02:53.070> marking

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
I'm going to take a very small marking

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.970 
I'm going to take a very small marking
pen<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.270> put<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.600> dot<00:02:55.050> on<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.500> leading<00:02:55.710> edge

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
pen and put a dot on the leading edge

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.940 
pen and put a dot on the leading edge
and<00:02:56.340> on<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.550> trailing<00:02:56.850> edge<00:02:57.180> so<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.170> know<00:02:58.470> when

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
and on the trailing edge so I know when

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.040 
and on the trailing edge so I know when
I<00:02:59.070> go<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.310> dynamically<00:03:00.210> balanced<00:03:00.840> these

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
I go to dynamically balanced these

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.870 
I go to dynamically balanced these
blades<00:03:01.880> where<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:03.120> add<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.630> tape<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:04.170> make<00:03:04.320> it

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.760 
blades where to add the tape to make it
that<00:03:05.880> blade<00:03:06.210> a<00:03:06.240> little<00:03:06.750> bit<00:03:06.900> heavier<00:03:07.320> if<00:03:07.560> it's

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
that blade a little bit heavier if it's

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.670 
that blade a little bit heavier if it's

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
the light blade balancing is a really

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.170 
the light blade balancing is a really
important<00:03:11.160> step<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:11.760> don't<00:03:11.940> want<00:03:12.120> to

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
important step and you don't want to

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.310 
important step and you don't want to
skip<00:03:12.510> this<00:03:13.100> now<00:03:14.100> there<00:03:14.370> are<00:03:14.460> some<00:03:14.610> really<00:03:14.910> nice

can do and I'm gonna show you kind of a

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.210 
can do and I'm gonna show you kind of a
low<00:03:30.090> cost<00:03:30.450> method<00:03:30.840> of<00:03:31.110> doing<00:03:31.290> this<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:32.040> can

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
low cost method of doing this you can

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.330 
low cost method of doing this you can
bolt<00:03:32.600> the<00:03:33.600> blades<00:03:33.900> together<00:03:34.230> probably<00:03:35.220> with

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
bolt the blades together probably with

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.320 
bolt the blades together probably with
the<00:03:35.460> mounting<00:03:35.820> hardware

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
the mounting hardware

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.790 
the mounting hardware
make<00:03:37.230> sure<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.980> leading<00:03:38.340> edges<00:03:38.730> are<00:03:39.000> parallel

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
make sure the leading edges are parallel

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.050 
make sure the leading edges are parallel
they're<00:03:40.800> not<00:03:40.950> going<00:03:41.130> to<00:03:41.190> match<00:03:41.430> but<00:03:41.880> they'll

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
they're not going to match but they'll

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.990 
they're not going to match but they'll
be<00:03:42.210> parallel<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.140> then<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.400> can<00:03:44.580> suspend

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
be parallel and then you can suspend

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
be parallel and then you can suspend
this<00:03:45.540> whole<00:03:45.840> rig<00:03:46.820> between<00:03:47.820> two<00:03:48.120> kitchen

this whole rig between two kitchen
glasses<00:03:49.710> and<00:03:50.100> what<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:50.580> does<00:03:50.790> is<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.090> gives

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
glasses and what that does is it gives

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.000 
glasses and what that does is it gives
you<00:03:51.570> a<00:03:51.600> very<00:03:51.930> low<00:03:52.410> friction<00:03:53.570> bearing<00:03:54.950> now<00:03:55.950> you

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
you a very low friction bearing now you

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.520 
you a very low friction bearing now you
can<00:03:56.310> see<00:03:56.520> that<00:03:56.850> this<00:03:57.030> blade<00:03:57.390> this<00:03:58.050> blade<00:03:58.350> over

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
can see that this blade this blade over

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.320 
can see that this blade this blade over
here<00:03:58.830> is<00:03:59.040> a<00:03:59.070> little<00:03:59.220> heavier<00:03:59.730> so<00:04:00.000> what<00:04:00.240> I'm

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
here is a little heavier so what I'm

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.580 
here is a little heavier so what I'm
going<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:00.510> do<00:04:00.690> is<00:04:00.810> I'm<00:04:00.960> going<00:04:01.020> to<00:04:01.140> add<00:04:01.290> some

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
going to do is I'm going to add some

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.720 
going to do is I'm going to add some
tape<00:04:01.950> to<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:03.000> high<00:04:03.270> blade<00:04:03.770> at<00:04:04.770> the<00:04:04.830> balancing

point the center of gravity of this

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.720 
point the center of gravity of this
blade<00:04:08.090> until<00:04:09.090> it<00:04:09.390> comes<00:04:09.780> down<00:04:10.110> and<00:04:10.730> balances

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
blade until it comes down and balances

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.250 
blade until it comes down and balances
I've<00:04:12.450> added<00:04:13.160> clear<00:04:14.160> cellophane<00:04:14.760> tape<00:04:15.109> to<00:04:16.109> the

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
I've added clear cellophane tape to the

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.849 
I've added clear cellophane tape to the
flat<00:04:16.590> side<00:04:16.980> of<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.540> high<00:04:18.540> blade<00:04:19.049> at<00:04:19.440> the
