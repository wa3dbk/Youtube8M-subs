00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.730
 lesson bone forever we are here in a 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.040
 new video of gta 5 online a new 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.870
 episode of hackers in gta 5 and one then 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.889
 this time I bring you something pretty cool the 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.570
 truth is that it has enough things 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:18.980
 fun and good first thing 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.349
 everything that we are going to be able to see then it is here 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.819
 and become a shark basically 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.189
 and the truth is that it is quite wajir 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:26.630
 swimming around with the shark and good 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.550
 well things thanks to when 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.689
 You come out of water like you're drowning 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.130
 that is, you run out of 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.079
 breathing and the truth is that I do not know 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.420
 It's pretty cool to be a shark 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.250
 the truth is that you should not molar and 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.870
 Well, these modes that I'm going to teach 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.180
 in this video are the update 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.950
 past or be pulled right towards the 115 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.300
 so at the moment all this does not 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.920
 it works simply I already had it 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.600
 recorded a while ago I pass it or 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.210
 loquillo that I will leave week in the 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.800
 description and such as always and good 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.970
 well basically now I think now 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.260
 same nothing works so I'm not going to 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.670
 leave the motes in the description because 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.740
 they basically do not work right now 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.420
 within a given day it will surely return 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.310
 to work but well, here you have 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.660
 be a shark first of all that the 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.009
 truth is that it gives me quite as I have 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.439
 said and nothing because the following we are going to 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.759
 have here a tram that we're going to be 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.579
 in all the city 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.079
 basically going around I mean flip 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:13.759
 makes incredible movements 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:15.859
 going through things and everything and the 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.149
 truth is that amazing is not going to go with 

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:19.159
 the changed imagine that you are 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.109
 in an online game and people have 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.600
 to freak out and well, the truth is that 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:25.670
 it's pretty cool all that and nothing all 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.770
 these modes that are a large scale with 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.119
 things so big with modifications so 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.409
 great of the game are friends that more 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.030
 they like it and the truth is that it does not hurt 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.649
 nobody as I always say was not 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.389
 killing a child by doing nothing or doing nothing 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.340
 weird so well then it's pretty 

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:39.530
 cool and good over here I will leave a 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.929
 section of a bunch of weapons that 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.549
 shoot or see how we shoot a 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.279
 kind of weird red ray that 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.990
 they bounce and explode or be something pretty 

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:50.119
 weird and good then there where we can 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.279
 shoot with a gun like that in plan 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.810
 submachine gun with super explosions italy 

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:55.010
 now you will see what looks like with the rpc 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.530
 let's shoot 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.420
 with green rays and the truth 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.660
 pretty cool and as you can see super recharge 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.100
 super but super hyper fast or not 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.500
 it gives him time to put the car and nothing 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.850
 makes a super speed and the truth 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.070
 which is cool enough to have now 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.290
 you had rmc to bust all the 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.770
 world in a second then we have here 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.900
 an extinguisher that explodes or is something 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.490
 quite weird as you see we launched it and 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.770
 hits and all the police come out 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.870
 fired the first thing that the extinguisher is 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.790
 a weapon that good a weapon an object that 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.430
 is not in the normal online gta but 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.350
 like all this and good after what 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.270
 we can throw that is already a thing of 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.470
 another world and well, here we have a 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.310
 bunch of characters that I'm going to 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.710
 teach in which we can 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.880
 transform as you see here the devil 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.410
 this that the truth is that it is quite 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.510
 cool and then you will see 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.730
 franklin transformations and Maikel 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.430
 from a lot of people that good without 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.660
 shirt with half body a lot of 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.910
 pretty web stuff as you see here goes 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.310
 like a policeman's dress and with a beard 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.959
 I do not know quite weird and it lacks medium 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.120
 body basically that the most striking 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.850
 then also how are we going to be able to see 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.520
 well to trevor and a lot of things that 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.020
 see who wears a harness 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.340
 that is some incredible clothes and 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.780
 basically as I said you will have the 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.180
 loquillo channel in the description 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.080
 all of these modes in this episode do not 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.480
 I'll put them at least for now 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.640
 when they come back out and they work 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.110
 I'll put them in the description and nothing 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.450
 already after this you are going to see good 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.160
 flip-side, that is, with pants and 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.680
 underpants or what the fuck is for the 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.970
 my ankles this I really liked 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.860
 because it's quite funny and with the 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.020
 pants there are stuck fag guy
