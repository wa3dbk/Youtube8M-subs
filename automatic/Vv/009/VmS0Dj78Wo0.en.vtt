00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
myself I need to combine a bunch of

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.210 
myself I need to combine a bunch of
rulers<00:00:26.910> into<00:00:27.240> one<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.779> what<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.019> did<00:00:28.140> was<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.920> took

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
rulers into one so what I did was I took

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.849 
rulers into one so what I did was I took
a<00:00:29.939> regular<00:00:30.390> quilting<00:00:31.080> really<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.439> was<00:00:31.590> four

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
a regular quilting really that was four

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.560 
a regular quilting really that was four
by<00:00:32.009> eight<00:00:32.040> which<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.579> size<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.180> one<00:00:33.390> I

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
by eight which is the size of this one I

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.720 
by eight which is the size of this one I
took<00:00:33.930> another<00:00:34.380> ruler<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:34.890> was<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> square

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
took another ruler that was a square

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.670 
took another ruler that was a square
ruler<00:00:36.000> where<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.390> 45<00:00:36.840> degree<00:00:37.110> angle<00:00:37.350> lines<00:00:37.500> go

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
ruler where the 45 degree angle lines go

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.260 
ruler where the 45 degree angle lines go
into<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> corner<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.489> then<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.059> took<00:00:39.120> a

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
into the corner and then I took a

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.240 
into the corner and then I took a
cutting<00:00:39.660> guide<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.350> had<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.680> grooves<00:00:40.950> cut

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
cutting guide that had the grooves cut

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.580 
cutting guide that had the grooves cut
out<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.579> combine<00:00:41.879> them<00:00:42.059> into<00:00:42.239> one<00:00:42.390> tool<00:00:42.809> now

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
out and combine them into one tool now

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.470 
out and combine them into one tool now
the<00:00:43.649> reason<00:00:44.250> why<00:00:44.399> it's<00:00:44.610> four<00:00:44.910> by<00:00:45.030> eight<00:00:45.059> is

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
the reason why it's four by eight is

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.069 
the reason why it's four by eight is
when<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.660> hand<00:00:46.050> my<00:00:46.110> draperies<00:00:46.770> from<00:00:47.309> my<00:00:47.460> DVD

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
when I hand my draperies from my DVD

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.139 
when I hand my draperies from my DVD
1:08<00:00:49.079> designer<00:00:49.620> draperies<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:50.789> have<00:00:51.030> our

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
1:08 designer draperies we have our

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.060 
1:08 designer draperies we have our
draperies<00:00:51.629> up<00:00:51.809> at<00:00:51.930> eight<00:00:52.110> inches<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.590> then<00:00:52.980> we

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
draperies up at eight inches and then we

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.860 
draperies up at eight inches and then we
fold<00:00:53.280> them<00:00:53.430> under<00:00:53.610> four<00:00:53.850> inches<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.180> then

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
fold them under four inches and then

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.450 
fold them under four inches and then
when<00:00:55.020> we<00:00:55.140> mark<00:00:55.469> our<00:00:55.649> pleats<00:00:55.980> we<00:00:56.160> mark<00:00:56.340> them

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
when we mark our pleats we mark them

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.889 
when we mark our pleats we mark them
four<00:00:56.699> inches<00:00:56.850> apart<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.210> that's<00:00:57.449> why<00:00:57.750> it's

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
four inches apart so that's why it's

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.170 
four inches apart so that's why it's
just<00:00:57.989> nice<00:00:58.320> little<00:00:58.530> size<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.730> other<00:00:59.910> thing
