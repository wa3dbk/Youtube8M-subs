00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:18.080
 hi this show hang this is a show in 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.820
 which I compared different people to 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.730
 last time we talked about such 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.340
 projects like shit question and challenge with 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.250
 huge voting advantage 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.900
 defeated the challenge namely bone imac 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.059
 today we will talk about two 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.309
 modern geniuses without them you would 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.650
 I was sitting at a computer now and not 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:40.100
 would brag about your new iphone yes yes 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:43.760
 it is about steve jobs and bill gates we 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.980
 start don't switch steve jobs 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.920
 full name steven floor jobs 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:53.090
 the creator of apple was born 2 4 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.370
 February 1 1955 San Francisco State 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.910
 california symbol from poor working 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.280
 families 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.550
 only got an average education 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.750
 like after the first year of study in 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.630
 university he left on his own 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.580
 to wish 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:11.450
 William Keith, the creator of microsoft 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.729
 born October 28 in 1955 in 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.979
 Washington USA and I have come true enough 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.899
 rich family studied in a private school and 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.039
 always been an excellent university 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:23.869
 disaccustomed two years and then he was kicked out and 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:27.440
 so i'm starting to compare but don't forget 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.270
 I compare and you choose my group 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.640
 VKontakte will vote can credit 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.830
 always down before comparing them 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.229
 brainchild namely microsoft and 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.179
 apple let's talk about bill themselves 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.479
 gates has always been an excellent and clever 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:43.819
 he was from a wealthy family and always 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.250
 so was boring and without imagination steve 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:48.649
 Jobs was from a poor family in his company 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.170
 considered an exile but he was very 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.509
 creative person eggs and jobs one 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.849
 time even quarreled with the courts but then 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.920
 over time over the years they realized that 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:59.690
 quarrel is not necessary and even somehow 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.599
 interacted and helped each other 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.270
 from university bill gates was expelled 

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:07.550
 and steve jobs left bill gates himself created 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.739
 first software steve 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.959
 Jobs one of the first to start massively 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.450
 releasing computers charity 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.720
 this is what bill gates was doing almost 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.410
 always and engaged now with a steve 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.050
 jobs and say that 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.650
 nothing difference between the creation of these firms 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.260
 But the year is still microsoft on earlier 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.170
 appeared gate created what is needed 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.730
 a job created something that is not necessary but 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.400
 can i have an apple 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.800
 beauty microsoft style and design 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.900
 functionality practicality and features 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.460
 microsoft guess what 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.590
 necessary for the consumer 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.840
 The apple itself forms and imposes 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.910
 priorities at microsoft range of products 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.300
 little more so any 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.480
 mouse accessories all sorts of different 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.170
 other devices as well as x-box apple 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.260
 basically 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.050
 iPhone and MacBook Bring water and aimags 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.240
 another why is steve jobs more popular i 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.270
 I will answer this question because the matter is 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.370
 representation of the company ie in advertising 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.400
 apple always provided its devices 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.490
 very impressive and easy to understand 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.070
 microsoftâ€™s language is boringly abstruse and 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:20.100
 tedious if you talk about operating 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:24.209
 systems such ios and windows to windows 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:26.370
 probably all the same more simple and discovery 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.709
 but because of this, windows is much bigger 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.530
 viruses and piracy speaking of 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.810
 quality and keeping the apple of course 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.930
 better but windows seems better to me 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.209
 because appearance is not important 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.130
 the main functionality and practicality on 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.140
 this moment you might think that i 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.780
 just rogue and can't afford 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.060
 something from apple is not even if u 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.900
 I was millions I would still choose 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.850
 windows 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.400
 but if we talk about devices such as 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:58.110
 smartphones i don't know what i would choose 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:01.080
 android windows phone or ios is simply not 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:04.260
 I know that's all 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.450
 I determined the winner for you 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.910
