can come up with it this is a technique
I<00:01:48.670> like<00:01:48.910> doing<00:01:49.150> it's<00:01:49.980> not<00:01:50.980> only<00:01:51.220> not<00:01:51.340> suggested

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
allowed to I don't know why instead of

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:03.420 
allowed to I don't know why instead of
me<00:01:56.170> going<00:01:59.160> down<00:02:00.160> down<00:02:00.520> down<00:02:00.940> well<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:02.190> can<00:02:03.190> speed

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
up and down from this joint it's not

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.620 
up and down from this joint it's not
this<00:02:38.329> now<00:02:39.329> it's<00:02:40.110> from<00:02:40.410> this<00:02:40.620> joint<00:02:40.980> right<00:02:41.190> here

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
this now it's from this joint right here

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.890 
this now it's from this joint right here
connects<00:02:42.630> with<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.930> hand<00:02:44.120> all<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.450> foam<00:02:45.660> has

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
to move I do it in a big scale it should

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.839 
to move I do it in a big scale it should
be<00:02:48.390> like<00:02:49.610> like<00:02:50.610> that<00:02:52.040> one<00:02:53.040> last<00:02:53.250> note<00:02:53.489> if<00:02:53.790> you
