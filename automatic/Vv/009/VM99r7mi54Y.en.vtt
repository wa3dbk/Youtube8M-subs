days<00:01:41.630> death<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.840> part<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.380> business<00:01:43.770> I've

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
days death is part of this business I've

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.649 
days death is part of this business I've
heard<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.399> speak<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.210> not<00:01:45.329> uncommon

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
heard you speak and it is not uncommon

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.300 
heard you speak and it is not uncommon
as<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:45.960> climb<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.320> nan<00:01:46.680> everest<00:01:47.040> where<00:01:47.220> you

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
as you climb to nan everest where you

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.670 
as you climb to nan everest where you
climb<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.670> k2<00:01:48.060> there<00:01:49.020> are<00:01:49.140> people<00:01:49.350> who<00:01:49.439> didn't

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
climb to k2 there are people who didn't

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.749 
climb to k2 there are people who didn't
make<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.009> they've<00:01:50.159> been<00:01:50.310> there<00:01:50.430> for<00:01:50.610> quite

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
make it and they've been there for quite

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.160 
make it and they've been there for quite
some<00:01:50.970> time<00:01:51.000> you'll<00:01:51.299> pass<00:01:51.509> bodies<00:01:51.869> on<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.049> way

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
some time you'll pass bodies on the way

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.429 
some time you'll pass bodies on the way
up<00:01:52.290> that's<00:01:52.770> true<00:01:53.009> yeah<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.790> mean<00:01:54.180> when<00:01:55.140> they<00:01:55.259> say

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
up that's true yeah I mean when they say

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.780 
up that's true yeah I mean when they say
they<00:01:55.560> were<00:01:55.619> covering<00:01:56.070> these<00:01:56.250> people<00:01:56.610> are<00:01:56.729> they

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
they were covering these people are they

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.010 
they were covering these people are they
going<00:01:57.090> up<00:01:57.180> there<00:01:57.360> hoping<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.630> find<00:01:57.840> them<00:01:57.960> alive

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
going up there hoping to find them alive

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.389 
going up there hoping to find them alive
but<00:01:58.469> what<00:01:58.649> what<00:01:58.740> do<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.860> think<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.100> going<00:01:59.219> on

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
but what what do you think is going on

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.160 
but what what do you think is going on
it's<00:02:00.000> it's<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.420> tough<00:02:00.600> thing<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.049> almost

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
it's it's a tough thing and it almost

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.690 
it's it's a tough thing and it almost
arm<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.680> just<00:02:01.860> reminded<00:02:02.219> me<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.369> little<00:02:02.579> bit

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
arm it just reminded me a little bit

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.459 
arm it just reminded me a little bit
because<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.570> avalanche<00:02:03.960> was<00:02:04.079> in<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.290> place

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
because this avalanche was in a place

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.660 
because this avalanche was in a place
called<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.829> bottleneck<00:02:05.219> now<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.549> haven't

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
called the bottleneck now I haven't

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.190 
called the bottleneck now I haven't
climbed<00:02:05.939> k2<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.479> having<00:02:06.630> no<00:02:06.750> plans<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.110> were

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
climbed k2 and having no plans that were

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.749 
climbed k2 and having no plans that were
to<00:02:07.290> do<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.530> but<00:02:08.099> there's<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.340> very<00:02:08.520> dangerous

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
to do that but there's a very dangerous

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.160 
to do that but there's a very dangerous
place<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.300> I've<00:02:09.390> seen<00:02:09.569> in<00:02:09.660> pictures<00:02:09.959> called

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
place that I've seen in pictures called

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.449 
place that I've seen in pictures called
the<00:02:10.259> bottleneck<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.739> it's<00:02:11.009> like<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.250> worst

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
the bottleneck and it's like the worst

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.450 
the bottleneck and it's like the worst
place<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.910> an<00:02:12.000> avalanche

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
place that an avalanche

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.600 
place that an avalanche
it<00:02:12.520> happen<00:02:12.880> and<00:02:13.830> very<00:02:14.830> very<00:02:15.010> difficult<00:02:15.190> place

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
it happen and very very difficult place

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.370 
it happen and very very difficult place
people<00:02:16.030> are<00:02:16.090> slowed<00:02:16.420> down<00:02:16.630> there<00:02:16.960> so<00:02:17.170> it<00:02:17.230> was

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
people are slowed down there so it was

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.810 
people are slowed down there so it was
the<00:02:17.500> worst<00:02:17.710> place<00:02:17.980> for<00:02:18.010> an<00:02:18.220> avalanche<00:02:18.490> to<00:02:18.580> come

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
the worst place for an avalanche to come

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.880 
the worst place for an avalanche to come
down<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.120> take<00:02:19.240> people<00:02:19.540> out<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:20.080> almost<00:02:20.410> left

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
down and take people out it almost left

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.770 
down and take people out it almost left
people<00:02:21.190> above<00:02:21.550> that<00:02:21.730> part<00:02:22.060> unable<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.510> get

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
people above that part unable to get

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.660 
people above that part unable to get
down<00:02:22.990> kind<00:02:23.590> of<00:02:23.620> like<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.830> Twin<00:02:24.040> Towers<00:02:24.070> and

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
down kind of like the Twin Towers and

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.420 
down kind of like the Twin Towers and
then<00:02:24.850> in<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:25.510> one<00:02:25.990> people<00:02:26.650> above<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.190> crash

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
then in a one people above the crash

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.160 
then in a one people above the crash
site<00:02:27.700> were<00:02:27.880> unable<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.180> get<00:02:28.480> down<00:02:28.630> through<00:02:28.900> it

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
site were unable to get down through it

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.630 
site were unable to get down through it
same<00:02:29.350> thing<00:02:29.530> here<00:02:29.710> only<00:02:29.920> in<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.100> tallest

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
same thing here only in the tallest

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.730 
same thing here only in the tallest
mountain<00:02:30.880> when<00:02:31.150> you<00:02:31.300> climb<00:02:31.690> is<00:02:32.200> an<00:02:32.410> avalanche

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
mountain when you climb is an avalanche

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.410 
mountain when you climb is an avalanche
just<00:02:33.100> like<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.370> mount<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.700> monster<00:02:34.390> that

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
just like the mount the monster that

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.970 
just like the mount the monster that
might<00:02:34.750> get<00:02:34.960> you<00:02:35.140> there's<00:02:35.320> nothing<00:02:35.620> you<00:02:35.710> can<00:02:35.860> do

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
might get you there's nothing you can do

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.260 
might get you there's nothing you can do
about<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.250> if<00:02:36.430> one<00:02:36.580> comes<00:02:36.820> along<00:02:36.940> now<00:02:37.120> it's

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
about it if one comes along now it's

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.910 
about it if one comes along now it's
called<00:02:37.450> objective<00:02:37.930> hazard<00:02:38.380> which<00:02:38.530> means<00:02:38.740> it's

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
called objective hazard which means it's

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.650 
called objective hazard which means it's
really<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.370> didn't<00:02:39.700> do<00:02:39.760> anything<00:02:39.940> wrong<00:02:40.300> it's

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
really you didn't do anything wrong it's

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.610 
really you didn't do anything wrong it's
just<00:02:40.720> here<00:02:40.900> in<00:02:40.990> the<00:02:41.050> wrong<00:02:41.200> place<00:02:41.440> at<00:02:41.590> the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
just here in the wrong place at the

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.260 
just here in the wrong place at the
wrong<00:02:41.800> time<00:02:41.860> and<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:42.760> can<00:02:42.910> kill<00:02:43.030> you<00:02:43.180> on

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
wrong time and that can kill you on

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.580 
wrong time and that can kill you on
Everest<00:02:43.660> too<00:02:43.870> but

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
Everest too but

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.290 
Everest too but
k2<00:02:44.860> is<00:02:45.040> a<00:02:45.130> little<00:02:45.310> special<00:02:45.700> that<00:02:45.850> terrain<00:02:46.150> is

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
k2 is a little special that terrain is

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.720 
k2 is a little special that terrain is
very<00:02:46.330> very<00:02:46.690> steep<00:02:46.990> and<00:02:47.230> also<00:02:47.920> at<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.190> the

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
very very steep and also at the the

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.240 
very very steep and also at the the
storms<00:02:49.120> are<00:02:49.210> very<00:02:49.360> freakish<00:02:49.810> on<00:02:50.020> k2<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.830> little

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
storms are very freakish on k2 a little

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.520 
storms are very freakish on k2 a little
bit<00:02:51.340> easier<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:51.700> predict<00:02:52.090> on<00:02:52.210> Everest<00:02:52.660> so<00:02:52.840> k2

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
bit easier to predict on Everest so k2

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.350 
bit easier to predict on Everest so k2
is<00:02:53.800> definitely<00:02:54.310> those<00:02:54.610> shorter<00:02:54.970> than<00:02:55.090> Everest

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
is definitely those shorter than Everest

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.970 
is definitely those shorter than Everest
there's<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:55.930> harder<00:02:56.200> climb<00:02:56.380> than<00:02:56.560> Everest<00:02:56.740> so

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
there's a harder climb than Everest so

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.050 
there's a harder climb than Everest so
once<00:02:57.130> again<00:02:57.220> there's<00:02:57.430> nothing<00:02:57.520> you<00:02:57.760> can<00:02:57.910> do<00:02:58.000> to

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
once again there's nothing you can do to

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.550 
once again there's nothing you can do to
prepare<00:02:58.210> for<00:02:58.540> one<00:02:58.690> you'll<00:02:59.170> be<00:02:59.200> applauded

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560
