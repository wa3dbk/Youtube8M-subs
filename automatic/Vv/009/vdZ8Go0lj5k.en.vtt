00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:10.299
 Yu press 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:13.299
 August 5000 people are not right 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:14.860
 Par 3 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.860
 I came to the store in the same way as the previous day 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:20.339
 Demented Grandmother 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.339
 Every day comes different 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.169
 Even though it has been coming for over a month 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.390
 Mother that part 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.390
 It falls more than 10 years ago 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.250
 I'm coming back from a new school in Nishishin today 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.080
 Really 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.150
 I'm glad it 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.220
 I thought it was going to clean up and pick up a guideline 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:49.970
 I 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.970
 I will try to be as natural as possible ie7 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.900
 It has not changed in recent weeks 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.790
 The seller was getting smaller 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.410
 7-4 in 4-4 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.080
 More than 10 years ago 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.100
 I have seen the same movie 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.360
 as a result 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.360
 I am in charge at the presidency 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.830
 Today I am full and I will do styling 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.570
 I will 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.010
 I will try bangs several times 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.010
 Some voices are coming out to wait for a while 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.350
 I competed for a while 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.250
 I am an obsan 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.250
 Subtract from the bridge 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.410
 I waited for Koshiji 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.410
 I think my brother is different 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.000
 Grandmother wrote 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.060
 After a while 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.320
 The movie has entered 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.280
 I was fighting today 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.150
 I was headed to the station a while ago 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.829
 However it is not necessary 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.829
 Please rest assured 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.060
 I think about 10 years ago using April 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.210
 An important customer who has positioned me for more than 20 years 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.820
 I'm also wearing underwear on the grass 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.879
 The minute I was allowed to pull 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.519
 Having a beauty salon in my memory 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.349
 It was 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.269
 And essential 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.309
 My grandmother has run out of the shop 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:25.309
 Instead, a family will come to the store 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:29.819
 To graduation 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.309
 I was proud of us 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:35.049
 Under the father who died 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.249
 I think I live happily 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:39.529
 truly 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:42.529
 Thank you 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:45.539
 There is this word 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:47.289
 I'm doing it now 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:48.609
 Always support me
