00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:09.029
 I would like to go the introduction Hello everybody from now functional substance of the Department of High School Students 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:09.029
 I will 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.940
 We had 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:19.640
 Here is the organic materials laboratory yesterday. Ella is the laboratory. Here is what experiment is being done. 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.790
 Is it 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:28.369
 We er electronics and ho especially material related to box, which was used that snow Searle 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:32.400
 We do research on 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.260
 Here's a simple one typical rate 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.629
 That 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.629
 Visit because organic el made with quarterly reports 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:47.260
 I would like, but in this kind of Fu Although this in such Fu is I'm blockade still 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:53.370
 When you apply a voltage, you say green glow 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.370
 All this is Yukie made by the simple method of that wet method 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.449
 Organic matter we saw the first time the shining of 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:09.260
 So the experiment is made actually that this light Tsu the dosage to determine the 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:14.090
 This is the place that make up the light-emitting material that was said about the previous 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.770
 This is by using a method called Suzuki Coupling, where Dr. Suzuki who has taken the non- bis was collected 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.550
 I'm composing 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.810
 Then I will show you where that issue is actually, and try to make it like electricity 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:27.259
 think 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.259
 I think you can see that it's shining blue and strong like this 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.090
 Thank you for the pilot's experiment 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:51.540
 This is an inorganic industrial chemistry laboratory. We introduced to our student, Mr. Furuya what kind of experiment we are doing here. 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:55.520
 Here we are conducting research on some ion batteries 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.770
 Making the electrodes using such substances 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.229
 actually 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.229
 I will make a battery using scary things 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.840
 Device to say that the glow box 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.009
 Lithium is 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:15.670
 To from weak to water 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:19.319
 Where range of stalls single about 44 degrees is actually assembled 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.319
 Assemble the bench on the jack 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:28.150
 Put the floured ones just before 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.629
 And those that say separator 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.629
 Cover 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.950
 Those rubber-like say a gasket 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.510
 to place 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.019
 And again to the perrelator 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.019
 Cover 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.250
 Say that all waters 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.060
 What becomes an ion conductor 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.060
 I will 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.400
 And 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.930
 The electrode pasted lithium night 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.600
 The 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.530
 1 electrode pasted margin 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.530
 The body is to count 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.180
 You better sound or was 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.180
 And 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.830
 Cover with f song 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.050
 We have an extra year feat 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.370
 Finally 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.370
 I should be a tea singer 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.409
 Big battery 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.890
 Ray 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:24.250
 Turn off due to banquet money 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.250
 Come caulking put the year in order to prevent 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.979
 The bench is assembled 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.869
 And it is here that it is finished 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:46.490
 Thank you for giving me this 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.720
 I saw to make a fence for the first time 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.460
 In the border 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.460
 Let Thank you Thank you very much 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:05:01.169
 We conducted a separate analysis of the amino acid peptide now 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.169
 Let's get in 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:12.130
 This experiment is from which peptide you are made of 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.130
 In addition, it is experiment to investigate what kind of structure it takes 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:24.760
 Hmm 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:32.310
 What is an electrophoresis device? How does an amino acid move by sending current to everybody? 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:32.310
 We perform migration by using the fingering heaven with the observation device 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.919
 Doing 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.260
 500 v I'm 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:49.840
 Here is the term eight years 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:56.590
 You can think of the US military as complete 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:59.850
 Since sophomore 2 This experiment is performed by the respective roles have been consists of a group j 6 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.850
 Many are very important 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:20.480
 Real sophisticated than in the high school perform well made various devices and about c 4-Qi and 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:25.520
 It is very fun to do the experiment 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:28.150
 Everyone tree over to fell Saga University Faculty of Science and Technology function substance 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.150
 Yeah yeah
