 Visibility looks like you are waiting 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.520

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.320
 Take a look at it this time 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.860

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.259

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.450
 this notch comes on this 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:33.830

 I did that the best way 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:55.470
 Now comes even as ingenious as it 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:03:01.170
 Ingenious and easy, you can also 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:03.810

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.060

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.360
 It is easy to do by hand and me 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.210
 Show yourself now the rest that would be 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.370
 so this last rest piece that then 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:44.620
 simply was no longer in contact with 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.490

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.160
