00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
each level in the game obviously I'm not

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.269 
each level in the game obviously I'm not
the<00:00:17.730> greatest<00:00:18.150> player<00:00:18.390> but<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:19.160> think<00:00:20.160> my

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
the greatest player but I think my

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.740 
the greatest player but I think my
brothers<00:00:20.580> will<00:00:20.730> show<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.570> don't

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
brothers will show you that you don't

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.779 
brothers will show you that you don't
have<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.020> be<00:00:22.230> one<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.980> insane<00:00:23.340> players<00:00:23.699> you

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
have to be one of the insane players you

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.759 
have to be one of the insane players you
get<00:00:23.880> Platinum's<00:00:24.330> on<00:00:24.420> each<00:00:24.570> level<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.109> if

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
get Platinum's on each level so if

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.259 
get Platinum's on each level so if
you're<00:00:25.920> not<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.070> top<00:00:26.340> caliber<00:00:26.760> player<00:00:26.970> like

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269

I've also never done any kind of video
guys<00:00:44.190> before<00:00:44.399> other<00:00:44.700> than<00:00:44.730> for<00:00:45.090> Guitar<00:00:45.360> Hero

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
guys before other than for Guitar Hero

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.209 
guys before other than for Guitar Hero
so<00:00:45.780> definitely<00:00:46.170> give<00:00:46.320> me<00:00:46.350> feedback<00:00:46.800> on<00:00:47.010> what<00:00:47.190> I

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
so definitely give me feedback on what I

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.709 
so definitely give me feedback on what I
do<00:00:47.309> well<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.910> more<00:00:48.239> importantly<00:00:48.570> what<00:00:48.660> I

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
do well and more importantly what I

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.840 
do well and more importantly what I
don't<00:00:48.960> do<00:00:49.110> well<00:00:49.340> for<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.430> most<00:00:50.579> part<00:00:50.789> I'll

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
don't do well for the most part I'll

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.819 
don't do well for the most part I'll
just<00:00:50.969> let<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.270> video<00:00:51.449> speak<00:00:52.079> for<00:00:52.289> itself<00:00:52.379> but

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
just let the video speak for itself but

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.229 
just let the video speak for itself but
I'll<00:00:52.980> point<00:00:53.160> out<00:00:53.340> things<00:00:53.610> here<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.120> there

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
I'll point out things here and there

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.750 
I'll point out things here and there
that<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.449> think<00:00:54.629> will<00:00:54.719> be<00:00:54.750> worth<00:00:54.989> mentioning<00:00:55.760> so

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
that I think will be worth mentioning so

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.299 
that I think will be worth mentioning so
anyway<00:00:57.090> here<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.449> run<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:58.410> time<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.190> beat

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
anyway here is the run a time to beat

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.580 
anyway here is the run a time to beat
his<00:00:59.399> twenty<00:00:59.730> six<00:00:59.940> point<00:01:00.210> six<00:01:00.510> for<00:01:00.899> platinum<00:01:01.199> so

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
his twenty six point six for platinum so

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.130 
his twenty six point six for platinum so
obviously<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.100> just<00:01:02.399> barely<00:01:03.439> beat<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.619> time

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
obviously I just barely beat that time

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.840 
obviously I just barely beat that time
actually<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.470> level<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.159> all<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.640> beginner

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
actually this level of all the beginner

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.250 
actually this level of all the beginner
levels<00:01:09.119> cause<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.450> most<00:01:09.600> trouble<00:01:09.689> for<00:01:10.170> me

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
levels cause the most trouble for me

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.289 
levels cause the most trouble for me
it's<00:01:10.860> probably<00:01:11.189> took<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.580> took<00:01:11.850> longer<00:01:12.119> for

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
it's probably took it took longer for

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.820 
it's probably took it took longer for
this<00:01:12.659> level<00:01:12.869> then<00:01:13.140> add<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.380> probably<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.740> other

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
this level then add a probably the other

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
this level then add a probably the other
four<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.580> almost<00:01:14.700> combine<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.740> yeah<00:01:16.850> it

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
four you can almost combine so yeah it

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.870 
four you can almost combine so yeah it
was<00:01:17.939> kind<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.270> pain<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:20.520> thing<00:01:20.670> with<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
was kind of a pain the thing with the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.980 
was kind of a pain the thing with the
beginner<00:01:21.180> levels<00:01:21.450> though<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.840> there's

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
beginner levels though is that there's

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.539 
beginner levels though is that there's
really<00:01:22.229> not<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.530> whole<00:01:22.799> lot<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.070> places<00:01:23.280> that

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
really not a whole lot of places that

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.460 
really not a whole lot of places that
you<00:01:23.640> can<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.600> know<00:01:24.689> pick<00:01:24.869> up<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.110> whole<00:01:25.259> lot<00:01:25.380> of

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
you can you know pick up a whole lot of

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.679 
you can you know pick up a whole lot of
seconds<00:01:26.000> because<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.119> entire<00:01:27.390> level<00:01:27.570> is

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
seconds because the entire level is

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.319 
seconds because the entire level is
fairly<00:01:27.930> easy<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.920> not<00:01:29.130> like<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
fairly easy it's not like and the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.999 
fairly easy it's not like and the
impossible<00:01:30.780> levels<00:01:31.020> where<00:01:31.170> all<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.530> do<00:01:31.860> is

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
impossible levels where all you do is

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.380 
impossible levels where all you do is
just<00:01:32.250> not<00:01:32.460> get<00:01:32.610> any<00:01:32.729> faults<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.240> you'll

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
just not get any faults and you'll

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.910 
just not get any faults and you'll
probably<00:01:33.570> get<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> right<00:01:33.990> time<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.770> at

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
probably get the right time so you at

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.910 
probably get the right time so you at
the<00:01:35.040> ending<00:01:35.250> there<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.400> kind<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.729> sucked<00:01:36.000> and

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
the ending there I kind of sucked and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.179 
the ending there I kind of sucked and
yeah<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.750> did<00:01:39.750> not<00:01:39.900> learn<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.290> ending<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.650> kind

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
yeah I did not learn the ending I kind

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.910 
yeah I did not learn the ending I kind
of<00:01:41.220> just<00:01:41.400> relied<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.780> pretty<00:01:43.590> flawless

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
of just relied on the a pretty flawless

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.190 
of just relied on the a pretty flawless
beginning<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:47.420> you<00:01:48.420> not<00:01:48.689> learn<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.990> ending

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
beginning to it you not learn the ending

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.649 
beginning to it you not learn the ending
but<00:01:49.320> obviously<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.159> number<00:01:50.729> one<00:01:50.880> score<00:01:51.240> or

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
but obviously the number one score or

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.200 
but obviously the number one score or
number<00:01:51.990> one<00:01:52.110> time<00:01:52.850> should<00:01:53.850> give<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> pretty

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
number one time should give you a pretty

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.719 
number one time should give you a pretty
good<00:01:54.299> idea<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.689> what<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.899> have<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.110> do<00:01:55.729> it

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
good idea of what you have to do it

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.090 
good idea of what you have to do it
looked<00:01:57.570> too<00:01:57.689> difficult<00:01:58.170> for<00:01:58.259> me<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.649> bother

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
looked too difficult for me to bother

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.469
