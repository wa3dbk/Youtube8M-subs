good<00:03:41.449> so<00:03:42.449> I<00:03:42.509> definitely<00:03:42.989> suggest<00:03:43.139> this<00:03:43.560> this<00:03:43.829> I

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
good so I definitely suggest this this I

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.009 
good so I definitely suggest this this I
think<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.609> trial<00:03:44.909> versions<00:03:45.419> it<00:03:45.659> says<00:03:45.870> right

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
think the trial versions it says right

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.210 
think the trial versions it says right
on<00:03:46.199> here<00:03:46.319> it's<00:03:46.470> only<00:03:46.680> 350<00:03:47.250> so<00:03:47.689> good<00:03:48.689> price<00:03:49.220> and

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
on here it's only 350 so good price and

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.280

paired<00:04:08.759> over<00:04:08.970> any<00:04:09.150> any<00:04:09.840> color<00:04:10.259> I<00:04:10.530> especially

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
paired over any any color I especially

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.830 
paired over any any color I especially
like<00:04:11.430> it<00:04:11.549> over<00:04:11.759> like<00:04:11.879> a<00:04:11.939> light<00:04:12.209> blue<00:04:12.389> color<00:04:12.750> I

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
like it over like a light blue color I

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.259 
like it over like a light blue color I
think<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:13.169> kind<00:04:13.379> of<00:04:13.470> looks<00:04:13.620> like<00:04:13.859> um<00:04:14.099> it<00:04:15.060> looks

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
think it kind of looks like um it looks

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.539 
think it kind of looks like um it looks
like<00:04:15.419> snow<00:04:15.689> or<00:04:16.199> even<00:04:16.650> over<00:04:16.889> a<00:04:16.919> white<00:04:17.220> or

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
like snow or even over a white or

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.339 
like snow or even over a white or
whatever<00:04:17.849> and<00:04:18.180> I<00:04:18.479> think<00:04:18.719> that's<00:04:18.989> why<00:04:19.079> I<00:04:19.139> liked

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
whatever and I think that's why I liked

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.080 
whatever and I think that's why I liked
it<00:04:19.469> so<00:04:19.620> much<00:04:19.680> over<00:04:20.099> December<00:04:20.519> was<00:04:20.729> because<00:04:21.000> it

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
it so much over December was because it

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.660 
it so much over December was because it
does<00:04:21.209> look<00:04:21.389> like<00:04:21.419> snow<00:04:21.840> and<00:04:22.109> it's<00:04:22.889> just<00:04:23.099> so

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
does look like snow and it's just so

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.600

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.540 
thing I have a lot of people rave about
here<00:04:37.890> on<00:04:38.130> YouTube<00:04:38.610> and<00:04:38.940> it's<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.390> sesh<00:04:39.720> a<00:04:39.870> V

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
here on YouTube and it's the sesh a V

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.970 
here on YouTube and it's the sesh a V
top<00:04:41.550> coat<00:04:41.880> and<00:04:42.180> this<00:04:42.450> is<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.780> rapid<00:04:43.500> dry<00:04:43.710> one<00:04:43.950> I

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
top coat and this is the rapid dry one I

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.810 
top coat and this is the rapid dry one I
think<00:04:44.190> this<00:04:44.460> dry<00:04:45.060> fast<00:04:45.450> top<00:04:45.810> coat<00:04:46.050> and<00:04:46.640> this<00:04:47.640> is

think this dry fast top coat and this is
14<00:04:48.210> milliliters<00:04:48.750> which<00:04:49.530> is<00:04:49.860> pretty<00:04:50.250> much<00:04:50.340> just

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
14 milliliters which is pretty much just

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.960 
14 milliliters which is pretty much just
like<00:04:50.640> the<00:04:50.820> size<00:04:51.030> of<00:04:51.210> any<00:04:51.300> normal<00:04:51.660> polish<00:04:52.140> so<00:04:52.500> a

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
little bit smaller but you know I don't

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.900 
little bit smaller but you know I don't
know<00:04:56.490> maybe<00:04:56.670> it's<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:56.880> same<00:04:57.060> who<00:04:57.270> knows<00:04:57.890> but

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
know maybe it's the same who knows but

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.000

this<00:05:36.420> definitely<00:05:36.840> doesn't<00:05:37.140> do<00:05:37.350> that<00:05:37.530> it<00:05:37.830> does

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.310 
this definitely doesn't do that it does
dry<00:05:38.550> superfast<00:05:39.060> I'd<00:05:39.510> say<00:05:39.660> probably<00:05:39.810> like<00:05:40.080> 10

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
dry superfast I'd say probably like 10

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.860 
dry superfast I'd say probably like 10
to<00:05:40.440> 15<00:05:40.740> minutes<00:05:41.070> or<00:05:41.250> so<00:05:41.520> and<00:05:41.730> then<00:05:42.330> I<00:05:42.420> can<00:05:42.630> start

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
to 15 minutes or so and then I can start

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.020 
to 15 minutes or so and then I can start
doing<00:05:43.110> other<00:05:43.200> things<00:05:43.320> usually<00:05:44.250> I<00:05:44.460> wait<00:05:44.820> about

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
doing other things usually I wait about

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.210 
doing other things usually I wait about
an<00:05:45.330> hour<00:05:45.510> still<00:05:45.930> before<00:05:46.140> I<00:05:46.320> do<00:05:46.410> anything<00:05:46.980> that

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
an hour still before I do anything that

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.200 
an hour still before I do anything that
requires<00:05:48.470> me<00:05:49.470> to<00:05:49.830> like<00:05:50.070> really<00:05:50.280> use<00:05:50.610> my<00:05:50.790> hands

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
requires me to like really use my hands

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.550 
requires me to like really use my hands
because<00:05:51.510> I<00:05:51.540> wouldn't<00:05:51.810> want<00:05:51.990> to<00:05:52.050> like<00:05:52.170> smear<00:05:52.470> my

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
because I wouldn't want to like smear my

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.350 
because I wouldn't want to like smear my
nails<00:05:52.770> just<00:05:52.860> in<00:05:53.070> case<00:05:53.250> so<00:05:53.820> like<00:05:53.910> if<00:05:54.030> I'm<00:05:54.120> doing

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
nails just in case so like if I'm doing

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
an hour but that's just kind of a

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.110 
an hour but that's just kind of a
precaution<00:05:59.250> that<00:05:59.280> I<00:05:59.400> take<00:05:59.670> I<00:05:59.790> don't<00:05:59.940> know<00:06:00.030> if
