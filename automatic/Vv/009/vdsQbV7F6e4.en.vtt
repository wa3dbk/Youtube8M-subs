00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.330
 who was fishing on february 1 well 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.040
 We remembered this day in the morning anyway 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.929
 decided despite the fact that already blew 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.019
 a strong wind decided to go by herself 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.019
 fishing 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.590
 right here we turn on big 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.810
 sunde see that due to strong wind 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:29.029
 the road is already partially entered 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.220
 this is driving up the ropes and at the entrance 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.900
 DPS officers on duty 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.809
 who check the driver incise 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:40.489
 or those who went to saturday 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.489
 fishing and still not come to their senses 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.480
 everything would be fine with us 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:50.320
 rice side of the islands road took us 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.320
 about an hour 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.630
 principle can be easily moved so 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.090
 as the wind blew in the back 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:03.110
 the snow was a bit pretty 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:08.110
 just gotta decide to stop at this 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.110
 The law here is a lot of snags around and 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.450
 these trees are small where the wind 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.010
 they are not saved by any means the wind is very strong 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.640
 even now we can have a wire here 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:22.550
 even feed the very well that's started 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.690
 came began to catch pick up depth get 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:29.450
 a better one and a half of this and everyone has already caught 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.759
 but at least one small 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.580
 Plotchiki Well, that is, it seems less 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:37.910
 okay, but we are bye for now 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.009
 need a fish in order to put the same 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.759
 rummage in general, first try 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:47.090
 fishing on underwater video camera 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:50.920
 framed in this hole here we have a tap 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.920
 is like you saw one we caught 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.890
 I decided to feed the holes right away 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:02.350
 thinks it will do 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.350
 the fish is bigger but the fish came up 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.700
 jerk came up and must 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.700
 let it be pretty petty 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:17.829
 that day large nobody caught here 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.829
 the fish became interested in the black snake 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.879
 it looks much bigger on screen 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:24.520
 what reality really is 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:26.470
 corner size slept 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.030
 here is another jigger she is white 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.069
 colors fish shows interest to her 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.269
 more 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.480
 but due to the fact that she has a hook 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.260
 too big 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.260
 a lot happens 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.620
 here I am a little dirty 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.549
 but she 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.549
 safely escaped 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.830
 Here is a view that the fish are not afraid of the camera 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.600
 lighting 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.290
 is coming 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.290
 infrared 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.590
 so 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.940
 doesn't see this light here was another 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.940
 biting is single again 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.099
 one more poklevka on well, then I 'll pull out 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.550
 that she does not like you she fits 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.550
 I'm playing on 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.709
 takes not very profitable 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.770
 all the same 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.560
 it is possible that pressure plays a role 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.530
 roles this wind change of weather is not 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.130
 especially bite though covers small 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.640
 Plotter there with perch many hide 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.010
 from the wind somehow 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:35.200
 tents there further 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:37.570
 In fact, these packages here we are here 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:43.480
 stupid as yet no 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:45.480
 shot him though time is already around 11 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.060
 o'clock 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:52.030
 the situation has not changed much or rather 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.600
 greatly changed in terms of weather and here 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:59.320
 this one was just riding now it snowed 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.630
 the wind has intensified us still bite 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.760
 small chips 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:06.760
 even on the cot and comes across very 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:11.920
 the thing on the sticks was none 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:15.340
 bite nightmare I froze hard he sat 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:21.790
 at 1 place from just nana beetles sat 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:23.980
 I had no options here 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.800
 there are few fishermen 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.670
 island of habits and probably still 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:35.030
 more or less comfortable 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:37.290
 and this still here for the trees have become 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:40.550
 that is, if you go out in the open 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.550
 fuck blow away 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:50.189
 in one hour and forty minutes of the journey we 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:53.610
 came to the car raw become 

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:53.610
 but pretty
