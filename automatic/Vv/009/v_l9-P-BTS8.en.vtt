as tell you I didn't totally blow off my
junior<00:01:53.490> year<00:01:53.520> but<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.869> first<00:01:55.140> step<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.740> to

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
junior year but the first step is to

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.969 
junior year but the first step is to
clear<00:01:57.390> your<00:01:57.540> mind<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.930> set<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.229> schedule<00:01:58.469> on

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
clear your mind and set a schedule on

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.550 
clear your mind and set a schedule on
this<00:01:59.820> is<00:01:59.939> taken<00:02:00.210> directly<00:02:00.329> from<00:02:00.630> my<00:02:00.780> book<00:02:00.990> but

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
this is taken directly from my book but

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.350 
this is taken directly from my book but
what<00:02:01.979> does<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.100> mean<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.820> clear<00:02:03.210> your

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
what does that mean so to clear your

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.149 
what does that mean so to clear your
mind<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.630> set<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.869> schedule<00:02:04.110> basically<00:02:04.590> means

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
mind and set a schedule basically means

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.679 
mind and set a schedule basically means
that<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.430> have<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.729> schedule<00:02:05.939> all<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.479> time

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
that you have to schedule all the time

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.809 
that you have to schedule all the time
so<00:02:07.320> there's<00:02:07.799> three<00:02:08.129> main

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
so there's three main

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.279 
so there's three main
that<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.239> have<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.479> schedule<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.019> the<00:02:10.079> first

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
that you have to schedule and the first

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.410 
that you have to schedule and the first
time<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.739> right<00:02:10.979> before<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.370> go<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.489> bed<00:02:11.609> so

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
time is right before you go to bed so

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.459 
time is right before you go to bed so
