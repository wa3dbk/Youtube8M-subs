pain in the butt sometimes because

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.560 
pain in the butt sometimes because
basically<00:01:02.010> what<00:01:02.370> wouldn't<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.640> do<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.420> would

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
basically what wouldn't you do you would

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.479 
basically what wouldn't you do you would
scoop<00:01:03.870> out<00:01:04.080> ice<00:01:04.260> cream<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.650> then<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:05.220> would

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
scoop out ice cream and then it would

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.399 
scoop out ice cream and then it would
get<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:05.909> cold<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.659> would<00:01:06.780> hold<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.260> ice

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
get so cold that it would hold the ice

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.840 
get so cold that it would hold the ice
cream<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.890> would<00:01:07.979> pretty<00:01:08.189> much<00:01:08.280> freeze<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
cream that would pretty much freeze the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.630 
cream that would pretty much freeze the
ice<00:01:08.880> cream<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.710> would<00:01:10.799> have<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.159> end<00:01:11.430> up

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
ice cream so you would have to end up

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.280 
ice cream so you would have to end up
dunking<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.390> water<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.020> could

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
dunking it in water so you could

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.929 
dunking it in water so you could
actually<00:01:13.439> scoop<00:01:13.890> some<00:01:14.070> more<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.729> what<00:01:14.820> we're

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
can like suppose if I go in I can really

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.819 
can like suppose if I go in I can really
cut<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.939> piece<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.509> butter<00:01:54.689> there<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.590> that

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
cut a piece of butter there so that

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.429 
cut a piece of butter there so that
shows<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.549> butter<00:01:57.090> knife<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.479> can<00:01:57.960> be<00:01:58.229> a

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
shows you the butter knife it can be a

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.969 
shows you the butter knife it can be a
real<00:01:59.040> pain<00:01:59.250> actually<00:01:59.670> make<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.939> cut<00:02:00.299> but<00:02:00.990> with

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
real pain actually make a cut but with

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.370 
real pain actually make a cut but with
the<00:02:02.100> spread<00:02:02.340> dish<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:03.509> what<00:02:03.719> it's<00:02:03.960> gonna<00:02:04.170> do

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
the spread dish that what it's gonna do

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.819 
the spread dish that what it's gonna do
is<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:04.950> going<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.310> use<00:02:05.520> your<00:02:06.060> your<00:02:06.990> body<00:02:07.409> heat

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
is it's going to use your your body heat

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.550 
is it's going to use your your body heat
to<00:02:08.039> warm<00:02:08.520> up<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.090> edge

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
to warm up the edge

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.470 
to warm up the edge
the<00:02:09.649> knife<00:02:09.950> so<00:02:10.520> it'll<00:02:10.670> cut<00:02:10.940> through<00:02:10.970> butter<00:02:11.390> a

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
the knife so it'll cut through butter a

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.210 
the knife so it'll cut through butter a
little<00:02:11.660> bit<00:02:11.900> better<00:02:12.020> so<00:02:12.590> this<00:02:12.739> is<00:02:12.890> how<00:02:13.010> this

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
little bit better so this is how this

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.790 
little bit better so this is how this
works<00:02:13.489> hold<00:02:14.120> this<00:02:14.270> in<00:02:14.480> our<00:02:14.599> hands<00:02:14.810> for<00:02:15.530> about

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
works hold this in our hands for about

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.190 
works hold this in our hands for about
they<00:02:16.069> say<00:02:16.220> about<00:02:16.430> 20<00:02:16.819> seconds<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.599> that's

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
they say about 20 seconds and that's

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.900 
they say about 20 seconds and that's
gonna<00:02:18.380> start<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:18.980> distribute<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.640> heat

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
gonna start to distribute the heat

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.699 
gonna start to distribute the heat
between<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:21.489> piece<00:02:22.489> of<00:02:22.670> metal<00:02:22.940> here<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.709> and

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
between the piece of metal here and and

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.380 
between the piece of metal here and and
of<00:02:24.950> course<00:02:25.160> once<00:02:25.610> that's<00:02:25.819> done<00:02:26.030> then<00:02:26.269> we<00:02:26.360> can

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
of course once that's done then we can

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.720 
of course once that's done then we can
turn<00:02:26.660> around<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.200> we<00:02:27.349> can<00:02:27.410> cut<00:02:27.769> butter<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.370> lot

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
turn around and we can cut butter a lot

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.449 
turn around and we can cut butter a lot
better<00:02:28.970> so<00:02:29.300> we<00:02:30.260> got<00:02:30.380> about<00:02:30.530> 20<00:02:30.800> seconds<00:02:31.220> here

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
better so we got about 20 seconds here

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.850 
better so we got about 20 seconds here
so<00:02:32.000> you<00:02:32.120> go<00:02:32.269> back<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:32.720> just<00:02:32.870> gonna<00:02:33.080> make<00:02:33.830> a

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
so you go back and just gonna make a

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.380 
so you go back and just gonna make a
nice<00:02:34.099> thin<00:02:34.750> slice<00:02:35.750> of<00:02:35.780> butter<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:38.000> as<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.239> can

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
nice thin slice of butter and as you can

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.100 
nice thin slice of butter and as you can
see<00:02:38.660> it's<00:02:39.349> cutting<00:02:39.709> it<00:02:39.830> a<00:02:40.040> lot<00:02:40.700> easier<00:02:41.269> that<00:02:41.540> it

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
see it's cutting it a lot easier that it

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.990 
see it's cutting it a lot easier that it
did<00:02:42.260> with<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.530> knife<00:02:42.680> in<00:02:43.280> fact<00:02:43.519> if<00:02:43.640> I<00:02:43.730> go<00:02:43.850> back

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
did with the knife in fact if I go back

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.870 
did with the knife in fact if I go back
to<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.239> knife<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:45.130> try<00:02:46.130> and<00:02:46.250> make<00:02:46.370> those<00:02:46.549> thin

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
to the knife and try and make those thin

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.820 
to the knife and try and make those thin
cuts<00:02:48.880> it's<00:02:49.880> a<00:02:50.239> little<00:02:50.690> bit<00:02:50.840> more<00:02:51.019> difficult<00:02:51.620> to

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
cuts it's a little bit more difficult to

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.800 
cuts it's a little bit more difficult to
to<00:02:52.100> and<00:02:52.519> it's<00:02:52.880> always<00:02:53.090> trying<00:02:53.299> to<00:02:53.450> push<00:02:53.660> the

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
to and it's always trying to push the

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.930 
to and it's always trying to push the
butter<00:02:54.099> trying<00:02:55.099> to<00:02:55.190> push<00:02:55.400> everything<00:02:55.849> the

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
butter trying to push everything the

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.180 
butter trying to push everything the
knife<00:02:56.120> off<00:02:56.360> of<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.989> butter<00:02:57.170> like<00:02:57.440> that<00:02:57.680> but<00:02:58.099> as

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
knife off of the butter like that but as

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.650 
knife off of the butter like that but as
you<00:02:58.310> can<00:02:58.430> see<00:02:58.489> I<00:02:58.700> can<00:02:58.940> make<00:02:59.060> some<00:02:59.269> really<00:02:59.510> nice

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
you can see I can make some really nice

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.390 
you can see I can make some really nice
slices<00:03:00.019> so<00:03:00.319> if<00:03:00.500> I<00:03:00.590> was<00:03:00.709> to<00:03:00.739> actually<00:03:00.920> freeze

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
slices so if I was to actually freeze

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.580 
slices so if I was to actually freeze
this<00:03:01.610> butter<00:03:01.849> then<00:03:02.540> you<00:03:02.720> really<00:03:03.200> see<00:03:03.440> the

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
this butter then you really see the

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.680 
this butter then you really see the
difference<00:03:03.620> between<00:03:04.580> this<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.209> this<00:03:05.390> in<00:03:05.630> fact

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
difference between this and this in fact

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.770 
difference between this and this in fact
we've<00:03:06.530> done<00:03:06.739> a<00:03:06.769> few<00:03:06.950> tests<00:03:07.459> on<00:03:07.640> with<00:03:08.599> the

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
we've done a few tests on with the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.539 
we've done a few tests on with the
spread<00:03:09.290> that<00:03:09.319> and<00:03:09.769> with<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.040> regular<00:03:10.160> butter

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
spread that and with the regular butter

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.360 
spread that and with the regular butter
knife<00:03:10.760> it<00:03:10.910> was<00:03:11.060> just<00:03:11.269> amazing<00:03:11.989> so<00:03:12.370> alright

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
knife it was just amazing so alright

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.890 
knife it was just amazing so alright
let's<00:03:13.579> get<00:03:13.700> back<00:03:13.880> to<00:03:14.030> this<00:03:14.180> scoop<00:03:14.480> here<00:03:14.690> now

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
let's get back to this scoop here now

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.500 
let's get back to this scoop here now
and<00:03:15.230> they've<00:03:15.380> been<00:03:15.530> sitting<00:03:15.769> into<00:03:16.299> the<00:03:17.299> ice

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
and they've been sitting into the ice

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.810 
and they've been sitting into the ice
cream<00:03:17.870> so<00:03:18.739> what<00:03:18.980> basically<00:03:19.130> is<00:03:19.609> going<00:03:19.730> to

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
cream so what basically is going to

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.840 
cream so what basically is going to
happen<00:03:20.209> is<00:03:20.359> this<00:03:21.079> the<00:03:21.680> handle<00:03:22.040> here<00:03:22.280> is<00:03:22.609> going

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
happen is this the handle here is going

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.940 
happen is this the handle here is going
to<00:03:22.910> be<00:03:23.000> really<00:03:23.329> cold<00:03:23.510> on<00:03:23.750> this<00:03:23.959> one<00:03:24.140> so<00:03:24.680> when<00:03:24.859> I

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
to be really cold on this one so when I

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.670 
to be really cold on this one so when I
scoop<00:03:25.250> out<00:03:25.489> the<00:03:25.760> ice<00:03:26.090> cream

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.220 

you<00:03:29.769> can<00:03:29.920> see<00:03:30.219> it's<00:03:31.090> kind<00:03:31.390> of<00:03:31.480> frozen<00:03:31.750> in<00:03:32.049> there

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
you can see it's kind of frozen in there

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.530 
you can see it's kind of frozen in there
and<00:03:32.409> that's<00:03:33.280> what<00:03:33.489> this<00:03:33.609> thumb<00:03:33.909> thing<00:03:34.120> is<00:03:34.299> it

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
and that's what this thumb thing is it

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.750 
and that's what this thumb thing is it
pushes<00:03:34.930> through<00:03:35.170> and<00:03:35.650> after<00:03:36.280> about<00:03:36.459> two<00:03:36.700> or

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
pushes through and after about two or

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.729 
pushes through and after about two or
three<00:03:36.819> scoops<00:03:37.269> you<00:03:37.510> can<00:03:37.689> see<00:03:37.930> there's<00:03:38.439> a<00:03:38.560> ice

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
three scoops you can see there's a ice

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.190 
three scoops you can see there's a ice
cream<00:03:39.069> in<00:03:39.219> there<00:03:39.430> that's<00:03:40.299> just<00:03:40.420> sticking<00:03:40.840> so

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
cream in there that's just sticking so

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.979 
cream in there that's just sticking so
when<00:03:41.319> I<00:03:41.349> do<00:03:41.469> another<00:03:41.920> scoop<00:03:42.540> it's<00:03:43.540> gonna<00:03:43.780> make

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
when I do another scoop it's gonna make

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.209 
when I do another scoop it's gonna make
even<00:03:44.590> harder<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:46.799> it's<00:03:47.799> gonna<00:03:47.920> make<00:03:48.129> it

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:48.219 
even harder and it's gonna make it

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:50.190 
even harder and it's gonna make it
harder<00:03:48.489> to<00:03:48.519> pull<00:03:48.760> out<00:03:48.939> and<00:03:49.180> put<00:03:49.810> it<00:03:49.900> in<00:03:49.989> here

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
harder to pull out and put it in here

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.020 
harder to pull out and put it in here
and<00:03:50.500> then<00:03:51.189> of<00:03:51.400> course<00:03:51.459> look<00:03:51.730> at<00:03:51.819> all<00:03:51.909> that

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
and then of course look at all that

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.280 
and then of course look at all that
extra<00:03:52.299> ice<00:03:52.510> cream<00:03:52.780> just<00:03:52.959> sitting<00:03:53.260> around

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
extra ice cream just sitting around

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.500 
extra ice cream just sitting around
there<00:03:53.620> so<00:03:53.799> basically<00:03:54.189> I<00:03:54.459> got<00:03:54.790> to<00:03:55.030> put<00:03:55.180> it<00:03:55.269> into

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
there so basically I got to put it into

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.509 
there so basically I got to put it into
the<00:03:55.989> water<00:03:56.170> so<00:03:56.650> it<00:03:56.739> can<00:03:56.769> break<00:03:57.069> up<00:03:57.219> to<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.400> ice

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
the water so it can break up to the ice

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.420 
the water so it can break up to the ice
cream<00:03:57.819> so<00:03:58.000> I<00:03:58.060> can<00:03:58.239> make<00:03:58.959> some<00:03:59.200> more<00:03:59.319> now<00:03:59.500> with

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
cream so I can make some more now with

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.599 
cream so I can make some more now with
this<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:01.629> handle<00:04:02.049> is<00:04:02.470> not<00:04:02.500> even<00:04:03.250> a<00:04:03.280> design

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
this the handle is not even a design

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.899 
this the handle is not even a design
Nicole<00:04:04.000> in<00:04:04.239> fact<00:04:05.109> as<00:04:05.349> you<00:04:05.409> can<00:04:05.620> see<00:04:05.859> I<00:04:06.099> can<00:04:06.700> pull

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
Nicole in fact as you can see I can pull

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:09.750 
Nicole in fact as you can see I can pull
it<00:04:07.030> right<00:04:07.060> out<00:04:07.239> and<00:04:08.200> you<00:04:08.500> can<00:04:08.620> see<00:04:08.829> melted<00:04:09.099> ice

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
it right out and you can see melted ice

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.720 
it right out and you can see melted ice
cream<00:04:09.819> right<00:04:10.720> on<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:11.650> scoop<00:04:11.950> here<00:04:12.129> so

basically I'm gonna hold on to this for

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.129 
basically I'm gonna hold on to this for
about<00:04:14.530> 20<00:04:15.129> seconds<00:04:15.760> like<00:04:16.060> I<00:04:16.209> said<00:04:16.419> with<00:04:17.049> the

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139

about 20 seconds like I said with the
knife<00:04:17.289> and<00:04:17.470> the<00:04:18.459> exposed<00:04:18.820> edges<00:04:19.090> you<00:04:19.329> can<00:04:19.359> see

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
knife and the exposed edges you can see

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.020 
knife and the exposed edges you can see
the<00:04:20.410> silver<00:04:20.709> around<00:04:21.039> the<00:04:21.190> edges<00:04:21.579> and<00:04:21.759> then<00:04:21.910> the

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
the silver around the edges and then the

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.450 
the silver around the edges and then the
white<00:04:22.210> here<00:04:22.599> the<00:04:23.500> silver<00:04:23.830> is<00:04:23.889> what's<00:04:24.099> going<00:04:24.340> to

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
white here the silver is what's going to

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.550 
white here the silver is what's going to
make<00:04:24.699> it<00:04:24.880> so<00:04:25.090> I<00:04:25.300> can<00:04:25.599> actually<00:04:25.900> scoop<00:04:26.349> this<00:04:26.500> a

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
make it so I can actually scoop this a

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.950 
make it so I can actually scoop this a
lot<00:04:26.800> better<00:04:26.949> so<00:04:27.550> now<00:04:27.729> I'm<00:04:28.120> gonna<00:04:28.270> come<00:04:28.539> in<00:04:28.690> here

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
and of course the edges are starting to

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.350 
and of course the edges are starting to
get<00:04:31.840> a<00:04:31.900> little<00:04:32.080> bit<00:04:32.259> warm<00:04:32.849> I'm<00:04:33.849> gonna<00:04:34.030> try<00:04:34.240> and

get a little bit warm I'm gonna try and
stay<00:04:34.599> away<00:04:34.840> from<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.139> edges<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:37.360> as<00:04:37.479> you<00:04:37.630> can

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
stay away from the edges and as you can

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.719 
stay away from the edges and as you can
see<00:04:38.050> I<00:04:38.320> scooped<00:04:38.830> a<00:04:38.919> nice<00:04:39.099> scoop<00:04:39.430> of<00:04:39.550> ice<00:04:39.699> cream

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
see I scooped a nice scoop of ice cream

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.290 
see I scooped a nice scoop of ice cream
here<00:04:40.240> and<00:04:40.419> it<00:04:40.960> fell<00:04:41.169> right<00:04:41.409> out<00:04:41.830> of<00:04:42.159> the<00:04:42.970> scoop

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
here and it fell right out of the scoop

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.230 
here and it fell right out of the scoop
if<00:04:43.479> I<00:04:43.870> was<00:04:44.050> using<00:04:44.260> an<00:04:45.190> all-metal<00:04:45.610> scoop<00:04:46.060> like

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
if I was using an all-metal scoop like

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.110 
if I was using an all-metal scoop like
this<00:04:46.590> after<00:04:47.590> about<00:04:47.740> two<00:04:47.979> or<00:04:48.099> three<00:04:48.130> it<00:04:49.000> would

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
this after about two or three it would

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.580 
this after about two or three it would
have<00:04:49.210> stuck<00:04:49.479> straight<00:04:49.840> to<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.110> piece<00:04:50.289> of<00:04:50.470> ice

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
have stuck straight to the piece of ice

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.860 
have stuck straight to the piece of ice
cream<00:04:50.919> and<00:04:51.150> you<00:04:52.150> would<00:04:52.270> have<00:04:52.330> had<00:04:52.389> to<00:04:52.479> use<00:04:52.599> your

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
cream and you would have had to use your

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.390 
cream and you would have had to use your
finger<00:04:53.169> to<00:04:53.289> actually<00:04:53.620> take<00:04:53.860> it<00:04:53.889> off<00:04:54.070> so<00:04:54.310> I'm

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
finger to actually take it off so I'm

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.909

gonna do that again and try and get into
the<00:04:57.070> ice<00:04:57.789> cream<00:04:58.090> here<00:04:58.479> and<00:04:58.889> take<00:04:59.889> a<00:04:59.919> scoop

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.409 

falls<00:05:03.509> right<00:05:03.720> out<00:05:03.780> like<00:05:04.050> that<00:05:05.419> interesting

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
I just hold on to this handle for about

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.830 
I just hold on to this handle for about
20<00:05:12.419> seconds<00:05:12.810> and<00:05:13.430> it<00:05:14.430> will<00:05:14.639> actually<00:05:14.840> will

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
20 seconds and it will actually will

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.710 
20 seconds and it will actually will
warm<00:05:16.110> up<00:05:16.319> the<00:05:16.800> area<00:05:17.160> of<00:05:17.340> the<00:05:17.490> scoop<00:05:18.030> so<00:05:18.509> it<00:05:18.630> will

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
warm up the area of the scoop so it will

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.629 
warm up the area of the scoop so it will
actually<00:05:18.840> come<00:05:19.620> out<00:05:19.800> a<00:05:19.949> lot<00:05:20.160> better<00:05:20.430> and<00:05:20.580> I

don't have to use the water method or
any<00:05:23.099> other<00:05:23.160> method<00:05:23.340> like<00:05:23.940> that<00:05:24.300> so<00:05:24.630> a<00:05:24.870> couple
