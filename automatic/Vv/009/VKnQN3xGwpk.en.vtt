leftover foam insulation you can see
right<00:01:51.630> here<00:01:51.929> I<00:01:52.849> just<00:01:53.849> used<00:01:54.029> that<00:01:54.209> foam

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:54.419 
right here I just used that foam

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:56.569 
right here I just used that foam
insulation<00:01:54.749> for<00:01:55.709> padding<00:01:56.039> and<00:01:56.159> it's<00:01:56.340> really

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
insulation for padding and it's really

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.830 
insulation for padding and it's really
nice<00:01:56.729> because<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.119> spend<00:01:57.389> most<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.630> your<00:01:57.719> time

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
nice because you spend most of your time

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.019 
nice because you spend most of your time
on<00:01:58.079> your<00:01:58.200> knees<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.560> here<00:01:58.799> because<00:01:59.639> it's<00:01:59.849> so

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:00.029 
on your knees in here because it's so

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:03.739 
on your knees in here because it's so
low<00:02:00.209> and<00:02:00.539> then<00:02:00.719> there's<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.619> bed<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.659> as<00:02:03.659> you

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:03.749 
low and then there's the bed and as you
