00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 but you feel destined by the team 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.200
 so you expected to find 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.279
 really disappointed everything he has 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.940
 past 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.940
 yes the truth yes 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:16.250
 disappointed when your goals are 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.500
 much higher of your results I think 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.960
 that we have a lot to be 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.550
 disappointed both parties 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.689
 what should the team improve in case of 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.450
 that you stay for next year what 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.540
 you think they should change 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.580
 many things I think the team is a 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.840
 great team of that I have no doubt 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.840
 he has very capable people 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.440
 I think more organization 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.440
 many times more humility in facing it 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.269
 the reality I think 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.600
 mclaren being so big this season 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:52.699
 It has cost him a lot to see the reality of 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.370
 where we are stuck and not follow 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.710
 thinking that we had a car to 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.739
 win races because with reality 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.239
 what we have is to enter the points 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.850
 it's a good weekend and that's the 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.649
 reality that we have and that the team 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.210
 It has been hard to assimilate ideas with the 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.590
 team because it 's martin whitmarsh 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.810
 let's be tough never again 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.970
 championships 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.479
 and I think that martÃ­n is a great leader 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:21.020
 I have nothing to say against Martin 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.759
 Martin is a great leader 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.000
 I think he has the team in good shape 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.530
 but in the end the team does not 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.340
 it just depends on one head there are many 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.509
 heads that probably has not been what 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.509
 good enough 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.650
 this year especially he has shown 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.790
 that mentally as we say with all 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.020
 the attacks that have been followed on you 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.909
 as sentimentally good very well 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.130
 in the face of attacks I have a lot of support from 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.330
 part of my country and that's what I 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.460
 motivates and helps me move forward 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.800
 finally sergio in case you do not 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.040
 there are other options you would like no 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.080
 that exist but that we would like to be 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.810
 I have to see and try to get the 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.360
 better the best possible option in case 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.980
 that does not stay there 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.980
 and see it better for my future
