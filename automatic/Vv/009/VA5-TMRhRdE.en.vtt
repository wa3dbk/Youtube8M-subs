corner<00:01:42.710> about<00:01:44.780> half<00:01:45.780> an<00:01:46.020> inch<00:01:46.170> from<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.649> court

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
corner about half an inch from the court

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.440 
corner about half an inch from the court
from<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.399> top<00:01:47.610> corner<00:01:48.680> as<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.810> then<00:01:52.070> down

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
from the top corner as so and then down

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.709 
from the top corner as so and then down
so<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:55.470> ruler<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:56.009> measures<00:01:57.140> 17<00:01:58.219> inches

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
so that the ruler it measures 17 inches

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:03.620 
so that the ruler it measures 17 inches
along<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.869> side<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.640> mark<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.450> will

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
along the side and mark it and that will

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.120 
along the side and mark it and that will
create<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:04.049> nice<00:02:05.030> perfectly<00:02:06.030> sized<00:02:06.329> trying

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
create a nice perfectly sized trying

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.040 
create a nice perfectly sized trying
and<00:02:09.130> then<00:02:09.250> take<00:02:09.520> along<00:02:09.790> the<00:02:09.940> bottom<00:02:11.070> mark<00:02:12.070> from

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
and then take along the bottom mark from

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:20.340 
and then take along the bottom mark from
that<00:02:14.050> bottom<00:02:14.920> of<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.130> line<00:02:15.600> over<00:02:16.600> a<00:02:16.630> cross<00:02:19.350> and

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
that bottom of the line over a cross and

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.260 
that bottom of the line over a cross and
then<00:02:20.680> cut<00:02:23.520> so<00:02:24.520> you're<00:02:24.640> going<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:24.820> want<00:02:25.000> two<00:02:25.240> of

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
then cut so you're going to want two of

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.040 
then cut so you're going to want two of
these<00:02:25.420> triangles<00:02:26.110> obviously<00:02:27.720> so<00:02:28.720> then<00:02:28.900> you

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
these triangles obviously so then you

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.070 
these triangles obviously so then you
just<00:02:29.910> so<00:02:30.910> then<00:02:31.060> you<00:02:31.150> just<00:02:31.180> fold<00:02:31.750> your<00:02:31.840> fabric

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
just so then you just fold your fabric

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:43.670 
just so then you just fold your fabric
again<00:02:33.300> lay<00:02:34.300> that<00:02:34.510> half<00:02:34.780> triangle<00:02:35.080> out<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:41.800> cut

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
again lay that half triangle out and cut

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:54.980 
again lay that half triangle out and cut
cut<00:02:44.680> cut<00:02:44.920> cut<00:02:45.450> take<00:02:46.450> your<00:02:46.630> first<00:02:46.870> triangle

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:03.290 

you<00:02:55.680> want<00:02:55.890> to<00:02:55.980> pin<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:59.660> face<00:03:00.660> down<00:03:02.150> against<00:03:03.150> the

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
you want to pin it face down against the

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:11.300 
you want to pin it face down against the
first<00:03:03.720> side<00:03:04.340> as<00:03:05.340> so

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.160 

so<00:03:11.880> that<00:03:12.000> when<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.209> flip<00:03:12.390> it<00:03:12.540> over<00:03:14.959> how<00:03:15.959> about

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
so that when you flip it over how about

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.670 
so that when you flip it over how about
a<00:03:16.200> nice<00:03:16.380> finished<00:03:17.069> edge<00:03:17.420> so<00:03:18.440> pin<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.590> down<00:03:21.680> take

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
a nice finished edge so pin it down take

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.800 
a nice finished edge so pin it down take
