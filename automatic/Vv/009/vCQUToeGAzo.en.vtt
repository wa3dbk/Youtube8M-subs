00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
or would you mind videotaping a few

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.029 
or would you mind videotaping a few
sentences<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.600> promote<00:00:19.109> exercise<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.980> the

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
sentences to promote exercise and the

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.980

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
classrooms that we can insert to our

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:32.020 
classrooms that we can insert to our
video<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.680> post<00:00:23.010> on<00:00:23.279> YouTube<00:00:23.699> or<00:00:23.970> Facebook

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.340 

you<00:00:33.030> know<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.149> think<00:00:33.239> we'd<00:00:33.540> all<00:00:33.570> agree<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.050> an

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
you know I think we'd all agree that an

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.500 
you know I think we'd all agree that an
in<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.620> ideal<00:00:35.219> world<00:00:35.579> children<00:00:36.180> would<00:00:36.329> get

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
in it ideal world children would get

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.810 
in it ideal world children would get
plenty<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:37.079> outdoor<00:00:37.260> time<00:00:37.559> but<00:00:38.370> sometimes

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
plenty of outdoor time but sometimes

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.729 
plenty of outdoor time but sometimes
they<00:00:39.059> don't<00:00:39.300> there's<00:00:39.750> budget<00:00:40.020> constraints

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
they don't there's budget constraints

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.100 
they don't there's budget constraints
they're<00:00:40.920> scheduling<00:00:41.430> problems<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.300> doing

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
they're scheduling problems so doing

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.590 
they're scheduling problems so doing
these<00:00:43.320> exercises<00:00:44.219> in<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.850> classroom<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.570> think

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
these exercises in the classroom I think

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.930 
these exercises in the classroom I think
is<00:00:45.930> helpful<00:00:46.260> because<00:00:46.530> again<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.520> kids<00:00:47.760> will

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
is helpful because again the kids will

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.610 
is helpful because again the kids will
learn<00:00:48.090> these<00:00:48.360> for<00:00:48.629> life<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.200> they'll<00:00:49.469> know

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
learn these for life and they'll know

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.400 
learn these for life and they'll know
okay<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:49.920> can't<00:00:50.190> go<00:00:50.280> out<00:00:50.399> jogging<00:00:50.730> today<00:00:51.210> but<00:00:52.140> I

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
okay I can't go out jogging today but I

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.670 
okay I can't go out jogging today but I
can<00:00:52.920> do<00:00:53.129> these<00:00:53.370> stretches<00:00:53.750> at<00:00:54.750> home<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.590> I

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
can do these stretches at home and I

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.560 
can do these stretches at home and I
think<00:00:55.980> as<00:00:56.129> adults<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.789> they<00:00:56.969> grow<00:00:57.210> up<00:00:57.239> with

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
think as adults that they grow up with

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.330 
think as adults that they grow up with
that<00:00:57.719> mentality<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.800> going<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.980> be<00:00:59.100> better

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
that mentality it's going to be better

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.920 
that mentality it's going to be better
for<00:00:59.579> them<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.590> I<00:01:01.590> ride<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.219> bike<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.879> work<00:01:03.090> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
for them and I ride a bike to work the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.340 
for them and I ride a bike to work the
US<00:01:04.140> Capitol<00:01:04.670> it's<00:01:05.670> about<00:01:05.850> 10<00:01:06.090> miles<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.510> day<00:01:06.540> but

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
US Capitol it's about 10 miles a day but

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.230 
US Capitol it's about 10 miles a day but
I<00:01:07.560> do<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.159> because<00:01:08.460> when<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:08.790> was<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.060> third

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
I do that because when I was in third

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.149 
I do that because when I was in third
grade<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.510> like<00:01:09.840> riding<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.260> bicycle<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.950> so

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
grade I like riding a bicycle and so

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.500 
grade I like riding a bicycle and so
there's<00:01:11.369> things<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:12.090> do<00:01:12.270> when

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
there's things that you can do when

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.929 
there's things that you can do when
you're<00:01:12.720> young<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.860> can<00:01:14.040> continue<00:01:14.430> doing

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
you're young that you can continue doing

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.940 
you're young that you can continue doing
the<00:01:15.030> rest<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.360> your<00:01:15.479> life<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.500> think<00:01:16.799> it's

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
the rest of your life and I think it's

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.350 
the rest of your life and I think it's
very<00:01:17.100> important<00:01:17.549> for<00:01:17.610> all<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.759> us<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.150> stay

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
very important for all of us to stay

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.120 
very important for all of us to stay
active<00:01:18.600> but<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:19.590> going<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.740> be<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> lot<00:01:20.100> easier

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
active but it's going to be a lot easier

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.580 
active but it's going to be a lot easier
if<00:01:20.520> you're<00:01:20.820> doing<00:01:21.119> things<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:22.080> grew<00:01:22.560> up

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
if you're doing things that you grew up

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.700 
if you're doing things that you grew up
doing<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:24.000> obesity<00:01:24.360> rate<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:24.930> our<00:01:25.259> country

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
doing the obesity rate in our country

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.830 
doing the obesity rate in our country
particular<00:01:26.159> state<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.490> Georgia<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.210> off<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
particular state of Georgia is off the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.510 
particular state of Georgia is off the
chart<00:01:28.140> Georgia<00:01:28.560> has<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.920> second<00:01:29.490> highest

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
chart Georgia has the second highest

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.149 
chart Georgia has the second highest
childhood<00:01:30.360> obesity<00:01:30.689> rate<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.920> country

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
childhood obesity rate in the country

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.420 
childhood obesity rate in the country
and<00:01:32.750> people<00:01:33.750> need<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.380> start<00:01:34.650> becoming<00:01:34.829> aware

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
and people need to start becoming aware

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.310 
and people need to start becoming aware
of<00:01:35.640> what<00:01:35.880> they're<00:01:36.090> eating<00:01:36.360> how<00:01:36.840> much<00:01:36.900> they're

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
of what they're eating how much they're

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.560 
of what they're eating how much they're
eating<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.220> quality<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.329> food

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
eating and the quality of the food

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.649 
eating and the quality of the food
itself<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.640> step<00:01:42.030> in<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
itself and so this is a step in the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.530 
itself and so this is a step in the
direction<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:43.200> getting<00:01:43.500> young<00:01:43.740> children

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
direction of getting young children

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.270 
direction of getting young children
attuned<00:01:45.540> with<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.140> because<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.920> isn't

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
attuned with that because this isn't

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.550 
attuned with that because this isn't
really<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.520> mystery<00:01:48.000> it's<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.299> calories<00:01:49.290> in

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
really a mystery it's a calories in

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.920 
really a mystery it's a calories in
burning<00:01:50.250> them<00:01:50.399> out<00:01:50.549> through<00:01:50.790> exercise<00:01:51.360> eating

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
burning them out through exercise eating

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.500 
burning them out through exercise eating
the<00:01:51.990> right<00:01:52.170> stuff
