00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 hi guys terminator one of 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.059
 probably the best films and 1 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.059
 terminator was a cool sequel or 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.410
 terminator 2 was a masterpiece that forever 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.420
 remained historians but a similar genre as 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.730
 unsurpassed height the audience went out 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.699
 from the cinema after the terminator 2 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.240
 a sense of delighted shock 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.519
 dominator you were weak he could not 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.710
 not hit the plot with no special effects 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.719
 like a second series 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.750
 terminator and was not something 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.120
 awesome new like first movie 4 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.219
 the series was a bold move 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.860
 shifted the future and in general 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.070
 a good movie turned out but still 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.840
 delight precisely delight after 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.000
 view left no one 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.399
 but 5 terminator me nice 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.350
 pleased I was already set to 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.480
 that it will be fire and dying 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.219
 dinosaurs what movie this i'm going to watch 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.140
 just out of respect for arnold 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.930
 but what can really show 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.450
 old man arnie how can he justify and 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.939
 explain your aged look but no 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.189
 the movie was unexpectedly cool and me 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.580
 probably want to watch it again 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.280
 pretty soon interesting technology 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.960
 classic theme of temporal war 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.540
 the aged bucket 0 is cleverly justified 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.390
 simple and logical way brilliant idea 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.909
 give some good explanation why 0 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.960
 aged belongs to none other than 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.729
 James Cameron understands why 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.430
 managed so deftly to move out of the topic 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.159
 great special effects cool moments 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.850
 many cool robots of all kinds 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.340
 models 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.140
 remarkably famous actors and here you are 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.210
 my verdict 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.060
 watch movies on the big screen 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.329
 watch and watch with pleasure 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.649
 now sometimes interesting facts about the movie 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.689
 film director Alan Taylor 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.390
 also known as a TV series director 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.700
 the game of thrones is now clear to us why 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.159
 the movie finally turned out good and 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.439
 why starring emilia clarke 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.439
 who played the main role in the games of thrones 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.050
 all just pull their only thing 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.830
 We were surprised when we learned that the director 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.860
 Terminator 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.600
 again the same guy who 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.880
 directed the games of thrones that in 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.130
 the process of action did not kill everyone 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.500
 goodies including terminator 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.630
 and actually saru connor like john 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.180
 connor favors jason clarke 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.070
 played in a good movie from my point 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.050
 view of planet of monkeys 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.540
 revolution it seems to me it is pretty 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.490
 a good actor jay courtney could be 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.650
 from the cast of the film since 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.130
 shooting schedule coincided with the production 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.290
 sequel to the film divergent 2014 but to 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.170
 fortunately the contract was drawn up so 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.750
 so that he can play in both 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.709
 the films I had no idea what the body 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.209
 young 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.970
 Arnold Schwarzenegger is not 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.730
 computer editing and he played the actor 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.790
 bodybuilder bad azar robert patrick 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.650
 declined the offer to play again 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.110
 liquid metal terminator ti 1000 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.540
 because he doubted that due to problems 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.660
 health physically cope with the role 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.700
 great actor christian bale alas not 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.730
 I could find time in the schedule to again 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.590
 play john connor role got 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.110
 to him the movie terminator may come 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.820
 savior in 2009 still such 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.940
 interesting fact that the rating of film critics 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:27.180
 in the world about the terminator spots all 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.519
 only 27 percent and in Russia 80 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.880
 percent that's how Russians turn out 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.850
 love 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.100
 Arnold movie terminator 5 h5 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.470
 writers one of which is james 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.400
 cameras how they managed to work together mind 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.200
