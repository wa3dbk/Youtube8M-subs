00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.900
 hello dear friends I suggest 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:22.380
 your attention one of the options 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:26.740
 ki distribution flap in this flap 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.189
 installed one three-phase pattern 2 in 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.829
 this one on 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.550
 three phase ouzo protective device 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.780
 disconnect 2 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.360
 single phase protective device 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.070
 shutdowns 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:45.329
 two three-phase automatic 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:49.860
 circuit breakers from schneider electric and 4 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.309
 single pole single phase stand 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.850
 which one here 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:01:04.659
 the scheme is applied in one machine for 32 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:09.900
 ampere from this voltage comes this 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:15.670
 on this three-phase circuit breaker and 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:19.509
 also one phase goes to this pattern and 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.990
 the second phase goes here on this pattern but that 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.360
 not marked with colored tape is 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.140
 there is this pattern 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:33.480
 There is a red base with red wire 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:38.740
 in red this is an Internet pattern 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:42.010
 in green from here it's free 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.659
 automatic here 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.830
 three phase switch 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:51.610
 load and there is a voltage from it to 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.820
 here this three-phase four-pole 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.479
 safety shutdown devices 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.450
 as it is already connected to the bottom terminals 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:06.840
 load ie this three phase 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:10.269
 the load is protected against leakage current 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.400
 safety device and off 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:17.739
 short circuit and overload here 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.740
 this circuit breaker further 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.150
 because 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:26.780
 here are two protective devices 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:30.320
 disconnecting single phase and automata like you 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:34.330
 see single pole they are double pole 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:39.110
 so for the pattern to work properly 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.430
 it is necessary that after u over these 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.670
 workers 0 and 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.080
 on whether they were not connected anywhere else 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:50.060
 so here after every high school 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.260
 installed separate 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.260
 on the left Yashina 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:09.000
 if here these two zero tires combine 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.440
 it will not work correctly 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:19.780
 triggered when when triggered 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:24.040
 it is not required that is to work false well and 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:28.300
 here is made so that morning one pattern on 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:32.200
 two machines this vine here on these two 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:37.330
 automatic machine and this is a pattern 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.100
 Now these are the two machine 2 and 4 and already 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.120
 to the circuit breaker bottom 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:47.380
 connected load i.e. sockets light 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:51.420
 there but so on well and the ground bus 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.420
 on a separate yellow green 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:06.430
 yellow green wire to busbar housing 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:09.700
 yellow can immediately be distinguished here 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:14.380
 we are made here 5 wired 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:19.030
 that is, it goes three phases on v1 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:22.479
 circuit breaker and 0 connected to 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:26.290
 working to working 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:31.020
 zero is more correct on the general 0 and above 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:35.410
 Well, this is a zero tire from it 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:41.410
 0 goes to the pattern on one Uzo to the second 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:44.130
 the pattern on the three-phase pattern 0 goes but also in 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.130
 principle and all 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:56.110
 after pattern 0 already goes on load here 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:05:00.940
 on a three phase load but here 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:05.199
 accordingly, 0 is already 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:08.010
 each on his new tire after 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:11.919
 single phase pattern that is in this 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:15.300
 distribution box though here and 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:19.930
 three phase but separation 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:25.060
 foam wire on p and n here is not satisfied 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:28.750
 since here is 5 wired it comes three 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.410
 phase 0 and grounding protective device 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.510
 shutdown 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:36.539
 here everything is 30 milliamps installed 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:40.919
 differential current 30 milliamps 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:42.070
 rated current which stand 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:47.820
 contacts 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.820
 internal eagle 40 amps all relays 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.310
 before 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:54.910
 flap means there still 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:59.260
 distribution devices and 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:01.090
 there is a 100 milliamp pattern with 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.599
 differential current ie 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:07.450
 ensure selectivity if somewhere 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:10.660
 appears on the load here let's say on 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:13.570
 three phase leakage current 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.860
 there because of deterioration of isolation or because 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.229
 insulation breakdown 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:21.220
 the first running from here it is 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:25.060
 pattern and if it is for some reason not 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:30.220
 it will turn off already then 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:33.250
 whose node is set to input 100 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:35.110
 milliampere on i'm likewise with 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:39.099
 automatic switch also 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:42.060
 selectivity is made if allowed 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:46.479
 16 amp single phase automatic 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:50.680
 short circuit occurs on to 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:52.860
 protected line let's say somewhere on 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:57.509
 outlet 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:58.819
 gotta disconnect this first 16th 

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:03.180
 automatic first 

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:07.020
 if he doesn't shut down then he should 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:08.419
 already off in one machine for 32 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.909
 amps 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:15.719
 of course if the short circuit current 

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:18.060
 will be enough to trigger it 

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:21.919
 Here, in principle, I have all thanks for 

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.919
 attention to all the best
