00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
cruise control and that's a bit of a

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
whinging but backwards taco is just

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:50.350 
whinging but backwards taco is just
plain<00:01:48.950> weird<00:01:49.190> a<00:01:49.369> test<00:01:49.580> and<00:01:49.759> Martin<00:01:50.030> trying<00:01:50.270> to

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
plain weird a test and Martin trying to

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.789 
plain weird a test and Martin trying to
be<00:01:50.450> different<00:01:50.630> and<00:01:51.140> there's<00:01:51.289> almost<00:01:51.380> nowhere

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
be different and there's almost nowhere

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:58.270 
be different and there's almost nowhere
to<00:01:52.009> put<00:01:52.159> something<00:01:52.369> like<00:01:52.580> a<00:01:52.610> mobile<00:01:52.880> phone
