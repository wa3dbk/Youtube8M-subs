 spent point exists approximately 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.049
 2400 1 bild 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.150
 for each of the presented 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.709
 classes in general is impressive and in 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.409
 continuation of the topic at the construction site is necessary 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:43.389

 the end of the battle they work the same 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.130
 like point 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.660
 that is, it takes away something 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.730
 add volume to shrink 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.200
 issued depends on what subject you are 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.090
 found the usual ancestors idea of ​​relics 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.829
 but then I think so sec 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.859
 In general, here is such a game and about 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:04.239
 forge despite the fact that before the release is still quite 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.529
 far want to share

 now existing smite 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.060
 idea of ​​lando house online or wah measures at once 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.800
 general release at least 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.480
 here is the impression but 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.430
 that's all for now 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.160
 filmed all show in the meantime that all of all
