00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
three years okay okay um the other thing

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:27.010 
three years okay okay um the other thing
it<00:01:22.279> talks<00:01:22.609> here<00:01:23.119> is<00:01:23.560> about<00:01:25.240> 200<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:26.389> 300<00:01:26.659> level

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
it talks here is about 200 and 300 level

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.410 
it talks here is about 200 and 300 level
units<00:01:27.439> what<00:01:27.679> are<00:01:27.770> these<00:01:27.859> 100<00:01:28.789> level<00:01:29.029> subjects

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
units what are these 100 level subjects

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.029 
units what are these 100 level subjects
are<00:01:29.569> actually<00:01:29.929> your<00:01:30.049> introductory<00:01:30.380> subjects

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
are actually your introductory subjects

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.149 
are actually your introductory subjects
so<00:01:31.609> if<00:01:31.999> you<00:01:32.209> drew<00:01:32.479> a<00:01:32.509> 200-level<00:01:33.439> subject<00:01:34.009> it

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
so if you drew a 200-level subject it

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.190 
so if you drew a 200-level subject it
means<00:01:34.399> you<00:01:34.549> already<00:01:34.759> done<00:01:35.209> your<00:01:35.270> 100<00:01:35.929> level

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
means you already done your 100 level

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.679 
means you already done your 100 level
intro<00:01:36.619> subject<00:01:37.099> it's<00:01:37.969> a<00:01:38.029> good<00:01:38.149> idea<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.420> have<00:01:38.659> a

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
intro subject it's a good idea to have a

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.839 
intro subject it's a good idea to have a
look<00:01:38.990> at<00:01:39.170> your<00:01:39.289> 300<00:01:39.799> level<00:01:39.920> subjects<00:01:40.520> just<00:01:40.759> to

00:01:40.839 --> 00:01:40.849 
look at your 300 level subjects just to

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:43.029 
look at your 300 level subjects just to
make<00:01:40.909> sure<00:01:41.029> you<00:01:41.359> meet<00:01:41.509> on<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.659> prereqs<00:01:42.079> if<00:01:42.829> you

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
make sure you meet on the prereqs if you

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:44.919 
make sure you meet on the prereqs if you
have<00:01:43.219> a<00:01:43.249> look<00:01:43.490> at<00:01:43.639> mass<00:01:43.819> 310<00:01:44.270> for<00:01:44.509> example

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
have a look at mass 310 for example

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:46.749 
have a look at mass 310 for example
you'll<00:01:45.529> see<00:01:45.679> that<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.889> pricks<00:01:46.189> are<00:01:46.399> at<00:01:46.549> mads

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
you'll see that the pricks are at mads

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.699 
you'll see that the pricks are at mads
to<00:01:46.939> 10<00:01:47.179> if<00:01:47.450> you<00:01:47.719> click<00:01:47.899> on<00:01:48.020> that<00:01:48.200> you'll<00:01:48.590> see

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
to 10 if you click on that you'll see

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:52.080 
to 10 if you click on that you'll see
that<00:01:49.099> the<00:01:49.310> prereq<00:01:49.729> for<00:01:49.759> mass<00:01:50.060> 210<00:01:50.509> is<00:01:50.719> math<00:01:51.049> 110

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
that the prereq for mass 210 is math 110

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.550 
that the prereq for mass 210 is math 110
sometimes<00:01:53.090> it's<00:01:53.419> different<00:01:53.810> if<00:01:54.049> you<00:01:54.109> have<00:01:54.529> a

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
sometimes it's different if you have a

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.279 
sometimes it's different if you have a
look<00:01:54.889> at<00:01:55.069> maths<00:01:55.579> 331<00:01:56.450> you<00:01:56.810> will<00:01:56.899> see<00:01:57.049> that<00:01:57.169> the

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
look at maths 331 you will see that the

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.349 
look at maths 331 you will see that the
prereqs<00:01:57.649> of<00:01:57.799> 30<00:01:57.979> credit<00:01:58.310> points<00:01:58.459> so

00:01:59.349 --> 00:01:59.359 
prereqs of 30 credit points so

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:01.330 
prereqs of 30 credit points so
theoretically<00:02:00.169> you<00:02:00.259> could<00:02:00.590> do<00:02:00.739> that<00:02:00.770> subject

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
theoretically you could do that subject

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.949 
theoretically you could do that subject
in<00:02:01.549> your<00:02:01.700> second<00:02:02.029> year<00:02:02.060> provided<00:02:02.719> you've<00:02:02.810> got

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:02.959 
in your second year provided you've got

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:04.839 
in your second year provided you've got
the<00:02:03.049> credit<00:02:03.289> point<00:02:03.469> requirements<00:02:04.069> so

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:04.849 
the credit point requirements so

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:06.699 
the credit point requirements so
basically<00:02:05.239> I<00:02:05.329> can't<00:02:05.689> do<00:02:05.840> a<00:02:05.869> 200-level<00:02:06.439> year

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:06.709 
basically I can't do a 200-level year

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:08.770 
basically I can't do a 200-level year
subjecting<00:02:07.279> my<00:02:07.369> first<00:02:07.669> no<00:02:07.969> not<00:02:08.300> unless<00:02:08.509> your

previous study you can always do it here

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.619 
previous study you can always do it here
but<00:02:20.159> make<00:02:20.400> sure<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.760> do<00:02:20.879> it<00:02:20.970> before<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.390> plan

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
but make sure you do it before you plan

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
your program okay cool well I haven't

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.240 
your program okay cool well I haven't
studied<00:02:24.390> anywhere<00:02:24.780> else<00:02:24.900> so<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.739> don't<00:02:26.010> think

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
studied anywhere else so I don't think

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.800 
studied anywhere else so I don't think
there's<00:02:26.549> any<00:02:26.730> credit<00:02:27.120> for<00:02:27.150> previous<00:02:27.569> studies

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
there's any credit for previous studies

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.660 
there's any credit for previous studies
for<00:02:27.959> me<00:02:28.080> or<00:02:28.409> 200<00:02:28.920> level<00:02:29.040> units<00:02:29.370> in<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.519> first

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
for me or 200 level units in the first

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.089 
for me or 200 level units in the first
year<00:02:29.940> for<00:02:30.060> me<00:02:30.180> either<00:02:30.299> but<00:02:31.080> after<00:02:31.680> my<00:02:31.799> first

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
year for me either but after my first

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.940 
year for me either but after my first
year<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.400> can<00:02:32.670> do<00:02:32.849> 200<00:02:33.569> or<00:02:33.750> 300<00:02:34.140> level<00:02:34.470> units<00:02:34.799> as

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
year I can do 200 or 300 level units as

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.470 
year I can do 200 or 300 level units as
long<00:02:35.069> as<00:02:35.190> I've<00:02:35.370> meet<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.879> prerequisites

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
long as I've meet the prerequisites

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.940 
long as I've meet the prerequisites
that's<00:02:36.720> right<00:02:36.930> well<00:02:37.319> and<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.590> think<00:02:37.620> the

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
that's right well and I think the

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.550 
that's right well and I think the
prereqs<00:02:38.430> are<00:02:38.610> listed<00:02:38.940> in<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.150> handbook<00:02:39.629> so

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
prereqs are listed in the handbook so

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.430 
prereqs are listed in the handbook so
here's<00:02:40.769> one<00:02:40.980> for<00:02:41.250> in<00:02:41.790> smash<00:02:42.180> there<00:02:42.480> yeah<00:02:42.959> it<00:02:43.170> is

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
here's one for in smash there yeah it is

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.699 
here's one for in smash there yeah it is
2.4<00:02:44.659> we<00:02:45.659> all<00:02:45.810> have<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.049> do<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.170> major<00:02:46.379> right

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
2.4 we all have to do a major right

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.759 
2.4 we all have to do a major right
other<00:02:47.250> Eunice<00:02:47.579> says<00:02:47.819> that<00:02:48.150> is<00:02:48.569> a<00:02:48.870> structured

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
other Eunice says that is a structured

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.020 
other Eunice says that is a structured
sequence<00:02:50.099> of<00:02:50.220> units<00:02:50.519> in<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.760> particular

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
sequence of units in a particular

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.240 
sequence of units in a particular
discipline<00:02:51.720> or<00:02:51.870> subject<00:02:52.290> area<00:02:52.620> which<00:02:53.129> is

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
discipline or subject area which is

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.789 
discipline or subject area which is
approved<00:02:53.640> by<00:02:53.819> the<00:02:53.879> University<00:02:54.540> yeah<00:02:54.840> so

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
approved by the University yeah so

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.589 
approved by the University yeah so
there's<00:02:56.220> a<00:02:56.310> list<00:02:56.549> of<00:02:56.700> these<00:02:56.819> majors<00:02:57.329> that<00:02:57.359> we

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
there's a list of these majors that we

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.270 
there's a list of these majors that we
can<00:02:57.780> choose<00:02:57.959> in<00:02:58.079> the<00:02:58.170> head<00:02:58.319> well<00:02:58.530> that's<00:02:58.980> right

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
can choose in the head well that's right

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.089 
can choose in the head well that's right
it's<00:02:59.549> right<00:02:59.819> here<00:02:59.879> and<00:03:00.420> if<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.530> know<00:03:01.829> what

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
it's right here and if you know what

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.589 
it's right here and if you know what
you're<00:03:02.280> interested<00:03:02.459> in<00:03:02.760> but<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.120> know<00:03:03.329> you're

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
you're interested in but you know you're

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.089 
you're interested in but you know you're
not<00:03:03.720> really<00:03:03.900> sure<00:03:04.170> what<00:03:04.319> majors<00:03:04.620> are<00:03:04.739> related

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
not really sure what majors are related

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.979 
not really sure what majors are related
to<00:03:05.129> that<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:06.060> can<00:03:06.209> always<00:03:06.390> go<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.540> this<00:03:06.750> page

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
to that you can always go to this page

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.250 
to that you can always go to this page
and<00:03:07.049> see<00:03:07.650> what's<00:03:08.069> interesting<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:09.269> you<00:03:09.299> okay

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
and see what's interesting to you okay

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.130 
and see what's interesting to you okay
uh<00:03:10.730> it's<00:03:11.730> just<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:12.090> little<00:03:12.359> bit<00:03:12.540> confusing<00:03:12.870> so

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
uh it's just a little bit confusing so

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.199 
uh it's just a little bit confusing so
majors<00:03:14.040> are<00:03:14.190> connected<00:03:14.609> to<00:03:14.700> departments

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
majors are connected to departments

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.970 
majors are connected to departments
right<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:16.019> department's<00:03:16.530> administer

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
right and the department's administer

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.099
