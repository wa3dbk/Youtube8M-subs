00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 the last time sterndrive that is the 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.069
 set of this f20 lte facelift of bmw 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.050
 one that summarizes perfectly and with it 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.849
 Welcome to a car report from auto 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.469
 idea that we are here from a face 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.599
 corresponding ones do not only look in detail 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.090
 Here, for example, we see the new one 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.420
 infrastructure in it is fully led 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.710
 technology but also very important 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.000
 this last one is something under the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.170
 hood next to the new one 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.490
 headlamps we have here now 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.080
 which pull so a bit in the broad 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.910
 and the car also much richer 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.679
 the road bring me the course 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.000
 already seen in other models 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.930
 we have for the lettering a 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.469
 16 d earlier , the x 1 was 6 liters displacement 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.460
 DE like in the old days everything was better 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.350
 or not yet is a 16 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.180
 for a small 13 country with 1 5 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.100
 liter capacity of bmw 1er was never 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.140
 the biggest when it comes to space 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.180
 went and so it goes in this 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.520
 last facelift and rear-wheel drive 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.270
 further one is now sitting in relative terms 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.520
 Let's say comfortable 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.899
 However, the roofline is very nice 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.119
 fall off hard that I am here behind 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.799
 have little space and this driver sits 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.810
 it is on my height of close 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.549
 and 1 meter 80 that is set 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.680
 if you would make someone bigger and drive 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.150
 it would be much closer 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.350
 I believe in a driving force 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.020
 you do not need a point of view 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.140
 argue about whether anyone in 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.119
 this point is better than the bmw 1er 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.450
 is with a small third countries notes 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.100
 you 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.080
 He just has the best suspension 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.670
 Of course , that's okay 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:36.409
 How does it fit with the three-cylinder 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:39.350
 Together, relatively good though 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:42.710
 Of course you have to say this joy on 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:46.719
 drive the bmw times sold little comes 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:49.700
 not so on this engine 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:53.420
 for example, these 3.6 liters with those 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:57.590
 bmw the insights de indicates inclusive 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.349
 eight-speed automatic I do not have 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.479
 reached with bending and breaking and so 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:04.969
 really the total anti joy on 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.360
 but drive this time to 4.6 liters 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:10.310
 created in the normal case completely normal 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.760
 driving the car is on the daily 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.459
 road passes 5.6 liters that's two 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.709
 liter more than specified can also with 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.840
 this much heavier equipment 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.310
 One thing is related to the engine 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.980
 However, it must be this river 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.329
 Guided use of the is extreme 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.000
 I enjoy spinning so far 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.950
 go and say for that 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.470
 average driver not daily 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.209
 on the highway must be enough 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.849
 small three-cylinder completely out 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.470
 however, of course, would be the well-known 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:43.599
 would like to experience joy in driving feeling 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.599
 he has to attack the bigger red 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.719
 the exciting question remains that well 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.859
 now the last with sterndrive can in 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:02.999
 the 13 countries also what he can 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:06.420
 but I have to be on the l you have 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:09.090
 drive him extremely and a wet one 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.409
 Fahrbahn is also very helpful there 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.150
 we have so beautiful here too 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:16.680
 gadgets like the drive 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.909
 controller also looks for some bmw 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.859
 Model still a little bit up 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.719
 but one has to allow a used then 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.790
 actually works really blind 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:25.319
 Of course you have to look at the screen 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.599
 as a control where you are currently moving 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.459
 but you can turn the rotary press 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.450
 to serve without problems and me 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.609
 Personally, therefore, it takes me a bit 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.519
 as a fan of the online entertainment 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:38.840
 outen because you just have access 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:41.430
 on a huge music database something like that 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.439
 in my knowledge, no one else 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.069
 manufacturer wants to summarize like that 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.109
 say a lot 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.909
 the three-cylinder is likely 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:50.879
 including this equipment the wrong one 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:53.040
 motorization but the bmw 1er remains 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:55.669
 also with this last facelift the 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.439
 case most active in the compact class 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:04:00.840
 you can look at it but here 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:03.209
 I would rather guess one 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.030
 numbering with the sequence 12 to choose 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.769
 or maybe even 13 then there is 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.129
 much more driving pleasure and you can 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:14.359
 enjoy this rear drive more 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.359
 as with this little three-cylinder
