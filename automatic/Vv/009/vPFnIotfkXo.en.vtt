MIT<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.600> half<00:00:33.840> thirteen<00:00:34.770> times<00:00:35.040> but<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.090> took<00:00:36.180> a

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
MIT in half thirteen times but it took a

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.850 
MIT in half thirteen times but it took a
lot<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.690> weight<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.170> pressure<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.739> actually

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
lot of weight and pressure to actually

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.319 
lot of weight and pressure to actually
sit<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.430> thing<00:00:38.640> with<00:00:38.790> our<00:00:38.820> bodies<00:00:39.180> and

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
sit on this thing with our bodies and

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.060 
sit on this thing with our bodies and
hold<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.600> down<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.870> make<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.110> work<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.530> we<00:00:40.950> did

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
hold it down to make it work so we did

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.410 
hold it down to make it work so we did
feel<00:00:41.190> like<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.399> was<00:00:41.489> really<00:00:41.730> quite<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.270> record

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
feel like it was really quite the record

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.479 
feel like it was really quite the record
so<00:00:43.050> what<00:00:43.200> we're<00:00:43.320> going<00:00:43.469> for<00:00:43.530> here<00:00:43.710> back<00:00:44.100> at<00:00:44.219> MIT

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
so what we're going for here back at MIT

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.180 
so what we're going for here back at MIT
is<00:00:44.940> falling<00:00:45.809> piece<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.110> paper<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.350> half<00:00:46.500> 13

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
is falling piece of paper in half 13

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.920 
is falling piece of paper in half 13
times<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.820> such<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> way<00:00:48.539> that'll<00:00:48.840> be

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
times in such a way that'll be

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.139 
times in such a way that'll be
freestanding<00:00:49.500> again<00:00:49.980> without<00:00:50.309> doubt<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.969> a

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
freestanding again without doubt be a

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.819 
freestanding again without doubt be a
folded<00:00:51.480> piece<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.629> paper<00:00:51.750> done<00:00:52.440> correctly

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
folded piece of paper done correctly

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.619 
folded piece of paper done correctly
people<00:00:53.399> can<00:00:53.640> verify<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.300> think<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
people can verify and I think the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.389 
people can verify and I think the
doctored<00:00:54.960> photographs<00:00:55.410> or<00:00:55.590> video<00:00:55.800> that's

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
doctored photographs or video that's

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.430 
doctored photographs or video that's
what<00:00:56.550> we're<00:00:56.640> doing<00:00:56.820> right<00:00:56.940> now

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.140 

60-point<00:01:01.440> lair<00:01:01.650> we've<00:01:02.430> just<00:01:02.760> gone<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
60-point lair we've just gone to the

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.090 
60-point lair we've just gone to the
64th<00:01:03.780> flower<00:01:04.050> paper<00:01:04.410> which<00:01:04.590> is<00:01:04.650> equivalent<00:01:04.860> to

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
64th flower paper which is equivalent to

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.520 
64th flower paper which is equivalent to
six<00:01:05.340> foldings<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.630> we're<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:06.960> our<00:01:07.110> way<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.320> we

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
six foldings so we're on our way so we

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.500 
six foldings so we're on our way so we
can<00:01:07.680> start<00:01:07.980> this<00:01:08.130> folding<00:01:08.490> project<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.420> it

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
can start this folding project so it

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.960 
can start this folding project so it
last<00:01:09.750> year<00:01:09.930> we<00:01:10.050> sold<00:01:10.200> about<00:01:10.610> 25,000<00:01:11.610> feet<00:01:11.790> with

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
last year we sold about 25,000 feet with

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.570 
last year we sold about 25,000 feet with
paper<00:01:12.180> it's<00:01:12.360> almost<00:01:12.540> five<00:01:12.900> miles<00:01:13.200> paper<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:14.370> of

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
paper it's almost five miles paper so of

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.890 
paper it's almost five miles paper so of
course<00:01:14.790> here<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.120> say<00:01:15.270> there's<00:01:15.480> no<00:01:15.630> wrong

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
course here to say there's no wrong

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.210 
course here to say there's no wrong
people<00:01:16.170> it's<00:01:16.380> actually<00:01:16.620> that<00:01:16.740> long<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.130> we

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
people it's actually that long so we

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.440 
people it's actually that long so we
have<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.400> actually<00:01:17.640> take<00:01:17.970> some<00:01:18.000> ends<00:01:18.300> together

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
have to actually take some ends together

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.850 
have to actually take some ends together
to<00:01:18.660> make<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.870> illegitimate<00:01:19.200> piece<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.680> strip

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
to make this illegitimate piece of strip

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.280 
to make this illegitimate piece of strip
of<00:01:19.950> paper<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:21.060> didn't<00:01:21.360> quite<00:01:21.510> do<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.170> we

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
of paper that didn't quite do it so we

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.710 
of paper that didn't quite do it so we
realized<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.800> time<00:01:23.010> we<00:01:23.130> need<00:01:23.340> more<00:01:23.820> paper<00:01:24.090> so

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
realized this time we need more paper so

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.810 
realized this time we need more paper so
we're<00:01:24.840> really<00:01:24.990> going<00:01:25.230> for<00:01:25.410> 50,000<00:01:26.400> feet<00:01:26.580> of

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
we're really going for 50,000 feet of

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.940 
we're really going for 50,000 feet of
paper<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.270> time<00:01:27.330> around<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.020> with<00:01:28.770> this

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
paper this time around so with this

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.560 
paper this time around so with this
extra<00:01:29.400> sixty-four<00:01:29.880> layers<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.360> ground

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
extra sixty-four layers on the ground
