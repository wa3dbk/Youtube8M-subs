00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.260
 good friends today let's talk a little 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:09.970
 about this type of filters the filter of the 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:12.010
 plate filter the platform filter 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.140
 when we started in the world of 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.299
 Aquarist is very common that we do not 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.080
 sell a filter in our aquarium 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.939
 these a platform plate filter 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.850
 these filters are placed at the bottom of the 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.279
 aquarium above these of these 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.570
 filters the gravel is placed all here 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.570
 up and it's full of gravel 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:38.080
 and a little hose is placed where 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:41.150
 comes the air this air makes a change 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:44.000
 of pressure inside the water 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.910
 which generates a stream let's say the 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.700
 aquarium water will go through the 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.420
 gravel that is on this plate that 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.460
 the gravel is the filter passed through 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.780
 from this grid the water runs through here 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.520
 go up this tube here the water comes out 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.600
 this thanks to the air flow that is given 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.610
 in this cylinder 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.979
 at the beginning you can say that they are very 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.350
 good many recommend this type 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.119
 of filters because here is going to be a 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.130
 bacterial colony bacteria 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.009
 nitrifiers that are essential for 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.290
 our aquarium but I see some 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:23.600
 drawbacks in these plates 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.490
 this type of filters as is in the 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.930
 bottom of our aquarium and below 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.600
 all the stone and chair is going to be 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.150
 difficult to clean because everything 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.720
 under the filter it will fill up 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.810
 dirt remains much food is 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:43.190
 remains of the poop of the fish then 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.950
 although you were siphoning the siphon 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.170
 better going to penetrate through the stone 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.710
 chair but will reach the point where 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.660
 can not pass lower and will not be able to 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.920
 take out all that society that is below 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:01.340
 of this plate then if you do not have a 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.350
 proper cleaning system in this 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.020
 type of filters now we can 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.420
 bring some consequences in our 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.970
 aquarium like for example can bring us 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.880
 some diseases it seems to me that the 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.040
 examine already if it is due many times in 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.460
 some aquariums that have this type 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.040
 of plates 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.810
 as many of us do when 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.960
 start with my aquariums they sold me 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.210
 I installed this type of filters 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.190
 even in one of my videos that 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.350
 called how to install a new aquarium 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.510
 see how I install one of these because 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.780
 good is the common thing when you start in 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.030
 this or videla aquarium is like 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.590
 you come in this type of filter and you 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.980
 recommend that it is very good for 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.680
 form it the bacterial colony 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.680
 nitrifiers for your aquarium some 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.800
 they call this a biological plate 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.410
 but I would not call this a plate 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.180
 biological inside an aquarium I 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.450
 I would call a plate filter 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.340
 but a biological plate not a plate 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.959
 biological for me is still what I 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.939
 we find here within our 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.060
 cascade filter that several times already 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:13.950
 I've taught them, let's see what 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.889
 first to handle safely 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.680
 we are going to disconnect the filter and we are going to 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:22.569
 see what would be the biological plaque that 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.359
 is inside the waterfall filter 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.579
 here we are going to draw this would be the 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.469
 biological plate because the plate 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:32.340
 biological because here is going to form a 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:36.129
 bacterial colony in our filter 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.290
 well it's important to say that not all 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:40.420
 the filters are going to have this same plate 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.120
 but they have some maybe 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.519
 tubes that are like ceramic have 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.280
 some spheres that call him even 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:53.010
 bio spheres where they will form this 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:56.560
 equally in the bacterial colony but 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.769
 well commonly if we find state 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.799
 this in in our filters inside the 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.000
 filter especially those of waterfall 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.579
 so if you have a filter of 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.549
 waterfall because you no longer need to use 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:11.560
 this other filter to the bottom plate and 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.419
 if right now you are using a filter 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.760
 these of bottom plates and you have doubts 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:17.829
 and it's good it's bad because I'll 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.870
 I would recommend that you better start 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.430
 use by filter like these a filter 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.889
 of waterfall 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.900
 since as you know good cleaning of 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.419
 We will do our aquarium with a 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.190
 siphon as I explained to you the siphon is not going to 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.400
 reach to remove all the dirt that 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.440
 there is below this plate 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.389
 so you could clean the plate well 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.449
 you would have to remove all the stone 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:42.130
 do it side draw the plate to be able to 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.830
 siphon and ar everything that is below 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.870
 of the plate and then replace it 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.970
 So the truth is, if it's a little bit 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.740
 more work is much simpler 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.700
 manipulate a filter of these because what 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.490
 we have outside of our aquarium 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.980
 well I hope that with this with this 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.670
 little explanation I have given to 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:05.490
 understand and I send a strong greeting to 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.320
 all friends who see them videos 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.660
 I thank you for your comments for your 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.960
 questions have patience I'll leave 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.240
 answering little by little there is written 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.670
 I invite you to continue subscribing and 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.740
 keep leaving your comments and also 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.960
 I would like you to tell me if 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.040
 you use this type of filters in your 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.770
 aquariums or 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.750
 if they abused him sometime and because 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.430
 filter they changed what is the filter 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.830
 what is best for you in your 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.690
 aquariums or if you ever saw that this 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.730
 type of filter brought them some problem 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.380
 It would be good to talk about it arana and in 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.300
 the comments so that later we do 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.570
 a video about that good I send you a 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.760
 strong greeting friends there watching my 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.800
 aquarium groupies that many people 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.480
 he has criticized because it is overpopulated 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.780
 but good they are also living 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.640
 Well, the groupies are quiet and 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.650
 those little fish that are back there with 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.900
 the sword and there is also a channel for 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:03.340
 there good I send you greetings friends 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.340
 take care a lot until soon
