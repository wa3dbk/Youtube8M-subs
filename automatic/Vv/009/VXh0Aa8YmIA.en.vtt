hey Phil Plait from Bad Astronomy calm
here<00:00:15.430> and<00:00:15.550> I'm<00:00:15.610> doing<00:00:15.790> a<00:00:16.090> mini<00:00:16.390> Q<00:00:16.810> and<00:00:16.960> B<00:00:17.020> a

here and I'm doing a mini Q and B a
session<00:00:17.890> I<00:00:18.010> just<00:00:18.040> wanted<00:00:18.400> to<00:00:18.490> test<00:00:18.700> out<00:00:18.880> some

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
session I just wanted to test out some

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.480 
session I just wanted to test out some
software<00:00:19.660> but<00:00:20.380> I<00:00:20.740> thought<00:00:21.010> I'd<00:00:21.130> do<00:00:21.220> it<00:00:21.340> with<00:00:21.460> a

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
software but I thought I'd do it with a

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.880 
software but I thought I'd do it with a
real<00:00:21.670> question<00:00:22.210> so<00:00:22.450> I<00:00:22.510> opened<00:00:22.900> up<00:00:23.020> a<00:00:23.230> hangout

question

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.720 
question
if<00:00:49.780> we<00:00:50.290> know<00:00:50.470> a<00:00:50.500> meteorite<00:00:50.920> came<00:00:51.220> from<00:00:51.400> Mars

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
if we know a meteorite came from Mars

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.830 
if we know a meteorite came from Mars
how<00:00:52.390> did<00:00:52.630> it<00:00:52.750> leave<00:00:53.050> Mars<00:00:53.470> and<00:00:53.860> when<00:00:54.360> now<00:00:55.360> it

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
how did it leave Mars and when now it

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.980 
how did it leave Mars and when now it
turns<00:00:56.080> out<00:00:56.290> that<00:00:57.000> meteorites<00:00:58.000> fall<00:00:58.690> to<00:00:58.810> earth

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
turns out that meteorites fall to earth

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.480 
turns out that meteorites fall to earth
all<00:00:59.140> the<00:00:59.260> time<00:00:59.440> we<00:00:59.680> actually<00:00:59.710> plow<00:01:00.250> through

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:00.490 
all the time we actually plow through

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.460 
all the time we actually plow through
about<00:01:00.790> a<00:01:00.820> hundred<00:01:01.270> tons<00:01:01.480> of<00:01:01.720> material<00:01:02.230> every

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
about a hundred tons of material every

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.079 
about a hundred tons of material every
day<00:01:02.680> most<00:01:03.310> of<00:01:03.430> it<00:01:03.520> burns<00:01:03.760> up<00:01:03.940> in<00:01:04.030> the

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
day most of it burns up in the

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.460 
day most of it burns up in the
atmosphere<00:01:04.150> but<00:01:04.659> if<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:04.869> pieces<00:01:05.049> are<00:01:05.290> big

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
atmosphere but if the pieces are big

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.020 
atmosphere but if the pieces are big
enough<00:01:05.650> or<00:01:05.920> if<00:01:06.310> they<00:01:06.430> come<00:01:06.610> in<00:01:06.700> at<00:01:06.790> the<00:01:06.880> right

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
enough or if they come in at the right

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.999 
enough or if they come in at the right
angle<00:01:07.479> or<00:01:07.689> there<00:01:08.380> are<00:01:08.439> other<00:01:08.530> factors

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
angle or there are other factors

involved<00:01:09.280> they<00:01:09.729> can<00:01:09.880> make<00:01:10.000> it<00:01:10.090> all<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.210> way<00:01:10.299> to

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
involved they can make it all the way to

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.210 
involved they can make it all the way to
the<00:01:10.540> ground<00:01:10.780> where<00:01:11.110> we<00:01:11.200> can<00:01:11.350> find<00:01:11.680> them<00:01:11.979> and<00:01:12.159> we

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
the ground where we can find them and we

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.840 
the ground where we can find them and we
find<00:01:12.430> a<00:01:12.490> mobile<00:01:12.759> time<00:01:12.939> now<00:01:13.689> some<00:01:14.079> of<00:01:14.110> these<00:01:14.290> are

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
find a mobile time now some of these are

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.020 
find a mobile time now some of these are
weird

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
weird

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.580 
weird
chemically<00:01:16.509> they're<00:01:16.869> they're<00:01:17.170> weird<00:01:17.409> they're

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
chemically they're they're weird they're

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.080 
chemically they're they're weird they're
not<00:01:17.740> like<00:01:17.980> the<00:01:18.190> other<00:01:18.310> meteorites<00:01:18.640> that<00:01:18.940> we

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
not like the other meteorites that we

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.970 
not like the other meteorites that we
find<00:01:19.480> and<00:01:19.900> it<00:01:20.020> turns<00:01:20.230> out<00:01:20.409> that<00:01:20.590> some<00:01:20.830> of<00:01:20.920> these

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
find and it turns out that some of these

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.830 
find and it turns out that some of these
have<00:01:21.159> been<00:01:21.190> positively<00:01:22.030> identified<00:01:22.300> as

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
have been positively identified as

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.100 
have been positively identified as
heaven<00:01:23.170> come<00:01:23.409> from<00:01:23.740> Mars<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:24.880> that's<00:01:25.330> amazing

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
heaven come from Mars and that's amazing

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
heaven come from Mars and that's amazing
when<00:01:26.230> you<00:01:26.290> think<00:01:26.470> that<00:01:26.560> something<00:01:26.860> came<00:01:27.010> from

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
when you think that something came from

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.310 
when you think that something came from
another<00:01:27.310> planet<00:01:27.430> maybe<00:01:28.390> you<00:01:28.659> know<00:01:28.810> most

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
another planet maybe you know most

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.630 
another planet maybe you know most
meteorites<00:01:29.650> that<00:01:29.860> come<00:01:29.979> from<00:01:30.070> asteroids

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
meteorites that come from asteroids

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.280 
meteorites that come from asteroids
asteroids<00:01:31.150> whack<00:01:31.570> into<00:01:31.810> each<00:01:31.990> other

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
asteroids whack into each other

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.440 
asteroids whack into each other
shrapnel<00:01:33.010> flies<00:01:33.430> off<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:33.700> eventually<00:01:34.330> they

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
shrapnel flies off and eventually they

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.200 
shrapnel flies off and eventually they
hit<00:01:34.630> the<00:01:34.750> earth<00:01:34.780> but<00:01:35.590> Mars<00:01:35.890> is<00:01:36.159> a<00:01:36.190> planet<00:01:36.729> it's

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
hit the earth but Mars is a planet it's

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.570 
hit the earth but Mars is a planet it's
a<00:01:37.300> whole<00:01:37.510> planet<00:01:38.350> and<00:01:38.500> yet<00:01:38.740> we<00:01:38.950> get<00:01:39.100> pieces<00:01:39.400> of

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
a whole planet and yet we get pieces of

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.930 
a whole planet and yet we get pieces of
it<00:01:39.700> here<00:01:39.850> on<00:01:39.970> earth<00:01:40.150> now<00:01:40.840> very<00:01:41.710> briefly<00:01:41.940> we

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
it here on earth now very briefly we

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.030 
it here on earth now very briefly we
know<00:01:43.150> they're<00:01:43.360> from<00:01:43.630> Mars<00:01:43.990> because<00:01:44.770> when<00:01:44.950> you

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
know they're from Mars because when you

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.800 
know they're from Mars because when you
slice<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.729> meteorite<00:01:46.120> up<00:01:46.299> and<00:01:46.510> you<00:01:46.570> do<00:01:46.690> this

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
slice the meteorite up and you do this

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.050 
slice the meteorite up and you do this
very<00:01:46.990> carefully<00:01:47.260> in<00:01:47.590> sterile<00:01:47.920> conditions<00:01:48.060> you

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
very carefully in sterile conditions you

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.520 
very carefully in sterile conditions you
will<00:01:49.150> find<00:01:49.420> sometimes<00:01:49.870> there<00:01:50.200> are<00:01:50.500> glass

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
will find sometimes there are glass

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.320 
will find sometimes there are glass
bubbles<00:01:53.530> in<00:01:53.740> them<00:01:53.890> or<00:01:54.310> little<00:01:54.700> cavities<00:01:55.180> in

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
bubbles in them or little cavities in

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.570 
bubbles in them or little cavities in
them<00:01:55.479> and<00:01:55.659> you<00:01:56.170> can<00:01:56.320> see<00:01:56.619> them<00:01:56.830> and<00:01:56.920> you<00:01:57.549> can

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
them and you can see them and you can

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.930 
them and you can see them and you can
sample<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.869> gas<00:01:59.650> that<00:02:00.040> is<00:02:00.159> inside<00:02:00.460> it

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
sample the gas that is inside it

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.460 
sample the gas that is inside it
basically<00:02:01.360> it's<00:02:01.510> an<00:02:01.570> air<00:02:01.720> bubble<00:02:02.049> that<00:02:02.080> formed

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
basically it's an air bubble that formed

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.109 
basically it's an air bubble that formed
inside<00:02:02.770> this<00:02:02.979> rock<00:02:03.220> when<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.549> rock<00:02:03.700> formed

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
inside this rock when the rock formed

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.359 
inside this rock when the rock formed
whenever<00:02:04.869> billions<00:02:05.260> of<00:02:05.320> years<00:02:05.500> ago<00:02:05.560> so<00:02:06.159> if<00:02:06.280> you

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
whenever billions of years ago so if you

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.719 
whenever billions of years ago so if you
can<00:02:06.520> take<00:02:06.700> a<00:02:06.729> sample<00:02:07.000> of<00:02:07.210> that<00:02:07.330> gas<00:02:07.570> you<00:02:08.319> can

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
can take a sample of that gas you can

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.859 
can take a sample of that gas you can
check<00:02:09.729> it<00:02:09.849> chemically<00:02:10.209> and<00:02:10.420> it<00:02:10.479> turns<00:02:10.659> out

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
check it chemically and it turns out

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.600 
check it chemically and it turns out
that<00:02:11.319> the<00:02:11.650> basically<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.220> chemical

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
that the basically the chemical

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.280 
that the basically the chemical
composition<00:02:13.150> of<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:13.269> gas<00:02:13.510> that<00:02:13.780> we<00:02:13.900> find<00:02:14.140> in

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
composition of the gas that we find in

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.350 
composition of the gas that we find in
some<00:02:14.439> of<00:02:14.560> these<00:02:14.650> meteorites<00:02:14.950> matches<00:02:15.939> what<00:02:16.180> we

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
some of these meteorites matches what we

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.869 
some of these meteorites matches what we
know<00:02:16.540> is<00:02:16.870> on<00:02:17.379> Mars<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:18.069> that's<00:02:18.519> really

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
know is on Mars and that's really

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.660 
know is on Mars and that's really
awesome<00:02:19.560> it's<00:02:20.560> one<00:02:21.069> of<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.190> few<00:02:21.310> places<00:02:21.490> where

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
awesome it's one of the few places where

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.400 
awesome it's one of the few places where
we've<00:02:22.000> actually<00:02:22.270> been<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.050> been<00:02:23.140> able<00:02:23.260> to

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
we've actually been to and been able to

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.740 
we've actually been to and been able to
sample<00:02:23.680> things<00:02:24.130> firsthand<00:02:24.849> we've<00:02:25.209> set<00:02:25.390> Rovers

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
sample things firsthand we've set Rovers

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.970 
sample things firsthand we've set Rovers
to<00:02:25.780> Mars<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.260> things<00:02:26.410> like

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
to Mars and things like

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.319 
to Mars and things like
so<00:02:27.310> we<00:02:27.459> know<00:02:27.579> what<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.760> atmosphere<00:02:27.879> is<00:02:28.180> made

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
so we know what the atmosphere is made

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.229 
so we know what the atmosphere is made
up<00:02:28.540> we<00:02:28.930> find<00:02:29.260> it<00:02:29.379> in<00:02:29.470> these<00:02:29.590> little<00:02:30.239> bubbles

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
up we find it in these little bubbles

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.539 
up we find it in these little bubbles
trapped<00:02:31.510> in<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.930> rock<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.379> we<00:02:33.370> can

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
trapped in the rock and we can

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.280 
trapped in the rock and we can
positively<00:02:33.939> identify<00:02:34.239> these<00:02:34.599> meteorites

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
positively identify these meteorites

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.619 
positively identify these meteorites
coming<00:02:35.500> from<00:02:35.739> Mars<00:02:36.120> they're<00:02:37.120> kind<00:02:37.510> of

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
coming from Mars they're kind of

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.050 
coming from Mars they're kind of
funny-looking<00:02:38.170> -<00:02:38.769> I<00:02:39.099> can<00:02:39.459> show<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.730> one<00:02:40.030> here

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
funny-looking - I can show you one here

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.990 
funny-looking - I can show you one here
I've<00:02:40.360> got<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.510> picture<00:02:40.689> of<00:02:40.930> one<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.879> this<00:02:42.879> is

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
I've got a picture of one and this is

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.449 
I've got a picture of one and this is
called<00:02:43.239> the<00:02:43.359> Nakhla<00:02:43.930> meteorite<00:02:44.530> and<00:02:44.769> you<00:02:45.310> can

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
called the Nakhla meteorite and you can

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.460 
called the Nakhla meteorite and you can
see<00:02:45.609> it's<00:02:45.760> green<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:46.450> kind<00:02:46.750> of<00:02:46.810> crystally<00:02:47.260> a

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
see it's green and kind of crystally a

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.110 
see it's green and kind of crystally a
lot<00:02:48.099> of<00:02:48.159> these<00:02:48.250> Martian<00:02:48.640> meteorites<00:02:49.000> are

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
lot of these Martian meteorites are

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.179 
lot of these Martian meteorites are
green<00:02:49.329> it<00:02:49.480> has<00:02:49.510> to<00:02:49.689> do<00:02:49.780> with<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.799> crystals

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:51.189 
green it has to do with the the crystals

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:53.550 
green it has to do with the the crystals
in<00:02:51.310> them<00:02:51.400> I<00:02:51.489> I<00:02:51.879> believe<00:02:52.480> its<00:02:52.629> olivine<00:02:53.200> which<00:02:53.439> is

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
in them I I believe its olivine which is

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.460 
in them I I believe its olivine which is
a<00:02:54.060> simple<00:02:55.060> mineral<00:02:55.540> but<00:02:55.629> it's<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.870> lovely<00:02:56.079> green

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
a simple mineral but it's a lovely green

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.800 
a simple mineral but it's a lovely green
like<00:02:56.859> that<00:02:57.060> that's<00:02:58.060> not<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.269> positive

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
like that that's not a positive

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.360 
like that that's not a positive
identification<00:02:59.170> of<00:02:59.680> a<00:02:59.739> Martian<00:03:00.099> meteorite

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
identification of a Martian meteorite

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.220 
identification of a Martian meteorite
there<00:03:01.269> are<00:03:01.359> other<00:03:01.540> meteorites<00:03:01.900> that<00:03:02.079> have

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
there are other meteorites that have

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.770 
there are other meteorites that have
olivine<00:03:02.709> in<00:03:02.829> them<00:03:02.980> or<00:03:03.670> that<00:03:03.970> are<00:03:04.090> green<00:03:04.450> in

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
olivine in them or that are green in

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.619 
olivine in them or that are green in
fact<00:03:05.019> but<00:03:05.980> that<00:03:06.010> is<00:03:06.519> one<00:03:06.879> thing<00:03:07.120> that<00:03:07.329> helps

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
fact but that is one thing that helps

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:09.300 
fact but that is one thing that helps
you<00:03:07.780> know<00:03:08.139> that<00:03:08.379> you're<00:03:08.500> seeing<00:03:08.769> a<00:03:08.950> Martian

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
you know that you're seeing a Martian

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.670 
you know that you're seeing a Martian
right<00:03:09.609> so<00:03:10.420> once<00:03:10.989> you've<00:03:11.109> identified<00:03:11.170> these

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
right so once you've identified these

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.619 
right so once you've identified these
things<00:03:11.829> as<00:03:11.950> Mark<00:03:12.159> as<00:03:12.579> being<00:03:12.879> marching<00:03:13.239> how<00:03:13.510> did

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
things as Mark as being marching how did

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:14.039 
things as Mark as being marching how did
they<00:03:13.689> get<00:03:13.810> here

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
they get here

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.129 
they get here
and<00:03:14.170> when<00:03:14.470> did<00:03:14.590> this<00:03:14.739> happen<00:03:15.099> well<00:03:15.959> there<00:03:16.959> are

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
and when did this happen well there are

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.629 
and when did this happen well there are
some<00:03:17.379> famous<00:03:17.530> Martian<00:03:18.010> meteorites<00:03:18.370> like<00:03:18.519> the

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
some famous Martian meteorites like the

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.309 
some famous Martian meteorites like the
Allen<00:03:18.939> Hills<00:03:19.150> meteorite<00:03:19.480> this<00:03:19.780> is<00:03:19.840> one<00:03:20.200> that

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
Allen Hills meteorite this is one that

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.369 
Allen Hills meteorite this is one that
was<00:03:20.439> found<00:03:20.620> in<00:03:21.159> Antarctica<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:22.379> they're

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:23.379 
was found in Antarctica and they're

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:25.949 
was found in Antarctica and they're
either<00:03:23.590> they're<00:03:23.950> really<00:03:24.129> cool<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:25.510> find<00:03:25.750> an

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
either they're really cool to find an

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.349 
either they're really cool to find an
article<00:03:26.200> because<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.799> ice<00:03:27.030> basically<00:03:28.030> over

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359

article because the ice basically over
over<00:03:28.720> long<00:03:29.109> periods<00:03:29.409> of<00:03:29.530> time<00:03:29.709> this

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
over long periods of time this

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.280 
over long periods of time this
circulates<00:03:30.940> and<00:03:31.150> so<00:03:31.359> a<00:03:31.389> meteorite<00:03:31.870> can<00:03:32.049> fall

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
circulates and so a meteorite can fall

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.800 
circulates and so a meteorite can fall
be<00:03:32.859> buried<00:03:33.310> in<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.549> ice<00:03:33.669> be<00:03:34.120> very<00:03:34.329> pristine

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
be buried in the ice be very pristine

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.720 
be buried in the ice be very pristine
and<00:03:34.959> then<00:03:35.079> come<00:03:35.260> back<00:03:35.290> up<00:03:35.440> a<00:03:35.799> long<00:03:36.250> time<00:03:36.280> later

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
and then come back up a long time later

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.009 
and then come back up a long time later
and<00:03:36.910> they're<00:03:37.030> very<00:03:37.150> easy<00:03:37.359> to<00:03:37.540> find<00:03:37.720> because

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
and they're very easy to find because

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.599 
and they're very easy to find because
meteorites<00:03:38.590> are<00:03:38.709> funny<00:03:38.889> color<00:03:39.099> they're<00:03:39.340> green

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
meteorites are funny color they're green

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.849 
meteorites are funny color they're green
or<00:03:39.910> they're<00:03:40.209> black<00:03:40.599> and<00:03:40.870> they're<00:03:41.470> sitting<00:03:41.799> on

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
or they're black and they're sitting on

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.470 
or they're black and they're sitting on
the<00:03:42.010> ice<00:03:42.129> and<00:03:42.519> when<00:03:42.699> you're<00:03:42.849> in<00:03:42.970> Antarctica

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
the ice and when you're in Antarctica

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.360 
the ice and when you're in Antarctica
you<00:03:44.199> know<00:03:44.290> and<00:03:44.500> there's<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:44.650> lot<00:03:44.709> of<00:03:44.889> ice<00:03:45.010> and

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
you know and there's a lot of ice and

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.740 
you know and there's a lot of ice and
there's<00:03:45.519> a<00:03:45.579> black<00:03:45.819> thing<00:03:46.030> sitting<00:03:46.269> on<00:03:46.449> it<00:03:46.569> it's

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
there's a black thing sitting on it it's

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.869 
there's a black thing sitting on it it's
very<00:03:46.959> easy<00:03:47.169> to<00:03:47.260> find<00:03:47.409> how<00:03:48.400> does<00:03:48.549> it<00:03:48.639> get<00:03:48.699> there

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
very easy to find how does it get there

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.879 
very easy to find how does it get there
well<00:03:49.060> this<00:03:49.720> is<00:03:49.870> actually<00:03:50.290> a<00:03:50.319> little<00:03:50.560> bit<00:03:50.739> of<00:03:50.829> a

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
well this is actually a little bit of a

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.009 
well this is actually a little bit of a
controversial<00:03:51.250> topic<00:03:51.549> but<00:03:52.299> basically

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
controversial topic but basically

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.830 
controversial topic but basically
there's<00:03:53.859> an<00:03:54.010> asteroid<00:03:54.400> impact<00:03:54.489> on<00:03:54.879> Mars<00:03:55.120> some

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
there's an asteroid impact on Mars some

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.719 
there's an asteroid impact on Mars some
asteroid<00:03:56.229> comes<00:03:56.470> in<00:03:56.709> Mars<00:03:57.250> has<00:03:57.430> a<00:03:57.459> thin

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:57.729 
asteroid comes in Mars has a thin

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:59.969 
asteroid comes in Mars has a thin
atmosphere<00:03:57.940> so<00:03:58.540> it<00:03:59.199> doesn't<00:03:59.500> take<00:03:59.590> a<00:03:59.620> huge

00:03:59.969 --> 00:03:59.979 
atmosphere so it doesn't take a huge

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:02.009 
atmosphere so it doesn't take a huge
asteroid<00:04:00.519> to<00:04:00.579> be<00:04:00.669> able<00:04:00.729> to<00:04:00.879> penetrate<00:04:01.030> Martian

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
asteroid to be able to penetrate Martian

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.990 
asteroid to be able to penetrate Martian
atmosphere<00:04:02.139> and<00:04:02.650> get<00:04:02.949> to<00:04:03.069> the<00:04:03.159> ground<00:04:03.400> when<00:04:03.909> it

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
atmosphere and get to the ground when it

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.259 
atmosphere and get to the ground when it
hits<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.329> ground<00:04:04.510> boom<00:04:05.260> it<00:04:05.590> blows<00:04:05.919> out

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
hits the ground boom it blows out

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.909 
hits the ground boom it blows out
shrapnel<00:04:07.269> debris<00:04:07.629> and<00:04:07.870> it<00:04:08.229> excavates<00:04:08.829> a

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
shrapnel debris and it excavates a

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:09.270 
shrapnel debris and it excavates a
crater

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
crater

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.539 
crater
now<00:04:09.970> Mars<00:04:10.959> is<00:04:11.379> smaller<00:04:11.769> than<00:04:12.159> the<00:04:12.280> earth<00:04:12.340> and

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
now Mars is smaller than the earth and

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.729 
now Mars is smaller than the earth and
it<00:04:12.669> has<00:04:12.819> a<00:04:12.849> much<00:04:13.090> lower<00:04:13.239> surface<00:04:13.780> gravity<00:04:13.989> so

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
it has a much lower surface gravity so

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.550 
it has a much lower surface gravity so
it's<00:04:14.919> not<00:04:15.129> as<00:04:15.340> hard<00:04:15.669> to<00:04:16.329> reject<00:04:16.449> rocks<00:04:17.139> into

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
it's not as hard to reject rocks into

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.890 
it's not as hard to reject rocks into
space<00:04:18.099> from<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.549> Martian<00:04:18.940> surface<00:04:19.090> as<00:04:19.479> it

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
space from the Martian surface as it

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.000 
space from the Martian surface as it
would<00:04:20.019> be<00:04:20.139> safe<00:04:20.349> from<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.590> Earth's<00:04:20.829> surface

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
would be safe from the Earth's surface

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.680 
would be safe from the Earth's surface
which<00:04:21.370> will<00:04:21.519> be<00:04:21.639> very<00:04:21.789> difficult<00:04:22.030> we<00:04:22.539> also

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
which will be very difficult we also

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.029 
which will be very difficult we also
have<00:04:22.870> a<00:04:22.930> thicker<00:04:23.110> atmosphere<00:04:23.199> and<00:04:23.800> that<00:04:23.830> makes

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
have a thicker atmosphere and that makes

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.909 
have a thicker atmosphere and that makes
it<00:04:24.190> hard<00:04:24.370> so<00:04:25.330> in<00:04:25.449> fact<00:04:25.720> when<00:04:26.530> you<00:04:26.650> do<00:04:26.770> the

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
it hard so in fact when you do the

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.399 
it hard so in fact when you do the
complicated<00:04:27.669> physics<00:04:28.150> of<00:04:28.419> this<00:04:28.599> you<00:04:29.080> find

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:29.409 
complicated physics of this you find

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:32.640 
complicated physics of this you find
that<00:04:29.620> you<00:04:29.800> can<00:04:30.070> in<00:04:30.250> fact<00:04:30.280> eject<00:04:31.000> debris<00:04:31.650> off

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
that you can in fact eject debris off

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.439 
that you can in fact eject debris off
the<00:04:32.710> surface<00:04:33.250> of<00:04:33.340> Mars<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:33.760> into<00:04:33.940> space<00:04:34.210> in

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
the surface of Mars and into space in

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.500 
the surface of Mars and into space in
fact<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.320> Martian<00:04:35.680> moon<00:04:35.860> Phobos<00:04:36.000> has<00:04:37.000> craters

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
fact the Martian moon Phobos has craters

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.269 
fact the Martian moon Phobos has craters
on<00:04:37.810> it<00:04:37.960> that<00:04:38.080> looked<00:04:38.320> like<00:04:38.529> they<00:04:38.979> may<00:04:39.250> have

00:04:39.269 --> 00:04:39.279 
on it that looked like they may have

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.230 
on it that looked like they may have
been

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
been

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.600 
been
when<00:04:40.720> debris<00:04:41.110> from<00:04:41.319> Mars<00:04:41.620> was<00:04:41.949> splashed<00:04:42.340> up<00:04:42.490> in

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
when debris from Mars was splashed up in

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.999 
when debris from Mars was splashed up in
space<00:04:42.910> and<00:04:43.120> the<00:04:43.569> moon<00:04:43.720> plowed<00:04:44.110> through<00:04:44.470> it<00:04:44.680> and

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:45.009 
space and the moon plowed through it and

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:46.890 
space and the moon plowed through it and
you<00:04:45.099> see<00:04:45.310> these<00:04:45.430> lines<00:04:45.819> of<00:04:46.120> craters<00:04:46.750> they're

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
you see these lines of craters they're

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.670 
you see these lines of craters they're
called<00:04:47.080> crater<00:04:47.259> chains<00:04:47.759> so<00:04:49.470> when<00:04:50.470> did<00:04:50.560> this

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
called crater chains so when did this

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.499 
called crater chains so when did this
happen<00:04:50.889> well<00:04:51.190> for<00:04:51.430> some<00:04:51.639> he<00:04:51.849> writes<00:04:52.090> we<00:04:52.270> think

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 
happen well for some he writes we think

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.990 
happen well for some he writes we think
they<00:04:53.169> may<00:04:53.349> have<00:04:53.500> actually<00:04:53.680> the<00:04:54.099> the<00:04:54.550> rock

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
they may have actually the the rock

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.450 
they may have actually the the rock
would<00:04:55.720> have<00:04:55.810> formed<00:04:56.080> billions<00:04:56.530> of<00:04:56.860> years<00:04:57.069> ago

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
would have formed billions of years ago

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.510 
would have formed billions of years ago
when<00:04:57.550> Mars<00:04:57.849> formed<00:04:58.539> or<00:04:58.840> maybe<00:04:59.199> later<00:04:59.560> because

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
when Mars formed or maybe later because

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.920 
when Mars formed or maybe later because
Mars<00:05:00.759> used<00:05:01.000> to<00:05:01.090> be<00:05:01.210> geologically<00:05:01.449> active

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
Mars used to be geologically active

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.450 
Mars used to be geologically active
maybe<00:05:02.319> even<00:05:02.620> as<00:05:02.710> recently<00:05:03.039> as<00:05:03.099> a<00:05:03.190> billion

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
maybe even as recently as a billion

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.790 
maybe even as recently as a billion
years<00:05:03.610> ago<00:05:03.729> so<00:05:04.300> rocks<00:05:04.569> were<00:05:04.780> formed<00:05:04.870> then<00:05:05.289> then

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
years ago so rocks were formed then then

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.620 
years ago so rocks were formed then then
a<00:05:05.830> meteor<00:05:06.190> an<00:05:06.759> asteroid<00:05:07.150> or<00:05:07.180> a<00:05:07.270> meteor<00:05:07.479> it

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
a meteor an asteroid or a meteor it

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.839 
a meteor an asteroid or a meteor it
comes<00:05:07.840> down<00:05:07.990> smacks<00:05:08.380> into<00:05:08.620> Mars<00:05:08.919> blast<00:05:09.669> this

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:09.849 
comes down smacks into Mars blast this

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:11.610 
comes down smacks into Mars blast this
thing<00:05:10.030> in<00:05:10.120> orbit<00:05:10.479> and<00:05:10.599> then<00:05:10.720> they<00:05:10.810> they<00:05:11.440> move

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
thing in orbit and then they they move

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.129 
thing in orbit and then they they move
around<00:05:11.770> in<00:05:12.009> space<00:05:12.389> maybe<00:05:13.389> on<00:05:13.599> an<00:05:13.720> elliptical

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
around in space maybe on an elliptical

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:15.420 
around in space maybe on an elliptical
orbit<00:05:14.289> around<00:05:14.440> the<00:05:14.650> Sun<00:05:14.860> until<00:05:15.069> the<00:05:15.280> earth

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
orbit around the Sun until the earth

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.430 
orbit around the Sun until the earth
smacks<00:05:15.909> into<00:05:16.210> it<00:05:16.330> and<00:05:16.690> then<00:05:16.840> it<00:05:16.960> falls<00:05:17.199> to<00:05:17.409> the

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
smacks into it and then it falls to the

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.059 
smacks into it and then it falls to the
ground<00:05:17.639> so<00:05:18.639> the<00:05:19.599> rock<00:05:19.810> probably<00:05:20.319> formed<00:05:20.770> like

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:21.069 
ground so the rock probably formed like

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:23.460 
ground so the rock probably formed like
Alan<00:05:21.430> Hills<00:05:21.610> meteorite<00:05:21.970> formed<00:05:22.810> billions<00:05:23.229> of

Alan Hills meteorite formed billions of

Alan Hills meteorite formed billions of
years<00:05:23.710> ago<00:05:23.949> it<00:05:24.669> was<00:05:24.909> probably<00:05:25.180> ejected<00:05:26.050> into

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
years ago it was probably ejected into

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.559 
years ago it was probably ejected into
space<00:05:26.340> millions<00:05:27.340> of<00:05:27.490> years<00:05:27.699> ago<00:05:27.819> circled<00:05:28.419> the

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:36.789 
thousand years now I'm giving you very

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:38.580 
thousand years now I'm giving you very
rough<00:05:37.000> numbers<00:05:37.360> but<00:05:37.750> that's<00:05:37.930> sort<00:05:38.289> of<00:05:38.440> the

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
rough numbers but that's sort of the

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.040 
rough numbers but that's sort of the
scale<00:05:38.830> of<00:05:39.069> these<00:05:39.190> things<00:05:39.659> probably<00:05:40.659> these

scale of these things probably these

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.580 
scale of these things probably these
meteorites<00:05:41.590> won't<00:05:41.860> stay<00:05:42.220> orbiting<00:05:42.699> the<00:05:42.789> Sun

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
meteorites won't stay orbiting the Sun

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.420 
meteorites won't stay orbiting the Sun
you<00:05:44.590> know<00:05:44.710> I'm<00:05:44.770> not<00:05:44.860> going<00:05:45.009> to<00:05:45.070> be<00:05:45.159> careful

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
you know I'm not going to be careful

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.589 
you know I'm not going to be careful
meteorites<00:05:45.849> after<00:05:46.090> it<00:05:46.150> hits<00:05:46.300> the<00:05:46.449> ground

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599 
meteorites after it hits the ground

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:48.689 
meteorites after it hits the ground
before<00:05:47.289> it<00:05:47.500> hits<00:05:47.710> us<00:05:47.860> it's<00:05:48.039> just<00:05:48.159> a<00:05:48.310> rock<00:05:48.490> from

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
before it hits us it's just a rock from

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:49.110 
before it hits us it's just a rock from
Mars

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
Mars

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.390 
Mars
so<00:05:49.539> it<00:05:49.870> won't<00:05:50.080> circle<00:05:50.440> the<00:05:50.530> Sun<00:05:50.740> for<00:05:50.979> billions

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
so it won't circle the Sun for billions

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.370 
so it won't circle the Sun for billions
of<00:05:51.520> years<00:05:51.580> because<00:05:52.030> at<00:05:52.270> some<00:05:52.449> point<00:05:52.479> the

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
of years because at some point the

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.740 
of years because at some point the
gravity<00:05:53.860> of<00:05:53.889> Mars<00:05:54.789> itself<00:05:55.180> or<00:05:55.389> the<00:05:55.479> earth<00:05:55.599> or

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
gravity of Mars itself or the earth or

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.600 
gravity of Mars itself or the earth or
Venus<00:05:55.990> or<00:05:56.139> something<00:05:56.409> will<00:05:56.830> change<00:05:56.860> its<00:05:57.430> orbit

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
Venus or something will change its orbit

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.180 
Venus or something will change its orbit
so<00:05:57.969> generally<00:05:58.810> the<00:05:59.349> lifetimes<00:05:59.919> of<00:06:00.039> those

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
so generally the lifetimes of those

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.890 
so generally the lifetimes of those
orbits<00:06:00.580> aren't<00:06:00.880> that<00:06:01.060> long<00:06:01.419> it's<00:06:01.719> not

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
orbits aren't that long it's not

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.480 
orbits aren't that long it's not
billions<00:06:02.380> of<00:06:02.469> years<00:06:02.710> it<00:06:02.800> might<00:06:02.919> be<00:06:03.039> tens<00:06:03.370> of

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
billions of years it might be tens of

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.420 
billions of years it might be tens of
millions<00:06:03.820> of<00:06:03.909> years<00:06:04.060> and<00:06:04.300> so<00:06:05.020> there<00:06:05.860> you<00:06:05.949> go<00:06:06.099> so

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
millions of years and so there you go so

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.390 
millions of years and so there you go so
again<00:06:06.729> for<00:06:07.690> billions<00:06:08.080> of<00:06:08.139> years<00:06:08.199> ago<00:06:08.400> ejected

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
again for billions of years ago ejected

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.510 
again for billions of years ago ejected
millions<00:06:09.759> of<00:06:09.909> years<00:06:10.090> ago<00:06:11.219> orbited<00:06:12.219> the<00:06:12.250> Sun

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
millions of years ago orbited the Sun

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.550 
millions of years ago orbited the Sun
for<00:06:13.240> that<00:06:13.360> time<00:06:13.599> and<00:06:13.630> then<00:06:13.990> slammed<00:06:14.259> into<00:06:14.469> the

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
for that time and then slammed into the

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.760 
for that time and then slammed into the
earth<00:06:14.680> and<00:06:15.479> there<00:06:16.479> was<00:06:16.659> a<00:06:16.690> Martian<00:06:17.080> meteorite

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
earth and there was a Martian meteorite

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.100 
earth and there was a Martian meteorite
that<00:06:18.069> just<00:06:18.250> fell<00:06:18.430> over<00:06:18.849> Northwest<00:06:19.719> Africa

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
that just fell over Northwest Africa

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.969 
that just fell over Northwest Africa
last<00:06:20.560> year<00:06:20.860> and<00:06:21.069> it<00:06:21.729> came<00:06:22.150> in<00:06:22.469> they<00:06:23.469> picked<00:06:23.860> it

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:23.979 
last year and it came in they picked it

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:25.680 
last year and it came in they picked it
up<00:06:24.039> they<00:06:24.219> found<00:06:24.610> it<00:06:24.819> picked<00:06:24.969> it<00:06:25.090> up<00:06:25.150> tested<00:06:25.569> it

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
up they found it picked it up tested it

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.510 
up they found it picked it up tested it
came<00:06:25.990> from<00:06:26.139> Mars<00:06:26.409> so<00:06:26.860> that<00:06:27.009> actually<00:06:27.310> has<00:06:27.460> only

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
came from Mars so that actually has only

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.100 
came from Mars so that actually has only
been<00:06:27.759> it<00:06:28.240> was<00:06:28.360> only<00:06:28.569> sitting<00:06:28.719> on<00:06:28.870> the<00:06:28.960> ground

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
been it was only sitting on the ground

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.839 
been it was only sitting on the ground
for<00:06:29.380> days<00:06:29.620> because<00:06:29.979> that<00:06:30.009> was<00:06:30.280> actually<00:06:30.400> seen

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:30.849 
for days because that was actually seen

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.610 
for days because that was actually seen
to<00:06:31.000> come<00:06:31.180> in<00:06:31.449> they<00:06:31.870> went<00:06:32.110> to<00:06:32.199> the<00:06:32.319> site<00:06:32.500> and

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
to come in they went to the site and

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.050 
to come in they went to the site and
found<00:06:32.800> those<00:06:33.099> those<00:06:33.340> meteorites<00:06:33.699> and<00:06:33.969> I'm

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
found those those meteorites and I'm

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.300 
found those those meteorites and I'm
pretty<00:06:34.210> sure<00:06:34.300> it<00:06:34.599> came<00:06:34.780> from<00:06:35.050> that<00:06:35.740> fireball

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
pretty sure it came from that fireball

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.399 
pretty sure it came from that fireball
that<00:06:36.490> was<00:06:36.610> witnessed<00:06:37.090> so<00:06:37.810> that<00:06:37.990> then<00:06:38.229> it<00:06:38.319> only

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:38.409 
that was witnessed so that then it only

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:39.839 
that was witnessed so that then it only
been<00:06:38.590> sitting<00:06:38.830> on<00:06:38.860> the<00:06:38.949> ground<00:06:39.130> for<00:06:39.370> you<00:06:39.729> know

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:39.849 
been sitting on the ground for you know

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:42.510 
been sitting on the ground for you know
hours<00:06:40.599> or<00:06:40.780> days<00:06:40.960> so<00:06:41.620> they<00:06:41.800> can<00:06:41.949> be<00:06:42.069> they<00:06:42.340> can<00:06:42.460> be

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 
hours or days so they can be they can be

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.920 
hours or days so they can be they can be
picked<00:06:42.729> up<00:06:42.819> after<00:06:42.969> their<00:06:43.210> thousands<00:06:43.630> of<00:06:43.750> years
