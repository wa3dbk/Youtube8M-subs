00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.620
 Y 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:17.230
 hello people now I bring you a recipe 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:19.930
 of a conditioner to comb cream 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.630
 to comb or living home that is a 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.150
 Coconut milk base goes very well because 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.640
 It hydrates a lot and above all has a 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.189
 high water content use this 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.320
 container as you can see there are remains of 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.809
 what I did before as it goes 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.739
 refrigerator and is well preserved 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:41.350
 reused without cleaning to use the 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.840
 maximum what is left and good 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.450
 you can simply use the milk of 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.760
 coconut you have on hand and use this 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.980
 tin 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.879
 you can use it also the one that comes in 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.190
 cardboard or tetra brik or if you can do it 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.469
 yourself at home homemade coconut milk 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.680
 perfect this one that used sports book in 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.489
 or to cook simply is to mix 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.110
 well I will use a cup that 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.440
 equals 8 ounces 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.560
 you can use the amount you prefer the 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:17.159
 measure are a quantity of coconut milk 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.560
 and half quantity of conditioners more 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.530
 the oils that you prefer now what 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.420
 I stir well and good 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.869
 simple this does not have much communication 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.590
 it's just mixing things I'll take more 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.730
 because I'm doing the recording 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.280
 tell them that this recipe is not in 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:41.240
 original but on the internet there are several 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.260
 me me I recommended it is already Carli me 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.270
 it has come to me of wonders 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.940
 and I'm going to use roughly half of 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.460
 the coconut milk and the rest I'll save it 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.460
 in a plastic container and freeze it 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.450
 in the fridge to use it in another 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.420
 olivi now I will take this measure that is of 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.490
 half a cup that equals 4 ounces and 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.909
 mix the conditioners that I'm 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.450
 using how they work very well 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.870
 this garnier and fruits that fruits 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.849
 now it's three oils that used to be 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.360
 obvious memory goes very well and also not 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:20.060
 have silicones I will use both the 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.580
 deep conditioner like the one that is 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.349
 to develop how is less 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.160
 surface 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.060
 Pon is the amount that seems to you 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.220
 best 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.400
 I will also mix this 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:39.220
 5 total repair conditioner 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.700
 that little has silicones and hair 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.760
 and raise also very well 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.810
 and it is now is to mix it with the 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.060
 coconut milk 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.280
 you can use the conditioners that 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.370
 you are using and that it works for you if 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.890
 you use things with silicone and they work 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.280
 you can use it with silicone I prefer 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.250
 without silicone or with 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.680
 soluble silicones then I will make them a 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:10.269
 review of the theme of silicone results 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:13.030
 now yes I will now put the oils to my 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.620
 taste here I show you this one that looks 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.290
 green because it's a mixture of 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.930
 olive oil and coconut oil as you know the 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.879
 coconut oil solidifies and I put it to 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.980
 remove in this glass that I have been left 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.260
 a little bit of olive oil from a 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.150
 treatment to 2015 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.569
 normally the fact more coconut oil 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.760
 but I only had one mat 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:38.829
 you can also put more oil 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:43.269
 olive and after this I will put oil 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:45.810
 of argan or manuel this oil is also 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.190
 very good for all hair types 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.480
 specialized 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:55.430
 I'll put half a teaspoon of can 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:58.650
 put more amount in addition to this time 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.350
 I'll use flour, I've 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.560
 bought in the training I will put a 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.980
 spoonful or so and I'll try to see 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.830
 How about I'm not sure it's 100% 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.280
 vegetable I hope it is 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:17.030
 and well we are being a little 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.250
 more careful the other time he put her 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.390
 He put more oil and I liked it this time 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:26.200
 for a change now add a 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.790
 spoonful of sweet almond oil 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.440
 You can also add more 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.910
 this 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.840
 and I think that I am of yes oils already 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.240
 is 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.820
 well you can put the oil you have 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.770
 by hand they do not have to be just 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.530
 what later if in your house you have 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.960
 avocado oil by busse oil 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.449
 avocado if you have coconut coconut if you do not 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.760
 you want to try putting oils on it 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:53.770
 put if you have a grape nugget 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.680
 you put property or water on you 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.949
 work for you or even better the one you have 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.390
 by hand and I like these I have at hand 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:05.790
 is what are the ones you have used 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.100
 now it's just mixing well and it 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.920
 will make a homogeneous mixture you can put 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.990
 the other time that last I did it 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.030
 I put a spoonful of honey and hair 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.210
 I fined that I stayed as freely 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:21.000
 I do not like it so now I will do it without the 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:26.150
 honey this amount I put in the fridge 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.740
 from the fridge and gives me to 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:35.229
 a month or a little more 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:38.470
 You can also use it in a bottle of 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:40.419
 atomizer you put some water and 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.550
 a few tablespoons of this and what 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.009
 you use to cool the curl 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.830
 I usually only use it when I 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:50.020
 I wash my hair to leave it in my hair 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:54.849
 clean then I'll show you how 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:58.330
 I use and well basically this is 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:00.399
 the truth is that I would advise them 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.069
 that they prove it because at least to me 

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:05.919
 hair is doing wonders, leave the curl 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:08.559
 highly defined and hydrated and although 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:11.919
 are many products that are not me 

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:15.520
 nothing happens because my hair needs a 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:17.409
 hydration we need to be very dry 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.559
 You need a lot of many things 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:23.080
 to be well hydrated you will see to what 

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:26.399
 I mean and then I will teach you in others 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:28.929
 in other deliveries before and after 

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:32.469
 how much did he apply to me 

00:06:28.929 --> 00:06:34.800
 used this amount gives me for a month 

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:37.389
 more or less or maybe a little more 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.300
 It depends on how you use it as you can 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:42.519
 see blends perfectly with the skin and 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:46.659
 also with the hair does not usually leave 

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:48.639
 waste I would tell them that that 

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:50.550
 they encourage you to try it and that you have tried 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:54.510
 Something similar 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.500
 share it with what they share below in 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.740
 the comments 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:01.530
 Well, I hope nothing has been useful 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:05.820
 and we continue to see each other here now 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:08.280
 I'll leave you some pictures and in the 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.910
 next delivery I hope to be able to teach you 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:13.710
 how my hair looks and how I apply it 

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:17.870
