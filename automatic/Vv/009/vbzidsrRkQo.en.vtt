00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.450
 So one of them should be with you 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.190
 do not want to deal with experimental physics 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.540
 Door is always open I apologize 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.620
 me again that the performance is not 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.030
 has worked properly but now 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.440
 At least we know what happens when 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.490
 one for oneself as the accidental one 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:22.360
 helium near and laser pours one 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:23.710
 Repetition would not be about the rate 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.510
 Department of theoretical physics 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.510
 informed doctor sheldon cooper now 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:38.559
 dr cooper innocent we were ourselves 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.329
 but agree to do that here 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.199
 this is pure waste of time of the 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.879
 I could do the laws of thermodynamics 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.969
 also equal to a very good labradoodle 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:49.649
 explain if you continue to take 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.649
 I do not invite you to the comic bookstore 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:53.339
 Hello 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:02.309
 by the way, that with the laser was one 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.080
 excellent performance with her 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.519
 fresh young faces remind you 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.110
 me to myself as myself one more 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.940
 modest graduate student 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.530
 was the one about his academic future 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.259
 decided 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.220
 Of course I was only 14 and had 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.180
 already achieved things from them 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.560
 most likely do not even dream 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.820
 although I'm always in bed at 9 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.470
 well, you had to like 102 of them 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.210
 maybe the stuff to have one 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.259
 distant day in theoretical physics 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.399
 to realize 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.630
 however, it is very much 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.490
 more likely that the tinkering of 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.810
 papier mÃ¢chÃ© volcano with fifth grader to 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.869
 culmination of their scientific 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.300
 career becomes 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.890
 you my goodness we told him we 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.149
 She had talked at some point in the 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.770
 Being able to become a significant 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.240
 contributing to the physics has to do them 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:48.619
 played badly and that's right 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.619
 bad questions 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.100
 Of course I do not cry 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.210
 the future of science if you 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.210
 I would now apologize for the new one 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.210
 edition of batman is complete 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.460
 actually the laser disposal was still 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:07.460
 not good what 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.970
 China has the think everything goes 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.970
 fashion star 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.120
 May 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.120
 March 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.920
 out
