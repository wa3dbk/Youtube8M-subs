00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.990 
front first step we've got to take the
lower<00:01:28.799> amount<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.159> our<00:01:29.280> shocks<00:01:29.520> off<00:01:29.729> actually

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
lower amount of our shocks off actually

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.219 
lower amount of our shocks off actually
in<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.360> rear<00:01:30.509> we're<00:01:30.600> going<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.750> remove<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
in the rear we're going to remove the

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.280 
in the rear we're going to remove the
whole<00:01:31.439> shock<00:01:32.390> next<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.540> our<00:01:33.689> sway<00:01:33.900> bar<00:01:34.110> link

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
whole shock next is our sway bar link

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.929 
whole shock next is our sway bar link
the<00:01:37.290> reason<00:01:37.740> for<00:01:37.920> removing<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.490> whole<00:01:38.700> shock

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
the reason for removing the whole shock

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.630 
the reason for removing the whole shock
on<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.299> rear<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.770> shock<00:01:40.979> extension

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
on the rear is that the shock extension

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.429 
on the rear is that the shock extension
for<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.880> back<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.270> seat<00:01:42.479> goes<00:01:43.170> on<00:01:43.350> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
for the back of the seat goes on the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.980 
for the back of the seat goes on the
upper<00:01:43.740> mount<00:01:44.210> now<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.360> we<00:01:45.450> have<00:01:45.570> our<00:01:45.600> shocks

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
upper mount now that we have our shocks

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.810 
upper mount now that we have our shocks
off<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.500> our<00:01:46.770> sway<00:01:46.920> bar<00:01:47.100> links<00:01:47.340> loose<00:01:47.520> we're

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
off and our sway bar links loose we're

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.609 
off and our sway bar links loose we're
going<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.000> remove<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.479> axle<00:01:48.960> side<00:01:49.140> bolt<00:01:49.439> on

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
going to remove the axle side bolt on

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.620 
going to remove the axle side bolt on
the<00:01:49.740> track<00:01:49.979> bar<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.549> give<00:01:50.700> us<00:01:50.850> enough<00:01:51.149> droop<00:01:51.450> to

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
the track bar to give us enough droop to

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.240 
the track bar to give us enough droop to
get<00:01:51.750> these<00:01:51.869> new<00:01:52.049> coil<00:01:52.320> springs<00:01:52.590> in
