00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.870 
that be garbage and the answer to that
question<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.770> if<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.070> just<00:00:17.190> take<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.580> look<00:00:17.730> at

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
question is if you just take a look at

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.599 
question is if you just take a look at
the<00:00:17.940> pc<00:00:18.420> version<00:00:18.449> it's<00:00:19.320> obviously<00:00:20.100> still<00:00:20.430> in

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
the pc version it's obviously still in

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.550 
the pc version it's obviously still in
development<00:00:21.240> it's<00:00:21.390> an<00:00:21.480> steam<00:00:22.109> early<00:00:22.380> access

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
development it's an steam early access

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.920 
development it's an steam early access
as<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.430> right<00:00:23.640> now<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.240> think<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.510> xbox

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
as of right now and I think the xbox

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.990 
as of right now and I think the xbox
one's<00:00:25.140> gonna<00:00:25.410> have<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.830> some<00:00:26.130> some<00:00:26.609> weird

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
one's gonna have to some some weird

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.509 
one's gonna have to some some weird
preview<00:00:27.900> things<00:00:28.230> they<00:00:28.439> announced<00:00:28.859> at<00:00:28.949> e3<00:00:29.070> or

preview things they announced at e3 or

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.700 
preview things they announced at e3 or
something<00:00:29.939> for<00:00:30.330> Daisy<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.560> basically

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
something for Daisy so that basically

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.260 
something for Daisy so that basically
means<00:00:31.980> are<00:00:32.279> going<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.460> be<00:00:32.550> developing<00:00:32.730> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
means are going to be developing the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.930 
means are going to be developing the
game<00:00:33.320> so<00:00:34.320> it's<00:00:34.739> gonna<00:00:34.920> be<00:00:35.010> like<00:00:35.130> almost<00:00:35.700> like<00:00:35.820> a

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
game so it's gonna be like almost like a

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.209 
game so it's gonna be like almost like a
basically<00:00:36.899> it's<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.260> beta<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.950> don't<00:00:38.129> have

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
basically it's a beta and you don't have

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.069 
basically it's a beta and you don't have
that<00:00:38.370> beta<00:00:38.670> stuff<00:00:39.059> works<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.540> know<00:00:39.600> people

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
that beta stuff works you know people

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.780 
that beta stuff works you know people
somehow<00:00:40.410> gain<00:00:40.739> actually<00:00:41.280> either<00:00:41.550> by

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
somehow gain actually either by

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.479 
somehow gain actually either by
pre-ordering<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.629> or<00:00:43.040> like<00:00:44.040> something<00:00:44.340> like

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
pre-ordering it or like something like

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.389 
pre-ordering it or like something like
that<00:00:44.850> or<00:00:45.120> they<00:00:45.360> like<00:00:45.690> some<00:00:46.050> wait<00:00:46.410> lists<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.219> get

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
that or they like some wait lists to get

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.430 
that or they like some wait lists to get
into<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> beta<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.360> they<00:00:48.539> want<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.960> play<00:00:49.140> it

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
than I do it's come a long way let me

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.390 
than I do it's come a long way let me
tell<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:09.840> it's<00:01:10.020> still<00:01:10.350> not<00:01:10.650> done<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
tell you but it's still not done on the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.789 
tell you but it's still not done on the
pc<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:11.909> i<00:01:12.180> don't<00:01:12.360> think<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.720> will<00:01:12.960> be<00:01:13.229> done<00:01:13.470> or

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
pc and i don't think it will be done or

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.700 
pc and i don't think it will be done or
close<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.729> being<00:01:15.000> done<00:01:15.030> on<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:16.080> next<00:01:16.560> gen

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
close to being done on the next gen

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.749 
close to being done on the next gen
consoles<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:18.000> if<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:19.049> does<00:01:19.380> launch<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:20.100> fairly

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
consoles so if it does launch is fairly

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.609 
consoles so if it does launch is fairly
close<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.330> will<00:01:21.479> probably<00:01:21.750> be<00:01:21.900> crap<00:01:22.320> and

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
close it will probably be crap and

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.460 
close it will probably be crap and
garbage<00:01:23.070> but<00:01:23.369> if<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:24.000> launches<00:01:24.470> sometime

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
garbage but if it launches sometime

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.370 
garbage but if it launches sometime
let's<00:01:25.710> say<00:01:25.920> net<00:01:26.250> like<00:01:26.580> 2016<00:01:27.450> or<00:01:27.659> sometime<00:01:28.140> guys

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
let's say net like 2016 or sometime guys

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.260 
let's say net like 2016 or sometime guys
then<00:01:29.040> it'll<00:01:29.310> probably<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> good<00:01:29.939> game

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
then it'll probably be a good game

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.940 
then it'll probably be a good game
because<00:01:30.540> i<00:01:30.810> would<00:01:30.990> think<00:01:31.259> by<00:01:31.530> then<00:01:31.740> they'd

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
because i would think by then they'd

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.280 
because i would think by then they'd
have<00:01:31.979> all<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.790> but<00:01:32.939> almost<00:01:33.390> almost<00:01:33.750> all

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
have all of the but almost almost all

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.710 
have all of the but almost almost all
the<00:01:34.470> bugs<00:01:34.650> worked<00:01:34.890> out<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.400> game<00:01:36.150> plot<00:01:36.390> and

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
the bugs worked out of the game plot and

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.660 
the bugs worked out of the game plot and

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
that's another thing it's not just about

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.670 
that's another thing it's not just about
the<00:01:38.909> game<00:01:39.090> played<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.659> makes<00:01:39.869> daisy<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.350> great

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
the game played that makes daisy a great

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.590 
the game played that makes daisy a great
game<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.130> mean<00:01:41.310> yeah<00:01:41.579> sure<00:01:41.939> if<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.390> have

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
game I mean yeah sure if you have

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.499 
game I mean yeah sure if you have
trouble<00:01:42.869> like<00:01:43.700> mapping<00:01:44.700> on<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.970> buttons<00:01:45.329> on

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
trouble like mapping on the buttons on

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.240 
trouble like mapping on the buttons on
this<00:01:45.630> controller<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.619> be<00:01:46.799> able<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.070> fit
