 with shirt polo shirt 1 is 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.079
 important the position of how to use anything 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.420
 back on the arm as it does not have a handle 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.890
 adjustable then always so 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.890

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.229
 mixed with fabric also a model 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.229
 more casual 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.909

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.159
 leather model still for travel 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.070

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.530
 adjustable here you can use both the 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.590
 shoulder of the cross-piece and holding the 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.590
 hand 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.780
 here would be more for tailoring suit
