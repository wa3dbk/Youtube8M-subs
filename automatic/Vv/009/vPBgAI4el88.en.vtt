00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
the kill switch is not a killer motor so

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:47.820 
the kill switch is not a killer motor so
that'll<00:01:46.060> give<00:01:46.179> you<00:01:46.240> time<00:01:46.270> to<00:01:46.709> take<00:01:47.709> control

the left side of the bike so your left
side<00:02:02.890> of<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.039> bike<00:02:03.220> is<00:02:03.490> basically<00:02:04.119> your

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
side of the bike is basically your

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.260 
side of the bike is basically your
shifting<00:02:05.080> side<00:02:05.319> down<00:02:06.280> here<00:02:08.849> that's<00:02:09.849> by<00:02:09.970> seeing

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
shifting side down here that's by seeing

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.940 
shifting side down here that's by seeing
your<00:02:10.300> section<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:11.290> is<00:02:11.440> what<00:02:11.560> shifts<00:02:11.830> all

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
your section this is what shifts all

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.250 
your section this is what shifts all
your<00:02:12.099> gear<00:02:12.220> up<00:02:12.490> and<00:02:12.610> down<00:02:12.819> and<00:02:13.110> I'll<00:02:14.110> talk

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
your gear up and down and I'll talk

about a little later afterward to kind
of<00:02:15.849> explain<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.870> shifting<00:02:17.770> on<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.550> bike<00:02:20.099> in

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
of explain the shifting on a bike in

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.479 
of explain the shifting on a bike in
here<00:02:21.580> on<00:02:21.790> your<00:02:21.970> arm<00:02:22.319> handle<00:02:23.319> you<00:02:24.130> have<00:02:24.280> this

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
here on your arm handle you have this

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:25.500 
here on your arm handle you have this
year<00:02:24.640> doesn't<00:02:24.880> really<00:02:25.030> do<00:02:25.120> anything<00:02:25.300> it's

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
year doesn't really do anything it's

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.479 
year doesn't really do anything it's
just<00:02:25.540> for<00:02:25.810> grip<00:02:26.020> so<00:02:26.319> just<00:02:26.800> hold<00:02:27.069> on<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.370> this

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
just for grip so just hold on to this

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.820 
just for grip so just hold on to this
but<00:02:28.120> here<00:02:28.300> this<00:02:28.480> here<00:02:28.720> is<00:02:28.900> for<00:02:29.200> your<00:02:29.260> clutch<00:02:29.500> so
