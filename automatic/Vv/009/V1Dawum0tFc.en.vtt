00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
and it was all contained within one

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.990 
and it was all contained within one
episode<00:00:20.010> which<00:00:20.189> made<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.609> little<00:00:20.760> bit

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000

against<00:04:41.020> these<00:04:41.199> zetsu's<00:04:41.620> again<00:04:41.860> ending<00:04:42.310> the

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
against these zetsu's again ending the

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.950 
against these zetsu's again ending the
episode<00:04:42.880> I<00:04:43.120> think<00:04:43.330> the<00:04:43.419> best<00:04:43.690> thing<00:04:43.780> about

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
episode I think the best thing about

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.629 
episode I think the best thing about
this<00:04:44.080> episode<00:04:44.500> was<00:04:44.560> probably<00:04:44.860> the<00:04:44.979> atmosphere

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
this episode was probably the atmosphere

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.580 
this episode was probably the atmosphere
like<00:04:45.820> I<00:04:45.970> said<00:04:46.180> I<00:04:46.210> liked<00:04:46.510> when<00:04:46.750> they<00:04:46.870> animated

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
like I said I liked when they animated

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.110 
like I said I liked when they animated
everything<00:04:48.070> kind<00:04:48.280> of<00:04:48.340> like<00:04:48.430> in<00:04:48.550> that<00:04:48.610> sunset

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
everything kind of like in that sunset

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.580 
everything kind of like in that sunset
setting<00:04:49.539> I<00:04:49.630> always<00:04:49.840> think<00:04:50.050> that<00:04:50.199> really<00:04:50.440> adds

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
setting I always think that really adds

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.279 
setting I always think that really adds
a<00:04:50.740> lot<00:04:50.889> of<00:04:51.070> emotion<00:04:52.030> to<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:52.300> scenes<00:04:52.570> and<00:04:52.870> at

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
a lot of emotion to the scenes and at

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:54.240 
a lot of emotion to the scenes and at
the<00:04:53.440> end<00:04:53.560> when<00:04:53.740> they<00:04:53.830> were<00:04:53.889> doing<00:04:54.010> the<00:04:54.130> whole

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
the end when they were doing the whole

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.860 
the end when they were doing the whole
fireworks<00:04:54.760> festival<00:04:55.150> it<00:04:55.449> looked<00:04:55.660> really

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
fireworks festival it looked really

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.659

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
really good and really festive and it's

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.129 
really good and really festive and it's
