00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
comfortable I actually didn't get to try

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.240

the Superfly threes when they came out
from<00:02:26.400> last<00:02:26.519> year<00:02:26.849> just<00:02:27.840> because<00:02:27.959> i<00:02:28.139> really

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
from last year just because i really

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.690 
from last year just because i really
wasn't<00:02:28.590> too<00:02:28.829> big<00:02:29.010> in<00:02:29.129> the<00:02:29.219> sneakers<00:02:29.519> at<00:02:29.639> the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
wasn't too big in the sneakers at the

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.690 
wasn't too big in the sneakers at the
time<00:02:29.879> um<00:02:30.810> but<00:02:31.260> trying<00:02:31.920> these<00:02:32.099> i<00:02:32.280> was<00:02:32.430> like<00:02:32.549> damn

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
time um but trying these i was like damn

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.429 
time um but trying these i was like damn
these<00:02:33.000> are<00:02:33.030> really<00:02:33.540> comfortable<00:02:33.900> these<00:02:34.200> might

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
these are really comfortable these might

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.649 
these are really comfortable these might
be<00:02:34.680> up<00:02:35.219> there<00:02:35.579> you<00:02:35.849> know<00:02:35.879> I<00:02:35.969> think<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.299> Jordan

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
be up there you know I think the Jordan

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.209 
be up there you know I think the Jordan
20<00:02:36.930> knives<00:02:37.109> are<00:02:37.319> still<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.680> most<00:02:37.709> comfortable

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:38.219 
20 knives are still the most comfortable

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:40.459 
20 knives are still the most comfortable
basketball<00:02:38.760> shoe<00:02:38.939> to<00:02:39.060> me<00:02:39.180> that<00:02:39.930> I've<00:02:40.049> worn<00:02:40.290> so

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:40.469 
basketball shoe to me that I've worn so

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:41.750 
basketball shoe to me that I've worn so
far<00:02:40.739> but<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.040> think<00:02:41.310> these<00:02:41.430> are<00:02:41.489> definitely

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
far but I think these are definitely

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.270 
far but I think these are definitely
next<00:02:42.209> in<00:02:42.450> line<00:02:42.750> with<00:02:43.439> the<00:02:43.859> comfortability

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
next in line with the comfortability

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.360 
next in line with the comfortability
getting<00:02:45.000> into<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.359> texture<00:02:45.900> on<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:46.829> top<00:02:47.189> the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
getting into the texture on the top the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.740 
getting into the texture on the top the
other<00:02:47.400> material<00:02:48.500> it's<00:02:49.500> like<00:02:49.650> this<00:02:50.180> mesh<00:02:51.180> but<00:02:51.689> i

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
other material it's like this mesh but i

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.440 
other material it's like this mesh but i
think<00:02:52.049> they<00:02:52.200> call<00:02:52.439> it<00:02:52.849> this<00:02:53.849> engineered

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
think they call it this engineered

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.129 
think they call it this engineered
textile<00:02:55.169> uh<00:02:56.450> pretty<00:02:57.450> nice<00:02:57.629> I<00:02:57.900> mean<00:02:57.989> I<00:02:58.049> guess

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
textile uh pretty nice I mean I guess

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.720 
textile uh pretty nice I mean I guess
they<00:02:58.379> did<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.769> to<00:02:59.310> make<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.579> more

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
they did it to to make it more

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.990 
they did it to to make it more
breathable<00:03:00.359> um<00:03:01.280> given<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.310> shoe<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.730> little

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
breathable um given that shoe a little

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.059 
breathable um given that shoe a little
more<00:03:03.120> ventilation<00:03:03.419> that<00:03:03.870> way<00:03:03.989> you<00:03:04.650> know<00:03:04.769> your

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
more ventilation that way you know your

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.099 
more ventilation that way you know your
feet<00:03:05.250> don't<00:03:05.430> stink<00:03:05.700> after<00:03:06.419> you<00:03:06.689> don't<00:03:06.870> play<00:03:07.049> in

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
feet don't stink after you don't play in

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.229 
feet don't stink after you don't play in
but<00:03:08.099> you<00:03:08.280> know<00:03:08.400> what<00:03:08.579> I<00:03:08.609> really<00:03:09.030> like<00:03:09.209> about

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
but you know what I really like about

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.789 
but you know what I really like about
the<00:03:09.569> shoe<00:03:09.719> is<00:03:09.840> just<00:03:10.019> a<00:03:10.109> way<00:03:10.230> that<00:03:10.409> it<00:03:10.530> fades

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
the shoe is just a way that it fades

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.750 
the shoe is just a way that it fades
from<00:03:11.099> that<00:03:11.370> red<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.109> green<00:03:13.440> it's<00:03:14.400> even<00:03:14.639> got

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
from that red to the green it's even got

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.780 
from that red to the green it's even got
these<00:03:14.970> little<00:03:15.889> segments<00:03:16.889> right<00:03:17.250> here<00:03:17.459> I<00:03:17.489> guess

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
these little segments right here I guess

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.330 
these little segments right here I guess
so<00:03:18.030> you<00:03:18.419> know<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.659> shoe<00:03:18.870> is<00:03:19.379> more<00:03:19.680> flexible<00:03:19.889> at

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
so you know the shoe is more flexible at

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.240 
so you know the shoe is more flexible at
those<00:03:20.519> certain<00:03:20.819> points<00:03:21.209> um<00:03:21.620> but<00:03:22.620> yeah<00:03:22.799> the

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
those certain points um but yeah the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.759 
those certain points um but yeah the
bottom<00:03:23.609> two<00:03:23.790> as<00:03:24.000> well<00:03:24.199> traction<00:03:25.199> you<00:03:25.290> got<00:03:25.470> a

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
bottom two as well traction you got a

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.099 
bottom two as well traction you got a
little<00:03:26.250> bit<00:03:26.489> of<00:03:26.519> that<00:03:26.609> herringbone<00:03:27.109> going

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
little bit of that herringbone going

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.270 
little bit of that herringbone going
along<00:03:28.260> right<00:03:28.409> there<00:03:28.590> you<00:03:28.709> can<00:03:28.859> see<00:03:28.889> you<00:03:29.129> got

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
along right there you can see you got

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.319 
along right there you can see you got
that<00:03:29.430> that<00:03:29.909> zoom<00:03:30.590> on<00:03:31.590> they<00:03:31.949> also<00:03:32.099> got<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:33.120> see

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
that that zoom on they also got it see

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.689 
that that zoom on they also got it see
if<00:03:33.389> I<00:03:33.449> you<00:03:33.510> guys<00:03:33.720> could<00:03:33.959> see<00:03:34.430> without<00:03:35.430> the

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:35.699 
if I you guys could see without the

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:37.280 
if I you guys could see without the
glare<00:03:35.970> there<00:03:36.239> anyways<00:03:36.659> right<00:03:36.870> there<00:03:37.079> on<00:03:37.260> that

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
glare there anyways right there on that

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.369 
glare there anyways right there on that
red<00:03:37.620> it<00:03:37.949> says<00:03:38.310> flight<00:03:38.699> speed<00:03:39.150> I<00:03:39.449> guess<00:03:40.079> it's<00:03:40.259> a

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
red it says flight speed I guess it's a

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.819 
red it says flight speed I guess it's a
new<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:41.040> guess<00:03:41.790> maybe<00:03:42.000> an<00:03:42.150> upgrade<00:03:42.540> from<00:03:43.290> the

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
new I guess maybe an upgrade from the

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.809 
new I guess maybe an upgrade from the
flight<00:03:44.099> plate<00:03:44.370> technology<00:03:45.090> that<00:03:45.689> they<00:03:45.810> had

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
flight plate technology that they had

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.129 
flight plate technology that they had
honestly<00:03:47.819> I<00:03:48.359> don't<00:03:48.750> know<00:03:48.900> what<00:03:49.049> the

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
honestly I don't know what the

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.080 
honestly I don't know what the
difference<00:03:49.259> is<00:03:49.620> it<00:03:49.949> seems<00:03:50.489> like<00:03:50.699> you<00:03:50.729> couldn't

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
difference is it seems like you couldn't

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.999 
difference is it seems like you couldn't
do<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.299> same<00:03:51.479> thing<00:03:51.780> I<00:03:51.989> know<00:03:52.290> reading<00:03:52.769> up<00:03:52.919> on

do the same thing I know reading up on

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:54.949 
do the same thing I know reading up on
the<00:03:53.159> shoe<00:03:53.310> before<00:03:53.459> it<00:03:53.729> came<00:03:53.909> out<00:03:54.060> it<00:03:54.569> said<00:03:54.840> it

the shoe before it came out it said it

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.210 
the shoe before it came out it said it
basically<00:03:55.259> does<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.620> same<00:03:55.799> thing<00:03:55.979> as<00:03:56.099> the

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
basically does the same thing as the

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.460
