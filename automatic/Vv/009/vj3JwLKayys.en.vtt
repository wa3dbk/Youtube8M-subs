 with you the progress in our

 labor product strategy in the 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.860
 country and they could see the design 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.680
 outside of the vehicles that we are going to 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.940
 be presenting in 2013 in Argentina 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.770
 the presence of these cars 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.480
 especially the focus means a 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.070
 very important investment that made it strong 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.719
 in recent years in recent months 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.610
 we tell a little how it's going to be produced 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.610
 this beyond serial production 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.980
 from cars good as you say by 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.510
 he invested 200 million dollars to 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.579
 have this product manufactured in the 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.230
 pacheco plant with the launch of 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.600
 new focuses this year our plant in 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.530
 Argentina will produce exclusively 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.780
 global platforms the new ranger 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.220
 and the new focus which is a pride 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.260
 for us because it is also 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.119
 making it possible to increase our 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.500
 production capacity and take 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.780
 around 300 new positions of 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.430
 work which is an objective that 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.680
 we always have here in Argentina from 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.960
 keep growing not only sales 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.369
 of cars but growing as production 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.280
 and contributing to the development of 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.560
 society a while ago spoke our 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.899
 was going to be its president enrique and 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.060
 I was talking about something very important that 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.649
 has to with social responsibility 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.880
 special physical businesswoman 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.600
 specifically with something that 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.100
 you make a lot of emphasis 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.380
 permanently that is the subject of 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.700
 colleges that they have made and of which 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.990
 I have participated in some 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.330
 of the actions that have made them count 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.399
 a little how is that topic today 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.770
 practically mid-year 2013 good 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.069
 is more current than ever like you 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.869
 you say in fort we believe that success 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.520
 sustainable a business is intimately 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.440
 related to the development of 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.690
 society where it operates and we are 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.450
 convinced that education is the engine 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.700
 able to generate the true true 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.019
 sustainable development of society 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.910
 that's why our strong commitment to 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.230
 education we have two programs that are 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.780
 very important 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.700
 it's the henry ford technical school what is it 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.379
 a secondary technical school open to 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.720
 the community of academic excellence that 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.370
 works within our plant and 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.590
 which have already graduated more than 1300 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.950
 students since the year thousand 965 until now 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.110
 the other is the school program 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.670
 rural and border in which for 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.340
 together with its dealer network 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.170
 built and donated 41 schools throughout 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.870
 and across the country in the decades of 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.790
 70 and 80 and since 2002 we are 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.920
 remodeling and modernizing putting them 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.780
 new one week ago just 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.250
 we reopened school number 19 in 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.010
 catamarca and is a program that continues 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.480
 already the workshop has moved to the next 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.890
 School of Santiago del Estero and 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.660
 we hope before the end of the year to have 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.890
 finished school number 20 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.129
 Carlos, let's go back to the car show 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.640
 Here I have a new party 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.750
 the spectacular focus I have the juice 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.810
 wonderful 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.360
 with which other cars we will be able to tell 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.770
 at the ford stand including some 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.500
 that you out there today are covered and not 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.150
 you can say look, tell us a little bit of 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.680
 that we are going to see already in that audio that 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.420
 it starts in a couple of good days in the 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.010
 motor show basically like 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.180
 important news for the market 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.280
 Argentine are going to do these three 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.230
 products something that if we are going to have and 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.910
 that for us, I think it's going to 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.390
 to like people very much is the concept 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.990
 of voice the concept was the concept of 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.970
 that the kinetic design 2.0 was born so 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.130
 it's a really spectacular car very 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.870
 cute to see and when they see it they go to 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.580
 recognize many of the traits that today 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.290
 they have our new global models 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.300
 in the evos that will be displayed in the 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.790
 May lounge I see the cinema is in front 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.709
 beyond that is smaller I transport myself 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.510
 I close my eyes and see one of the nascar 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.620
 that runs usually in spring cup and 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.450
 that I can see you on Sundays 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.070
 television running beyond that is 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.900
 much bigger of course but 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.130
 let's say it's the same is the same tube 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.540
 of the car with which in a way 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.850
 they follow what we were talking about just 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.320
 still in ford we have decided already 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.630
 several years have a global strategy 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.220
 of business that involves a strategy 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.910
 overall development strategy 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.610
 products 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.320
 and we have defined to have a promise of 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.080
 brand and an identity mark already 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.570
 global this consistency is seen in the 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.269
 time once recognizes a ford car 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.560
 seeing it from a block that was what 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.270
 we were looking for we have a 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.030
 design identity that people 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.760
 like it and make it easily identifiable 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.430
 when one sees a ford closing give me a 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.920
 your opinion about how it comes 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.390
 being the year for fort in regards to your 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.220
 sales in terms of production as 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.710
 to exports and how will they be 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.810

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.350
 success and today we are capitalizing on that 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.290
 success 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.360

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.180
 uploaded to our market share in 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.920
 around 1.2 percentage points 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.440
 taking more accumulated and we 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.970
 we are very optimistic that as 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.350
 that we are introducing the new 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.120
