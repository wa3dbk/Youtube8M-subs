clutch<00:00:04.259> assemblies<00:00:05.100> off<00:00:05.370> of<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:06.540> Revo<00:00:06.960> now<00:00:07.830> I

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
clutch assemblies off of the Revo now I

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.129 
clutch assemblies off of the Revo now I
can<00:00:08.130> compare<00:00:08.580> them<00:00:08.700> for<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:09.000> guys<00:00:09.179> and<00:00:09.480> tell

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
can compare them for you guys and tell

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.580 
can compare them for you guys and tell
you<00:00:10.260> exactly<00:00:10.800> why<00:00:11.219> I'm<00:00:11.580> making<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.210> switch

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
you exactly why I'm making the switch

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.039 
you exactly why I'm making the switch
all<00:00:13.590> right<00:00:13.710> so<00:00:13.920> first<00:00:14.250> off<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.580> can<00:00:14.910> see<00:00:15.210> that

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
all right so first off you can see that

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.439 
all right so first off you can see that
the<00:00:16.500> stock<00:00:18.800> spur<00:00:19.800> gear<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.449> significantly

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
the stock spur gear is significantly

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.189 
the stock spur gear is significantly
bigger<00:00:22.050> than<00:00:22.609> the<00:00:23.609> Robinson<00:00:24.240> Racing<00:00:24.539> one<00:00:24.660> this

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
bigger than the Robinson Racing one this

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.300 
bigger than the Robinson Racing one this
is<00:00:25.410> 60<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> tooth<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:26.760> one<00:00:26.970> here<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.269> 60<00:00:27.750> tooth

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.890 
is 60 a tooth this one here is 60 tooth
yeah<00:00:29.310> that's<00:00:29.640> pretty<00:00:30.300> much<00:00:30.420> going<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.750> give

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
yeah that's pretty much going to give

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.220 
yeah that's pretty much going to give
you<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.050> little<00:00:31.320> bit<00:00:31.470> more<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:32.009> top<00:00:32.880> end<00:00:33.420> you

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
you a little bit more on top end you

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.830 
you a little bit more on top end you
know<00:00:34.350> it's<00:00:34.950> all<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.489> your<00:00:36.090> own<00:00:36.270> preference

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
that's just the way I like it so if we

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.729 
that's just the way I like it so if we
flip<00:00:40.469> them<00:00:40.739> here<00:00:40.950> you'll<00:00:41.670> notice<00:00:42.440> you<00:00:43.440> got<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739

three clutch pads here okay so now just

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.290 
three clutch pads here okay so now just
after<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.989> day's<00:00:48.989> worth<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.739> running<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.340> mean

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
after a day's worth of running I mean

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.189 
after a day's worth of running I mean
them<00:00:51.510> pads<00:00:51.780> are<00:00:52.050> really<00:00:52.680> worn<00:00:53.160> down<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:54.199> then

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
them pads are really worn down and then

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.080 
them pads are really worn down and then
this<00:00:55.379> plate<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:56.100> can<00:00:56.309> see<00:00:56.520> these<00:00:56.579> already<00:00:56.850> got

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
this plate you can see these already got

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.139 
this plate you can see these already got
rings<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.719> mean<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.680> should<00:00:58.859> be<00:00:58.890> shiny<00:00:59.370> like

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
rings I mean it should be shiny like

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.389 
rings I mean it should be shiny like
that<00:01:00.390> that's<00:01:00.690> how<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.899> comes<00:01:01.280> but<00:01:02.280> it's

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399

already pretty worn out lettering is

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.370 
already pretty worn out lettering is
more<00:01:06.320> advantageous<00:01:07.700> because<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.990> surface

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
more advantageous because of the surface

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.060 
more advantageous because of the surface
area<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.860> mean<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.640> got<00:01:12.260> three<00:01:13.260> tiny<00:01:13.680> little

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
going to chip or strip because I have

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.100 
going to chip or strip because I have
got<00:01:35.150> one<00:01:35.450> to<00:01:35.600> chip<00:01:35.870> before<00:01:36.130> but<00:01:37.130> that<00:01:37.280> was<00:01:37.460> in

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
got one to chip before but that was in

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.240 
got one to chip before but that was in
some<00:01:39.110> pretty<00:01:39.350> harsh<00:01:39.710> weather<00:01:40.280> climate<00:01:40.990> so

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250

some pretty harsh weather climate so
yeah<00:01:43.250> we'll<00:01:44.180> just<00:01:44.360> leave<00:01:44.510> it<00:01:44.600> at<00:01:44.720> that

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
yeah we'll just leave it at that

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.640 
yeah we'll just leave it at that
really<00:01:46.400> it's<00:01:46.750> there's<00:01:47.750> been<00:01:47.960> no<00:01:48.140> problem<00:01:48.530> with

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
like crazy you know it's real easy to

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.850 
like crazy you know it's real easy to
another<00:01:55.430> thing<00:01:55.760> that<00:01:56.150> I<00:01:56.420> really<00:01:56.960> like<00:01:57.650> about

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
another thing that I really like about

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.450 
another thing that I really like about
the<00:01:58.690> Robinson<00:01:59.690> racing<00:02:00.140> versus<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:01.040> stock

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
Trax's it's just the ease of assembly so

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.780 
Trax's it's just the ease of assembly so
when<00:02:06.170> you<00:02:06.290> got<00:02:06.440> the<00:02:06.650> Traxxas<00:02:07.130> one<00:02:07.310> you<00:02:07.580> got<00:02:07.760> a

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
this stays in all four of its pins while

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.510 
this stays in all four of its pins while
