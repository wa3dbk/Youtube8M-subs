00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
it'll take you to wherever wherever you

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.730 
it'll take you to wherever wherever you
have<00:01:59.369> your<00:01:59.399> presets<00:02:00.090> just<00:02:00.960> go<00:02:01.140> there<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.619> then

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
have your presets just go there and then

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.100 
have your presets just go there and then
you<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:02.040> just<00:02:02.159> start<00:02:02.369> loading<00:02:03.329> in<00:02:03.600> presets

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
you can just start loading in presets

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.100 
you can just start loading in presets
like<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.530> so

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.120 

hold<00:02:09.110> on<00:02:09.290> whoops<00:02:10.660> let<00:02:11.660> me<00:02:11.690> go<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:11.930> my<00:02:12.290> Ableton

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
hold on whoops let me go to my Ableton

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.790 
hold on whoops let me go to my Ableton
proof<00:02:14.440> here<00:02:15.440> we<00:02:15.530> go<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:15.770> you<00:02:15.860> out<00:02:16.160> this<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.640> my

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
proof here we go and you out this to my

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:25.960 
proof here we go and you out this to my
small<00:02:18.800> interface<00:02:21.970> okay<00:02:22.970> so<00:02:24.370> pretty<00:02:25.370> much<00:02:25.520> now

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
small interface okay so pretty much now

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.270 
small interface okay so pretty much now
I<00:02:26.290> have<00:02:27.290> this<00:02:27.470> loaded<00:02:27.980> in<00:02:28.130> patch<00:02:30.280> everything

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
I have this loaded in patch everything

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.820 
I have this loaded in patch everything
else<00:02:32.500> so<00:02:33.500> um<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:35.390> way<00:02:35.570> you<00:02:35.630> can<00:02:35.960> name<00:02:36.320> this<00:02:36.530> is

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
you click on this dot right here so this

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.230 
you click on this dot right here so this
dot<00:02:39.080> and<00:02:39.560> you<00:02:39.740> can<00:02:39.890> call<00:02:40.160> it<00:02:40.340> or<00:02:40.580> whatever<00:02:41.000> the

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
dot and you can call it or whatever the

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.080 
dot and you can call it or whatever the
hell<00:02:41.360> you<00:02:41.480> want<00:02:41.630> patch<00:02:41.870> blah<00:02:42.500> blah<00:02:42.680> blah<00:02:43.090> so

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
hell you want patch blah blah blah so

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.380 
hell you want patch blah blah blah so
it's<00:02:44.360> now<00:02:44.570> patch<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:46.760> gotta<00:02:46.940> click<00:02:47.210> back

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
it's now patch and you gotta click back

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.360 
it's now patch and you gotta click back
on<00:02:47.570> fine<00:02:49.180> so<00:02:50.180> that<00:02:50.840> one<00:02:51.080> is<00:02:51.110> loaded<00:02:51.770> into<00:02:52.070> the

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
on fine so that one is loaded into the

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.360 
on fine so that one is loaded into the
bank<00:02:52.610> so<00:02:53.090> now<00:02:53.330> you<00:02:53.750> just<00:02:53.930> go<00:02:54.140> down<00:02:54.800> and<00:02:55.130> then

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
bank so now you just go down and then

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.250 
bank so now you just go down and then
you<00:02:55.490> can<00:02:55.640> load<00:02:55.790> in<00:02:55.970> another<00:02:56.270> one<00:02:56.480> so<00:02:56.810> I<00:02:57.080> guess

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
you can load in another one so I guess

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.760 
you can load in another one so I guess
load<00:02:57.590> in<00:02:57.770> another<00:02:58.070> preset<00:02:58.990> it<00:02:59.990> doesn't<00:03:00.680> really

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
load in another preset it doesn't really

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.000 
load in another preset it doesn't really
matter<00:03:00.980> what<00:03:02.770> again

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
matter what again

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.190 
matter what again
name<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:04.400> whatever<00:03:04.550> you<00:03:04.850> want<00:03:04.970> name<00:03:05.300> it<00:03:05.510> bla

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
name it whatever you want name it bla

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.300 
name it whatever you want name it bla
bla<00:03:06.740> bla

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
bla bla

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:14.380 
bla bla
if<00:03:07.640> you<00:03:07.820> want<00:03:08.350> and<00:03:12.760> now<00:03:13.760> that's<00:03:14.090> how<00:03:14.239> you<00:03:14.270> make

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
if you want and now that's how you make

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.430 
if you want and now that's how you make
banks<00:03:15.140> so<00:03:15.980> it's<00:03:16.520> very<00:03:16.760> tedious<00:03:17.150> it<00:03:17.570> takes

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
banks so it's very tedious it takes

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.080 
banks so it's very tedious it takes
forever<00:03:18.650> to<00:03:19.010> do<00:03:19.160> especially<00:03:19.520> if<00:03:19.820> you<00:03:19.970> have

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
forever to do especially if you have

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.180 
forever to do especially if you have
like<00:03:20.300> 400<00:03:21.080> presets<00:03:21.530> you<00:03:21.620> want<00:03:21.800> to<00:03:21.860> put<00:03:22.010> into

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
like 400 presets you want to put into

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.900 
like 400 presets you want to put into
one<00:03:22.400> bank<00:03:22.640> like<00:03:23.000> I<00:03:23.150> do<00:03:23.209> so<00:03:24.140> it's<00:03:24.320> uh<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:25.040> takes<00:03:25.820> a

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
one bank like I do so it's uh it takes a

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.100 
one bank like I do so it's uh it takes a
long<00:03:26.090> time<00:03:26.120> if<00:03:26.510> you're<00:03:26.660> on<00:03:26.750> Mac<00:03:26.870> but

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
long time if you're on Mac but

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.840 
long time if you're on Mac but
unfortunately<00:03:27.739> that's<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.250> only<00:03:28.459> way<00:03:28.610> that<00:03:28.640> I

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
unfortunately that's the only way that I

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.050 
unfortunately that's the only way that I
know<00:03:28.940> how<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:29.209> do<00:03:29.480> it<00:03:30.459> yeah<00:03:31.459> I<00:03:31.489> kind<00:03:31.730> of<00:03:31.760> wish<00:03:31.910> I

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
know how to do it yeah I kind of wish I

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.090 
know how to do it yeah I kind of wish I
had<00:03:32.360> some<00:03:32.690> PC<00:03:33.019> computers<00:03:33.470> laying<00:03:33.739> around<00:03:33.830> so<00:03:34.070> I

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
had some PC computers laying around so I

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.140 
had some PC computers laying around so I
could<00:03:34.250> just<00:03:34.370> file<00:03:35.239> manage<00:03:36.640> my<00:03:37.640> presets

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
could just file manage my presets

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.790 
could just file manage my presets
through<00:03:38.390> some<00:03:38.600> sort<00:03:38.780> of<00:03:39.550> other<00:03:40.550> software<00:03:41.030> but

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
through some sort of other software but

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.970 
through some sort of other software but
that's<00:03:42.800> what<00:03:43.040> we<00:03:43.160> have<00:03:43.310> to<00:03:43.459> do<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:44.780> let<00:03:45.739> me<00:03:45.830> see

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
that's what we have to do and let me see

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.850 
that's what we have to do and let me see
what<00:03:46.190> else<00:03:46.780> so<00:03:47.780> if<00:03:48.019> you<00:03:48.170> wanted<00:03:48.590> to<00:03:48.709> make<00:03:48.830> your

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
what else so if you wanted to make your

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.840 
what else so if you wanted to make your
own<00:03:49.040> blank<00:03:50.800> Bank<00:03:51.800> pretty<00:03:52.370> much<00:03:52.489> you<00:03:52.610> have<00:03:52.640> to

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
own blank Bank pretty much you have to

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.870 
own blank Bank pretty much you have to
just<00:03:53.060> go<00:03:53.209> to<00:03:53.560> each<00:03:54.560> preset<00:03:55.040> initialize<00:03:55.580> it<00:03:55.790> or

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
just go to each preset initialize it or

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.910 
just go to each preset initialize it or
delete<00:03:56.180> it<00:03:56.239> and<00:03:56.540> that's<00:03:57.200> how<00:03:57.290> you<00:03:57.410> get<00:03:57.590> a<00:03:57.650> blank

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
delete it and that's how you get a blank

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.350 
delete it and that's how you get a blank
Bank<00:03:58.160> but<00:03:58.459> you<00:03:58.910> don't<00:03:59.060> need<00:03:59.120> to<00:03:59.180> do<00:03:59.330> that

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
Bank but you don't need to do that

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.790 
Bank but you don't need to do that
because<00:03:59.600> I'll<00:03:59.780> give<00:03:59.959> you<00:04:00.080> one<00:04:00.260> because<00:04:00.620> I<00:04:00.739> know

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
because I'll give you one because I know

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.250 
because I'll give you one because I know
how<00:04:00.950> long<00:04:01.160> it<00:04:01.340> takes<00:04:01.580> to<00:04:01.730> just<00:04:02.180> clear<00:04:02.810> out<00:04:03.019> all

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
how long it takes to just clear out all

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.660 
how long it takes to just clear out all
the<00:04:03.440> presets<00:04:03.769> out<00:04:03.980> of<00:04:04.100> a<00:04:04.190> bank<00:04:04.340> it<00:04:04.519> takes

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
the presets out of a bank it takes

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.520 
the presets out of a bank it takes
forever<00:04:04.850> so<00:04:05.239> once<00:04:06.110> you're<00:04:06.260> done<00:04:07.239> bringing<00:04:08.239> in

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
forever so once you're done bringing in

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.280 
forever so once you're done bringing in
importing<00:04:09.530> in<00:04:10.690> presets<00:04:11.690> you<00:04:11.930> pretty<00:04:12.200> much

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
importing in presets you pretty much

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.979 
importing in presets you pretty much
just<00:04:12.350> go<00:04:12.739> safe<00:04:13.040> bank<00:04:13.340> and<00:04:13.610> then<00:04:14.390> you<00:04:14.600> just<00:04:14.810> save

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
just go safe bank and then you just save

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.420 
just go safe bank and then you just save
that<00:04:15.019> wherever<00:04:15.410> you<00:04:15.560> want<00:04:15.799> and<00:04:16.010> that's<00:04:16.190> all
