standard USB connections those are up to
2.1<00:02:26.680> amps<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.400> standard<00:02:28.680> USB<00:02:29.680> charging<00:02:30.610> ports

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
2.1 amps to standard USB charging ports

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.220 
2.1 amps to standard USB charging ports
so<00:02:31.390> you<00:02:31.630> could<00:02:32.170> use<00:02:32.560> pretty<00:02:33.400> much<00:02:33.490> any<00:02:34.230> cable

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
so you could use pretty much any cable

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.530 
so you could use pretty much any cable
it<00:02:35.560> could<00:02:35.770> even<00:02:35.920> be<00:02:36.160> a<00:02:36.190> you<00:02:36.790> know<00:02:36.880> proprietary

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
it could even be a you know proprietary

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.470 
it could even be a you know proprietary
cable<00:02:37.900> as<00:02:37.990> long<00:02:38.170> as<00:02:38.380> one<00:02:39.160> end<00:02:39.370> is<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.730> standard

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
cable as long as one end is a standard

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.660 
cable as long as one end is a standard
USB<00:02:40.870> end<00:02:41.230> of<00:02:41.530> course<00:02:41.950> you<00:02:42.070> could<00:02:42.250> use<00:02:42.280> the

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
USB end of course you could use the

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.290 
USB end of course you could use the
included<00:02:43.060> cable<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:44.440> charge<00:02:44.800> a<00:02:45.220> device<00:02:46.000> that

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
included cable to charge a device that

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.890 
included cable to charge a device that
has<00:02:46.480> a<00:02:46.510> micro<00:02:47.350> USB<00:02:47.670> connection<00:02:50.520> to<00:02:51.520> charge<00:02:51.900> the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
has a micro USB connection to charge the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.090 
has a micro USB connection to charge the
battery<00:02:53.560> you<00:02:54.220> can<00:02:54.520> use<00:02:54.880> pretty<00:02:55.390> much<00:02:55.480> any

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
battery you can use pretty much any

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.270

standard micro USB power adapter and to

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.180 
standard micro USB power adapter and to
do<00:03:00.430> so<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:01.060> would<00:03:01.210> connect<00:03:01.600> it<00:03:01.750> here<00:03:01.930> on<00:03:02.800> the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
do so you would connect it here on the

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.550 
do so you would connect it here on the
left<00:03:03.430> side<00:03:03.850> now<00:03:04.180> I<00:03:04.210> find<00:03:04.630> that<00:03:04.720> my<00:03:04.930> smart<00:03:05.290> phone

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
left side now I find that my smart phone

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.920 
left side now I find that my smart phone
will<00:03:05.860> last<00:03:06.130> probably<00:03:06.370> you<00:03:07.330> know<00:03:07.450> from<00:03:07.690> eight

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
will last probably you know from eight

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.470 
will last probably you know from eight
to<00:03:08.350> five<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:08.950> that's<00:03:09.100> pretty<00:03:09.370> much<00:03:09.610> it<00:03:09.940> after

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
to five and that's pretty much it after

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.350 
to five and that's pretty much it after
that<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:11.080> battery<00:03:11.440> is<00:03:11.740> almost<00:03:12.220> done<00:03:13.030> you<00:03:13.240> know

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
that the battery is almost done you know

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.090 
that the battery is almost done you know
you're<00:03:13.510> looking<00:03:13.630> at<00:03:13.930> probably<00:03:14.470> anywhere<00:03:14.770> from

you're looking at probably anywhere from

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.080 
you're looking at probably anywhere from
25<00:03:15.670> to<00:03:15.700> 15%<00:03:16.630> life<00:03:17.560> left<00:03:17.920> in<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.310> that<00:03:18.520> is<00:03:18.850> of

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
25 to 15% life left in and that is of

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.180 
25 to 15% life left in and that is of
