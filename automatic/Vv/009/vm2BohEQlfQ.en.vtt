get really really hard

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.350 
get really really hard
now<00:05:08.910> this<00:05:09.180> mass<00:05:09.660> is<00:05:09.960> different<00:05:11.030> from<00:05:12.030> other

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
now this mass is different from other

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:19.520 
now this mass is different from other
math<00:05:13.130> because<00:05:14.130> it<00:05:14.759> takes<00:05:15.210> a<00:05:15.419> little<00:05:15.599> while<00:05:18.530> it

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
math because it takes a little while it

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.140 
math because it takes a little while it
takes<00:05:19.830> a<00:05:20.069> little<00:05:20.250> while<00:05:20.550> to<00:05:22.699> it<00:05:23.699> takes<00:05:23.970> a

takes a little while to it takes a
little<00:05:24.330> while<00:05:24.599> to<00:05:26.270> get<00:05:27.270> hard<00:05:28.610> and<00:05:29.870> when<00:05:30.870> it

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
little while to get hard and when it

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.129 
little while to get hard and when it
does<00:05:31.259> your<00:05:32.159> eyes<00:05:32.370> will<00:05:32.729> be<00:05:32.909> like<00:05:33.120> that<00:05:33.360> you'll
