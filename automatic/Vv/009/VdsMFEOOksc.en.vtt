isn't<00:02:08.789> bad<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.060> guess<00:02:09.210> that's<00:02:09.479> like<00:02:09.600> probably

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
isn't bad I guess that's like probably

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.890 
isn't bad I guess that's like probably
like<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.649> same<00:02:10.890> as<00:02:11.100> iron<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:12.060> guess<00:02:12.600> it's<00:02:12.780> a

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
like the same as iron so I guess it's a

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.330 
like the same as iron so I guess it's a
that's<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.230> pretty<00:02:13.410> decent<00:02:13.890> weapon<00:02:14.130> but<00:02:14.220> the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
that's a pretty decent weapon but the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.460 
that's a pretty decent weapon but the
armor<00:02:14.610> itself<00:02:14.850> is<00:02:15.060> only<00:02:15.240> as<00:02:15.540> good<00:02:15.720> as<00:02:16.050> leather

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
armor itself is only as good as leather

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.340 
armor itself is only as good as leather
it's<00:02:17.190> not<00:02:17.400> too<00:02:17.610> tanky<00:02:17.850> if<00:02:18.569> I<00:02:18.750> get<00:02:18.900> out<00:02:19.020> of<00:02:19.170> game

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
it's not too tanky if I get out of game

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.010 
it's not too tanky if I get out of game
mode<00:02:19.590> here<00:02:19.940> get<00:02:20.940> out<00:02:21.150> of<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.840> let's

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
mode here get out of that and let's

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.559 
mode here get out of that and let's
punch<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.560> spider<00:02:22.890> come<00:02:23.220> hit<00:02:23.400> me<00:02:23.610> as<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.450> can

see<00:02:24.750> it's<00:02:24.900> not<00:02:25.590> too<00:02:25.770> tanky<00:02:26.040> but<00:02:26.250> i<00:02:26.280> guess<00:02:26.459> its

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
see it's not too tanky but i guess its

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.670

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.170 
actually spam fire and as you can see
issues<00:03:47.739> really<00:03:48.130> fast<00:03:48.459> it<00:03:48.760> said<00:03:48.940> something

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
issues really fast it said something

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.630 
issues really fast it said something
like<00:03:49.450> four<00:03:49.810> per<00:03:50.140> second<00:03:50.650> I<00:03:50.799> know<00:03:51.310> about<00:03:51.430> all

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
like four per second I know about all

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.460 
like four per second I know about all
that<00:03:51.820> stuff<00:03:51.850> like<00:03:52.269> how<00:03:52.330> fast<00:03:52.660> it<00:03:52.870> goes<00:03:53.019> I<00:03:53.320> just

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
that stuff like how fast it goes I just

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.170 
that stuff like how fast it goes I just
know<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.709> goes<00:03:53.799> really<00:03:53.950> fast<00:03:54.190> it<00:03:54.670> got<00:03:54.820> pretty

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
know it goes really fast it got pretty

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.670 
know it goes really fast it got pretty
nice<00:03:55.450> range<00:03:55.780> as<00:03:56.019> you<00:03:56.170> can<00:03:56.290> see<00:03:56.410> let's<00:03:56.530> see<00:03:56.560> if

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
nice range as you can see let's see if

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.259 
nice range as you can see let's see if
we<00:03:56.769> could<00:03:56.920> hit<00:03:57.070> them<00:03:57.160> from<00:03:57.280> from<00:03:57.940> back<00:03:58.090> here

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
we could hit them from from back here

00:03:58.269 --> 00:03:59.699 
we could hit them from from back here
actually<00:03:58.450> that's<00:03:58.690> not<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:59.320> greatest<00:03:59.560> of

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
actually that's not the greatest of

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.130 
actually that's not the greatest of
range<00:03:59.950> actually<00:04:00.459> I<00:04:00.640> mean<00:04:01.600> I<00:04:01.660> guess<00:04:01.690> you<00:04:01.959> just

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
range actually I mean I guess you just

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.960 
range actually I mean I guess you just
have<00:04:02.260> to<00:04:02.350> kind<00:04:02.560> of<00:04:02.650> put<00:04:03.190> it<00:04:03.310> on<00:04:03.400> an<00:04:03.519> angle<00:04:03.670> but

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
have to kind of put it on an angle but

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.789 
have to kind of put it on an angle but
it's<00:04:04.120> still<00:04:04.329> not<00:04:04.510> bad<00:04:04.840> range<00:04:05.230> and<00:04:05.530> you<00:04:05.620> just

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
it's still not bad range and you just

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.100 
it's still not bad range and you just
shooting<00:04:06.070> potatoes<00:04:06.579> and<00:04:06.880> your<00:04:07.450> potatoes<00:04:07.930> are

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
shooting potatoes and your potatoes are

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.960 
shooting potatoes and your potatoes are
now<00:04:08.260> deadly<00:04:08.769> instead<00:04:09.400> of<00:04:09.489> just<00:04:09.610> eating<00:04:09.880> none

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
now deadly instead of just eating none

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.020 
now deadly instead of just eating none
like<00:04:10.120> six<00:04:10.360> damage<00:04:10.600> 5<00:04:10.900> damage<00:04:11.230> that's<00:04:11.500> not<00:04:11.590> bad

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
like six damage 5 damage that's not bad

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.240

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.160 
the damage is pretty random but the good
thing<00:05:00.100> about<00:05:00.250> this<00:05:00.550> is<00:05:00.610> it<00:05:01.120> puts<00:05:01.450> them<00:05:01.630> on<00:05:01.810> fire

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
thing about this is it puts them on fire

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.620 
thing about this is it puts them on fire
so<00:05:02.530> it's<00:05:02.680> like<00:05:02.800> a<00:05:02.980> like<00:05:03.430> potato<00:05:03.850> launcher<00:05:04.120> kind

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
so it's like a like potato launcher kind

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.990 
so it's like a like potato launcher kind
of<00:05:04.840> just<00:05:05.590> sets<00:05:05.740> them<00:05:05.920> on<00:05:06.010> fire<00:05:06.070> for<00:05:06.700> you<00:05:06.850> know<00:05:06.970> a

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
of just sets them on fire for you know a

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.130 
of just sets them on fire for you know a
few<00:05:07.210> seconds<00:05:07.540> I<00:05:07.630> believe<00:05:07.810> that<00:05:07.930> something

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
few seconds I believe that something

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.500 
few seconds I believe that something
like<00:05:08.230> five<00:05:08.560> seconds<00:05:08.980> or<00:05:09.130> so<00:05:09.340> and<00:05:09.580> you<00:05:09.640> can<00:05:10.270> spam

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
like five seconds or so and you can spam

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.040 
like five seconds or so and you can spam
this<00:05:10.750> as<00:05:10.900> well<00:05:11.280> test<00:05:12.280> out<00:05:12.460> its<00:05:12.490> range<00:05:13.000> and<00:05:13.450> you

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
anything's really Opie in it i think the

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.620 
anything's really Opie in it i think the
the<00:05:46.450> recipes<00:05:46.840> are<00:05:46.870> pretty<00:05:47.170> fair<00:05:48.150> i'm<00:05:49.150> not<00:05:49.420> too

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
the recipes are pretty fair i'm not too

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.360 
the recipes are pretty fair i'm not too
expensive<00:05:49.900> but<00:05:50.230> it's<00:05:50.380> not<00:05:50.560> like<00:05:50.770> really<00:05:51.130> cheap

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
expensive but it's not like really cheap

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.770 
expensive but it's not like really cheap
either<00:05:51.550> if<00:05:51.790> you<00:05:51.880> think<00:05:52.120> about<00:05:52.300> like<00:05:52.480> all<00:05:52.600> the

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
either if you think about like all the

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.780 
either if you think about like all the
flint<00:05:53.080> and<00:05:53.230> you<00:05:54.220> know<00:05:54.310> you're<00:05:54.520> just<00:05:54.580> only

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
flint and you know you're just only

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.970 
flint and you know you're just only
diamond<00:05:55.420> and<00:05:55.630> that<00:05:55.900> kind<00:05:56.140> of<00:05:56.230> stuff<00:05:56.290> for<00:05:56.740> these

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980

diamond and that kind of stuff for these
recipes<00:05:57.370> and<00:05:57.820> i<00:05:58.090> think<00:05:58.330> it's<00:05:58.480> totally<00:05:58.660> worth

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050
