00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
thing we're going to do is bring up the

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.950 
thing we're going to do is bring up the
eye<00:00:21.510> gel<00:00:22.100> universal<00:00:23.100> management<00:00:23.550> suite<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.359> I

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
eye gel universal management suite and I

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.179 
eye gel universal management suite and I
already<00:00:25.080> have<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.320> couple<00:00:25.560> profiles

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
already have a couple profiles

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.310 
already have a couple profiles
configured<00:00:26.910> but<00:00:27.689> we'll<00:00:27.840> go<00:00:27.960> through<00:00:28.199> them

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
configured but we'll go through them

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.299 
configured but we'll go through them
this<00:00:29.010> profile<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:30.650> whatever<00:00:31.650> profile<00:00:32.130> you're

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
this profile is whatever profile you're

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.940 
this profile is whatever profile you're
using<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.940> connect<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.930> your<00:00:34.380> Zen<00:00:34.829> app

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
using to connect to your Zen app

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.680 
using to connect to your Zen app
environment<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:35.730> I'm<00:00:36.210> not<00:00:36.390> going<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.600> go

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
environment so I'm not going to go

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.170 
environment so I'm not going to go
through<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:36.930> one<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.340> here<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.520> my<00:00:38.820> printer

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
through that one and here is my printer

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.100 
through that one and here is my printer
configuration

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
configuration

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:47.240 
configuration
so<00:00:41.629> in<00:00:42.629> general<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:44.100> will<00:00:44.370> set<00:00:44.820> up<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:46.250> quick

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
so in general I will set up a quick

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.069 
so in general I will set up a quick
example<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.879> have<00:00:48.000> one<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.510> here<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:48.930> is

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
example I have one in here and this is

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.959 
example I have one in here and this is
the<00:00:49.200> one<00:00:49.320> we're<00:00:49.469> really<00:00:49.500> gonna<00:00:49.829> dig<00:00:50.370> into<00:00:50.579> but

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
the one we're really gonna dig into but

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.150 
the one we're really gonna dig into but
I'm<00:00:51.210> gonna<00:00:51.390> set<00:00:51.690> up<00:00:51.719> another<00:00:52.110> one<00:00:52.320> just<00:00:53.070> to

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
I'm gonna set up another one just to

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.709 
I'm gonna set up another one just to
give<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.370> an<00:00:53.460> example<00:00:53.760> if<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.210> had<00:00:54.420> something

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
give you an example if you had something

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.420 
give you an example if you had something
quick<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.320> dirty<00:00:55.500> say<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.460> HP<00:00:57.289> 2000c<00:00:58.320> say<00:00:59.309> it

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
quick and dirty say in HP 2000c say it

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.549 
quick and dirty say in HP 2000c say it
was<00:00:59.520> connected<00:00:59.820> via<00:01:00.710> parallel<00:01:01.710> port<00:01:02.539> this

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
was connected via parallel port this

these two settings here we're regarding

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.690 
these two settings here we're regarding

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
create that we have a new printer but

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.359 
create that we have a new printer but
I'm<00:01:41.640> gonna<00:01:41.820> show<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.270> different<00:01:42.720> use<00:01:42.840> case

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
I'm gonna show you a different use case

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.050 
I'm gonna show you a different use case
if<00:01:44.369> your<00:01:44.880> printer<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.420> not<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.960> list

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
if your printer is not in that list

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.370 
if your printer is not in that list
we're<00:01:48.060> gonna<00:01:48.180> do<00:01:48.450> something<00:01:48.840> along<00:01:49.140> these

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
we're gonna do something along these

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.730 
we're gonna do something along these
lines<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:51.210> printer<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.540> have<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> reco<00:01:52.380> CL

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
lines so the printer I have is a reco CL

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.270 
lines so the printer I have is a reco CL
2000<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.579> there<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.240> no<00:01:54.509> driver<00:01:54.840> for<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.380> in

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
2000 and there is no driver for that in

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.600 
2000 and there is no driver for that in
our<00:01:56.460> list<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.780> what<00:01:58.409> I've<00:01:58.530> done<00:01:58.710> here<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:59.070> -

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
our list so what I've done here is -

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.700 
our list so what I've done here is -
happens<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.060> be<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> TCP<00:02:00.869> network<00:02:01.170> printer<00:02:01.469> so

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
happens to be a TCP network printer so

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.580 
happens to be a TCP network printer so
I've<00:02:01.829> set<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.189> IP<00:02:02.399> address<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.119> port

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
I've set the IP address and the port

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.749 
I've set the IP address and the port
really<00:02:04.590> makes<00:02:04.770> no<00:02:04.979> difference<00:02:05.100> whether<00:02:05.490> it's

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
really makes no difference whether it's

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:06.719 
really makes no difference whether it's
you

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
you

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.630 
you
any<00:02:07.329> of<00:02:07.539> these<00:02:07.630> other<00:02:07.869> printer<00:02:08.200> types<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:08.739> set

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
any of these other printer types I set

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.290 
any of these other printer types I set
my<00:02:09.819> profile<00:02:10.599> to<00:02:10.780> generic<00:02:11.200> generic<00:02:11.230> rollcue

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
my profile to generic generic rollcue

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.089 
my profile to generic generic rollcue
and<00:02:13.300> in<00:02:13.569> mapping<00:02:13.810> in<00:02:14.050> sessions<00:02:14.500> I'm<00:02:14.650> going<00:02:14.920> to

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
and in mapping in sessions I'm going to

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.180 
and in mapping in sessions I'm going to
use<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.370> custom<00:02:15.819> Windows<00:02:16.390> driver<00:02:16.569> name<00:02:16.989> now<00:02:17.800> I

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
use a custom Windows driver name now I

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.740 
use a custom Windows driver name now I
don't<00:02:18.370> know<00:02:18.550> exactly<00:02:18.670> what<00:02:19.090> that<00:02:19.209> name<00:02:19.390> is<00:02:19.569> yet

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
don't know exactly what that name is yet

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.540 
don't know exactly what that name is yet
so<00:02:19.930> I'm<00:02:20.019> just<00:02:20.050> gonna<00:02:20.260> click<00:02:20.500> OK<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.129> save<00:02:21.340> this

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
so I'm just gonna click OK and save this

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.630 
so I'm just gonna click OK and save this
profile<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.390> we'll<00:02:22.660> pull<00:02:22.930> up<00:02:23.130> our<00:02:24.130> Zen<00:02:24.489> app

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.660 
profile and we'll pull up our Zen app
server<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.360> install<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:26.290> printer<00:02:26.500> driver<00:02:27.480> so

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
server and install the printer driver so

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.170 
server and install the printer driver so
here<00:02:30.670> is<00:02:30.910> our<00:02:31.650> Zen<00:02:32.650> app<00:02:33.030> server

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
here is our Zen app server

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.539 
here is our Zen app server
mmm<00:02:34.959> I<00:02:35.380> have<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.769> printer<00:02:36.010> driver<00:02:36.129> already

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
mmm I have the printer driver already

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.009 
mmm I have the printer driver already
downloaded<00:02:37.239> so<00:02:37.480> we'll<00:02:37.629> go<00:02:37.780> ahead<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.519> and

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
downloaded so we'll go ahead and and

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.780 
downloaded so we'll go ahead and and
install<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.709> printer<00:02:41.920> driver<00:02:44.549> I'll<00:02:45.549> add<00:02:45.730> a

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
install the printer driver I'll add a

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.600 
install the printer driver I'll add a
local<00:02:46.090> printer<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.840> port<00:02:47.110> doesn't<00:02:47.470> set<00:02:48.370> it<00:02:48.489> to

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
local printer the port doesn't set it to

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.199 
local printer the port doesn't set it to
a<00:02:48.640> null<00:02:48.849> port<00:02:49.209> I<00:02:49.510> have<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.560> 2000<00:02:51.400> so<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:52.060> this

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
a null port I have the 2000 so and this

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.630 
a null port I have the 2000 so and this
is<00:02:52.269> the<00:02:52.420> PostScript<00:02:52.930> driver<00:02:53.140> so<00:02:54.099> printer<00:02:54.519> name

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
is the PostScript driver so printer name

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.430 
is the PostScript driver so printer name
that's<00:02:55.000> fine<00:02:55.569> we'll<00:02:55.750> go<00:02:55.870> with<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.079> generic

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
that's fine we'll go with the generic

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.780 
that's fine we'll go with the generic
printer<00:02:56.650> name<00:02:56.799> let<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.280> driver<00:02:57.790> install<00:02:59.790> then

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
printer name let the driver install then

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.110 
printer name let the driver install then
we<00:03:01.150> don't<00:03:01.239> need<00:03:01.360> to<00:03:01.450> share<00:03:01.630> it<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.880> it's<00:03:03.880> fine

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
we don't need to share it and it's fine

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.580 
we don't need to share it and it's fine
we<00:03:04.420> don't<00:03:04.569> have<00:03:04.690> to<00:03:04.780> set<00:03:04.959> it<00:03:04.989> this<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.319> default

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
we don't have to set it this the default

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.910 
we don't have to set it this the default
printer<00:03:06.099> but<00:03:07.000> now<00:03:07.150> what<00:03:07.360> we<00:03:07.450> can<00:03:07.630> do<00:03:07.840> is<00:03:08.260> go<00:03:08.709> in

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920

this<00:03:39.660> list<00:03:39.930> here<00:03:40.049> this<00:03:40.349> is<00:03:40.590> what<00:03:41.099> we<00:03:41.280> need<00:03:41.549> to

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
this list here this is what we need to

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.930 
this list here this is what we need to
plug<00:03:42.750> in<00:03:42.989> to<00:03:43.260> our<00:03:43.470> profile<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.280> this<00:03:44.640> driver

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
plug in to our profile and this driver

plug in to our profile and this driver
name<00:03:45.180> it<00:03:45.330> is<00:03:45.450> case<00:03:45.750> sensitive<00:03:46.349> and<00:03:46.500> space

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
name it is case sensitive and space

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.820 
name it is case sensitive and space
sensitive<00:03:47.700> so<00:03:47.849> it<00:03:47.970> has<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.239> be<00:03:48.330> exactly<00:03:48.810> as<00:03:49.290> it

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
sensitive so it has to be exactly as it

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.140 
sensitive so it has to be exactly as it
is<00:03:49.860> stated<00:03:50.340> here<00:03:50.370> so<00:03:50.879> it's<00:03:51.530> Rico<00:03:53.150> space

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
is stated here so it's Rico space

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:01.130

that<00:04:43.500> profile<00:04:44.210> and<00:04:45.210> I<00:04:45.539> will<00:04:45.720> take<00:04:46.280> these<00:04:47.280> two

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
that profile and I will take these two

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.050 
that profile and I will take these two
profiles<00:04:48.150> and<00:04:48.389> apply<00:04:48.660> them<00:04:48.900> to<00:04:48.930> our<00:04:49.139> test<00:04:50.060> VM

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
profiles and apply them to our test VM

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.580 
profiles and apply them to our test VM
here<00:04:53.419> you<00:04:54.419> just<00:04:54.539> have<00:04:54.750> a<00:04:54.780> couple<00:04:55.110> profiles

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
here you just have a couple profiles

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.550 
here you just have a couple profiles
applied<00:04:55.950> that<00:04:56.280> make<00:04:56.700> the<00:04:57.530> presentation<00:04:58.530> a

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
applied that make the presentation a

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.710 
applied that make the presentation a
little<00:04:58.620> bit<00:04:58.800> easier<00:04:59.099> so<00:04:59.880> we'll<00:05:00.120> apply<00:05:00.240> these

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
little bit easier so we'll apply these

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:07.330 
little bit easier so we'll apply these
two<00:05:00.960> profiles<00:05:01.530> to<00:05:01.860> our<00:05:01.979> thin<00:05:02.190> client

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.890 

and<00:05:08.340> we'll<00:05:08.610> push<00:05:08.879> the<00:05:09.090> settings<00:05:09.449> out<00:05:09.629> actually

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
and we'll push the settings out actually

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.360 
and we'll push the settings out actually
it<00:05:10.080> looks<00:05:10.229> as<00:05:10.379> if<00:05:10.530> the<00:05:10.650> thin<00:05:10.830> clients<00:05:11.189> thought

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
it looks as if the thin clients thought

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.350 
it looks as if the thin clients thought
up<00:05:11.520> and<00:05:11.669> running<00:05:11.969> so<00:05:12.210> let's<00:05:12.449> uh<00:05:14.030> let's<00:05:15.030> fix

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
up and running so let's uh let's fix

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:25.980 
up and running so let's uh let's fix
that<00:05:15.479> real<00:05:15.840> fast

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:31.590 

so<00:05:26.990> as<00:05:27.050> soon<00:05:27.230> as<00:05:27.290> it<00:05:27.410> comes<00:05:27.620> back<00:05:27.830> up

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.340 

just<00:05:32.320> be<00:05:32.470> a<00:05:32.500> second<00:05:32.920> here<00:05:33.100> will<00:05:33.250> refresh<00:05:34.350> and

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
just be a second here will refresh and

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.220 
just be a second here will refresh and
we<00:05:35.710> will<00:05:35.890> do<00:05:36.360> settings<00:05:37.360> you<00:05:37.570> missed<00:05:37.870> a<00:05:38.020> thin

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
we will do settings you missed a thin

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.870 
we will do settings you missed a thin
client<00:05:39.810> and<00:05:40.810> now<00:05:41.710> we<00:05:41.770> can<00:05:42.070> see<00:05:42.340> if<00:05:42.520> we<00:05:42.640> shadow

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
client and now we can see if we shadow

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.480 
client and now we can see if we shadow
the<00:05:43.120> device<00:05:43.560> we<00:05:44.560> will<00:05:44.680> have<00:05:44.860> an<00:05:44.950> icon<00:05:45.280> on<00:05:45.340> the

desktop for Zen app will make a

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:55.460 
desktop for Zen app will make a

see<00:06:09.620> if<00:06:09.860> it<00:06:10.130> auto<00:06:10.400> created<00:06:11.210> our<00:06:14.050> printer<00:06:16.090> and

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
see if it auto created our printer and

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.470 
see if it auto created our printer and
there<00:06:17.810> it<00:06:17.900> is<00:06:18.050> from<00:06:18.680> session<00:06:19.070> 1<00:06:19.370> I'll<00:06:20.150> go<00:06:20.360> ahead

and get printer properties and send a

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.550 
and get printer properties and send a
test<00:06:23.270> page<00:06:24.490> and<00:06:25.490> we'll<00:06:25.730> see<00:06:26.000> my<00:06:26.990> printer<00:06:27.380> light

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
test page and we'll see my printer light

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.900 
test page and we'll see my printer light
is<00:06:27.710> flashing<00:06:27.980> and<00:06:30.010> the<00:06:31.010> page<00:06:31.220> is<00:06:31.430> coming<00:06:31.760> out

now I will go check and see if it
printed<00:06:34.850> correctly<00:06:35.230> so<00:06:36.230> I've<00:06:36.440> walked<00:06:36.680> over<00:06:36.890> to

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:36.980 
printed correctly so I've walked over to

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.590 
printed correctly so I've walked over to
the<00:06:37.160> printer<00:06:37.340> and<00:06:37.550> grabbed<00:06:37.760> the<00:06:37.970> test<00:06:38.330> page

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:38.600 
the printer and grabbed the test page

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.420 
the printer and grabbed the test page
and<00:06:38.990> took<00:06:39.200> a<00:06:39.610> wonderful<00:06:40.610> picture<00:06:40.820> with<00:06:41.210> my

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:42.430 
and took a wonderful picture with my

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.300 
and took a wonderful picture with my
cell<00:06:43.430> phone<00:06:43.970> and<00:06:44.180> as<00:06:44.630> you<00:06:44.780> can<00:06:44.900> see<00:06:44.960> there<00:06:45.440> it

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310 
cell phone and as you can see there it

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.870 
cell phone and as you can see there it
appears<00:06:46.940> that<00:06:48.340> everything<00:06:49.340> printed<00:06:49.730> as

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 
appears that everything printed as

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.090 
appears that everything printed as
expected<00:06:50.480> so<00:06:50.690> as<00:06:51.050> you<00:06:51.530> can<00:06:51.620> see<00:06:51.800> it's<00:06:51.950> pretty

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.100 
expected so as you can see it's pretty

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:57.630 
expected so as you can see it's pretty
