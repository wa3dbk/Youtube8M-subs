know<00:03:40.090> how<00:03:40.420> they<00:03:40.660> bake<00:03:40.930> how<00:03:41.170> evolve<00:03:41.560> bases

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
know how they bake how evolve bases

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.660

their<00:03:42.250> size<00:03:42.610> off<00:03:42.880> but<00:03:43.239> if<00:03:43.450> I<00:03:43.600> was<00:03:43.780> going<00:03:44.080> off<00:03:44.230> of

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
their size off but if I was going off of
