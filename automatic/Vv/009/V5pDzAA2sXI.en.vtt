anyway this guy wasn't eating good he

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.750 
anyway this guy wasn't eating good he
looked<00:02:37.920> healthy

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
looked healthy

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.120

gets his stripped his strength back

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.170 
gets his stripped his strength back
that's<00:03:14.220> not<00:03:14.400> that's<00:03:14.730> not<00:03:14.910> a<00:03:14.940> clinical

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
that's not that's not a clinical

parasites on him other than just being

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.309 
parasites on him other than just being
much<00:03:36.780> higher<00:03:37.139> than<00:03:37.530> he<00:03:37.769> was<00:03:38.900> which<00:03:39.900> is<00:03:40.079> which

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
much higher than he was which is which

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.710 
much higher than he was which is which
is<00:03:40.350> interesting<00:03:40.980> but<00:03:41.190> you<00:03:41.880> can<00:03:42.000> see<00:03:42.180> now<00:03:42.359> you

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.779 
guarantee it's not a 100 percent
foolproof<00:04:21.810> but<00:04:22.349> it's<00:04:23.190> definitely<00:04:23.400> better

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
foolproof but it's definitely better

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.540

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:40.099 
the discus had reacted well to the to

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:41.379 
the discus had reacted well to the to
the<00:04:40.220> medication<00:04:40.759> and<00:04:40.879> the<00:04:40.940> main<00:04:41.060> aquarium

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
the medication and the main aquarium

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.119

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:43.129 
they bounced back they're healthy and

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:46.629 
they bounced back they're healthy and
eating<00:04:43.250> really<00:04:43.520> hardly<00:04:44.409> and<00:04:45.409> even<00:04:46.280> this<00:04:46.430> guy

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
eating really hardly and even this guy

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.129 
eating really hardly and even this guy
who<00:04:46.699> I<00:04:46.879> you<00:04:47.300> know<00:04:47.419> I<00:04:47.449> thought<00:04:47.780> should<00:04:48.020> have

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
who I you know I thought should have

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.920 
who I you know I thought should have
been<00:04:48.259> pulled<00:04:48.470> out<00:04:48.620> he's<00:04:49.580> doing<00:04:49.970> pretty<00:04:50.240> good

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
been pulled out he's doing pretty good

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.430 
been pulled out he's doing pretty good
all<00:04:51.289> things<00:04:51.319> considered<00:04:52.039> so<00:04:53.229> anyway<00:04:54.229> I<00:04:54.259> just

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
all things considered so anyway I just

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.629 
all things considered so anyway I just
going<00:04:54.770> to<00:04:54.830> kind<00:04:55.009> of<00:04:55.099> show<00:04:55.220> you<00:04:55.310> where<00:04:55.490> we<00:04:55.610> were

going to kind of show you where we were

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.730 
going to kind of show you where we were
at<00:04:55.909> I<00:04:55.940> think<00:04:56.270> this<00:04:56.389> is<00:04:56.569> probably<00:04:56.840> part<00:04:57.440> one<00:04:57.710> of
