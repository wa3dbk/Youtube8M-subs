00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.430
 Hello everyone, how are you? 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.770
 have a good time, the note 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.050
 rivas and again I bring you my second 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.270
 theory with what I'm doing and this time I'm going 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.310
 to talk about a different topic and this 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.020
 is the anime and torrico manga and the 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.300
 reasons why I think it's one of 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.340
 the best sleeves are currently 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.290
 that I only do manga reviews in 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.660
 my channel and those who do not see this 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.790
 manga do not approach those videos is because 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.650
 that on this occasion I will be more direct 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.989
 and make one more recommendation 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.180
 deep in this manga and anime too 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.100
 I must clarify that I will not give spoiler so 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.170
 you who have not seen this series and you have 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.020
 curiosity you can watch this video with 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.700
 all confidence well let's start the 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.190
 torrico series tells us the adventures 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.590
 of a world where food and flavor 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.930
 This is something very important 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.880
 world is made up of food there are 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.280
 animals that have capture levels 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.140
 The higher your level is, the better your taste 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.180
 nutritional level is higher on 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.950
 historical protagonist a hunter 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.289
 gourmet or viso whose which is dedicated to 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.840
 hunt this type of beasts and create your 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:33.270
 full menu which are hors d'oeuvres 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.400
 fish dish soup meat dish 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.590
 plate 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.690
 salad dessert and drink together 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.880
 with three other companions are known 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.160
 like the four heavenly kings in 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.410
 this world people have cells 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.000
 gourmet which increase their 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.520
 skills in terms of strength and 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.930
 resistance these cells are strengthened 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.840
 with the nutritional level of the food 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.960
 the higher it is stronger you 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.090
 you will do well so far your synopsis I know that 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.670
 At first glance it seems to be pretty bad 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.620
 boring but come on this is a son in de 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.720
 the long ones and we know that the vast majority 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.090
 they start something simple and little by little 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.710
 they take their story because this is where they 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.780
 I say what makes torrico one of the 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.090
 best sleeves and it's that although your 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.640
 argument seems silly this manga has 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.980
 very interesting fact since it is not 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.930
 based only on hunting beasts 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.240
 also in fighting against the organization 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.370
 of badly known as bis or kukai and what 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.050
 what makes the fights epic and great is 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.240
 that torrico does not focus on throwing 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.430
 energy spheres or rays to fight 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.130
 but it is based mostly on attacks 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.410
 physical something like wampis without 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.420
 But his fights are something that almost no 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.860
 we see in the current sleeves are 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.930
 fucking epic 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.910
 where here they take care of the energies that have 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.680
 lost and how many are left without 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.470
 mention that the techniques they use 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.570
 they evolve more and more and a council the 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.790
 anime is better in history since it is 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.130
 very censored manga and manga 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.410
 obviously it's better since they show us 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.840
 much blood without falling into the exaggerated and 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.850
 it's amazingly cool and not just the 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.040
 action is what stands out in this manga 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.440
 but also the suspense that they put us 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.750
 in many episodes such is the case of the 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.450
 saga that takes place in chapters 83 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.490
 to 95 where we see a lot of suspense and 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.770
 thriller that keep us hooked 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.170
 in clear episodes without leaving a 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.000
 side the fights have to clarify that a 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.130
 this series happens to him the same as to 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.930
 hunter x hunter and is that it comes out in the 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.000
 tomorrow so the strong scenes 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.980
 are softened if they have a style of 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.989
 drawing a little different than manga 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.970
 therefore you see is the anime and not you 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:36.030
 I recommend that you go to 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.650
 manga since it's better now one thing if 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.050
 he wears torrico only in 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.520
 specials with one piece is very likely 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.739
 that you did not like it 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.870
 you understand almost nothing but if you see both 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.310
 series is no doubt that these crossovers 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.349
 since you'll love 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.810
 fan of both series to me it seemed to me 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:54.000
 great the special with dragon ball z and 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.709
 of course that being objective does not 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.560
 it seemed that they made goku weak 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.660
 much less this special I loved seeing 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.880
 three matchless characters fighting 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.250
 and I 'm not the only one who thinks about it 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.620
 if we see in recent covers torico him 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.870
 took his place to bridge xd in summary 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.030
 friends torico is a lot more than what 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.550
 it seems the anime can be like many 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.320
 but manga does not use its history very 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.000
 well and also this manga is the 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.310
 responsible for one of the most fights 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.169
 epics that I have seen in history 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.810
 it's so much better than many that 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:27.240
 now we have finally seen friends 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.310
 I think that until here I leave the video I hope 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.530
 have you enjoyed sharing what 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.080
 more people are encouraged to read this manga 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.150
 in order that's all thank you very much 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.050
 say goodbye to your friend alan otaku 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.050
 rivas goodbye
