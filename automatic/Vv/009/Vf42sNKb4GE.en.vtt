 I'm here with my friend, gentleman and 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.080
 Caesar is truly true that he makes a 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.210

 in here born I do not know if it's something I do not know 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:32.830
 I hope it comes out but I do not think so, because with 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:36.129
 15 thousand subscribers that you leave here is 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:39.070

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:53.559
 of them that they got in to see if 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.510
