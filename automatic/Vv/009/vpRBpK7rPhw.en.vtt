00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
friends over online everyone has a hack

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.510 
friends over online everyone has a hack
to<00:01:39.600> pay<00:01:39.900> yes<00:01:40.140> sure<00:01:40.380> but<00:01:40.650> it's<00:01:40.770> not<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.009> legal

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.679 
to pay yes sure but it's not the legal
one<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.299> not<00:01:42.420> as<00:01:42.689> fun<00:01:44.360> anyway<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.509> is

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
one so it's not as fun anyway this is

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.330 
one so it's not as fun anyway this is
obviously<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.290> movie<00:01:46.560> distribution<00:01:47.100> event

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
obviously a movie distribution event

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.460 
obviously a movie distribution event
power<00:01:48.180> saves<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.780> probably<00:01:49.020> going<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.200> have<00:01:49.350> it

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
power saves is probably going to have it

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.660 
power saves is probably going to have it
and<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.619> course<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:49.979> will<00:01:50.040> cover<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.399> when

this<00:03:55.200> it's<00:03:56.200> interesting<00:03:56.530> and<00:03:56.890> there's<00:03:57.370> a<00:03:57.459> lot

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
this it's interesting and there's a lot

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.560 
this it's interesting and there's a lot
we<00:03:57.640> could<00:03:57.850> probably<00:03:57.940> take<00:03:58.150> away<00:03:58.330> from<00:03:58.480> this

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
we could probably take away from this

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.030 
we could probably take away from this
but<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:58.870> number<00:03:59.170> one<00:03:59.350> fact<00:03:59.650> here<00:03:59.860> is<00:03:59.890> that

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
but the number one fact here is that

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.540 
but the number one fact here is that
mega<00:04:00.430> evolution<00:04:01.000> is<00:04:01.120> confirmed<00:04:02.050> now

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
mega evolution is confirmed now

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.770 
mega evolution is confirmed now
obviously<00:04:03.550> for<00:04:04.030> this<00:04:04.180> game<00:04:06.239> now<00:04:07.239> here<00:04:07.630> we<00:04:07.750> have

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
obviously for this game now here we have

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.440 
obviously for this game now here we have
a<00:04:07.930> nice<00:04:08.200> look<00:04:08.500> at<00:04:08.680> all<00:04:08.920> the<00:04:09.220> starters<00:04:09.610> they

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
a nice look at all the starters they

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
a nice look at all the starters they
seem<00:04:10.780> to<00:04:10.810> be<00:04:11.020> wearing<00:04:11.590> a<00:04:11.970> set<00:04:12.970> cloth<00:04:13.450> so<00:04:14.110> I<00:04:14.140> feel

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
seem to be wearing a set cloth so I feel

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.690 
seem to be wearing a set cloth so I feel
like<00:04:14.590> maybe<00:04:14.860> you<00:04:14.980> can't<00:04:15.280> really<00:04:15.400> change

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
like maybe you can't really change

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.030 
like maybe you can't really change
around<00:04:15.940> and<00:04:16.330> we<00:04:16.720> also<00:04:16.900> have<00:04:17.020> hoop<00:04:17.260> unbound<00:04:17.799> as

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
around and we also have hoop unbound as

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.890 
around and we also have hoop unbound as
well<00:04:18.220> as<00:04:18.340> Hoopa<00:04:18.669> down<00:04:19.419> here<00:04:19.950> so<00:04:20.950> that<00:04:21.489> is

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
well as Hoopa down here so that is

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.360 
well as Hoopa down here so that is
pretty<00:04:22.900> interesting<00:04:23.200> I'm<00:04:23.950> not<00:04:24.100> sure<00:04:24.250> if

pretty interesting I'm not sure if

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.240 
pretty interesting I'm not sure if
that's<00:04:24.460> supposed<00:04:24.640> to<00:04:24.880> be<00:04:24.910> a<00:04:25.000> side<00:04:25.300> event

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250

you have to figure / universe it depends
really<00:04:53.700> it's<00:04:53.940> just<00:04:54.060> maybe<00:04:54.360> a<00:04:54.420> strong<00:04:54.720> bond

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
stone but as we know mega evolutions um

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.140 
stone but as we know mega evolutions um
like<00:05:01.830> seemed<00:05:02.130> to<00:05:02.220> merge<00:05:02.520> with<00:05:02.550> their<00:05:02.910> stone

when<00:05:03.330> they<00:05:03.419> mega<00:05:03.630> evolve<00:05:04.020> so<00:05:04.560> it's<00:05:04.740> it

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
when they mega evolve so it's it

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.530 
when they mega evolve so it's it
wouldn't<00:05:05.280> be<00:05:05.430> it<00:05:05.700> wouldn't<00:05:05.940> be<00:05:06.030> logical<00:05:06.419> form

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
wouldn't be it wouldn't be logical form

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:07.730 
wouldn't be it wouldn't be logical form

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
to actually be holding it he would be

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.370 
to actually be holding it he would be
wearing<00:05:07.980> it<00:05:08.190> outside<00:05:09.090> of<00:05:09.150> mega<00:05:09.510> evolution<00:05:09.600> but

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
wearing it outside of mega evolution but

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.960 
wearing it outside of mega evolution but
still<00:05:10.560> this<00:05:10.710> is<00:05:10.770> very<00:05:11.040> exciting<00:05:11.370> this<00:05:11.610> is<00:05:11.669> very
