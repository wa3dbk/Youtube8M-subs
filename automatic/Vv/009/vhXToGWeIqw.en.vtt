00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:04.710
 last month the national newspaper showed the new rules for the use of a 

00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:08.499
 Car Accessory Type Xenon Headlamps 

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:12.949
 The issue raised doubts about who has already installed or wants to install the 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:14.219
 lamps 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.830
 we come back to the subject for more clarification on the norms 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:23.509
 the new rules for headlights inclusive and those for gas discharge 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:24.970
 known as the brothers 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.579
 began to be valid on the first day of the year 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.529
 all new cars imported and imported from the factory 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.399
 after January 1, 2009 equipped with xenon headlights shall 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.309
 have cleaners in a system that regulates the inclination of the light beam 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.440
 the National Traffic Council resolution specifically cites the charges 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.089
 new 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.280
 but raised a doubt among thousands of Brazilians settled for this 

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.630
 year 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.430
 after buying the car 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.320
 and who then the headlights before the 1st day 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.280
 also needs to adapt 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.350
 the answer is in another resolution of the contran and is worth so much for those already 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.540
 has installed as well as for those who intend to install xenon headlights on 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.010
 they will leave the factory without this payment 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.450
 it's three steps 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.900
 first requested prior authorization from the state detran 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.750
 After the service is ready the driver should look for a 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.450
 licensed inspection by denatran 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.070
 If changes are approved, it is necessary to return to detran so that the 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.480
 change in lighting is recorded in the car document 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.250
 who meets these requirements is legal who does not comply is subject to 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.160
 serious infraction falls 5 points in the portfolio and a fine of 127 reais 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.680
 kieling took all the steps did not make me several 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.750
 he can continue 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.190
 using your vehicle I can not make any changes 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.440
 this importer estimates that 3 million cars 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.020
 I have installed hot and not in brazil he said the vast majority is good 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.880
 quality and that the essential thing is to make the regulation doors arrived to the fame of being 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.369
 one side as well as proposals two people 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.810
 regardless of whether or not it has always been the taxpayer and the 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.170
 smuggling
