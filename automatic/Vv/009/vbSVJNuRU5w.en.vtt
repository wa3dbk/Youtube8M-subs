00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.050 
nine seven we're way above specification
just<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:42.660> you<00:01:42.720> know<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.860> range<00:01:44.130> on<00:01:44.430> some<00:01:44.700> Ford

vehicles is 0.32 point 7 volts the next

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.410 
vehicles is 0.32 point 7 volts the next
step<00:01:49.800> is<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.130> verify<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.850> DPF<00:01:51.300> II

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
step is to verify that the DPF II

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.630 
step is to verify that the DPF II
reading<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.899> we're<00:01:52.050> getting<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:53.100> actual

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
reading that we're getting is the actual

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.700 
reading that we're getting is the actual
