doing a great job one of the factors of

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.509 
doing a great job one of the factors of
animation<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:03.439> you're<00:01:04.439> kind<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.830> trying

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
animation is that you're kind of trying

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.030 
animation is that you're kind of trying
to<00:01:05.700> make<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.299> invisible<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:07.290> more<00:01:07.530> successful

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
to make it invisible the more successful

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.370 
to make it invisible the more successful
we<00:01:08.340> are<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.670> less<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.030> really<00:01:09.510> notice<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
we are the less you really notice the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.780 
we are the less you really notice the
animation<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:11.100> stuff<00:01:11.280> we've<00:01:11.400> got<00:01:11.520> going<00:01:11.640> on

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
animation the stuff we've got going on

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.190 
animation the stuff we've got going on
with<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:11.970> boss<00:01:12.150> fights<00:01:12.479> going<00:01:12.840> really

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
with that boss fights going really

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.230 
with that boss fights going really
impressive<00:01:13.650> it's<00:01:13.860> another<00:01:14.070> kind<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.030> key

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
impressive it's another kind of key

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.030 
impressive it's another kind of key
development<00:01:15.780> for<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.110> game<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.350> think<00:01:16.500> we're

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
development for this game I think we're

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.520 
development for this game I think we're
working<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.460> lot<00:01:17.759> with<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.119> designers<00:01:18.840> like

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
working a lot with the designers like

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.300 
working a lot with the designers like
way<00:01:20.040> more<00:01:20.070> closely<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.180> creating<00:01:21.960> new<00:01:21.990> things

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
way more closely and creating new things

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.700 
way more closely and creating new things
with<00:01:23.310> them<00:01:24.020> there's<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.140> certain<00:01:25.439> type<00:01:25.680> of

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
with them there's a certain type of

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.649 
with them there's a certain type of
feeling<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.310> an<00:01:26.820> animation<00:01:27.150> we<00:01:27.390> have<00:01:27.420> to

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
feeling that an animation we have to

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.109 
feeling that an animation we have to
achieve<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:29.100> most<00:01:29.250> important<00:01:29.670> part<00:01:30.030> of

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
achieve and the most important part of

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.840 
achieve and the most important part of
course<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.479> Kratos<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:30.960> how<00:01:31.740> he<00:01:31.799> moves<00:01:32.220> Kratos

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
course is Kratos and how he moves Kratos

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.999 
course is Kratos and how he moves Kratos
is<00:01:32.970> very<00:01:33.180> direct<00:01:33.509> we<00:01:34.079> don't<00:01:34.259> try<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.409> make<00:01:34.680> them

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
is very direct we don't try to make them

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.740 
is very direct we don't try to make them
too<00:01:35.400> fancy<00:01:35.759> if<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.060> notice<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.479> lot<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.630> times

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
too fancy if you notice a lot of times

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.510 
too fancy if you notice a lot of times
when<00:01:37.110> he's<00:01:37.290> having<00:01:37.409> conversations<00:01:38.159> he's<00:01:38.340> just

around<00:01:59.420> all<00:01:59.720> the<00:01:59.840> time<00:02:00.050> you<00:02:00.290> definitely<00:02:00.440> get

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
around all the time you definitely get

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.590 
around all the time you definitely get
up<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.190> try<00:02:01.340> to<00:02:01.430> act<00:02:01.700> it<00:02:01.880> out<00:02:02.060> it's<00:02:02.450> definitely

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
up and try to act it out it's definitely

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.840 
up and try to act it out it's definitely
always<00:02:03.050> a<00:02:03.170> hazardous<00:02:04.160> to<00:02:04.280> walk<00:02:04.460> around<00:02:04.730> the

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
always a hazardous to walk around the

always a hazardous to walk around the
animation<00:02:05.240> area<00:02:05.480> you<00:02:05.600> gotta<00:02:05.780> watch<00:02:06.020> out<00:02:06.670> what

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
are the challenges of animating

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.420 
are the challenges of animating
something<00:02:09.770> that<00:02:10.160> big<00:02:10.430> planning<00:02:11.180> out<00:02:11.300> where

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.110 
happens on accident you need to know
where<00:02:17.620> everything<00:02:18.620> is<00:02:18.800> I<00:02:19.250> did<00:02:19.670> not<00:02:19.880> know<00:02:20.090> that

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
where everything is I did not know that

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.660 
where everything is I did not know that
it<00:02:20.390> was<00:02:20.480> gonna<00:02:20.600> be<00:02:20.810> this<00:02:20.960> big<00:02:21.260> I<00:02:21.590> just<00:02:22.400> had<00:02:22.580> an

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
it was gonna be this big I just had an

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.160 
it was gonna be this big I just had an
idea<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:23.210> I<00:02:23.270> was<00:02:23.330> like<00:02:23.450> yeah<00:02:23.810> I'm<00:02:23.900> just<00:02:24.080> gonna

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
idea and I was like yeah I'm just gonna

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.470 
idea and I was like yeah I'm just gonna
go<00:02:24.380> with<00:02:24.590> it<00:02:24.800> which<00:02:25.220> is<00:02:25.250> kind<00:02:25.550> of<00:02:25.580> a<00:02:25.670> bad<00:02:25.850> idea<00:02:25.880> I

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
go with it which is kind of a bad idea I

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.930 
go with it which is kind of a bad idea I
learned<00:02:27.350> my<00:02:27.530> lesson<00:02:27.560> at<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.340> same<00:02:28.400> time<00:02:28.790> I'm

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
learned my lesson at the same time I'm

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.060 
learned my lesson at the same time I'm
glad<00:02:29.270> that<00:02:29.660> it's<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:30.110> size<00:02:30.320> that<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:30.620> is<00:02:30.650> the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
glad that it's the size that it is the

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.980 
glad that it's the size that it is the
players<00:02:31.310> will<00:02:31.580> be<00:02:31.700> happy<00:02:32.000> that<00:02:32.209> it's<00:02:32.270> in<00:02:32.750> there

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
players will be happy that it's in there

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.930 
players will be happy that it's in there
I<00:02:33.020> think<00:02:33.380> they'll<00:02:33.590> get<00:02:33.860> an<00:02:34.070> ax<00:02:34.190> drawn<00:02:34.490> and<00:02:34.700> rust

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
I think they'll get an ax drawn and rust

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.390 
I think they'll get an ax drawn and rust
is<00:02:35.090> from<00:02:35.330> seeing<00:02:35.570> the<00:02:35.690> sequence<00:02:36.110> gradual

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
is from seeing the sequence gradual

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.520 
is from seeing the sequence gradual
your<00:02:37.760> death<00:02:38.330> will<00:02:38.660> not<00:02:39.170> be<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.590> gentle<00:02:40.310> one
