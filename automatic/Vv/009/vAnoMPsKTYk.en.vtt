00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.280
 with me at the same time that I you 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.019
 announce the game I would say a little 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.650
 explanation why I'm looking for this game 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.689
 for the collection 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.140
 let's start with the first game it is 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.119
 of a game megadrive street of rage 3 on 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.670
 street of rage and the best series of 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.009
 video games for megadrive console and 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.880
 I re I already own the first one 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.250
 second opus 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.290
 I miss it more than the 3 by cons a 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.409
 little bit expensive second game another game 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.420
 megadrive probotector since I had 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.950
 great pleasure to remake the protector 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.229
 on the super nintendo as well as the one 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.369
 on the game boy, well I I 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.509
 realized a short time ago 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.400
 that they also released a 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.750
 probotector on the megadrive and 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.920
 I would like to test the third 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.570
 I'm also part of the series 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.130
 protector this is the second opus for 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.600
 the gameboy 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.310
 same as for megadrive protector 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.270
 since I finished the bronze 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.979
 texan on the game boy 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.479
 I did not even know there was a 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.399
 second who came out on game boy 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.049
 normal I'm looking for I'm looking for 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.340
 also a game to complete my 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.960
 silent hill collection 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.479
 this is silent hill book of 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.880
 memories the opus of ps vita 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.049
 even though the genre of this game is not the 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.820
 everything ensures a high rank is no longer a 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.530
 hack'n slash the recharge anyway 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.829
 for my personal collection of silent 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.530
 hill 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.360
 and then maybe he's not that bad 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.739
 that I already have some but it's not 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.610
 not a French version it is true 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.220
 that sonic 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.990
 is an ultra catastrophic game for no 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.120
 say the worst game the one who never 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.220
 been done well i'm looking for each other 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.500

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.420
 who from what one builds in 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.360
 comments it seems he is top 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.150
 another game ps vita shade of light on 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.210
 la vita I had great pleasure to see her 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.760
 finish in twitch on the xbox version 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.860
 one but as the xbox version to seniors 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.610
 the material is not found after 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.709
 the collector who or April and the a6 where the 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.470
 game is not even in it's more a 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.640
 code to download the the only console 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.620
 or this game came out in battle 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.910
 only and well it's on the vita is 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.470
 a genre just found him for the 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.180
 ps saw a little zelda too I 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.820
 search is the princess toilet 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.680
 on the gamecube there is also a game 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.420
 ps1 that I'm looking for the poem is that 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.910
 it's one of the most wanted games 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.010
 for the psa it's about toby the first 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.550
 opus since I remember that 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.440
 the time 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.630
 the only background I played at this style game 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.610
 on a demo version and he had 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.770
 frankly well well convinced this game 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.750
 but I have never made history and 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.950
 when we see how much it's going to cost 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.890
 be complicated to have it for less 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.330
 60 euros to and pink may that magic sassi 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.040
 of the strategy game on pc 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.880
 well i'm looking for the second opus 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.350
 we are not on pc but on game boy color 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.150
 since I ask it if I have the 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.280
 first the first game for the game boy 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.810
 color and I know they've released a 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.280
 second for the game boy color 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.260
 I would like to see him and see 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.209
 what to expect when I go play 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.739
 at this games on game boy color in terms of 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.299
 retro games completely goofy 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.549
 Of course we have goose hermann but we have 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.380
 also off store gimat the game owns 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.269
 one and the 2 be it on the grid 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.010
 megadrive and on the super Nintendo 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.260
 but they also released the first 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.180
 baby that day megacity headphones at the 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.560
 difference the ost who were 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.480
 completely changed which are of a 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.250
 extraordinary quality 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.080
 if you have the time I advise you 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.769
 advise you to listen to them on 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.390
 Youtube 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.430
 I am a very big fan of the games of 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.459
 rhythm like for example the guitar hero 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.690
 the donkey kong a is also rock band dj 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.250
 hero is a game that is going 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.080
 convinced when I go in already 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.470
 panic in japan style conventions 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.090
 expo 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.010
 in this time of as they are called 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.330
 ah yes ensures guen for the japan expo of 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.480
 marseille visit didier theys not 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:25.240
 this year it's pop'n music 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:28.600
 with I think there are birds at 9,10 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.490
 bumper and this game is super complicated 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.730
 but very busy playing it 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:37.240
 the problem is that to find the 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.590
 stick standards to play this game it's going 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.390
 to be complicated but frankly that but 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.040
 it would be really great to own this 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.420
 game in my collection there are also some 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.090
 xbox one games that I search by 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.840
 example there is mortal kombat 10 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.730
 I will wait that are a little cheaper 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.310
 a shoot'em up that stx n com recommends 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.470
 strongly compared to these ost of 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.140
 quality it's tons of gold force 3 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.300
 or May 4th I'm already looking for the 3rd 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.100
 and when I looked on the internet me 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.440
 I know I like the sub-themes up 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.430
 but it's not that expensive 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.300
 think I could find myself 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.160
 easily 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.710
 I do not own a little dreamcast game 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.820
 which is quite common but I am a 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.910
 few big stems not to see her 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.380
 these tutus rockets the little game with 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.510
 all the little mice and cats 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.040
 who looks like nothing but who can 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.300
 play up to four at the same time 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.430
 game is a good one to play several 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.900
 among all my collector's collection 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.070
 there is one that I do not always have 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.230
 no and that's the collector that I 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.660
 search the most it comes to collector 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.640
 of fallout 3 the sandwich box after 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.380
 3.6 or ps3 I do not care or it's true 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.710
 I forgot to tell you this xbox one game 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:39.610

 danteques and I come back to redo them 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.960
 on xbox one in this compilation well 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.570
 heard the remarkable wii game or 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.490
 leaked since they did 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.470
 updating with the cut of meaning and 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.620
 it's good for me to play it 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.120
 little games saturn also fighting vipers 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:04.030
 the fighting game I was playing at 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.140
 the time at the cousin's and I do not have 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.030

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:09.700

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:18.729
 game it's fire emblem on the gamecube 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.180
 I tested the ds version after this 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:22.310
 I was told it's not the 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.130
 elsewhere in the series and it's true that 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:28.039
 the system of strategy that looks 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:30.410
 strongly to advance wars boots 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:32.000
 frankly and I'm lying range trying the 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.220

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.550
 collection of video games apart from 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.630

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:50.660
 reasons alesi the thread is 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.979
