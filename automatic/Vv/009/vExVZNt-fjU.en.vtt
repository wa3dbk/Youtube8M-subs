00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.680 
that they are messy so I sweep you brush
over<00:01:18.290> it<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:18.560> you've<00:01:18.950> got<00:01:19.100> like<00:01:19.450> minerals<00:01:20.450> all

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
over it and you've got like minerals all

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.910 
over it and you've got like minerals all
the<00:01:20.990> way<00:01:21.050> around<00:01:21.729> so<00:01:23.080> it's<00:01:24.080> sort<00:01:24.320> of<00:01:24.440> a<00:01:24.500> pain<00:01:24.680> to

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
the way around so it's sort of a pain to

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.690 
the way around so it's sort of a pain to
keep<00:01:25.100> clean<00:01:25.790> and<00:01:26.150> evidence<00:01:26.630> but<00:01:27.340> cool<00:01:28.340> itself

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
keep clean and evidence but cool itself

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.120 
keep clean and evidence but cool itself

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.310 
i think really is nice a bit under the
minute<00:01:31.460> but<00:01:31.880> not<00:01:32.360> sure<00:01:32.539> if<00:01:32.630> you<00:01:32.720> can<00:01:32.810> see<00:01:32.869> it

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:51.909 
so I think if Bruce were probably the

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:56.530 
so I think if Bruce were probably the
better

probably 1090 probably not

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.729 
probably 1090 probably not
for<00:03:09.170> one<00:03:09.319> am<00:03:09.439> i<00:03:09.560> right<00:03:09.920> different<00:03:10.280> sizes<00:03:11.739> we

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
for one am i right different sizes we
