00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
a critical objective and those are the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.280 
a critical objective and those are the
mines<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:23.460> have<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.760> go<00:01:23.909> kind<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.900> just

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
mines you have to go kind of just

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.800 
mines you have to go kind of just
destroy<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.740> mines<00:01:26.070> by<00:01:26.369> sitting<00:01:26.850> in<00:01:27.030> them<00:01:27.270> so

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
destroy the mines by sitting in them so

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.719 
destroy the mines by sitting in them so
the<00:01:28.170> mine<00:01:28.409> spawns<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.130> you're<00:01:29.280> just<00:01:29.520> gonna

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
the mine spawns and you're just gonna

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.429 
the mine spawns and you're just gonna
try<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.270> focus<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.689> killing<00:01:30.900> him<00:01:31.140> first

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
because you will be able to make it

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.960 
because you will be able to make it
there<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.960> got<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> little<00:01:34.830> a<00:01:35.189> panicked<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.939> little

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
there I got a little a panicked a little

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.580 
there I got a little a panicked a little
bit<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.479> started<00:01:36.840> running<00:01:36.990> over<00:01:37.200> there<00:01:37.439> and

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
bit so I started running over there and

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.410 
bit so I started running over there and
it<00:01:37.619> did<00:01:37.860> kill<00:01:38.130> me<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.460> think<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.000> was<00:01:39.150> me

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
it did kill me but I think that was me

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.480 
it did kill me but I think that was me
shooting<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.409> rocket<00:01:40.799> at<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.009> ground<00:01:41.280> so

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
shooting the rocket at the ground so

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.850 
shooting the rocket at the ground so
honestly<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:42.000> was<00:01:42.119> just<00:01:42.270> my<00:01:42.509> fault<00:01:42.900> but<00:01:43.590> so

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
honestly that was just my fault but so

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.640 
honestly that was just my fault but so
we<00:01:44.100> do<00:01:44.280> end<00:01:44.549> up<00:01:44.700> killing<00:01:45.119> him<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.630> then<00:01:45.900> we

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
we do end up killing him and then we

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.700 
we do end up killing him and then we
were<00:01:46.770> able<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.070> run<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:48.119> land<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:49.200> mean<00:01:49.380> make<00:01:49.680> it

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
were able to run and land I mean make it

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.100 
were able to run and land I mean make it

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
that is the see my man we were at this

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.520 
that is the see my man we were at this
for<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.560> very<00:02:19.890> long<00:02:20.040> time<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.880> it<00:02:21.780> was<00:02:21.959> kind<00:02:22.290> of

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
for a very long time and it was kind of

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.690 
for a very long time and it was kind of
completely<00:02:23.250> my<00:02:23.550> fault<00:02:23.580> because<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.209> thought

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
completely my fault because I thought

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.760 
completely my fault because I thought
had<00:02:24.790> weapons<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.390> light<00:02:25.629> on<00:02:25.810> but<00:02:26.470> we<00:02:26.620> were

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
had weapons of light on but we were

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.100 
had weapons of light on but we were
using<00:02:27.180> blessings<00:02:28.180> of<00:02:28.360> light<00:02:28.540> so<00:02:28.750> we<00:02:28.780> didn't

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
using blessings of light so we didn't

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.839 
using blessings of light so we didn't
have<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.410> extra<00:02:29.620> damage<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.519> this<00:02:30.700> was

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
have that extra damage and this was

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.670 
have that extra damage and this was
actually<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.239> very<00:02:31.420> last<00:02:31.780> run<00:02:32.050> because<00:02:32.410> it<00:02:32.560> was

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
actually a very last run because it was

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.070 
actually a very last run because it was
getting<00:02:32.800> pretty<00:02:32.950> late<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.720> yeah<00:02:34.720> we<00:02:34.930> just

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
getting pretty late and yeah we just

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.320 
getting pretty late and yeah we just
realized<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:35.709> I<00:02:35.920> was<00:02:36.129> on<00:02:36.280> blessings<00:02:37.180> of

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
realized that I was on blessings of

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.020 
realized that I was on blessings of
light<00:02:37.540> not<00:02:37.810> weapons<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.319> light<00:02:38.500> so<00:02:38.920> you<00:02:39.879> know

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
light not weapons of light so you know

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.300 
light not weapons of light so you know
it<00:02:40.090> was<00:02:40.239> pretty<00:02:41.110> funny<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:41.830> was<00:02:41.920> kind<00:02:42.250> of

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
it was pretty funny it was kind of

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.490 
it was pretty funny it was kind of
bittersweet<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:43.120> guess<00:02:43.360> it<00:02:43.569> was<00:02:43.660> kind<00:02:43.720> of<00:02:43.959> just

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
bittersweet I guess it was kind of just

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.020 
bittersweet I guess it was kind of just
annoying<00:02:45.040> that<00:02:45.819> I<00:02:46.510> have<00:02:47.670> blessings<00:02:48.670> of<00:02:48.819> light

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
annoying that I have blessings of light

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.380 
annoying that I have blessings of light
anyway<00:02:49.660> so<00:02:49.720> after<00:02:50.440> you<00:02:50.530> do<00:02:50.739> guys<00:02:51.010> kill<00:02:51.640> him

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
multiple times because we would run out

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.449 
multiple times because we would run out
of<00:03:55.930> heavy<00:03:56.290> and<00:03:56.530> then<00:03:56.650> we<00:03:56.769> would<00:03:56.920> go<00:03:57.069> in<00:03:57.250> there

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
of heavy and then we would go in there

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.670 
of heavy and then we would go in there
and<00:03:57.609> just<00:03:57.790> pretty<00:03:58.150> much<00:03:58.299> farm<00:03:58.690> and<00:03:58.989> the<00:03:59.470> took

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
and just pretty much farm and the took

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.770 
and just pretty much farm and the took
us<00:03:59.799> a<00:03:59.950> long<00:04:00.190> time<00:04:00.250> to<00:04:00.670> figure<00:04:01.060> and<00:04:01.209> finally<00:04:01.600> get

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
us a long time to figure and finally get

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.140 
us a long time to figure and finally get
this<00:04:01.959> but<00:04:02.290> we<00:04:02.980> did<00:04:03.160> do<00:04:03.310> it<00:04:03.340> with<00:04:03.519> to<00:04:03.700> level<00:04:04.000> 30
