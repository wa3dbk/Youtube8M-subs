00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.520
 to go wrong 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.920
 without failing 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.290
 marcelo hit the spotlight 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.379
 we cariello petiz 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:12.369
 so we have it now 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:16.059
 the nuclear envelope to caries or 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.179
 foot her 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:22.839
 important wrap that protects genetic material 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:24.919
 we will find 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.199
 the genish responsible for our 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.689
 heritage 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.849
 genetics 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.030
 mitochondria 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.100
 an important organelle appear in the region quoted peace sea dry 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.600
 of the cell animate it 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.760
 responsible for the art of cellular respiration 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.760
 so what is my cell lung produces energy 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.250
 I replicate beyond the opas 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.560
 a network of channels 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.640
 we have two types of milk and plasma honey 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.650
 the trash 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.000
 and joy 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.260
 which differentiates the structure of the Lisbon plasma level rating with a goal 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.640
 it's the presence 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.410
 2 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.800
 and we like 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.500
 delegations to a large club and how to 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.830
 responsible for production 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.830
 of cell proteins 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.340
 we now have bauxi complex 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.480
 responsible for storage in cell secretion 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.750
 substances that are produced are stored in the complex of 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.619
 and will be later 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.650
 secreted 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.590
 without perillo 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.330
 important responsibility for the formation of a 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.440
 the use 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.420
 to roll 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.760
 during cell division mythology 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.650
 in this somo 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.650
 organelle responsible for digestion 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.710
 you enter a home 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.999
 particles that penetrate the cell to be digested 

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:59.910
 penalty 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.230
 then woven 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:07.170
 is the carry on tim presents the wrapper believe the carateca 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.459
 or also 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.539
 many Olhanense 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:16.259
 are responsible for various functions within the cell 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:20.129
 whereas in the prokaryotes in the bacterium 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.129
 In the chat on the site we only find those who are 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:25.210
 a look at her 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.420
 responsible for the synthesis 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.000
 in proteins 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.769
 bacterial 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.149
 the videos 

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:34.889
 are series 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:37.569
 it seems that a very simple structure 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.659
 Let's study now. 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.519
 the videos 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.309
 legal structure 

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:45.949
 cap decided 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:48.949
 involving the genetic material of viruses 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.379
 genetic material which can be 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:53.789
 I gave my 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:54.549
 Paulo 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.359
 rna 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:57.739
 responsible 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.069
 pen it details age 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.979
 by mutations 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:03.319
 that occur 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.199
 the rights 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:06.230
 the videos 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.210
 samarra 100 dollars as we just observed 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.310
 has a simple genetic material structure of mine 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:14.629
 rna 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.149
 in the case of hiv 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:21.659
 AIDS virus it is considered a retrovirus by which it presents 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:23.529
 It is the one who errs as material 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:25.129
 janitor account 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.129
 the videos they are considered so on the nose 

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:32.829
 for all this does not always depend on another brain has a structure 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.339
 very simple 

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.620
 servers he has dna 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.300
 so we'll imagine a situation bn a 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.579
 is the engineer of a work 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:42.629
 the sister 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.919
 is the worker in this work 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:49.480
 so if the virus he has dna he has an engineer missing a worker 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.640
 which he will get the worker in a week 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.109
 to zeca 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.449
 if there is no rna 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:57.440
 understood 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.999
 the worker lacks the engineer 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:02.180
 so do not even think 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.910
 to avoid another cell to search 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.379
 the engineer so why 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:11.849
 it is considered a case will not give will always depend 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.849
 of another cell that would go to avoid 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.090
 to be able to reproduce 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.090
 outside the cell virus has no ability to reproduce 

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:25.569
 but I would like you 

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:28.679
 do not forget the main points of the state 

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:33.900
 is a companion a table with a summary of the main 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.840
 points of this 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.099
 organization of the cellular structure of living beings 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:40.719
 we have 

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:43.449
 your nose would trade last 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.039
 and is the karyoty 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.599
 procariontes bacteria and would be bacteria 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:53.100
 that you also know as if in the end these 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.640
 but today we use more the term cyanobacteria 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.159
 eukaryotes 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:00.699
 protozoa 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.699
 unicellular 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:04.159
 even a man 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:07.159
 including the group of eukaryotes 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.509
 provided the current salary 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:13.150
 some vegetables until then for me 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.439
 there are 100 dollars we have the training group 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:21.499
 do not forget those details that are important 

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:22.500
 now 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.339
 to answer the initial question 

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:30.439
 what are the expensive brazi differences between a cell 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:33.310
 would provoke the optics that is a bacterial cell 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.939
 and a renal scene 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:38.460
 I would like you to keep track of 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.589
 now the resolution 

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:43.950
 being the bacterial present 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.659
 on winning 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:47.270
 ariella technique 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.620
 membrane 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.990
 do not believe 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.990
 or in vain nuclear tori 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.830
 we only have the presence of the hamas 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.259
 ribosomes 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:05:59.919
 on a giant screen for 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.020
 in the term term nothing serves the battery 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.260
 bad cell phone 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.400
 presence of the carateca 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.839
 your wrap create 

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:11.889
 and to the presence of many galleries in possession 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.400
 what should be very important 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.819
 bacteria that become bacteria 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:20.200
 prokaryotes 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.169
 the rest of the living beings 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.059
 excerpts viruses 

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:27.059
 classified as I fall ortiz 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.820
 Ariel I await you for our next hour.
