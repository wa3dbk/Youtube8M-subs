00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.850
 easter bunnies make the easter bunnies 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.150
 just belong to Easter 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.810
 We're making a nice Easter bunny 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.960
 styrofoam 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.910
 it is with servette and with decoration 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.289
 Partsch technique simply designed here 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.980
 For this you need a big one 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:39.329
 styrofoam easter bunny and servette nice 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.200
 patterned and then almost with flowers 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.980
 all materials like scissors or pencil 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:50.539
 acrylic paints and an eco prime or 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.800
 white wine a few brushes 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:57.109
 Here we have mobile stones for the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:01.969
 eyes used and now we start 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:05.729
 First we take a napkin and 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:08.430
 our haase just gets up front 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.750
 the front between the hands and 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:16.040
 later we have a heart here 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.439
 beautiful there will be you with heart motives 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.070
 we cut and put it nicely 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.070
 deal 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:34.360
 Now we paint the interior here 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:38.759
 ears on ears simply get 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:41.500
 another color from this career 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.680
 pattern and cut our ears 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:54.190
 back we use only the first layer 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:57.300
 from the sabet two parts for the 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:01.179
 simply cut out the inner area and 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.190
 rightly live the same thing we do 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.229
 here with the tail also that 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.229
 little tail will be in a different color 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.910
 designed 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:14.500
 you look on the right side 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:17.560
 we have some pieces with this with this one 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.800
 Servette of your choice here simply 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.030
 piece made and now we give 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.130
 Weisheim directly on the bunny 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.340
 dozens of here 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.829
 Servette and paint completely 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.700
 Once over the whole thing goes over 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:38.980
 work piece by piece and you see 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.040
 here we overlap this servette 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.540
 one after the other and the whole thing will now 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.540
 already passed 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:52.210
 the whole bunny is complete here 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:56.170
 made to the end and a three 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:59.560
 live here get the ears and the 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:06.070
 beautifully designed heart sticking to this heart 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:09.370
 a few on a foil on the heart 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:13.350
 as said cut out also 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.730
 the servette and this is glued on 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.720
 so it has a nice strong 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:26.950
 stood and now cut out with the 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:29.410
 scissors work out nicely and 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.380
 you can see the bunny is here now 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.570
 completely finished now we give it in the 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:42.430
 file the tail just in this one 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:45.880
 Caro was stuck on and ears are lying 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:52.230
 Also for the conclusion just here 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:52.230
 area here still use the ears 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:03.520
 as I said repainting that 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:06.780
 stature and then 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:10.030
 give once again to argue the matter 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:15.690
 the two eyes are made of mogel stones 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:19.770
 we paint the nose here and the mouth 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.770
 is drawn on 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:36.180
 now just the heart in front between the 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:42.389
 Hands glued around a small tube 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:45.650
 still attach now with felt-tip pen 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.650
 to indicate the teeth
