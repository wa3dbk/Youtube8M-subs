flakes they don't they tend to float at
the<00:01:11.100> top<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.610> fish<00:01:11.939> don't<00:01:12.330> know

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570

recognized as food because life rooms

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.700 
recognized as food because life rooms
would<00:01:14.760> just<00:01:14.939> sink<00:01:15.360> down<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.900> eat<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.229> so

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
would just sink down and that eat it so

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.929 
would just sink down and that eat it so
the<00:01:16.830> flake<00:01:17.009> would<00:01:17.189> stay<00:01:17.340> at<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.520> top

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
the flake would stay at the top

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.240 
the flake would stay at the top
nothing<00:01:18.450> until<00:01:18.630> they<00:01:18.869> start<00:01:19.140> sinking<00:01:19.650> they

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
nothing until they start sinking they

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.219 
nothing until they start sinking they
would<00:01:20.430> go<00:01:20.790> after<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.420> then<00:01:21.630> spit<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:21.990> out

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
would go after it and then spit it out

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.260 
would go after it and then spit it out
they<00:01:22.530> didn't<00:01:22.770> eat<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.130> they<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:23.790> like<00:01:24.000> I

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
they didn't eat it they just like I

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
don't know to them I think it's like

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.999 
don't know to them I think it's like
eating<00:01:26.250> paper<00:01:26.900> um<00:01:27.930> there's<00:01:28.350> like<00:01:28.439> artificial

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
eating paper um there's like artificial

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.569 
eating paper um there's like artificial
and<00:01:29.610> not<00:01:29.790> really<00:01:30.090> good<00:01:30.299> um<00:01:30.710> so<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.979> had<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.430> get

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
and not really good um so I had to get

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.670 
and not really good um so I had to get
rid<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.850> flakes<00:01:33.270> out<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.880> out<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.680> way

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
rid of flakes out of the out of the way

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.870 
rid of flakes out of the out of the way
I<00:01:37.979> guess<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.490> don't<00:01:38.640> know

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
I guess I don't know

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.170 
I guess I don't know
and<00:01:39.119> then<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:40.320> still<00:01:40.890> got<00:01:41.159> me<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.520> live<00:01:41.850> foods

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
and then that still got me to live foods

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.850 
and then that still got me to live foods
I<00:01:42.329> didn't<00:01:42.570> want<00:01:42.720> life<00:01:42.930> was<00:01:43.259> because<00:01:43.470> every<00:01:43.649> day

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
I didn't want life was because every day

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.130 
I didn't want life was because every day
I'd<00:01:43.979> have<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.250> find<00:01:44.430> time<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:45.119> defrost<00:01:45.570> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
I'd have to find time to defrost the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.889

Rastas<00:02:07.469> that's<00:02:07.649> what<00:02:07.770> they're<00:02:07.890> on<00:02:08.039> says

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
Rastas that's what they're on says

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.790 
Rastas that's what they're on says
expect<00:02:09.270> record<00:02:09.539> growth<00:02:09.899> highly<00:02:10.590> digestible

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
expect record growth highly digestible

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.339 
expect record growth highly digestible
so<00:02:11.550> this<00:02:11.730> stuff<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.569> really<00:02:12.840> good<00:02:13.080> as<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.290> can

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.650 
so this stuff is really good as you can
see

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
see

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.520 
see
they're<00:02:13.810> like<00:02:14.020> fired<00:02:14.500> up<00:02:14.800> about<00:02:15.070> it<00:02:15.340> um<00:02:16.530> they

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
they're like fired up about it um they

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.260 
they're like fired up about it um they
would<00:02:17.710> float<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.430> top<00:02:18.520> too<00:02:18.880> but<00:02:19.150> they

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
would float to the top too but they

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.970 
would float to the top too but they
would<00:02:19.390> also<00:02:19.510> sink<00:02:19.900> after<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.230> couple<00:02:20.590> seconds

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
would also sink after a couple seconds

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.310 
would also sink after a couple seconds
so<00:02:21.460> what<00:02:21.610> I<00:02:21.670> do<00:02:21.730> is<00:02:22.090> I<00:02:22.270> chuck<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:22.870> in<00:02:23.020> there<00:02:23.170> and

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
so what I do is I chuck it in there and

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.540 
so what I do is I chuck it in there and
then<00:02:23.410> it<00:02:23.560> starts<00:02:23.890> sinking<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.280> then<00:02:24.370> I<00:02:24.430> would

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
then it starts sinking and then I would

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.610 
then it starts sinking and then I would
just<00:02:24.730> eat<00:02:24.850> it<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.120> they<00:02:25.360> ate<00:02:25.630> it<00:02:25.690> they<00:02:26.110> did<00:02:26.500> not

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
just eat it and they ate it they did not

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.420 
just eat it and they ate it they did not
spit<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.160> out<00:02:27.310> so<00:02:27.730> since<00:02:28.240> then<00:02:28.830> not<00:02:29.830> float<00:02:30.280> it

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
spit it out so since then not float it

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.190 
spit it out so since then not float it
and<00:02:30.580> then<00:02:30.700> eat<00:02:31.030> it<00:02:31.060> because<00:02:31.720> they<00:02:31.840> recognize

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
and then eat it because they recognize

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.950 
and then eat it because they recognize
as<00:02:32.440> food<00:02:32.710> now<00:02:32.890> so<00:02:33.490> that<00:02:33.730> has<00:02:33.970> been<00:02:34.270> taken<00:02:34.930> care

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
as food now so that has been taken care

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.960 
as food now so that has been taken care
of<00:02:35.200> them<00:02:35.560> eating<00:02:35.800> and<00:02:36.130> it's<00:02:36.310> been<00:02:36.460> a<00:02:36.490> month<00:02:36.700> of

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
of them eating and it's been a month of

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.620 
of them eating and it's been a month of
them<00:02:37.270> eating<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:37.750> so<00:02:37.780> they're<00:02:38.140> good<00:02:38.350> over<00:02:39.280> here

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
them eating it so they're good over here

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.000 
them eating it so they're good over here
this<00:02:40.630> is<00:02:40.810> their<00:02:40.960> sleeping<00:02:41.320> zone<00:02:41.560> this<00:02:41.830> is

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
this is their sleeping zone this is

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.710 
this is their sleeping zone this is
where<00:02:42.160> they<00:02:42.310> sleep<00:02:42.460> every<00:02:42.850> night<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.390> they

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
where they sleep every night and they

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.640 
where they sleep every night and they
dig<00:02:43.990> this<00:02:44.290> little<00:02:44.650> hole<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.250> guess<00:02:45.610> you'd<00:02:45.790> say

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
dig this little hole I guess you'd say

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.230 
dig this little hole I guess you'd say
every<00:02:47.650> time<00:02:47.830> it<00:02:47.980> clean<00:02:48.220> it<00:02:48.400> straighten<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.120> out

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
every time it clean it straighten it out

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.780 
every time it clean it straighten it out
and<00:02:49.510> then<00:02:49.630> next<00:02:50.290> morning<00:02:50.980> they<00:02:51.160> would<00:02:51.280> dig<00:02:51.670> it

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
and then next morning they would dig it

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.400 
and then next morning they would dig it
out<00:02:51.880> again<00:02:52.150> they<00:02:52.600> do<00:02:52.720> this<00:02:52.840> little<00:02:53.020> wiggle

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
out again they do this little wiggle

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.960 
out again they do this little wiggle
dance<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.100> whole<00:02:54.190> sand<00:02:54.520> would<00:02:54.670> be<00:02:54.760> just

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
dance and the whole sand would be just

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.940 
dance and the whole sand would be just
shot<00:02:55.210> up<00:02:55.360> I<00:02:55.660> don't<00:02:56.590> care

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
shot up I don't care

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.070 
shot up I don't care
I<00:02:57.130> guess<00:02:57.370> that's<00:02:57.760> that's<00:02:58.330> their<00:02:58.540> decision<00:02:58.720> to

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
I guess that's that's their decision to

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.840 
I guess that's that's their decision to
live<00:02:59.230> there<00:02:59.410> I<00:02:59.560> don't<00:03:00.040> want<00:03:00.160> them<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.460> live<00:03:00.670> in

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
live there I don't want them to live in

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.090 
live there I don't want them to live in
