00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.480
 if you think pisi 360 game is 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.610
 coolest gaming headphones from 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.189
 sennheiser you are deeply mistaken 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.239
 because at the moment the flagship 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:33.750
 This line is a model pc 360 3d 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:37.250
 we will look at it now externally 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:42.179
 Seeing 360 3d is almost the same as 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:44.850
 360 and 350 models in principle such 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:46.579
 the design seems to me the most successful 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.769
 for long gaming sessions 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:53.219
 elongated bowls soft velor ear cushions 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:55.800
 and headband ears do not hurt my head 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.440
 headphones do not crush well, and this is understandable because 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.960
 they are also light as their predecessors 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.780
 I personally can sit in them all day 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.949
 and ears will not be able to, I earphones 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.620
 open type 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.410
 so you will hear everyone around they 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.150
 in turn will hear you say 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.430
 that open headphones do not allow 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.130
 sweat your ears and give more natural 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.200
 the sound will not argue but it seems to me that 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.300
 in terms of competition it will interfere 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.850
 hear the game and teammates there always 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.890
 noisy but let's leave it to conscience 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.990
 developers 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.390
 someone might not like what 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.350
 the price of the headset is completely 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.360
 plastic 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.700
 rightly so but for me 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.710
 they are made quite high quality and even 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.300
 if they were completely metal 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.210
 this aside in the fall it is them you are not 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.640
 saved what distinguishes them from previous 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.870
 models like the same why not 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.450
 flagship but its sound card 3d sbis 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.760
 game van it allows you to turn on 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.430
 surround function you can 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.710
 choose two channel sound 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.330
 four-channel 51 and 71 just not 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.610
 forget to install drivers without them 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.910
 the radio card will not work 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.700
 3d effect simple slides regulator 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.679
 volume left the same where and always 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.069
 on the right ear 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.019
 cable braided and length 2 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.909
 meter if you do not miss it 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.310
 can use 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:22.400
 audio extension cable which will give 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.590
 you additional 1 and 2 meters well, but if 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.019
 the cable is too long for you 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.319
 can shorten it with this one 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.319
 things 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.870
 microphone as usual in the raised position 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.719
 off and on when you do it 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.099
 lower it bends a little and you can 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:43.000
 adjust it 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:49.720
 but how does it work? 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.720
 Microphone check sennheiser pc 360. 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.519
 I think these words are enough to check 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.409
 but katuhu 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:05.840
 microphone check sennheiser pc 360 3d 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:07.639
 Excellent in my opinion from these words to the 100th 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.650
 sound you are probably nothing new 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:12.340
 hear from the entire line it looks like 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.049
 especially in games I was expecting super cool 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.209
 positioning and i got it 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.819
 really gaming headphones high 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.129
 class and no wonder people praise them to hear 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.739
 far away everything is clear and for competitive 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:27.680
 shooters such sound will be just a godsend 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.419
 if you're going to play ks16 then 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.699
 multichannel sounding is useless 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:34.159
 the game just doesn't support it and you 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:36.019
 you will hear all the shops but for c s 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:38.299
 head or any battle field of 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.790
 crises and so on it will be cool 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.400
 sound you'll like in general like 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.699
 expected sound in games just great 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.949
 movies and music in 363 models will be 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:49.430
 sound exactly like the previous ones 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:52.489
 models 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.409
 that is, nothing unusual here you are 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.720
 find megabass all sound very 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:04:00.169
 soft balanced and as for me 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.060
 quite ordinary movies will help a lot 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:04.699
 multichannel sound especially in action 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.590
 try should like some 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:08.780
 listen to music with him but I like that 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.169
 the sound seems unusual and so I 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.979
 I prefer to listen just in stereo 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:15.139
 music movies 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:17.509
 it is nice but it seems to me 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:20.000
 these headphones are game only 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:23.040
 if you want yourself good headphones for 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.810
 competitive shooters here they are you 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.300
 regret when you understand what you hear 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.280
 better than their rivals than they think you 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.940
 it is precisely this engineers sennheiser and 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.060
 sought 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.880
 and nothing to say have succeeded such a sound 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.800
 I wish everyone on this everything was with you
