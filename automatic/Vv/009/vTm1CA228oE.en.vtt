habitat conditions in Missouri we even

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.030 
habitat conditions in Missouri we even
look<00:00:35.790> restored<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.809> know<00:00:36.930> lots<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.559> wetlands

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
look restored you know lots of wetlands

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.040 
look restored you know lots of wetlands
in<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.219> last<00:00:38.399> 10<00:00:38.610> or<00:00:38.640> 20<00:00:38.969> years<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:39.930> we

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
in the last 10 or 20 years and so we

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.900 
in the last 10 or 20 years and so we
want<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.290> find<00:00:40.469> out<00:00:40.649> where<00:00:41.160> ducks<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.760> geese
