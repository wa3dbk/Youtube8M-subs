short tutorial to give you some hints
and<00:00:06.600> tips<00:00:06.810> on<00:00:07.200> using<00:00:07.620> paper<00:00:08.040> structurally<00:00:08.730> for

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
and tips on using paper structurally for

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.680 
and tips on using paper structurally for
your<00:00:09.480> paper<00:00:09.840> bridge<00:00:10.820> so<00:00:11.820> one<00:00:12.330> of<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.480> easiest

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
your paper bridge so one of the easiest

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.910 
your paper bridge so one of the easiest
things<00:00:12.780> we<00:00:13.049> can<00:00:13.170> do<00:00:13.259> with<00:00:13.349> paper<00:00:13.530> is

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
things we can do with paper is

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.790 
things we can do with paper is
corrugated<00:00:14.670> essentially<00:00:15.420> bend<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.379> in<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.619> way

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
corrugated essentially bend it in a way

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.630 
corrugated essentially bend it in a way
to<00:00:16.830> stiffen<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:18.770> so<00:00:19.770> I've<00:00:19.920> just<00:00:19.949> taken<00:00:20.160> an<00:00:20.490> a4

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
to stiffen it so I've just taken an a4

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.550 
to stiffen it so I've just taken an a4
sheet<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:22.730> 80<00:00:23.730> grams<00:00:24.090> per<00:00:24.359> square<00:00:24.449> metre<00:00:24.869> paper

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
sheet of 80 grams per square metre paper

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.920 
sheet of 80 grams per square metre paper
printer<00:00:26.130> paper<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:27.180> ninety<00:00:27.420> four<00:00:27.599> sheets

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
printer paper so ninety four sheets

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.529 
printer paper so ninety four sheets
works<00:00:28.380> out<00:00:28.740> at<00:00:28.980> about<00:00:29.099> five<00:00:29.670> grams<00:00:29.970> just<00:00:30.119> under

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
works out at about five grams just under

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.670 
works out at about five grams just under
five<00:00:30.750> grams<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:32.009> if<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.460> just<00:00:32.669> fold<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.680> that'll

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
five grams and if I just fold it that'll

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.319 
five grams and if I just fold it that'll
add<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.800> little<00:00:35.040> bit<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.190> stiffness<00:00:38.329> but

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
add a little bit of stiffness but

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.299 
add a little bit of stiffness but
obviously<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:40.050> it's<00:00:40.410> collapsing<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.250> it

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
obviously it's it's collapsing so it

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.819 
obviously it's it's collapsing so it
needs<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.550> little<00:00:41.579> bit<00:00:41.790> more<00:00:41.910> rigidity<00:00:42.590> so<00:00:43.590> what

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
needs a little bit more rigidity so what

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.920 
needs a little bit more rigidity so what
I've<00:00:43.950> done<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.750> I've<00:00:45.750> just<00:00:46.379> drawn<00:00:46.829> up<00:00:47.039> some

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
I've done is I've just drawn up some

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.000 
I've done is I've just drawn up some
little<00:00:48.930> sheets<00:00:49.730> with<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.379> shape<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.710> it's

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
little sheets with the shape that it's

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.549 
little sheets with the shape that it's
going<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.969> cut<00:00:54.809> them<00:00:54.960> out<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> little

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
going to be and cut them out so a little

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.040 
going to be and cut them out so a little
slot<00:00:55.920> onto<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.489> house<00:00:56.670> I've<00:00:57.510> got<00:00:57.629> ten<00:00:57.930> of

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
slot onto the house I've got ten of

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.330 
slot onto the house I've got ten of
these<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.500> an<00:00:58.620> a4<00:00:58.770> sheet<00:00:59.629> so<00:01:00.629> they<00:01:01.590> work<00:01:01.980> out

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
these as an a4 sheet so they work out

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.579 
these as an a4 sheet so they work out
I've<00:01:02.550> only<00:01:02.670> gone<00:01:02.820> five<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.390> these<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:03.989> that's

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
I've only gone five of these so that's

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.410 
I've only gone five of these so that's
another<00:01:04.799> two<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.220> half<00:01:05.400> grams<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.150> inside

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
another two and a half grams so inside

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.880 
another two and a half grams so inside
we've<00:01:06.600> got<00:01:06.689> seven<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> half<00:01:07.140> grams<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.619> mean

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
we've got seven and a half grams I mean

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.770 
we've got seven and a half grams I mean
true-blue<00:01:08.369> Peter<00:01:08.640> style<00:01:09.150> here's<00:01:09.420> one<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.659> made

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
true-blue Peter style here's one I made

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.170 
true-blue Peter style here's one I made
earlier<00:01:10.040> so<00:01:11.040> I've<00:01:11.130> just<00:01:11.159> slotted<00:01:11.640> these<00:01:11.939> on

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
earlier so I've just slotted these on

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.960 
earlier so I've just slotted these on
very<00:01:12.510> simply<00:01:12.960> they<00:01:13.500> slide<00:01:13.830> on<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.340> it'll<00:01:14.790> just

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
very simply they slide on and it'll just

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.780 
very simply they slide on and it'll just
add<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.180> little<00:01:15.330> bit<00:01:15.479> more<00:01:15.600> rigidity<00:01:16.520> so<00:01:17.520> if<00:01:17.670> we

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
add a little bit more rigidity so if we

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.420 
add a little bit more rigidity so if we
try<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.090> with<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.330> load<00:01:18.570> we've<00:01:19.259> got<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> an<00:01:20.100> empty

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
try it with a load we've got a an empty

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.480 
try it with a load we've got a an empty
plastic<00:01:20.670> pint<00:01:21.150> glass

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.990 

we'll<00:01:27.299> try<00:01:27.540> filling<00:01:27.810> out<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.049> bit<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.350> water

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.240 

we've<00:01:36.000> got<00:01:36.180> half<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:37.020> point<00:01:37.260> gone<00:01:37.710> as<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.950> point

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
we've got half a point gone as a point

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.850 
we've got half a point gone as a point
glass<00:01:38.520> that's<00:01:38.820> half<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.150> litre<00:01:39.440> water's<00:01:40.440> one

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
glass that's half a litre water's one

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.360 
glass that's half a litre water's one
kilo<00:01:41.430> per<00:01:41.760> liter<00:01:42.620> so<00:01:43.620> let's<00:01:44.040> say<00:01:44.130> we<00:01:44.220> get<00:01:44.310> a

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
kilo per liter so let's say we get a

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.510 
kilo per liter so let's say we get a
half<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.850> glass<00:01:45.630> full<00:01:46.110> that'll<00:01:46.920> be<00:01:47.010> a<00:01:47.040> quarter

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
half a glass full that'll be a quarter

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.640 
half a glass full that'll be a quarter
of<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.670> kilo<00:01:48.320> that's<00:01:49.320> holding<00:01:49.680> up<00:01:49.770> all<00:01:49.890> right

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
of a kilo that's holding up all right

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.280 
of a kilo that's holding up all right
quarter<00:01:52.650> of<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.740> kilo<00:01:53.720> that<00:01:54.720> does<00:01:54.930> nicely<00:01:55.350> okay
