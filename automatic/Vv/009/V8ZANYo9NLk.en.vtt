00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
stuff like that the way we're going to

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.080 
stuff like that the way we're going to
embed<00:00:20.430> our<00:00:20.580> code<00:00:21.270> into<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.810> website<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.039> also

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.070 

yeah<00:00:27.090> that's<00:00:27.300> pretty<00:00:27.510> much<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.810> we're<00:00:27.960> just

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
yeah that's pretty much it we're just

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.810 
yeah that's pretty much it we're just
going<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.230> create<00:00:28.470> some<00:00:28.650> simple<00:00:28.859> games<00:00:29.220> give

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
going to create some simple games give

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.820 
going to create some simple games give
you<00:00:29.970> guys<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.390> concepts<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:30.929> need<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.289> create

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
you guys the concepts you need to create

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.880 
you guys the concepts you need to create
games<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.489> general<00:00:32.880> for<00:00:33.059> Java<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:34.110> all<00:00:34.739> that

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
games in general for Java and all that

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.290 
games in general for Java and all that
good<00:00:35.040> stuff<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.700> first<00:00:35.940> thing<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.090> we're

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
good stuff the first thing that we're

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.370 
good stuff the first thing that we're
going<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.450> do<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.690> we're<00:00:36.809> going<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.989> create<00:00:37.320> a

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
going to do is we're going to create a

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.410 
going to do is we're going to create a
new<00:00:37.649> project<00:00:37.950> hopefully<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.760> guys<00:00:38.879> have<00:00:39.120> Java

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
new project hopefully you guys have Java

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.750 
new project hopefully you guys have Java
setup<00:00:39.930> already<00:00:40.110> if<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.590> don't<00:00:41.219> check<00:00:41.460> out<00:00:41.610> our

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
that we have on my bring back comm and

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.670 
that we have on my bring back comm and
get<00:00:50.969> get<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.449> know<00:00:51.570> Java<00:00:51.899> setup<00:00:52.379> all<00:00:52.530> that

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
get get you know Java setup all that

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.220 
get get you know Java setup all that

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
have that all set up we're just going to

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.540 
have that all set up we're just going to
create<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.610> new<00:00:56.820> project<00:00:58.129> we're<00:00:59.129> going<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.309> call

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
create a new project we're going to call

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.880 
create a new project we're going to call
this<00:00:59.730> web<00:01:00.090> game<00:01:00.770> and<00:01:02.750> well<00:01:03.750> BAM<00:01:03.960> there<00:01:04.619> we<00:01:04.739> go

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
this web game and well BAM there we go

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.320 
this web game and well BAM there we go
the<00:01:05.460> next<00:01:05.489> thing<00:01:05.790> we're<00:01:05.909> going<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.090> do<00:01:06.210> is

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the next thing we're going to do is

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.840 
the next thing we're going to do is
we're<00:01:06.450> going<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.600> create<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.930> new<00:01:07.350> class<00:01:07.850> call

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
we're going to create a new class call

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.990 
we're going to create a new class call
this<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.450> starting<00:01:10.320> point<00:01:10.619> if<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.670> guys<00:01:11.760> have

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
this a starting point if you guys have

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.280 
this a starting point if you guys have
followed<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> previous<00:01:12.780> series<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.200> we

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
followed the previous series that we

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.929 
followed the previous series that we
have<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.590> my<00:01:13.710> bring<00:01:13.950> back<00:01:14.130> which<00:01:14.729> hopefully

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
have on my bring back which hopefully

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.550 
have on my bring back which hopefully
you<00:01:15.090> guys<00:01:15.240> have<00:01:15.509> otherwise<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.200> might<00:01:16.380> be<00:01:16.530> a

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
you guys have otherwise this might be a

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.350 
you guys have otherwise this might be a
little<00:01:16.740> bit<00:01:16.950> fast-paced<00:01:17.520> but<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> first

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
little bit fast-paced but the first

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:26.840 
little bit fast-paced but the first
thing<00:01:18.509> about<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.780> web<00:01:25.220> applications<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.490> that

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
thing about a web applications of that

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.450 
thing about a web applications of that
we've<00:01:27.360> built<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.229> previous<00:01:28.439> series<00:01:28.920> all

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
we've built in the previous series all

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.010 
we've built in the previous series all
we're<00:01:29.759> going<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.909> do<00:01:30.150> for<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> web<00:01:30.750> application

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.420 

there<00:01:37.020> we<00:01:37.110> go<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.710> next<00:01:37.740> thing<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.100> we<00:01:38.280> got

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
there we go the next thing that we got

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.090 
there we go the next thing that we got
to<00:01:38.520> do<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:38.790> got<00:01:38.820> importer<00:01:39.540> applet<00:01:40.100> pretty

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
to do we got importer applet pretty

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.069 
to do we got importer applet pretty
simple<00:01:41.549> pretty<00:01:41.700> basic<00:01:41.939> we're<00:01:42.840> getting<00:01:43.020> a

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
simple pretty basic we're getting a

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.539 
simple pretty basic we're getting a
little<00:01:43.320> caution<00:01:43.770> thing<00:01:43.979> but<00:01:44.220> don't<00:01:44.430> worry

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
little caution thing but don't worry

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.100 
little caution thing but don't worry
about<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.299> now<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.450> we've<00:01:45.659> set<00:01:45.869> up<00:01:45.930> a

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
about that so now that we've set up a

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.710 
about that so now that we've set up a
Java<00:01:46.409> applet<00:01:46.740> what<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.790> an<00:01:47.939> applet<00:01:48.360> what<00:01:48.630> does

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
Java applet what is an applet what does

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.319 
Java applet what is an applet what does
it<00:01:48.869> do<00:01:49.310> basically<00:01:50.310> it's<00:01:50.549> just<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.880> smaller

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
it do basically it's just a smaller

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.200 
it do basically it's just a smaller
application<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:52.920> are<00:01:52.950> limited<00:01:53.579> on<00:01:53.700> func

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
application we are limited on func

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.969 
application we are limited on func
functions<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.960> features<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.619> stuff<00:01:55.799> like

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
functions and features and stuff like

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.940 
functions and features and stuff like
that<00:01:56.360> but<00:01:57.360> it's<00:01:57.600> pretty<00:01:57.899> easy<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.350> embed<00:01:58.469> in

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
that but it's pretty easy to embed in

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.280 
that but it's pretty easy to embed in
your<00:01:59.009> website<00:01:59.280> and<00:02:00.090> we<00:02:00.479> can<00:02:00.630> create<00:02:00.869> simple

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
your website and we can create simple

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.550 
your website and we can create simple
games<00:02:01.530> with<00:02:01.829> applets<00:02:02.360> so<00:02:03.360> let's<00:02:03.869> jump<00:02:04.200> into<00:02:04.530> it

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
games with applets so let's jump into it

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.560 
games with applets so let's jump into it
let's<00:02:04.890> see<00:02:05.040> how<00:02:05.219> they<00:02:05.369> work<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.880> first<00:02:06.540> thing

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
let's see how they work the first thing

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
let's see how they work the first thing
that<00:02:06.689> we're<00:02:06.869> going<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.049> do<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.320> we're<00:02:07.439> going<00:02:07.530> to

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
that we're going to do is we're going to

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.350 
that we're going to do is we're going to
go<00:02:07.740> within<00:02:08.069> our<00:02:08.190> brackets<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.910> our<00:02:09.000> starting

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
go within our brackets of our starting

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.360 
go within our brackets of our starting
point<00:02:09.629> class<00:02:09.929> we're<00:02:10.500> going<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.679> hit<00:02:10.830> control

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
point class we're going to hit control

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.600 
point class we're going to hit control
space

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
space

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.180 
space
and<00:02:12.970> we<00:02:13.480> have<00:02:13.690> some<00:02:14.020> methods<00:02:14.530> that<00:02:14.710> we<00:02:14.830> can<00:02:14.860> use

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
and we have some methods that we can use

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.740 
and we have some methods that we can use
and<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.670> first<00:02:15.850> method<00:02:16.240> we're<00:02:16.390> going<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.540> use

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
and the first method we're going to use

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.030 
and the first method we're going to use
is<00:02:16.960> called<00:02:16.990> initialize<00:02:17.830> ups<00:02:18.540> control<00:02:19.540> space

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
is called initialize ups control space

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.060 
is called initialize ups control space
in<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:22.660> that's<00:02:23.050> basically<00:02:23.740> what's<00:02:23.980> going

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
in it and that's basically what's going

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.830 
in it and that's basically what's going
to<00:02:24.130> be<00:02:24.220> called<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.520> first<00:02:24.880> time<00:02:25.180> this<00:02:25.330> applets

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
to be called the first time this applets

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.290 
to be called the first time this applets
ever<00:02:26.020> been<00:02:26.230> browsed<00:02:26.560> or<00:02:27.250> called<00:02:27.790> upon<00:02:28.060> so

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
ever been browsed or called upon so

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.630 
ever been browsed or called upon so
we're<00:02:28.420> just<00:02:28.450> going<00:02:28.660> to<00:02:28.750> hit<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:29.310> BAM<00:02:30.310> we<00:02:30.610> got

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
we're just going to hit that BAM we got

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.490 
we're just going to hit that BAM we got
that<00:02:30.970> set<00:02:31.210> up<00:02:31.240> and<00:02:31.690> we'll<00:02:31.900> just<00:02:32.050> kind<00:02:32.230> of<00:02:32.320> go<00:02:32.380> in

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
that set up and we'll just kind of go in

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.710 
that set up and we'll just kind of go in
the<00:02:32.710> order<00:02:32.860> of<00:02:33.130> how<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.340> applet<00:02:33.820> works<00:02:34.030> so<00:02:34.630> the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
the order of how the applet works so the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.120 
the order of how the applet works so the
next<00:02:34.840> thing<00:02:34.990> we're<00:02:35.200> going<00:02:35.320> to<00:02:35.440> create<00:02:35.920> is

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
next thing we're going to create is

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.220 
next thing we're going to create is
called<00:02:36.370> start<00:02:36.880> alright<00:02:37.570> so<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.900> difference

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
called start alright so the difference

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.410 
called start alright so the difference
between<00:02:38.290> start<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.160> initialize<00:02:40.120> is

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
between start and initialize is

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.690 
between start and initialize is
initialize<00:02:41.380> gets<00:02:41.680> called<00:02:41.890> once<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.490> very

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
initialize gets called once the very

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.760 
initialize gets called once the very
first<00:02:42.940> time<00:02:43.210> you<00:02:43.690> know<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:43.870> stumble<00:02:44.650> upon

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
first time you know you stumble upon

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.580 
first time you know you stumble upon
this<00:02:45.070> applet<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:45.820> then<00:02:46.390> after<00:02:47.050> it<00:02:47.170> calls<00:02:47.380> the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
this applet and then after it calls the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.290 
this applet and then after it calls the
initialize<00:02:48.100> method<00:02:48.130> it's<00:02:48.790> going<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:49.000> call<00:02:49.180> the

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
initialize method it's going to call the

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.030 
initialize method it's going to call the
start<00:02:49.570> method<00:02:49.720> so<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.440> start<00:02:50.680> method<00:02:50.830> is

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
start method so the start method is

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.350 
start method so the start method is
always<00:02:51.370> going<00:02:51.490> to<00:02:51.550> be<00:02:51.640> called<00:02:51.940> we're<00:02:52.150> going<00:02:52.270> to

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
always going to be called we're going to

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.300 
always going to be called we're going to
be<00:02:52.450> doing<00:02:52.630> setting<00:02:53.410> up<00:02:53.620> some<00:02:53.800> stuff<00:02:54.070> within

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
be doing setting up some stuff within

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.949 
be doing setting up some stuff within
our<00:02:54.520> start<00:02:54.790> method<00:02:55.090> like<00:02:55.209> our<00:02:55.390> thread<00:02:55.750> that

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
our start method like our thread that

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.480 
our start method like our thread that
we're<00:02:56.080> going<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.230> be<00:02:56.350> using<00:02:56.560> for<00:02:56.709> a<00:02:56.860> game<00:02:57.070> all

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
we're going to be using for a game all

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.820 
we're going to be using for a game all
that<00:02:57.670> stuff<00:02:57.910> so<00:02:58.120> this<00:02:58.840> that's<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.410> difference

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
that stuff so this that's the difference

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.370 
that stuff so this that's the difference
between<00:02:59.920> those<00:03:00.370> two<00:03:00.750> again<00:03:01.750> we<00:03:01.930> don't<00:03:02.050> have<00:03:02.170> to

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
between those two again we don't have to

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.470 
between those two again we don't have to
put<00:03:02.740> all<00:03:02.890> these<00:03:03.070> methods<00:03:03.490> in<00:03:03.610> there<00:03:03.820> but<00:03:04.030> most

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
put all these methods in there but most

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.420 
put all these methods in there but most
likely<00:03:04.840> what<00:03:05.020> we<00:03:05.290> want<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.680> start<00:03:05.980> method<00:03:06.310> at

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
likely what we want the start method at

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.310 
likely what we want the start method at
least<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:07.060> then<00:03:07.630> we<00:03:07.810> have<00:03:07.990> some<00:03:08.200> other

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
least and then we have some other

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.690 
least and then we have some other
methods<00:03:08.709> that<00:03:08.770> we<00:03:08.920> can<00:03:09.040> throw<00:03:09.220> in<00:03:09.370> there<00:03:09.490> like

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
methods that we can throw in there like

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.250 
methods that we can throw in there like
stop<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:12.640> hit<00:03:12.820> that<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:13.390> then<00:03:13.570> also<00:03:13.870> again

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
stop and hit that and then also again

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.449 
stop and hit that and then also again
control<00:03:14.800> space<00:03:15.100> for<00:03:15.400> these<00:03:15.750> destroy<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:17.459> if

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
control space for these destroy and if

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.070 
control space for these destroy and if
you<00:03:18.519> guys<00:03:18.670> fold<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.180> Android<00:03:19.570> series<00:03:19.900> these

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
you guys fold the Android series these

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.520 
you guys fold the Android series these
are<00:03:20.230> kind<00:03:20.410> of<00:03:20.470> familiar<00:03:21.239> but<00:03:22.239> if<00:03:22.959> you<00:03:23.230> haven't

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
are kind of familiar but if you haven't

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.140 
are kind of familiar but if you haven't
that's<00:03:23.620> cool<00:03:23.890> and<00:03:24.370> then<00:03:24.519> the<00:03:24.640> last<00:03:24.790> one<00:03:25.000> we're

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
that's cool and then the last one we're

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.070 
that's cool and then the last one we're
going<00:03:25.239> to<00:03:25.300> do<00:03:25.480> is<00:03:25.630> we're<00:03:25.780> going<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:25.930> hit

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
going to do is we're going to hit

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.660 
going to do is we're going to hit
control<00:03:26.470> space<00:03:26.830> and<00:03:27.160> we're<00:03:27.310> going<00:03:27.430> to<00:03:27.489> say

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
control space and we're going to say

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.850 
control space and we're going to say
paint<00:03:28.090> this<00:03:28.720> is<00:03:28.900> going<00:03:29.080> to<00:03:29.140> paint<00:03:29.380> all<00:03:29.590> of<00:03:29.620> our

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
paint this is going to paint all of our

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.820 
paint this is going to paint all of our

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
graphics - or applet that we're going to

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.220 
graphics - or applet that we're going to
be<00:03:32.920> using<00:03:33.160> I<00:03:33.580> don't<00:03:34.360> know<00:03:34.450> exactly<00:03:34.540> what<00:03:35.050> game

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
be using I don't know exactly what game

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.420 
be using I don't know exactly what game
we're<00:03:35.410> creating<00:03:35.739> yet<00:03:35.890> but<00:03:36.130> if<00:03:36.220> we<00:03:36.340> have

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
we're creating yet but if we have

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.100 
we're creating yet but if we have
sprites<00:03:36.820> we<00:03:37.120> want<00:03:37.330> to<00:03:37.390> use<00:03:37.600> it<00:03:37.750> within<00:03:37.900> the

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
sprites we want to use it within the

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.900 
sprites we want to use it within the
paint<00:03:38.320> method<00:03:38.500> so<00:03:39.010> again<00:03:39.190> if<00:03:39.280> this<00:03:39.459> looks

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
paint method so again if this looks

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.540 
paint method so again if this looks
confusing<00:03:40.450> to<00:03:40.630> you<00:03:40.720> guys<00:03:41.310> don't<00:03:42.310> worry<00:03:42.459> about

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
confusing to you guys don't worry about

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.820 
confusing to you guys don't worry about
these<00:03:42.790> super<00:03:43.090> methods<00:03:43.630> we<00:03:44.410> haven't<00:03:44.620> really

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
these super methods we haven't really

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.590 
these super methods we haven't really
talked<00:03:45.070> about<00:03:45.190> those<00:03:45.489> too<00:03:45.760> much<00:03:45.970> I<00:03:46.180> don't

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
talked about those too much I don't

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.110 
talked about those too much I don't
think<00:03:46.810> in<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.410> last<00:03:47.590> tutorial<00:03:47.920> series<00:03:48.400> we<00:03:49.030> can

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
think in the last tutorial series we can

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.960 
think in the last tutorial series we can
just<00:03:49.330> delete<00:03:49.570> those<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:50.140> and<00:03:50.980> there<00:03:51.550> we<00:03:51.670> go<00:03:51.790> we

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
just delete those and and there we go we

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.850 
just delete those and and there we go we
basically<00:03:52.330> have<00:03:52.660> our<00:03:52.840> web<00:03:52.989> app<00:03:53.230> let's<00:03:53.530> set<00:03:53.830> up

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
basically have our web app let's set up

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.250 
basically have our web app let's set up
and<00:03:54.250> in<00:03:54.910> the<00:03:55.300> next<00:03:55.540> tutorial<00:03:55.959> we're<00:03:56.080> going<00:03:56.200> to

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
and in the next tutorial we're going to

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.130 
and in the next tutorial we're going to
start<00:03:56.590> coding<00:03:57.100> a<00:03:57.400> little<00:03:57.670> bit<00:03:57.820> and<00:03:58.090> setting<00:03:59.019> up

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
start coding a little bit and setting up

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.600 
start coding a little bit and setting up
some<00:03:59.320> of<00:03:59.410> these<00:03:59.470> methods<00:03:59.920> what<00:04:00.160> we<00:04:00.250> want<00:04:00.430> them

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
some of these methods what we want them

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.729 
some of these methods what we want them
to<00:04:00.730> do<00:04:00.880> and<00:04:01.209> all<00:04:01.840> that<00:04:02.019> stuff<00:04:02.290> so<00:04:02.350> make<00:04:02.709> sure

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
to do and all that stuff so make sure

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.860 
to do and all that stuff so make sure
you<00:04:02.920> check<00:04:03.130> it<00:04:03.280> out<00:04:03.430> but<00:04:04.000> this<00:04:04.090> is<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.420> basic

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
you check it out but this is the basic

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:14.000 
you check it out but this is the basic
framework<00:04:05.260> of<00:04:06.480> our<00:04:07.480> web<00:04:07.780> application<00:04:08.650> or<00:04:08.920> web

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.219 

applicants<00:04:15.090> or<00:04:16.090> whatever<00:04:16.450> the<00:04:16.810> initialize

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
applicants or whatever the initialize

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.710 
applicants or whatever the initialize
method<00:04:17.260> gets<00:04:17.859> called<00:04:17.919> the<00:04:18.669> first<00:04:18.880> time<00:04:19.150> you

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
method gets called the first time you

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.230 
method gets called the first time you
view<00:04:20.019> applet<00:04:20.560> and<00:04:21.220> then<00:04:21.669> it<00:04:21.820> will<00:04:21.940> call<00:04:22.120> the

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
view applet and then it will call the

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.750 
view applet and then it will call the
start<00:04:22.510> start<00:04:23.080> method<00:04:23.440> here<00:04:23.830> whatever<00:04:24.520> we<00:04:24.669> have

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
start start method here whatever we have

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.620 
start start method here whatever we have
within<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.300> start

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
within the start

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.390 
within the start
methods<00:04:25.900> can<00:04:26.140> be<00:04:26.200> like<00:04:26.350> well<00:04:26.530> yeah<00:04:26.830> okay<00:04:27.160> I<00:04:27.190> can

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
methods can be like well yeah okay I can

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.460 
methods can be like well yeah okay I can
do<00:04:27.520> that<00:04:27.550> that's<00:04:27.910> cool<00:04:28.030> blah<00:04:28.330> blah<00:04:28.510> blah<00:04:28.720> setup

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
do that that's cool blah blah blah setup

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.310 
do that that's cool blah blah blah setup
or<00:04:29.620> game<00:04:29.830> all<00:04:30.250> that<00:04:30.310> stuff<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.450> then<00:04:31.840> you<00:04:32.290> know

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
or game all that stuff and then you know

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.260 
or game all that stuff and then you know
these<00:04:32.590> other<00:04:32.800> methods<00:04:32.980> like<00:04:33.340> stop<00:04:33.790> this<00:04:34.090> is

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
these other methods like stop this is

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.660 
these other methods like stop this is
when<00:04:34.420> our<00:04:34.630> applet<00:04:35.230> stops<00:04:35.650> basically<00:04:36.340> and

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
when our applet stops basically and

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.180 
when our applet stops basically and
destroy<00:04:37.570> when<00:04:37.900> we<00:04:38.020> destroy<00:04:38.410> our<00:04:38.560> applet<00:04:38.980> if<00:04:39.070> we

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
destroy when we destroy our applet if we

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.640 
destroy when we destroy our applet if we
want<00:04:39.370> to<00:04:39.460> save<00:04:39.700> some<00:04:39.730> data<00:04:40.090> from<00:04:40.450> our<00:04:40.600> game<00:04:40.810> we

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
want to save some data from our game we

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.350 
want to save some data from our game we
can<00:04:41.800> do<00:04:41.890> it<00:04:41.980> within<00:04:42.100> the<00:04:42.250> destroy<00:04:42.760> or<00:04:43.120> within

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
can do it within the destroy or within

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.020 
can do it within the destroy or within
the<00:04:43.600> stop<00:04:43.900> and<00:04:44.890> then<00:04:45.010> the<00:04:45.190> paint<00:04:45.520> is<00:04:45.730> going<00:04:45.970> to

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
the stop and then the paint is going to

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.970 
the stop and then the paint is going to
paint<00:04:46.300> or<00:04:46.390> graphics<00:04:46.840> to<00:04:47.110> or<00:04:47.260> application

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
paint or graphics to or application

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.550 
paint or graphics to or application
paint<00:04:48.820> to<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:49.300> canvas<00:04:49.330> if<00:04:49.960> you<00:04:50.050> guys<00:04:50.170> watched

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560
