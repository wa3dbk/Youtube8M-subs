00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:08.540 

all<00:00:03.929> right<00:00:04.140> so<00:00:05.450> continuing<00:00:06.450> here<00:00:07.550> this

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
all right so continuing here this

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.640 
all right so continuing here this
lecture<00:00:08.880> almost<00:00:09.240> seems<00:00:09.480> like<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:10.019> lecture<00:00:10.500> and

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
lecture almost seems like a lecture and

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.919 
lecture almost seems like a lecture and
as<00:00:10.769> CID<00:00:11.099> as<00:00:11.460> compared<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.480> t-cell<00:00:12.780> and

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
as CID as compared to the t-cell and

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.990 
as CID as compared to the t-cell and
b-cell<00:00:13.519> t-cell<00:00:14.519> receptors<00:00:14.910> and

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
b-cell t-cell receptors and

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.160 
b-cell t-cell receptors and
immunoglobulin<00:00:15.509> but<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.020> very

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
immunoglobulin but this is very

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.820 
immunoglobulin but this is very
important<00:00:16.529> thing

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
important thing

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.800 
important thing
understanding<00:00:17.670> pathology<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:18.390> level<00:00:18.690> is

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
understanding pathology to this level is

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.140 
understanding pathology to this level is
a<00:00:18.840> very<00:00:18.960> interesting<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.070> important<00:00:20.460> thing

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
a very interesting and important thing

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.500 
a very interesting and important thing
to<00:00:21.270> do

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
to do

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.080 
to do
alright<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.109> now<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.949> recombinase<00:00:23.550> has

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
alright so now the recombinase has

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.599 
alright so now the recombinase has
picked<00:00:24.330> up<00:00:24.449> v1<00:00:24.900> from<00:00:25.230> this<00:00:25.380> pool<00:00:25.650> has<00:00:26.279> picked

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
picked up v1 from this pool has picked

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.150 
picked up v1 from this pool has picked
up<00:00:26.730> d3<00:00:27.330> from<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.840> pool<00:00:28.109> remember<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.980> were<00:00:29.130> a

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
up d3 from this pool remember you were a

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.859 
up d3 from this pool remember you were a
recombinant<00:00:29.760> with<00:00:29.970> me<00:00:30.119> as<00:00:30.240> well<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.750> were

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
recombinant with me as well so you were

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.810 
recombinant with me as well so you were
picking<00:00:31.109> up<00:00:31.320> something<00:00:31.619> else<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:32.399> maybe<00:00:32.610> you

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
picking up something else so maybe you

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.380 
picking up something else so maybe you
picked<00:00:33.059> up<00:00:33.210> D<00:00:33.390> 1<00:00:33.600> or<00:00:33.750> 2<00:00:33.930> or<00:00:33.960> D<00:00:34.290> 20<00:00:34.940> the<00:00:35.940> J<00:00:36.120> chain

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
picked up D 1 or 2 or D 20 the J chain

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.900 
picked up D 1 or 2 or D 20 the J chain
came<00:00:36.630> here<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.320> J<00:00:37.649> gene<00:00:37.680> pool<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.399> then

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
came here so the J gene pool and then

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.000 
came here so the J gene pool and then
the<00:00:39.120> constant<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.170> picked<00:00:40.379> up<00:00:40.500> one<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.860> them

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
the constant we picked up one of them

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.619 
the constant we picked up one of them
although<00:00:41.520> when<00:00:42.059> we<00:00:42.149> will<00:00:42.300> do<00:00:42.480> the

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
although when we will do the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:43.970 
although when we will do the
immunoglobulin<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.469> will<00:00:43.559> see<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
immunoglobulin you will see that the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.229 
immunoglobulin you will see that the
very<00:00:44.129> first<00:00:44.430> time<00:00:44.579> when<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.850> constant

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
very first time when the constant

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.930 
very first time when the constant
regions<00:00:45.570> are<00:00:45.690> picked<00:00:45.899> up<00:00:46.079> there<00:00:46.829> are<00:00:47.039> mu<00:00:47.670> and

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
regions are picked up there are mu and

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.600 
regions are picked up there are mu and
Delta<00:00:48.390> both<00:00:48.690> are<00:00:48.899> picked<00:00:49.140> up<00:00:49.260> together<00:00:49.610> that

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
Delta both are picked up together that

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.959 
Delta both are picked up together that
is<00:00:50.850> why<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.809> very<00:00:52.110> first<00:00:52.620> time<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.250> b-cell

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
is why the very first time a b-cell

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.560 
is why the very first time a b-cell
encounters<00:00:54.570> an<00:00:54.719> infection<00:00:55.260> an<00:00:55.550> antigen<00:00:56.570> it

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
encounters an infection an antigen it

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.260 
encounters an infection an antigen it
actually<00:00:58.260> makes<00:00:58.530> m<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.160> D<00:00:59.460> both<00:01:01.309> M<00:01:02.309> goes<00:01:03.000> out

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
actually makes m and D both M goes out

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.320 
actually makes m and D both M goes out
in<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.930> blood<00:01:04.140> D<00:01:05.129> sticks<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.880> surface

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
in in the blood D sticks on the surface

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.190 
in in the blood D sticks on the surface
of<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.750> B<00:01:07.200> cell<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:08.100> if<00:01:08.340> somebody<00:01:08.880> says<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.990> a

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
of the B cell so if somebody says that a

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.910 
of the B cell so if somebody says that a
b-cell<00:01:10.830> cannot<00:01:11.700> express<00:01:12.210> more<00:01:12.930> than<00:01:13.170> one<00:01:13.500> type

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
b-cell cannot express more than one type

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.190 
b-cell cannot express more than one type
of<00:01:14.000> immunoglobulins<00:01:15.000> at<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.479> at<00:01:15.720> one<00:01:15.990> time

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
of immunoglobulins at this at one time

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.660 
of immunoglobulins at this at one time
that<00:01:16.890> somebody<00:01:17.580> would<00:01:17.759> be<00:01:17.880> wrong<00:01:18.650> why<00:01:19.670> the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
that somebody would be wrong why the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.240 
that somebody would be wrong why the
very<00:01:20.880> first<00:01:21.390> time<00:01:21.810> when<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> b-cell<00:01:22.890> becomes

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
very first time when a b-cell becomes

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.340 
very first time when a b-cell becomes
active<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.820> starts<00:01:24.119> making<00:01:24.350> immunoglobulins

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
active and starts making immunoglobulins

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.920 
active and starts making immunoglobulins
it<00:01:25.830> makes<00:01:26.159> M<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.820> D<00:01:27.530> and<00:01:29.180> then<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.479> would<00:01:30.780> do

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
it makes M and D and then it would do

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.840 
it makes M and D and then it would do
class<00:01:31.170> switching<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.860> from<00:01:32.070> n<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.549> would<00:01:32.700> go

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
class switching and from n it would go

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.359 
class switching and from n it would go
to<00:01:32.880> G<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.540> from<00:01:33.960> there<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.409> would<00:01:34.560> go<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.770> e<00:01:35.100> and

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
to G and from there it would go to e and

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.270 
to G and from there it would go to e and
then<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.820> but<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.380> beginning<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.920> can<00:01:38.070> make

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
then a but in the beginning it can make

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.910 
then a but in the beginning it can make
M<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.850> D<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.720> because<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.229> alternate

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
M and D and that is because of alternate

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.920 
M and D and that is because of alternate
splicing<00:01:41.189> we<00:01:41.909> will<00:01:42.000> talk<00:01:42.180> about<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.659> when<00:01:42.899> we

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
splicing we will talk about that when we

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.649 
splicing we will talk about that when we
will<00:01:43.140> go<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:44.270> immunoglobulins<00:01:45.360> so

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
will go to the immunoglobulins so

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.560 
will go to the immunoglobulins so
anyways<00:01:46.049> regardless<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.610> point<00:01:47.909> let<00:01:48.540> us

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
anyways regardless of that point let us

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.310 
anyways regardless of that point let us
say<00:01:48.659> we<00:01:48.840> got<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.229> muji<00:01:50.299> now<00:01:51.299> what<00:01:52.170> will

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
say we got in the muji now what will

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.020 
say we got in the muji now what will
happen<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.799> we'll<00:01:53.700> do<00:01:54.770> we'll<00:01:55.770> create<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.159> RNA

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
happen is we'll do we'll create the RNA

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.539 
happen is we'll do we'll create the RNA
from<00:01:57.210> here<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:58.320> we<00:01:58.409> will<00:01:58.500> make<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.680> messenger

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
from here so we will make a messenger

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.149 
from here so we will make a messenger
RNA<00:02:00.170> but<00:02:01.850> we<00:02:02.850> would<00:02:03.090> splice<00:02:03.479> off<00:02:03.840> all<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.950> J's

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
RNA but we would splice off all the J's

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.889 
RNA but we would splice off all the J's
and<00:02:05.189> we'll<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:05.670> keep<00:02:05.850> what<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.780> the

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
and we'll just keep what so the

variable region of light chain V and J

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.850

so<00:04:08.850> light<00:04:09.030> chain<00:04:09.240> is<00:04:09.390> lighter<00:04:09.690> it<00:04:10.470> is<00:04:10.590> smaller

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
so light chain is lighter it is smaller

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.920 
so light chain is lighter it is smaller
so<00:04:11.460> the<00:04:11.580> gene<00:04:11.790> pool<00:04:12.030> is<00:04:12.060> smaller<00:04:12.420> as<00:04:12.570> well<00:04:12.720> so

so the gene pool is smaller as well so

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.350

will<00:04:44.130> be<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:44.370> same<00:04:44.610> so<00:04:45.030> antigen<00:04:45.480> specificity

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
will be the same so antigen specificity

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.190

alternate<00:05:04.440> splicing<00:05:04.970> what<00:05:05.970> I<00:05:06.000> have<00:05:06.270> not

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
alternate splicing what I have not

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.260 
alternate splicing what I have not
covered<00:05:06.840> is<00:05:07.350> DNA

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
covered is DNA

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.750 
covered is DNA
rearrangement<00:05:09.140> for<00:05:10.010> class<00:05:10.280> switching

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
rearrangement for class switching

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.760 
rearrangement for class switching
because<00:05:11.300> this<00:05:11.690> is<00:05:11.840> really<00:05:12.140> not<00:05:12.320> a<00:05:12.380> lecture

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
because this is really not a lecture

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.010 
because this is really not a lecture
about<00:05:12.920> immunoglobulin<00:05:13.790> this<00:05:14.270> is<00:05:14.450> a<00:05:14.600> lecture

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
about immunoglobulin this is a lecture

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.530 
about immunoglobulin this is a lecture
to<00:05:15.170> figure<00:05:15.680> out<00:05:15.830> how<00:05:16.490> the<00:05:16.550> gene<00:05:17.030> pools<00:05:17.360> are

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
to figure out how the gene pools are

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.420 
to figure out how the gene pools are
used<00:05:17.870> to<00:05:18.530> create<00:05:19.100> this<00:05:19.430> molecule<00:05:19.940> I<00:05:21.310> wanted<00:05:22.310> to

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
used to create this molecule I wanted to

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.200 
used to create this molecule I wanted to
use<00:05:22.670> this<00:05:22.880> foundation<00:05:23.350> then<00:05:24.350> to<00:05:24.590> say<00:05:24.740> to<00:05:24.800> you

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
use this foundation then to say to you

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.870 
use this foundation then to say to you
that<00:05:26.210> this<00:05:26.450> is<00:05:26.600> the<00:05:26.720> same<00:05:26.960> mechanism<00:05:27.670> that<00:05:28.670> is

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
that this is the same mechanism that is

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.740 
that this is the same mechanism that is
used<00:05:29.180> to<00:05:29.960> create<00:05:30.140> the<00:05:30.350> t-cell<00:05:30.830> receptors<00:05:31.750> same

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
used to create the t-cell receptors same

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.020 
used to create the t-cell receptors same
mechanism<00:05:33.260> same<00:05:33.470> way<00:05:33.650> the<00:05:34.310> only<00:05:34.670> thing<00:05:34.880> is

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
mechanism same way the only thing is

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.660 
mechanism same way the only thing is
t-cell<00:05:35.720> receptor<00:05:36.110> does<00:05:36.260> not<00:05:36.440> have<00:05:36.710> the

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
t-cell receptor does not have the

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.050 
t-cell receptor does not have the
constant<00:05:38.330> gene<00:05:38.660> pool<00:05:39.460> which<00:05:40.460> can<00:05:40.640> make<00:05:40.820> these

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
constant gene pool which can make these

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.770 
constant gene pool which can make these
handles<00:05:42.100> rather<00:05:43.100> the<00:05:43.460> t-cells<00:05:43.940> constant<00:05:44.480> area

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
handles rather the t-cells constant area

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.250 
handles rather the t-cells constant area
is<00:05:44.990> only<00:05:45.590> going<00:05:46.040> to<00:05:46.100> be<00:05:46.220> a<00:05:46.460> very<00:05:47.090> small<00:05:47.480> peptide

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
is only going to be a very small peptide

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.920 
is only going to be a very small peptide
which<00:05:49.040> has<00:05:49.310> gotten<00:05:49.700> disulfide<00:05:50.240> bonds<00:05:50.630> with<00:05:50.780> it

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
which has gotten disulfide bonds with it

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.870 
which has gotten disulfide bonds with it
and<00:05:51.140> that<00:05:51.620> helps<00:05:51.800> it<00:05:52.040> anchor<00:05:52.340> into<00:05:52.610> the<00:05:52.700> cell

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
and that helps it anchor into the cell

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.340 
and that helps it anchor into the cell
so<00:05:53.330> if<00:05:53.420> we<00:05:53.540> come<00:05:53.720> back<00:05:53.750> here<00:05:54.490> VD<00:05:55.490> and<00:05:55.730> J<00:05:56.000> are

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
so if we come back here VD and J are

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.250 
so if we come back here VD and J are
active<00:05:57.350> to<00:05:57.980> make<00:05:58.010> T<00:05:58.370> cell<00:05:58.580> receptor<00:05:59.000> same<00:05:59.660> like

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
active to make T cell receptor same like

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.560 
active to make T cell receptor same like
immunoglobulin<00:06:01.010> constant<00:06:01.880> region<00:06:02.180> makes<00:06:02.390> a

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
immunoglobulin constant region makes a

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.540 
immunoglobulin constant region makes a
slightly<00:06:02.870> different<00:06:03.350> structure<00:06:03.590> so<00:06:04.190> here<00:06:04.400> is

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
slightly different structure so here is

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.700 
slightly different structure so here is
how<00:06:04.730> the<00:06:04.790> t-cell<00:06:05.210> receptor<00:06:05.630> is<00:06:06.110> so<00:06:06.410> this<00:06:06.560> is

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
how the t-cell receptor is so this is

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.200 
how the t-cell receptor is so this is
the<00:06:06.800> T<00:06:06.950> cell<00:06:08.170> the<00:06:09.170> T<00:06:09.350> cell<00:06:09.590> is<00:06:09.800> a<00:06:09.880> receptor<00:06:10.880> is<00:06:11.180> a

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
the T cell the T cell is a receptor is a

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.610 
the T cell the T cell is a receptor is a
dimeric<00:06:11.840> protein<00:06:12.490> with<00:06:13.490> V<00:06:14.330> and<00:06:14.620> constant

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
dimeric protein with V and constant

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.540 
dimeric protein with V and constant
regions<00:06:16.240> it<00:06:17.240> has<00:06:17.510> alpha<00:06:17.960> beta<00:06:18.260> chains<00:06:18.710> these

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
regions it has alpha beta chains these

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.090 
regions it has alpha beta chains these
dimeric<00:06:20.180> proteins<00:06:20.540> have<00:06:20.780> gotten<00:06:21.140> this<00:06:21.800> is<00:06:22.010> the

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.100 
dimeric proteins have gotten this is the

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.700 
dimeric proteins have gotten this is the
constant<00:06:22.490> part<00:06:22.700> so<00:06:23.540> this<00:06:23.720> constant<00:06:24.200> part<00:06:24.440> has

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
constant part so this constant part has

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.490 
constant part so this constant part has
nothing<00:06:25.270> no<00:06:26.270> functional<00:06:26.930> or<00:06:27.080> structural

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
nothing no functional or structural

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.710 
nothing no functional or structural
resemblance<00:06:27.860> to<00:06:28.640> the<00:06:28.790> constant<00:06:29.240> part<00:06:29.450> of<00:06:29.540> an

resemblance to the constant part of an

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:35.470 
resemblance to the constant part of an
immunoglobulin<00:06:31.810> now<00:06:33.760> disulfide<00:06:34.760> bonds<00:06:35.150> here

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:35.480 
immunoglobulin now disulfide bonds here

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:43.590 
immunoglobulin now disulfide bonds here
what<00:06:35.960> else<00:06:38.410> one<00:06:39.410> more<00:06:39.590> thing<00:06:39.800> that<00:06:40.030> these

chains or segments have gotten

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.970

carbohydrates<00:06:47.600> attached<00:06:47.900> to<00:06:48.170> them<00:06:48.380> so<00:06:48.830> they

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:48.980 
carbohydrates attached to them so they

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.430 
carbohydrates attached to them so they
have<00:06:49.100> gotten<00:06:49.510> these<00:06:50.510> are<00:06:50.720> glycoproteins

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
have gotten these are glycoproteins

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.160 
have gotten these are glycoproteins
instead<00:06:51.770> of<00:06:51.890> just<00:06:52.490> simple<00:06:52.850> proteins<00:06:53.240> so<00:06:53.960> that

instead of just simple proteins so that

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.190 
instead of just simple proteins so that
is<00:06:54.320> what<00:06:54.470> is<00:06:54.590> a<00:06:54.620> t-cell<00:06:55.010> receptor<00:06:55.540> and<00:06:56.540> that<00:06:57.050> is
