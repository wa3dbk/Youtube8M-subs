00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hello we all make this video 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.009
 fast fast because I care 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.589
 particularly talk about this 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.240
 topic is definitely you will have seen 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.090
 all of you in the last ten 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.940
 fifteen days different videos on you 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.550
 tube concerning one piece video from 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.439
 part of different youtuber also 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.720
 quite famous the raw brands of 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.269
 appoint to then not be charged with 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.640
 exploit their hunger for their success 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.529
 earn views so much 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.980
 I can assure you that this is the last one 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.690
 of different problems and videos both for 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.410
 regarding the way they are 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:41.700
 been mounted both for the theme they go 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.980
 to treat both for the purpose and video 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.289
 which however hide underneath 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.840
 the only big common thread that them 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.360
 unites and above all video that has me 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.969
 done with a very important question 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.710
 in my opinion because it goes a bit to finish 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.410
 what junior world on this channel 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.010
 and more generally on youtube 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.199
 or what is for me one piece 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.820
 obviously I don't want to go to trouble 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.159
 trani characters below the numbers of 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.439
 sales and my author of all this 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.890
 the question line is quite different 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:17.040
 wondering what the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.680
 one piece manga what they represent me 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.759
 these volumes and the answers in my opinion 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.759
 it's very simple 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.340
 one piece is the reason why I now 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.729
 I'm here for which I'm doing now 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.549
 this video and for which you had been 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.310
 looking at a very trivial answer and a 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.049
 the first look though I can assure you 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.780
 which hides a much more meaning 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.960
 we can horse vast horse 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.790
 boast of one of the largest communities e 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.750
 more cohesive than the entire panorama of 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.299
 youtube 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.159
 and this because it is made up of boys 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.960
 like me who want to get in 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.730
 game to put one's own leverage into play 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.410
 own passions to share them 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.800
 dream of comparing your own 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:01.170
 opinions and the problem is when this 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.420
 spirit in this passion starts a little 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.460
 to fail when you begin to do 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.280
 video not so much for pleasure 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.650
 personal but why these little girl who 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.690
 the public will like it and sincerely me 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.580
 I ask why we need to 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.270
 realize in this type of video 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.040
 make views earn by like 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.060
 get some change from the 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.880
 partnership 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.740
 I honestly don't know but I can 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.620
 speak only from personal experience 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.450
 I can't express it further maybe 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.520
 he is right who makes this type of video and 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.110
 need your eyes to make videos 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.450
 simply for passion 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.000
 what I mean that as well as 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.700
 I think it's useless to make a video with 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.040
 the sole purpose of criticizing another from 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.680
 since there are special areas if up 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.830
 youtube three comments that the methods 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.860
 alternative like emails like the 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.070
 contact youtube and on facebook ad 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.790
 example for obviously when it comes 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:02.220
 of constructive criticism and I do not see the 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.050
 need to make a video about it e 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.600
 believe even more useful to have to 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.940
 redo your own video because when 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.489
 previous is not particularly 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.930
 liked the public and I know it's a video 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.110
 a bit antithetical what I'm doing 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.330
 I am going to criticize a 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.310
 certain type of video and then I do one 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.709
 just of that kind of course vi 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.260
 I can assure you that I hope this is it 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.900
 before and the last time i do this 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.350
 kind of video I'm very sorry for 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.310
 having spent my minutes not giving this 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.540
 video your minutes to watch it 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.219
 really the only thing I can tell you 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.799
 is the one I already wrote in the title 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:44.200
 or that one piece is first of all 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:47.549
 a passion not a competition for those who make videos 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.549
 more beautiful thanks
