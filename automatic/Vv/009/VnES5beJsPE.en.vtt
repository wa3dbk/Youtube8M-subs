00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:08.220
 Good day to all, I recently 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.860
 filmed a tourist video review 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.040
 camping set for cooking 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.910
 on an open fire 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:22.039
 but today in the proposal this topic 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:25.920
 will go talk about a thermos 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.630
 food thermos this thermos is made 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.140
 by the firm 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:33.899
 flamberge of 1500 milliliters 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:39.149
 also have a similar thermos capacity of 1200 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:42.600
 milliliters and there are also even less 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.770
 thermoses I do not remember what volume but there 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.190
 one capacity in this this format consists 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.420
 of the three tanks and the one that is slightly less 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.180
 of the two bones of him now explain in 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:03.750
 the principle for what this thermos was 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:05.309
 Acquired there are situations when 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.850
 for some reason you can't afford 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.850
 cook food on an open fire 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:19.439
 for example went to fishing lead 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:22.530
 active fishing you just have no time 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.450
 make a fire there either sit 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.040
 engage in cooking in 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.200
 danger to deliver tormoz 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:34.770
 and there to dine or dine and those that were 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.689
 prepared in advance for example if you 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.010
 tourist 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:45.160
 send someone a sightseeing tour 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:49.300
 some historical places here and 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.010
 accordingly for some reason so 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.110
 how are you some kind of reserved 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:57.990
 zone or somewhere you can't just 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:02.350
 sit down to make a fire that is you can 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.180
 eat either in the cafeteria 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.600
 any 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.850
 either again pre-cooked 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.010
 food stored in a thermos 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:18.190
 or after a certain period 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:20.800
 time will stay hot too 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.390
 Here, for example, tomorrow the girl is going 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:28.690
 skiing also in order to save 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:35.560
 funds so as not to overpay huge 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:39.910
 the amount for food on the mountain is exactly the same 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:43.000
 ride and go down to the car 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:47.790
 changed clothes and quietly also hot 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.550
 someone's food broth and something ate 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:57.720
 thus saved so much 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:03:01.390
 amount but now let's go to the thermos 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.870
 This thermos is made of stainless 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.870
 become 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:14.650
 the handle is made with a clasp on 2 clicked 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:25.989
 we receive a cover a cover plastic and 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:32.230
 inside we have 3 capacity 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:33.680
 and made of plastic judging by 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:40.299
 hieroglyphs 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.299
 probably whether he will be seen here 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:51.430
 produced in china it's no wonder on 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:55.609
 1 container with a regular lid 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.709
 without sealing that is serves for 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:02.739
 some 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.739
 non-bursting liquids either this 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:10.720
 the next capacity is also 300 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:16.659
 milliliters but implied already for 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:21.260
 liquid food lid on her thread on 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:24.220
 threaded and beyond that here in the groove 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:28.900
 there is a sealing ring 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:34.870
 there is also a valve here on the cap 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.870
 probably for some purpose certain 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:49.640
 3 container we have a volume of 750 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:51.650
 milliliters method of locking another too 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:56.600
 different on the latch 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:05:01.990
 cranked otchelknul opened seal 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:05.770
 no there is so I for him that for 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.770
 second course container 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:16.910
 This thermos cost about 15 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:20.480
 dollars well there for stock net price 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:25.220
 If not for the stock, then this is about 20 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:27.310
 dollars that's how it cost me 15 in 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.260
