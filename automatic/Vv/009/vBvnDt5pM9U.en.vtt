 special that is alberto del canal 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:16.680
 we come with a taste that is called the 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:20.199
 sacrifice of the book 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.090
 and this one consists of game are four 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.950
 questions are going to be two in this channel of 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.650
 Mariana and the others are going to be in my 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.460
 channel because we have no other idea of 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.460
 make another attack 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.150
 well then the subject is a field 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.610
 calypso and are several situations 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.130
 extreme equilibrium would you choose for those 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.410
 situations the first scenario is that 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.450
 a very exciting book let's start 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.760
 with an apocalypse of zombies 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.250
 let's say you're in a bookstore and if 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.380
 just watching the books and suddenly 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.780
 for there is a zombie attack like 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.079
 ads you see on television saying 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.090
 that military forces have 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.370
 discovered that the only weakness of 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.440
 the zombies is a super book 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.480
 exciting 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.260
 and that the book that everyone says 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.000
 that is amazing wonderful and so 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.270
 you studied and you would be willing to 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.200
 give it to the zombies to defend yourself from 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.430
 this universe and super exciting 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.430
 you have one in mind 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:32.460
 of this 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:34.680
 well no book 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.960
 unless you have not read it but not 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.260
 it catches your attention because I do not think 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.260
 would be 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:54.610
 read but I would not criticize what I know 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.610
 makes it would be 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.560
 I think he would be a psychoanalyst because 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.900
 Although it is a good book because 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.420
 I admit it is a good book I like it 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:11.820
 many people are surprised when I say 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.880
 the second question says a sequel 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.040
 let's say you're in the room like that 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.680
 when cutting the hair and so I do not know by 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.200
 what is suddenly wow there is like that one 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.210
 just started with a lot of water that is 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.520
 which state after using as 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:31.950
 an umbrella an umbrella for 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.300
 protect yourself time use since 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.580
 is the first one that occurs to me right now 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.860
 would be growing the second which is 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:43.370
 because I despair a lot 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:48.480
 protagonist and it's easy that is not 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.520
 easy the book to direct it and I just asked 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.200
 to the chronicles of narnia the lion the 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.090
 witch and the wardrobe because then it is that 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:07.340
 is the sequel to the first book that 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:09.290
 flames but the father and although it is for the 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.760
 fact that there was in the first book 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.680
 explain everything that happened today because there are 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.720
 a break or because the witch is how she is and 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.920
 everything and I decide that equal and the 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.830
 second book and today to see the rest 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.480
 questions have to click here on 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.190
 the cade rebolledo so that they go to his 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.190
 channel and go after the video 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:42.140
 but then this book that this book 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.140
 what to see 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.110
