00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.580
 yes, that was not the first time that one 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.630
 have not worked together for 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.220
 most people are one thing 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.810
 terrible imagination you are not only 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.289
 married one still works 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.000
 together 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.279
 but we love to do that 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.689
 we argue a lot , we laugh 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:34.140
 and there are neighbors of the feelings 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.989
 we argue we deny it 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.829
 It's funny and it's pretty mummy too 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.239
 exhausting 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.520
 Something always comes at the end 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.590
 It's an adventure 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.460
 having become happy end there is this 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.460
 book I'm glad 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.460
 we actually got it because we 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.260
 even both of us were surprised that we 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.000
 now 20 years there are married 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.199
 we could actually earlier legs 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.789
 I do not think so 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.510
 especially I think I could 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.199
 does not matter 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.600
 That was the one reason we watched 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.909
 Of course, people like crazy 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.260
 Marriage and ask us why there is 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.990
 no economic reason no 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.390
 social no religious reason it needs 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.009
 Something the people are still at this 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.710
 put before them as though on 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.860
 failed that was one for me 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.330
 challenge that to clarify or 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.070
 The second reason was that me 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.259
 After 15 years, I am now always 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.930
 alone on reading trip was traveling with 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.520
 I simply wanted to enjoy my novels 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:41.670
 a reading trip together with my husband 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:43.800
 Do what it is not the book 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.240
 is a counselor because that's what we want 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.100
 not really pretend to other people 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.870
 to give advice it is with 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.450
 safety a very entertaining book 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.250
 you will often be able to smile often 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.170
 You will become married people 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.510
 being able to recognize being a human 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.750
 the marry wants to find something 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.760
 it could be interesting it is more yes 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.009
 something like an inventory so 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.350
 what happened in a while in the past 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.670
 actually no one has to marry anymore and 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.310
 but still it is 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.320
 Many people do and what the marriage before 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.840
 means people and what they are from her 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.239
 expect and the book is a very 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.510
 varied mix of the 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:26.310
 For example , you can find interviews with you 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:28.370
 a beloved an adulterer and also 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.650
 a few therapists from subjective 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.720
 scenes in a marriage and I also tell in 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.430
 some things about my wife you 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.430
 maybe always wanted to know 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.610
 let me think 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:54.420
 i think i would be my wife 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.190
 much rather marry than 22 years ago 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.620
 but now I do not know what the 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.620
 picture and she has really proven herself
