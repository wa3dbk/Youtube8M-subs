00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.920 
a great application just to do it as you
know<00:06:33.440> it's<00:06:34.070> a<00:06:34.130> general<00:06:34.460> stroke<00:06:34.790> from<00:06:35.360> from<00:06:35.750> top

know it's a general stroke from from top
to<00:06:35.960> bottom<00:06:36.110> but<00:06:36.740> you<00:06:36.830> can<00:06:36.980> also<00:06:37.280> move<00:06:37.580> the<00:06:37.760> wand

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:41.570 
from left to right it's so curly and

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.590 
from left to right it's so curly and
that<00:06:41.690> allows<00:06:41.990> the<00:06:42.730> mascara<00:06:43.730> to<00:06:43.850> be<00:06:43.940> integrated

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:44.600 
that allows the mascara to be integrated

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.500 
that allows the mascara to be integrated
into<00:06:44.960> the<00:06:45.290> lash<00:06:45.610> so<00:06:46.610> you're<00:06:46.790> moving<00:06:47.030> from<00:06:47.120> left

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:47.510 
into the lash so you're moving from left

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:48.780 
into the lash so you're moving from left
to<00:06:47.660> right

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:48.790 
to right

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:54.739
