about<00:00:50.309> 46<00:00:50.760> percent<00:00:50.820> again<00:00:51.390> talked<00:00:51.629> about<00:00:51.989> 31

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
about 46 percent again talked about 31

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.229 
about 46 percent again talked about 31
percentage<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.340> how<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.850> power<00:00:54.090> is

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
percentage so how this power is

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.850 
percentage so how this power is
producing<00:00:54.570> engine<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.199> produced<00:00:55.680> due<00:00:55.829> to

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
producing engine it is produced due to

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.130 
producing engine it is produced due to
the<00:00:55.949> combustion<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.820> fuel<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.719> if<00:00:57.840> more

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the combustion of the fuel so if more

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.860 
the combustion of the fuel so if more
fuel<00:00:58.469> gets<00:00:58.920> combustion<00:00:59.730> or<00:00:59.879> more<00:01:00.270> fuel<00:01:00.539> burns

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
fuel gets combustion or more fuel burns

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.130 
fuel gets combustion or more fuel burns
more<00:01:01.289> power<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.190> created<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:02.969> if<00:01:03.270> more<00:01:03.629> fuel

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
more power is created so if more fuel

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.560 
more power is created so if more fuel
needs<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.680> burn<00:01:04.890> we<00:01:05.100> need<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.430> supply<00:01:06.030> more<00:01:06.270> air

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
needs to burn we need to supply more air

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.990 
needs to burn we need to supply more air

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
of air so that more fuel can be born and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.990 
of air so that more fuel can be born and
more<00:01:55.470> power<00:01:55.860> can<00:01:56.100> be<00:01:56.250> produced<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.909> how

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
more power can be produced that is how

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.569 
more power can be produced that is how
this<00:01:57.149> 41<00:01:57.600> percentage<00:01:58.079> more<00:01:58.619> power<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.100> 31

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
this 41 percentage more power and 31

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.490 
this 41 percentage more power and 31
percentage<00:02:00.030> more<00:02:00.210> torque<00:02:00.899> is<00:02:01.049> produced<00:02:01.259> by

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
percentage more torque is produced by

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.490 
percentage more torque is produced by
the<00:02:01.560> help<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:02.360> supercharger<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.840> actually

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
the help of a supercharger so actually

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.480 
the help of a supercharger so actually
when<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:05.040> pressurized<00:02:05.520> air<00:02:05.790> is

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
when this pressurized air is

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.089 
when this pressurized air is
play<00:02:06.640> to<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.540> inlet<00:02:07.750> manifold<00:02:08.200> what<00:02:08.739> happens

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
play to the inlet manifold what happens

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.550 
play to the inlet manifold what happens
is<00:02:09.250> that<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:10.149> density<00:02:10.539> of<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.780> air<00:02:10.899> reduces

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
is that the density of the air reduces

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.710 
is that the density of the air reduces
so<00:02:11.709> if<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.130> density<00:02:12.310> of<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.790> air<00:02:12.819> gets<00:02:13.510> a

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
so if the density of the air gets a

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.850 
so if the density of the air gets a
reduced<00:02:14.760> its<00:02:15.760> property<00:02:16.270> to<00:02:16.390> expand<00:02:17.020> will<00:02:17.709> be

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
reduced its property to expand will be

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.040 
reduced its property to expand will be
less<00:02:18.040> so<00:02:18.190> if<00:02:18.340> it<00:02:18.849> is<00:02:18.970> not<00:02:19.060> properly<00:02:19.270> expanding

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
less so if it is not properly expanding

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.350 
less so if it is not properly expanding
that<00:02:20.140> much<00:02:20.349> power<00:02:20.500> is<00:02:20.709> not<00:02:21.310> happening<00:02:22.060> here

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
that much power is not happening here

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.140 
that much power is not happening here
inside<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.840> inlet<00:02:23.019> manifold<00:02:23.440> so<00:02:24.069> for<00:02:24.670> cooling

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
inside the inlet manifold so for cooling
