00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.450
 hello guys welcome to a new 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:08.469
 chapter of only ground photos i am 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.990
 fernando I'm here at a friend's house 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:15.380
 we have been doing a session of 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:18.250
 photos to his works since he is a painter and 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.869
 engraver and is dedicated to the world of art 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.720
 so he asked me if I could 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.779
 come to make some pictures of some 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.779
 of new paintings that has 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.730
 received then good because we have already 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.220
 made the photo of the pictures of the 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.840
 works that had to be done and now what 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.840
 are I think that 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.840
 at nine twenty eight and 40 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.950
 in the afternoon 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.950
 Well, the truth is that there is a light 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.950
 precious 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.090
 the environment right now in this 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.660
 This room's room is 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.989
 very dim very warm there are very clouds 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:05.530
 naturally rather placed in the 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:08.500
 heaven and good now, they have a 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.619
 white a soft yellow a yellow 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.869
 pale and a little bit of orange for 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.380
 around that is awesome is 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.159
 impossible not to stay there 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.990
 gawking looking at the sky 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.479
 so I want to take advantage to do 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.970
 a panoramic from the views there 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.390
 in this house from the balconies 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.060
 because really this is one thing that I 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.910
 I would like to share with all of you 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.690
 so you can see what I am 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.370
 watching right now and good I invite you to 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.440
 make a company here and let's do 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.820
 a panoramic we are going to do it with him 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.320
 with the new tripod and good to see what 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.510
 so we get the lever that I think that 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.350
 it will work out very well for us because 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:00.660
 I say we have a sky and some views 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.660
 awesome let's go to it let's go 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.780
 when you see this sky guys girls 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:22.660
 you are going to blow your senses merely equal 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.420
 we're going to do is going to be leveling the 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.880
 tripod thanks to the bubble level 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.210
 what we have here 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.170
 we can 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.960
 we can make it easy is this task 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.340
 all right 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.270
 to see out there 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.000
 there we are 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.770
 there is a gentle an uproar down the street 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.930
 is listening to us I hope not because 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:50.640
 the microphone well turn on the viewfinder is 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.170
 more comfortable I prefer to work with the 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.170
 station in this case 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.150
 we stick the tripod everything we can 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.930
 to the balcony we see that the bubble level 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.299
 it is there it is straight perfect 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.049
 then good for the panoramic 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.680
 usually I usually do it in 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:11.680
 vertical but in this case we're going to 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.680
 simply 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:20.140
 and do them horizontally let's put 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:24.270
 a f10 to the camera for what 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.790
 let's have enough depth of field 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.700
 in raw of course in this case the 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.900
 white balance leaves it in automatic 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.900
 manuel corzo 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.530
 Y 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:41.670
 well I'm going to change instead of 10 I'm going 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.800
 to put an 8 f worth I'll put a this 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.620
 right the shutter speed let's 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.560
 to put it to a 10 on board second good 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.030
 Now what we are going to do is focus 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.770
 let's say the framing and just like 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.380
 we want 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.819
 that comes out and what we are going to do is a 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:02.130
 pre travel with the camera 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:04.800
 to see if indeed 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.260
 it's all ok what we want it to come out 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.380
 Sometimes it happens that having 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.060
 framed on the right, zoom in as 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.140
 better we have to correct a little in 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.200
 this case I'm going to go down 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.990
 a tad so the camera there exactly 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.990
 so that I get a piece out of the 

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:28.569
 balcony that I want it to come out 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:32.360
 and do not cut me too much the scene 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:35.689
 let's do the panorama 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:39.590
 One little thing to say is important for 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:43.550
 do the panoramas I advise you 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:46.470
 do them with wireless trigger 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.470
 OK with the remote trigger 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.110
 the rc 6 good rc whatever in 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.360
 your case of your camera 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:57.599
 like you have not seen the video 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.520
 of this command here I leave the link 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:02.940
 I always linking other good videos 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:06.330
 let's do then guys the 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.830
 the panoramic we have here you see no os 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.430
 I'm going to show 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:14.550
 the configuration of the camera 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:17.760
 Well as you see a 10 second manual efe 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:20.630
 8.0 iso 100 good white balance 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.630
 automatic 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.610
 to be able to shoot with the command 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.930
 wireless good surely already what 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.539

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.320
 Well nothing there we have the first to 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.630

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.620
 nice that this is going to come out 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.850
 Let's go there 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.560
 Well, you see in a matter of nothing 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:29.080
 a few minutes already we have run out of 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.759
 light practically so good here what 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.860
