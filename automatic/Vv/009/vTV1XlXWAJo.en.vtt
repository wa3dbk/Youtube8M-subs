analysis<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:38.130> John's<00:01:38.549> character<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.329> think

analysis of John's character I think

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.630 
analysis of John's character I think
they're<00:01:39.780> gonna<00:01:39.960> either<00:01:40.229> really<00:01:40.860> like<00:01:41.070> him<00:01:41.310> or

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.080 
they're gonna either really like him or
not<00:01:42.060> like<00:01:42.570> him<00:01:43.140> he<00:01:43.409> lacks<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.799> empathy<00:01:44.549> with

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
not like him he lacks that empathy with

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.149 
not like him he lacks that empathy with
other<00:01:45.119> people<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.110> he<00:01:46.200> comes<00:01:46.470> off<00:01:46.619> really

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159

for<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.230> most<00:02:42.320> part<00:02:42.530> he<00:02:42.890> was<00:02:42.920> quite<00:02:43.400> realistic

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
for the most part he was quite realistic

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.840 
for the most part he was quite realistic
in<00:02:44.660> how<00:02:45.080> Dan<00:02:45.350> Wells<00:02:45.620> portrayed<00:02:46.280> him<00:02:46.459> I<00:02:46.640> thought

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
flipped the plot the entire book I think

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.150 
flipped the plot the entire book I think
on<00:03:14.390> its<00:03:14.570> side<00:03:14.870> was<00:03:15.260> expecting<00:03:15.830> one<00:03:16.130> thing

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
on its side was expecting one thing

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.910 
on its side was expecting one thing
going<00:03:17.090> into<00:03:17.480> this<00:03:17.600> book<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.170> I<00:03:18.350> totally<00:03:18.650> got

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
going into this book and I totally got

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.979 
going into this book and I totally got
another<00:03:19.610> thing<00:03:19.940> when<00:03:20.150> this<00:03:20.390> twist<00:03:20.690> was

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
another thing when this twist was

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.750 
another thing when this twist was
introduced<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:21.769> it<00:03:21.920> made<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.489> story

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
introduced and it made the story

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.570 
introduced and it made the story
afterwards<00:03:23.390> pretty<00:03:24.080> interesting<00:03:24.830> aside<00:03:25.250> from

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
afterwards pretty interesting aside from

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.280 
afterwards pretty interesting aside from
that<00:03:25.790> twist<00:03:26.209> I<00:03:26.450> thought<00:03:26.660> it<00:03:26.870> was<00:03:27.019> pretty

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
that twist I thought it was pretty

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.620 
that twist I thought it was pretty
steady<00:03:28.190> going<00:03:28.580> throughout<00:03:28.970> I<00:03:29.330> thought<00:03:29.540> the

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
steady going throughout I thought the

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.449 
steady going throughout I thought the
flow<00:03:29.810> and<00:03:29.930> pacing<00:03:30.380> was<00:03:30.530> really<00:03:30.890> well<00:03:31.040> done

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
flow and pacing was really well done

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.280 
flow and pacing was really well done
