00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.410 

locking<00:00:01.190> mechanism<00:00:01.819> it's<00:00:02.780> right<00:00:03.199> here<00:00:04.420> okay

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:05.420 
locking mechanism it's right here okay

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.019 
locking mechanism it's right here okay
and<00:00:06.069> what<00:00:07.069> I<00:00:07.099> found<00:00:07.340> out<00:00:07.639> is<00:00:07.819> there<00:00:07.939> is

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:08.029 
and what I found out is there is

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.450 
and what I found out is there is
actually<00:00:08.330> a<00:00:08.390> plug<00:00:08.720> that<00:00:09.470> was<00:00:09.620> right<00:00:09.830> here<00:00:10.220> this

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
actually a plug that was right here this

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.089 
actually a plug that was right here this
rubber<00:00:10.880> cap<00:00:11.860> was<00:00:12.860> sitting<00:00:13.250> inside<00:00:14.769> this<00:00:15.769> hole

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:16.099 
rubber cap was sitting inside this hole

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.550 
rubber cap was sitting inside this hole
that<00:00:17.050> was<00:00:18.050> right<00:00:18.260> there<00:00:18.880> okay<00:00:19.880> and<00:00:20.410> you<00:00:21.410> can

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
that was right there okay and you can

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.950 
that was right there okay and you can
actually<00:00:21.800> see<00:00:22.340> on<00:00:23.170> the<00:00:24.170> back<00:00:24.380> end<00:00:24.740> here<00:00:25.960> at

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
actually see on the back end here at

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.519 
actually see on the back end here at
this<00:00:27.170> hole<00:00:27.699> okay<00:00:28.699> goes<00:00:29.630> all<00:00:29.869> the<00:00:29.900> way<00:00:30.140> through

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
this hole okay goes all the way through

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.119 
this hole okay goes all the way through
I'm<00:00:31.400> not<00:00:31.460> sure<00:00:31.699> if<00:00:31.820> you<00:00:31.910> can<00:00:32.000> see<00:00:32.269> that<00:00:32.479> or<00:00:32.659> not

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
I'm not sure if you can see that or not

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.229 
I'm not sure if you can see that or not
but<00:00:34.129> you<00:00:34.280> can<00:00:34.399> see<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:34.640> light<00:00:34.850> coming<00:00:35.210> through

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
but you can see the light coming through

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.559 
but you can see the light coming through
it<00:00:36.399> you<00:00:37.399> can<00:00:37.460> see<00:00:37.550> my<00:00:37.760> little<00:00:37.909> finger<00:00:38.269> sticking

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:38.569 
it you can see my little finger sticking

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:41.139 
it you can see my little finger sticking
through<00:00:39.069> so<00:00:40.069> you<00:00:40.129> probably<00:00:40.550> could<00:00:40.760> stick<00:00:40.999> your

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
through so you probably could stick your

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.259 
through so you probably could stick your
hand<00:00:41.659> down<00:00:42.639> through<00:00:43.639> there<00:00:43.760> you<00:00:43.879> have<00:00:43.999> to<00:00:44.059> push

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:44.269 
hand down through there you have to push

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:46.329 
hand down through there you have to push
the<00:00:44.479> plug<00:00:44.719> the<00:00:44.989> plug<00:00:45.139> goes<00:00:45.559> has<00:00:45.920> to<00:00:46.010> be<00:00:46.069> pushed

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
the plug the plug goes has to be pushed

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:51.309 
the plug the plug goes has to be pushed
into<00:00:46.609> the<00:00:46.909> engine<00:00:47.359> compartment<00:00:47.859> okay<00:00:50.170> here<00:00:51.170> is

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:51.319 
into the engine compartment okay here is

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:55.509 
into the engine compartment okay here is
the<00:00:51.499> plug<00:00:51.769> right<00:00:52.479> here<00:00:53.499> that<00:00:54.499> has<00:00:54.709> been<00:00:54.739> taken

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
the plug right here that has been taken

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.359 
the plug right here that has been taken
out<00:00:55.639> and<00:00:56.049> you<00:00:57.049> might<00:00:57.319> be<00:00:57.559> able<00:00:57.829> to<00:00:57.979> get<00:00:58.159> your

00:00:58.359 --> 00:00:58.369 
out and you might be able to get your

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:01.000 
out and you might be able to get your
finger<00:00:58.909> or<00:00:59.149> something<00:00:59.659> to<00:01:00.019> push<00:01:00.289> down<00:01:00.619> on<00:01:00.649> this

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
finger or something to push down on this

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.709 
finger or something to push down on this
locking<00:01:01.489> mechanism<00:01:02.059> because<00:01:02.209> the<00:01:02.359> locking

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
locking mechanism because the locking

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.130 
locking mechanism because the locking
mechanism<00:01:03.289> spring-loaded<00:01:04.120> and<00:01:05.120> it<00:01:05.750> goes<00:01:05.900> this

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
mechanism spring-loaded and it goes this

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.850 
mechanism spring-loaded and it goes this
direction<00:01:06.460> so<00:01:07.460> I<00:01:07.490> had<00:01:07.670> to<00:01:07.730> push<00:01:07.940> that<00:01:08.180> plug<00:01:08.450> out

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
direction so I had to push that plug out

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.020 
direction so I had to push that plug out
now<00:01:09.860> I'm<00:01:09.950> not<00:01:10.130> sure<00:01:10.160> on<00:01:10.490> how<00:01:10.520> you're<00:01:10.880> going<00:01:10.970> to

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
now I'm not sure on how you're going to

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.840 
now I'm not sure on how you're going to
be<00:01:11.120> able<00:01:11.180> to<00:01:11.300> turn<00:01:11.510> your<00:01:11.570> hand<00:01:12.460> to<00:01:13.460> be<00:01:13.610> able<00:01:13.760> to

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
be able to turn your hand to be able to

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.760 
be able to turn your hand to be able to
grab<00:01:14.120> a<00:01:14.150> hold<00:01:14.300> of<00:01:14.510> this<00:01:14.660> cable<00:01:15.110> mechanism

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
grab a hold of this cable mechanism

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.910 
grab a hold of this cable mechanism
right<00:01:15.920> here<00:01:15.980> I<00:01:16.220> don't<00:01:16.400> know<00:01:16.730> if<00:01:16.970> there's<00:01:17.240> I

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
gotten a really short screw driver and

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.960 
gotten a really short screw driver and
I'm<00:01:51.759> putting<00:01:52.149> it<00:01:52.210> through<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.450> hole<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:54.460> I<00:01:54.820> am

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
I'm putting it through the hole and I am

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.789 
I'm putting it through the hole and I am
just<00:01:55.119> angling<00:01:55.570> it<00:01:55.750> at<00:01:55.869> this<00:01:55.990> direction<00:01:56.200> I'm

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
just angling it at this direction I'm

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.340 
just angling it at this direction I'm
actually<00:01:57.159> able<00:01:57.640> to<00:01:57.789> get<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.860> mechanism<00:02:01.350> to

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
actually able to get that mechanism to

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.899 
actually able to get that mechanism to
move<00:02:02.590> to<00:02:03.460> release<00:02:03.729> that<00:02:03.909> spring<00:02:04.270> load<00:02:04.800> okay<00:02:05.909> so

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
move to release that spring load okay so

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.160 
move to release that spring load okay so
you<00:02:07.060> punch<00:02:07.360> out<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:10.209> spacer<00:02:10.720> or<00:02:10.899> whatever

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
you punch out that spacer or whatever

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.390 
you punch out that spacer or whatever
you<00:02:11.230> want<00:02:11.350> to<00:02:11.380> call<00:02:11.500> it<00:02:11.590> that<00:02:11.650> seal<00:02:11.980> or<00:02:12.190> rubber

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
you want to call it that seal or rubber

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.949 
you want to call it that seal or rubber
bushing<00:02:13.000> or<00:02:13.120> whatever<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:13.480> want<00:02:13.600> to<00:02:13.660> call<00:02:13.810> it

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
bushing or whatever you want to call it

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.990 
bushing or whatever you want to call it
you<00:02:15.810> push<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:16.959> out<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:17.550> then<00:02:18.550> you<00:02:18.670> have<00:02:18.760> come

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
you push it out and then you have come

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.160 
you push it out and then you have come
in<00:02:19.150> at<00:02:19.239> this<00:02:19.390> angle<00:02:20.970> okay<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.930> you<00:02:23.019> can

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170
