00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 or the reset eros and reset heras today we're going 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.670
 to prepare this delicious entree that 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.710
 I also advise him as garnish 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.660
 a roast of meat 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.400
 the first thing is to put some potatoes 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.900
 medium and already washed in a source of 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.330
 oven 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.460
 and baked with them 200 degrees 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.349
 centigrade for about 45 minutes 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.179
 when they are already roasted and there is the 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.220
 tempered a little bit so as not to close 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:28.179
 alive in the manipulation we cut the 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.179
 potatoes in half 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.070
 and with the help of a teaspoon 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.230
 we remove the pulp from the potato while 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.910
 roasted is removed very easily have 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.530
 careful not to break the shell in this 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.449
 step since we will need it later 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.930
 when we have removed all the pulp 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.170
 we add salt 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.680
 and of course ground pepper 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.680
 indispensable in any kitchen 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.190
 and now we add butter to 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.260
 room temperature so that it integrates 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.359
 better with potato 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.289
 then with a fork we integrate well 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.699
 the butter 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.879
 while we crush the pieces of the 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.310
 potato 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.750
 give it a good shoe we do not think 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.610
 there are large pieces of potato in the 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.860
 dough 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.480
 when there is a kind of puree 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.400
 do not forget to try now to see if it is 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.020
 well of salt we proceed to fill in 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.530
 new the potato peels with this 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.540
 delicious mix 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.100
 as a suggestion you can make and roast 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.110
 these potatoes at the same time as a chicken 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.270
 also roasted then you serve it all 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.340
 next to if you take advantage of the heat of the 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.710
 oven and you make an authentic recipe of 10 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.570
 and with that said we continue when there 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.189
 stuffed the potatoes well we return them 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.270
 to put in the baking dish looking 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.030
 upwards 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.429
 and back to the oven we grill them 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.109
 at 200 degrees for about 10 minutes that 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.330
 get roasted on top and get that 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:51.850
 crunchy layer
