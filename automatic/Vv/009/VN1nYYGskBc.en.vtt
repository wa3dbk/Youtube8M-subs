00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
happen actually let me know what you

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.840 
happen actually let me know what you
thought<00:02:12.200> of<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.470> video<00:02:12.560> below<00:02:12.890> but<00:02:13.250> yeah<00:02:13.400> so

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
thought of the video below but yeah so

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.759 
thought of the video below but yeah so
that<00:02:14.390> was<00:02:14.420> interesting<00:02:14.660> they<00:02:15.260> kind<00:02:15.500> of<00:02:15.560> said

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
that was interesting they kind of said

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.949 
that was interesting they kind of said
that<00:02:15.800> they<00:02:16.040> gave<00:02:16.190> him<00:02:16.430> his<00:02:16.640> bike<00:02:16.850> back<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.780> I

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
that they gave him his bike back and I

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.300 
that they gave him his bike back and I
guess<00:02:18.170> that's<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.709> case<00:02:18.890> with<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.160> lot<00:02:19.280> of

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
guess that's the case with a lot of

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.759 
guess that's the case with a lot of
beating<00:02:19.880> so<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.840> kind<00:02:21.050> of<00:02:21.080> need<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.290> get<00:02:21.620> your

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
beating so you kind of need to get your

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.740 
beating so you kind of need to get your
bike<00:02:21.950> back<00:02:22.190> so<00:02:22.910> for<00:02:23.120> example<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:23.600> they've<00:02:23.720> got

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
bike back so for example so they've got

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.750 
bike back so for example so they've got
really<00:02:24.410> really<00:02:24.590> really<00:02:24.860> affected<00:02:25.280> me<00:02:25.430> when<00:02:25.730> I
