there you will provide your baby with an
outside<00:02:42.030> source<00:02:42.480> of<00:02:42.930> nutrition<00:02:43.680> which<00:02:44.160> means

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
outside source of nutrition which means

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.030 
outside source of nutrition which means
that<00:02:45.000> there<00:02:45.210> will<00:02:45.330> not<00:02:45.570> be<00:02:45.630> as<00:02:46.020> much<00:02:46.470> demand

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
that there will not be as much demand

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.670 
that there will not be as much demand
from<00:02:47.430> your<00:02:47.670> boob<00:02:47.940> which<00:02:48.750> means<00:02:49.050> that<00:02:49.470> your

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
from your boob which means that your

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.340 
from your boob which means that your
boobs<00:02:50.010> will<00:02:50.280> automatically<00:02:51.030> slowly<00:02:51.840> start

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
boobs will automatically slowly start

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.120 
boobs will automatically slowly start
producing<00:02:52.860> less<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.700> less<00:02:53.880> milk<00:02:54.210> also

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
producing less and less milk also

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.130 
producing less and less milk also
artificial<00:02:56.130> milk<00:02:56.370> would<00:02:57.030> really<00:02:57.300> fill<00:02:57.840> him<00:02:57.960> up

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
artificial milk would really fill him up

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.040 
artificial milk would really fill him up
because<00:02:58.590> these<00:02:59.430> milks<00:02:59.790> are<00:02:59.940> usually<00:03:00.450> much

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
because these milks are usually much

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.960 
because these milks are usually much
heavier<00:03:01.500> than<00:03:01.560> our<00:03:01.890> milk<00:03:02.190> our<00:03:02.370> milk<00:03:02.760> is<00:03:02.940> very

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
heavier than our milk our milk is very

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.690 
heavier than our milk our milk is very
easy<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:03.510> digest<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.500> these<00:03:04.740> artificial<00:03:05.430> milks

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
easy to digest so these artificial milks

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.300 
easy to digest so these artificial milks
both<00:03:05.910> fill<00:03:06.300> him<00:03:06.450> up<00:03:06.600> more<00:03:06.870> which<00:03:07.590> means<00:03:07.860> that

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
both fill him up more which means that

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.910 
both fill him up more which means that
he<00:03:08.490> will<00:03:08.670> sleep<00:03:09.000> longer<00:03:09.540> which<00:03:10.140> means<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:10.740> he

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
he will sleep longer which means that he

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.240 
he will sleep longer which means that he
won't<00:03:11.220> feed<00:03:11.520> as<00:03:11.760> much<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.900> that<00:03:13.470> will<00:03:13.980> also

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
won't feed as much and that will also

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.740 
won't feed as much and that will also
translate<00:03:14.970> into<00:03:15.420> a<00:03:16.280> lower<00:03:17.280> supply<00:03:17.750> eventually

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
translate into a lower supply eventually

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.510 
translate into a lower supply eventually
I<00:03:18.959> need<00:03:19.380> to<00:03:19.500> tell<00:03:19.709> you<00:03:19.830> this<00:03:19.980> because<00:03:20.220> I<00:03:20.489> know

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
I need to tell you this because I know

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.670 
I need to tell you this because I know
there<00:03:20.880> are<00:03:21.060> certain<00:03:21.540> moms<00:03:21.780> out<00:03:21.989> there<00:03:22.020> that

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
there are certain moms out there that

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.130 
there are certain moms out there that
are<00:03:22.800> unsure<00:03:23.340> of<00:03:23.370> their<00:03:23.850> supply<00:03:24.270> and<00:03:24.570> they<00:03:25.020> are

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
are unsure of their supply and they are

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.170 
are unsure of their supply and they are
thinking<00:03:25.590> of<00:03:25.770> supplementing<00:03:26.430> with<00:03:26.610> milk<00:03:26.880> and

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
thinking of supplementing with milk and

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.199 
thinking of supplementing with milk and
again<00:03:28.020> if<00:03:28.260> they<00:03:28.470> do<00:03:28.530> that<00:03:28.860> that<00:03:29.400> is<00:03:29.520> fine<00:03:29.550> but

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
again if they do that that is fine but

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.080 
again if they do that that is fine but
they<00:03:30.360> need<00:03:30.600> to<00:03:30.630> know<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.410> risks<00:03:31.890> of

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
they need to know the risks of

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.540 
they need to know the risks of
supplementing<00:03:33.140> because<00:03:34.160> 99%<00:03:35.160> of<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.310> time

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
supplementing because 99% of the time

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.120 
supplementing because 99% of the time
supplementing<00:03:36.330> is<00:03:36.450> not<00:03:36.690> necessary<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.560> feel

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
supplementing is not necessary I feel

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.320 
supplementing is not necessary I feel
like<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.430> need<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.610> tell<00:03:38.850> you<00:03:39.000> this<00:03:39.120> because

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
like I need to tell you this because

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.390
