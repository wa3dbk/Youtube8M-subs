00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.950
 Hello, welcome Doric TV is now from Berlin by m-net 10 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.590
 and now it's all about the tactics of EMI this year but of course 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.740
 also a very special device Rome the iPad 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.780
 the iPad has made the men's handbag socially acceptable again 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.090
 is the iPad will be one 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.899
 the sun 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.899
 as a conventional laptop 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.340
 after being let in 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.699
 January start on the monitor 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.399
 this is fun the wars then i can see everything that is pretty good especially 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.750
 not yourself 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.360
 On the one hand, for the first time in his life, he does quite well 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.360
 it makes no sense now for clear conditions 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.070
 a revision did not like it when you look at it - the fingers 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.380
 7 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.380
 good day everyone a newspaper 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.630
 easy but not filmed no problem reported the newspaper simply 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.590
 Keep it up so I've never talked to a newspaper about how it feels 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.090
 that for her 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.530
 very familiar because I'm the last one 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.630
 The person of the newspaper can not only hide theirs 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.180
 You can also read them Prof Red also on the iPad 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.980
 provided, of course, now does not stand too many stupid questions 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.520
 the testers then also the regional newspapers 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.310
 Rheine 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.190
 is the team have 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.150
 the party to the 1 thus omitted 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.210
 then it was enough then you can get there 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.380
 make up or 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.030
 that's all a cling to e10 it forms extremely FB 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:11.779
 that also lead us to the crucial questions 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:15.569
 The best jumper will really be the mirror with an opponent 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.179
 Hold a mirror 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:21.229
 he becomes Foursquare mayor of the nx10 her in Berlin and 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.689
 who in the end will leave the field as Keegan World Champion 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:30.889
 Place and much more 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:31.849
 March 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.869
 3 Attention si 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:37.869
 soon this is 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.680
 so wooden around 2 000
