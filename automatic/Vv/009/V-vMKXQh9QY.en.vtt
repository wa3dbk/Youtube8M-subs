cayenne and the vivid orange guys these
are<00:00:49.160> a<00:00:49.489> hybrid<00:00:49.879> case<00:00:50.360> that<00:00:51.320> are<00:00:51.590> basically

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
are a hybrid case that are basically

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.389 
are a hybrid case that are basically
constructed<00:00:52.820> of<00:00:53.059> outside<00:00:53.840> is<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:55.039> soft

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
constructed of outside is the soft

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.310 
constructed of outside is the soft
rubber<00:00:56.210> and<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:57.230> back<00:00:57.410> is<00:00:57.760> a<00:00:58.760> hard<00:00:59.059> plastic<00:00:59.320> so

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
rubber and the back is a hard plastic so

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.340 
rubber and the back is a hard plastic so
basically<00:01:00.770> you<00:01:01.010> have<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:01.690> ability<00:01:02.690> to<00:01:03.050> see

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
basically you have the ability to see

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.749 
basically you have the ability to see
through<00:01:03.559> there<00:01:03.769> with<00:01:03.980> the<00:01:04.070> protection<00:01:04.580> and

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
through there with the protection and

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.330 
through there with the protection and
you<00:01:05.660> have<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:05.930> ability<00:01:06.050> to<00:01:06.440> easily<00:01:06.740> slip

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
you have the ability to easily slip

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.870 
you have the ability to easily slip
these<00:01:07.490> on<00:01:07.700> and<00:01:07.850> slip<00:01:08.060> these<00:01:08.180> off<00:01:08.420> with<00:01:08.690> the

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
these on and slip these off with the

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.969 
these on and slip these off with the
soft<00:01:10.880> edges<00:01:11.270> on<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:11.420> outside<00:01:11.899> so<00:01:12.530> that's

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
soft edges on the outside so that's

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.060 
soft edges on the outside so that's
actually<00:01:13.490> a<00:01:13.520> really<00:01:13.640> slick<00:01:14.509> case<00:01:15.070> especially

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
actually a really slick case especially

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.460 
actually a really slick case especially
with<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.610> clear<00:01:16.850> back<00:01:17.090> I<00:01:17.450> thought<00:01:18.229> of<00:01:18.350> putting

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
with the clear back I thought of putting

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.719 
with the clear back I thought of putting
the<00:01:18.619> gelaskins<00:01:19.040> on<00:01:19.189> there<00:01:19.310> which<00:01:19.430> I'm<00:01:19.549> sure

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
the gelaskins on there which I'm sure

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.030 
the gelaskins on there which I'm sure
other<00:01:19.909> people<00:01:20.090> have<00:01:20.299> already<00:01:20.720> but<00:01:21.680> I<00:01:21.710> really

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
other people have already but I really

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.320 
other people have already but I really
like<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:22.280> way<00:01:22.310> that<00:01:22.549> looked<00:01:22.820> with<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:23.090> green

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330

with them though if you notice on the
top<00:01:33.380> right<00:01:33.650> corner<00:01:33.920> you<00:01:34.220> see<00:01:34.400> how<00:01:34.549> it's<00:01:34.700> kind

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
top right corner you see how it's kind

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.440 
top right corner you see how it's kind
of<00:01:35.030> pulling<00:01:35.840> up<00:01:36.049> a<00:01:36.140> little<00:01:36.380> bit<00:01:36.820> i'm<00:01:37.820> not<00:01:38.150> sure

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
of pulling up a little bit i'm not sure

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.020 
of pulling up a little bit i'm not sure
if<00:01:38.869> that<00:01:39.320> has<00:01:39.710> anything<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:40.189> do<00:01:40.490> with<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.909> way

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
if that has anything to do with the way

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.880 
if that has anything to do with the way
that<00:01:41.180> you<00:01:41.270> put<00:01:41.450> it<00:01:41.540> on<00:01:41.600> because<00:01:41.810> every<00:01:42.590> once<00:01:42.619> in

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
that you put it on because every once in

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.380 
that you put it on because every once in
a<00:01:42.950> while<00:01:43.070> you<00:01:43.100> will<00:01:43.430> notice<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.880> camera<00:01:44.240> hole

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
a while you will notice the camera hole

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.090 
a while you will notice the camera hole
doesn't<00:01:44.600> line<00:01:44.869> up<00:01:44.899> you<00:01:45.259> can<00:01:45.439> actually<00:01:45.590> massage

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
doesn't line up you can actually massage

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.359 
doesn't line up you can actually massage
that<00:01:46.340> into<00:01:46.549> place<00:01:46.670> by<00:01:47.509> just<00:01:47.720> kind<00:01:47.899> of<00:01:47.960> pulling

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
that into place by just kind of pulling

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.770 
that into place by just kind of pulling
the<00:01:49.369> edges<00:01:49.970> of<00:01:50.000> sight<00:01:50.270> see<00:01:50.450> how<00:01:50.509> you<00:01:50.600> can

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
the edges of sight see how you can

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.170 
the edges of sight see how you can
unlined<00:01:51.200> that<00:01:51.439> up<00:01:51.619> real<00:01:51.860> easily<00:01:52.040> and<00:01:52.490> then<00:01:53.090> you

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
unlined that up real easily and then you

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.090 
unlined that up real easily and then you
can<00:01:53.270> line<00:01:53.479> it<00:01:53.509> back<00:01:53.719> up<00:01:53.780> again<00:01:54.049> i<00:01:54.409> think<00:01:54.799> that

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
can line it back up again i think that

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.289 
can line it back up again i think that
has<00:01:55.189> to<00:01:55.310> do<00:01:55.399> with<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.610> fact<00:01:55.640> that<00:01:55.880> it<00:01:56.000> may<00:01:56.119> not

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
has to do with the fact that it may not

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.600 
has to do with the fact that it may not
be<00:01:56.360> sitting<00:01:56.780> completely<00:01:57.680> flat<00:01:58.040> on<00:01:58.340> there

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
be sitting completely flat on there

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.060 
be sitting completely flat on there
because<00:01:59.390> I'm<00:01:59.540> pulling<00:01:59.869> it<00:01:59.960> left<00:02:00.619> and<00:02:00.920> right

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
because I'm pulling it left and right

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.490

your vibrate switch your rocker switches

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:11.910 
your vibrate switch your rocker switches
are<00:02:09.410> obviously<00:02:09.799> easily<00:02:10.549> pushed<00:02:10.820> through<00:02:11.060> the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920

rubber soft side and the bottom is

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.080 
rubber soft side and the bottom is
completely<00:02:15.350> opened<00:02:15.739> along<00:02:16.549> the<00:02:16.700> edge<00:02:16.850> there

completely opened along the edge there

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.060 
completely opened along the edge there
for<00:02:17.420> your<00:02:17.510> port<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:18.019> of<00:02:18.650> course<00:02:18.889> your

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
for your port and of course your

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.220 
for your port and of course your
speakers<00:02:19.459> have<00:02:19.579> holes<00:02:19.820> as<00:02:20.000> well<00:02:20.180> so<00:02:20.510> it's<00:02:20.989> not

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
speakers have holes as well so it's not

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.409 
speakers have holes as well so it's not
completely<00:02:21.410> cut<00:02:22.040> out<00:02:22.070> but<00:02:22.699> they<00:02:23.000> leave<00:02:23.269> you

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:23.419 
completely cut out but they leave you

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:24.200 
completely cut out but they leave you
enough<00:02:23.660> room<00:02:23.930> to

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
enough room to

enough room to
all<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.570> up<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:24.900> does<00:02:25.080> line<00:02:25.260> up<00:02:25.290> pretty

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
all that up and that does line up pretty

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.350 
all that up and that does line up pretty
well<00:02:25.710> have<00:02:26.370> no<00:02:26.550> problem<00:02:26.940> plugging<00:02:27.270> anything

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
well have no problem plugging anything

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.650 
well have no problem plugging anything
in<00:02:27.810> there<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:29.370> only<00:02:29.640> other<00:02:29.820> thing<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:30.390> was

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
in there and the only other thing I was

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.500 
in there and the only other thing I was
thinking<00:02:30.870> about<00:02:31.320> was<00:02:31.710> the<00:02:32.400> bottom<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:32.880> tend<00:02:33.360> to

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
thinking about was the bottom is tend to

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.770 
thinking about was the bottom is tend to
get<00:02:33.630> a<00:02:33.690> little<00:02:34.080> saggy<00:02:34.830> on<00:02:35.370> there<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.600> think

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
get a little saggy on there and I think

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.000 
get a little saggy on there and I think
that<00:02:36.900> has<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.140> same<00:02:37.350> thing<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.620> do<00:02:37.770> with<00:02:37.890> the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
that has the same thing to do with the

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.590 
that has the same thing to do with the
edges<00:02:38.370> just<00:02:38.400> kind<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:38.850> bubbling<00:02:39.210> up<00:02:39.360> but<00:02:39.510> you

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
edges just kind of bubbling up but you

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.620 
edges just kind of bubbling up but you
know<00:02:39.720> what<00:02:40.430> I've<00:02:41.430> had<00:02:41.490> this<00:02:42.060> thing<00:02:42.270> won<00:02:42.420> for

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
know what I've had this thing won for

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.060 
know what I've had this thing won for
the<00:02:42.690> last<00:02:42.900> two<00:02:43.110> weeks<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:43.440> I've<00:02:43.560> beat<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:43.950> up

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070

that<00:03:25.590> is<00:03:25.800> a<00:03:25.830> good<00:03:25.920> case<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:27.300> iphone<00:03:27.990> is

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
that is a good case the iphone is

dirt on the top and the bottom as I've
seen<00:03:40.140> before<00:03:40.400> so<00:03:41.400> actually<00:03:42.210> turned<00:03:42.450> out

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
seen before so actually turned out

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.910 
seen before so actually turned out
pretty<00:03:42.600> well<00:03:42.930> better<00:03:43.380> than<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:43.650> thought<00:03:43.860> it

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
pretty well better than I thought it

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.380 
pretty well better than I thought it
would<00:03:44.070> be<00:03:44.340> completely<00:03:44.490> honest<00:03:44.940> with<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.180> I

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
would be completely honest with you I

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.870 
would be completely honest with you I
expected<00:03:46.380> dirt<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.920> get<00:03:47.070> underneath<00:03:47.340> here<00:03:47.700> but

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
expected dirt to get underneath here but

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.080 
expected dirt to get underneath here but
it<00:03:47.970> does<00:03:48.120> hold<00:03:48.440> pretty<00:03:49.440> well<00:03:49.850> to<00:03:50.850> where

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
it does hold pretty well to where

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.690 
it does hold pretty well to where
there's<00:03:51.720> nothing<00:03:52.110> there<00:03:52.320> like<00:03:52.710> when<00:03:53.580> my

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
there's nothing there like when my

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.540 
there's nothing there like when my
finger<00:03:54.060> along<00:03:54.360> there<00:03:54.600> I<00:03:54.780> don't<00:03:55.530> see<00:03:55.800> I<00:03:56.160> don't

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
finger along there I don't see I don't

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.210 
finger along there I don't see I don't
see<00:03:56.790> it<00:03:56.910> really<00:03:57.390> any<00:03:57.540> dirt<00:03:57.870> but<00:03:58.350> hey<00:03:58.890> you<00:03:58.950> know

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
see it really any dirt but hey you know

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.500 
see it really any dirt but hey you know
what<00:03:59.430> I<00:03:59.460> do<00:03:59.610> take<00:03:59.850> it<00:03:59.970> off<00:04:00.060> everyone<00:04:00.360> so<00:04:00.450> I'm

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
what I do take it off everyone so I'm

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.300 
what I do take it off everyone so I'm
clean<00:04:00.840> it<00:04:00.960> so<00:04:01.470> maybe<00:04:01.680> there<00:04:01.920> might<00:04:01.950> be<00:04:02.160> a

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
clean it so maybe there might be a

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.710 
clean it so maybe there might be a
little<00:04:02.520> bit<00:04:02.700> more<00:04:02.850> dirt<00:04:03.120> on<00:04:03.300> there<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:03.630> I'll

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
little bit more dirt on there and I'll

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.540 
little bit more dirt on there and I'll
have<00:04:03.900> to<00:04:04.110> give<00:04:04.680> you<00:04:04.710> guys<00:04:04.920> an<00:04:05.100> update<00:04:05.160> on<00:04:05.400> that

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
have to give you guys an update on that

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.550 
have to give you guys an update on that
I<00:04:05.760> didn't<00:04:06.420> really<00:04:06.540> follow<00:04:06.810> that<00:04:07.080> all<00:04:07.260> too<00:04:07.410> much

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
I didn't really follow that all too much

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.040 
I didn't really follow that all too much
because<00:04:08.180> typically<00:04:09.180> when<00:04:09.450> I<00:04:09.480> have<00:04:09.690> a<00:04:09.720> case

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
because typically when I have a case

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.420 
because typically when I have a case
that<00:04:10.290> you<00:04:10.380> can<00:04:10.530> see<00:04:10.680> through<00:04:10.890> on<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.070> back<00:04:11.220> I'm

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
that you can see through on the back I'm

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.390 
that you can see through on the back I'm
usually<00:04:12.080> eventually<00:04:13.080> bothered<00:04:13.500> by<00:04:13.650> some<00:04:14.040> form

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
usually eventually bothered by some form

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.580 
usually eventually bothered by some form
of<00:04:14.520> dirt<00:04:14.790> getting<00:04:15.180> underneath<00:04:15.480> there<00:04:15.870> and<00:04:16.049> I

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
of dirt getting underneath there and I

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.410 
of dirt getting underneath there and I
take<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:16.980> off<00:04:17.100> to<00:04:17.280> get<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.520> dirt<00:04:17.700> out<00:04:17.910> now

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
take it off to get the dirt out now

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.360 
take it off to get the dirt out now
maybe<00:04:18.720> because<00:04:19.109> i<00:04:19.140> had<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.620> gelaskins<00:04:20.130> on

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
maybe because i had the gelaskins on

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.010 
maybe because i had the gelaskins on
there<00:04:20.640> it<00:04:20.880> may<00:04:21.390> have<00:04:21.510> made<00:04:21.720> it<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.900> little

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
there it may have made it a little

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.480 
there it may have made it a little
thicker<00:04:22.320> around<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.860> edges<00:04:23.040> here<00:04:23.370> and

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
thicker around the edges here and

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.850 
thicker around the edges here and
allowed<00:04:23.760> to<00:04:24.000> keep<00:04:24.150> it<00:04:24.300> out<00:04:24.450> i<00:04:24.750> don't<00:04:25.500> know<00:04:25.650> i'll

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
allowed to keep it out i don't know i'll

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.110 
allowed to keep it out i don't know i'll
have<00:04:26.010> to<00:04:26.160> test<00:04:26.370> that<00:04:26.430> out<00:04:26.550> for<00:04:26.820> you<00:04:26.940> guys<00:04:27.090> I
