00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.099
 hello beer operation again 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.790
 the hangover continues so we just 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.280
 came to work now around 9 o'clock 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:18.180
 immediately began to recover 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:20.340
 laptop keyboard here she take a look at 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.890
 kind of as new practical as she 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.920
 washed off sugar on the battery all night at 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.949
 us batteries are so satisfied hot 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.410
 in appearance you can't tell about it 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.820
 swollen or something else happened to her 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.610
 it looks like a pretty whole motherboard 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.110
 I threw yesterday in the housing it in 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.059
 principle was not so very much 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.550
 dirty and rubbed main connectors 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.670
 alcohol and and 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.660
 and let's try to turn it on now 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.190
 laptop without keyboard without the idea of rum 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.520
 watch it turn on or not by the way 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.340
 This is what I tell people who 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.949
 completely beginner in repairing a laptop 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.060
 can be switched on without keyboard 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.540
 winchester 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.729
 touchpad it's not deadly he if 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.259
 motherboard is working it will turn on 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:21.119
 no problem so the connector i already have 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:24.299
 saying here no customer customer not 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.360
 the client was simply given to the client which 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.880
 brought it he says the connector to him is not 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.310
 need and just let everything be on 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.040
 wires on wires so on wires 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.380
 let's maxim click turn on smart no 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.840
 I remind you that then without a keyboard, he does not 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:45.590
 included this connector you are very very 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:47.840
 well lit bulb lit up buzzed 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.490
 something buzzed 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.429
 I will give that on the screen asus screensaver 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.399
 the principle is already good 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:59.869
 next we will need now 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.240
 throw the keypad in general 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.310
 twist it all back and be 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.119
 is the final inclusion 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.799
 not back to you well what are all the people 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.629
 collected let's turn on and check 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:16.129
 click on the button 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:20.000
 we have basically checked that 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:24.950
 the computer itself is running sneci 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.030
 it's already perfect 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:34.640
 important to check the keyboard's inter 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:36.500
 already working well more still here 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.959
 these cops are not for you but the main thing is these 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.030
 four buttons yes and the button how is it 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:47.720
 where someone button all raki they all there 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:50.030
 all red so okay these are the lyrics 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.750
 Maxim we have something sick in the morning 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:57.709
 general situation with me 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.129
 bacilli infectious password components 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.310
 inter 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:06.139
 he shows personal discover 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:14.469
 loaded now let's create a text 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:19.299
 I've found a text document open 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:23.680
 spread out his window at all so well, that 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.680
 solemn moment let's check 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:39.430
 let's reset you and then it is a little bit 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:39.430
 I thought well, everything seems to be working all 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.319
 work 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.810
 enter shift another life works 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:02.340
 principle 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:04.980
 the arrows also work as if they are us 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.800
 you need to wash the water itself in 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.580
 In principle, the other keys are not 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.890
 check here but practice has shown that 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.440
 I will connect the flooded keyboard 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.650
 it is quite possible to wash it with ordinary water from under 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:23.280
 tap with dishwashing detergent 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:27.030
 That is now what the budget is 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:30.090
 truck it is that focus back and forth so 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.880
 then the camera is basically here 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.840
 launder all very very budget all 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:40.230
 works as if converging to do under 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.210
 the strength of each, that is, do not carry it in 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.720
 service center and overpay there 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.400
 crazy money if you have 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.860
 minimally straight arms and at least one 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.520
 screwdriver yourself can do it all 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.990
 fine in principle on this all my 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:00.240
 beer hangover 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:03.300
 It went well with a laptop that I still wanted 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.550
 say guys there in the comments people 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.090
 sometimes they write that well, let us tell you 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:12.500
 some trash send honestly in 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:15.360
 In principle, we do not mind if you are from Ukraine 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.940
 if you have any old there 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.180
 waste iron either idle or 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.990
 In general, what is not a pity to send a new 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.060
 by mail 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:28.530
 if you do not mind we will pay 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.990
 shipment as if we were going to shoot something 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.710
