 tony valbuena commenting videos traigo 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.419
 a new gameplay in this case the 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.740
 demo of the f1 race stars remember that this 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:15.049
 game has been developed and distributed 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.510
 by codemasters and you want your 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.690
 departure for November 13, 2012 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.720
 in the USA and three days later on 16 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.830
 November 2012 for europe asia 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.390
 it will also arrive but it will reach 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.580
 early 2013 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.259
 and well let's see a little bit what we 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.970
 depara this game that aims to pretend 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.739
 be a kind of mario kart to see if 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.690
 meets expectations or stays in 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.430
 minor cloths the game consists of three 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.340
 game modes or mode trajectory mode 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.440
 time trial and multiplayer mode to 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.410
 split screen for four players and 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.000
 online up to eleven also consists of 11 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.460
 circuits set in circuits 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.839
 Formula-1 officials set not 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.030
 it means that they are completely 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:57.949
 the same and of three categories one thousand two thousand 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.949
 and three thousand cubic centimeters 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.900
 and well let's choose also has 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.210
 all the teams and official pilots 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.220
 of the world the world of formula 1 and 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.960
 all the characters are recognizable 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.410
 for any fan the formula1 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.780
 you can observe raikkonen alonso vettel 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.150
 they are all recognizable they are very 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.350
 well designed and caricatured we are going to 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.850
 choose Fernando Alonso, who is my 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.920
 favorite pilot and I consider it the 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.140
 best active driver in the last 10 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.000
 years and let's see if this game 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.000
 really meets expectations 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.110
 remember that this game will come out in 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.979
 physical format ie on dvd and blu-ray 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.530
 for xbox 360 platforms 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:44.620
 playstation3 and pc at a price of 50 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.620
 euros 49 with 90 turkeys 50 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.960
 and we'll see the playability the juve lead is 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.240
 what people have more doubts and now 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.549
 let's leave them by checking a 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.549
 little control we go there 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.119
 and I knew lightning to start I have 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.619
 practice other games and it seems to me that 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:10.000
 it works also play a little bit of 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:12.100
 operate the brake wow remove from the middle 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.780
 to see how the car turns to the car 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.310
 the truth does not turn much 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.989
 look do not shoot do not want anything 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.280
 good yes yes that it turns but it is that it is necessary 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.930
 brake a lot in the corners and I'm 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.830
 trying to pull the handbrake but 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.900
 it seems that there is no handbrake 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.970
 many will you tell me man the formula 1 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.460
 they have a handbrake and I will tell you clearly 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.580
 Formula 1 has an arcade game like that 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.870
 of jail of incarceration the payasete like this 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.610
 that should have a handbrake 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.060
 as they have other games like mario kart 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.010
 and others but good 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.050
 feeling of game speed either 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.670
 it has a lot of the truth sometimes observed 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.780
 here you can here four bites 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.130
 a little bit of haste they put you four 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.040
 stripes to make it appear to run 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.480
 more the car but the truth that 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.730
 good is seeing the feeling of 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.049
 speed but it does not kill graphics either 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.879
 sexy style 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.799
 in the purest cartoon style perie drawings 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:03.609
 the graphics are very good the truth is 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.609
 also pretty good 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.159
 the control except for that small 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.780
 detail that the car would like me to 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:11.920
 spill over to me personally is my 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.500
 I did not see them 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.760
 this phase of the 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.770
 circuit reminds us a little bit of 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.180
 more veterans to mario kart to the phase 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.440
 that one on the highway does not remember 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.770
 what was it called because it was many years ago 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.700
 but yes that seems pretty good 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.230
 You have also seen that there are 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.140
 intense estrellitas these just 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.130
 catch that what they do is 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.470
 basically they are not skills or we 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.690
 can give acceleration can they give us 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.850
 some kind of object for us to launch 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.319
 the enemies and we will reduce them too 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.880
 is there any skill for example you have 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.500
 seen that it has started to rain that is 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.640
 one of the skills that well now 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.290
 it starts to rain but before 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.819
 also this is one of the skills 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.590
 that he must have taken one of our 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.360
 adversaries and this what it does is 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.489
 slow everyone but him and that 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.110
 he puts a kind of water wheels 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.480
 and this makes him very fast and 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.769
 we go pretty slow 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.630
 now we will go through goal for the first 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.930
 time and we will only have one round to 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.010
 finish the race 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.299
 I want to remind you to emphasize that 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.189
 If you are looking for a game like this, 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.290
 other alternatives much more complete and 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:11.340
 much cheaper in this case we have 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.310
 in the market already a game that has already 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.870
 gone out years ago that is the good one 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.060
 years ago months ago and I think it does 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.639
 more than a year that came out is segal stars 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.169
 racing is a much more complete game 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.060
 that is much more fun with the 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.400
 sega characters and some characters 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.720
 specifically in xbox we have guests 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.900
 How to make a saucepan and some other 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.699
 surprises that is also very fun and 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.509
 much more complete than this one and that what 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.150
 we can buy at a price 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:38.699
 approximately 15 20 euros in 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.800
 stores like extra light for example that 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:43.650
 good if you want a game this style 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.770
 I recommend that is cheaper 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.720
 and it's not going to happen much better 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.330
 man, what time do they put me on 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.889
 balloon from my cache in the sea 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.449
 but well you also have other 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.280
 alternatives if that is a court of 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.530
 serious conviction since this game already 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.210
 that for the price that it will cost us 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.490
 there are other alternatives like formula 1 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.379
 2012 as google file 2000 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.599
 forgiveness world rally car 3 that is a 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:09.780
 excellent game of rallies or you already have 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:11.550
 other options as they are the carriers 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.280
 force motorsport or force to new 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.990
 force horizontal yes yes if you want to go up 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.849
 that I place of said games forget you 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.280
 of the latter from here microsoft has 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:22.289
 put pretty fussy for the subject 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.819
 of the gameplays and it puts a lot of 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.759
 conditions for you to go up that place of 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:29.099
 your games as they are let the project 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:30.509
 gotham forza motorsport all games 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:32.340
 of Microsoft have many problems to the 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:34.139
 time to upload gameplays and for him 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.150
 example you can not have anything monetized 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.280
 You can not monetize good videos 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.050
 you have to put an explanation in the 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.360
 video information on are very very very 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.340
 strict 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.050
 so my recommendation is will be to 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.659
 be racing if you want a bit like 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.759
 to this much cheaper and much more 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:52.710
 complete this game is fine is 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:54.840
 entertaining has good graphics a 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.560
 good playability although with some 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.200
 shortcomings 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.770
 and well I think it's very very long 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.969
 duration so well we already arrived at the 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.889
 goal 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:08.869
 you can download the engravings from the bazaar 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.299

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:16.610
 analysis by these first impressions
