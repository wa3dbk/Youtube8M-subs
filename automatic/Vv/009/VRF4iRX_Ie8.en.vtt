much<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.910> begin<00:01:00.180> with<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.480> have<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.660> go

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
much and to begin with you have to go

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.090 
much and to begin with you have to go
buy<00:01:01.320> ammo<00:01:02.039> for<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.059> squid<00:01:03.449> launcher<00:01:04.019> thing<00:01:04.290> it

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
shooting them into the ground into the

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.209 
shooting them into the ground into the

sky and also when it shoots people

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:02.490 
sky and also when it shoots people
I<00:06:00.490> feel<00:06:01.029> they<00:06:01.240> should<00:06:01.419> somehow<00:06:01.599> explode<00:06:02.259> that

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500

it's<00:06:35.810> kind<00:06:35.990> of<00:06:36.020> lame<00:06:36.229> it<00:06:36.379> should<00:06:36.530> be<00:06:36.620> 200<00:06:37.069> so<00:06:37.159> I

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
it's kind of lame it should be 200 so I

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.589 
it's kind of lame it should be 200 so I
could<00:06:37.340> actually<00:06:37.460> afford<00:06:37.669> and<00:06:38.090> just<00:06:38.300> see<00:06:38.449> what

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:38.599 
could actually afford and just see what

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:40.779 
could actually afford and just see what
it<00:06:38.690> is<00:06:38.810> but<00:06:39.620> I<00:06:39.680> think<00:06:39.740> the<00:06:40.099> cheat<00:06:40.310> codes<00:06:40.550> that

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:40.789 
it is but I think the cheat codes that

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:42.309 
it is but I think the cheat codes that
are<00:06:40.879> already<00:06:40.970> out<00:06:41.090> which<00:06:41.780> if<00:06:41.930> you<00:06:42.050> want<00:06:42.229> to

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 
are already out which if you want to

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.589 
are already out which if you want to
look<00:06:42.470> them<00:06:42.590> up<00:06:42.740> Google<00:06:43.520> st.<00:06:43.789> Rose<00:06:44.000> three<00:06:44.330> cheat
