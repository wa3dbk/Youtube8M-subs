 the southern town and added that there is crisis 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.340
 today I come with an answer for a friend 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.719
 our friend was called politics 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:19.739
 and today we ask friends what is it that has there that seems like a null csi 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.150
 when you want 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.150
 maybe the music producer and micky 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.149
 to start the cb is a monk music producer 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.840
 but I put a ski 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.630

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.580
 inter 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.240
 this page this age in the description of the video 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.880
 as is 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.010
 once inside the page here they have four type of players 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.650
 you can harden your preference but I saw it the cri 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.170
 what was left 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.170
 let's see here and from there we click 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.600
 I am very important that they put without my id in 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.220
 for example, I for mine 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.800
 pain fashion 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.500
 ileana 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.140
 everyone gives it halfway between skiing 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.910
 and good download it 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.409
 ornate p the story was a patch or tack that you will have to bring 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.290
 in the folder 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.570
 the name will appear 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.910
 well it's called indar 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.170
 in which the folder 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.240
 an icon like this will appear 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.820
 let's think about crisis 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.110
 I did not ask that if we want a repugnant fact there is in Chile 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.400
 moacir 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.400
 they were all 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.009
 i 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.009
 this wait is turning 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:19.639
 I see the master to see now 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:25.029
 and if you start to open the player 

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:36.799
 nick reilly 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.069
 This page is very good 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.069
 there between you can also download themes 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.620
 and it's called the alinco bird page 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:54.560
 nor was there a good friend who knows that this meeting between what he wants from me and 

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:55.459
 I 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.849
 I will look for an answer 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.849
 and this must answer all your comment 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:04.790
 And the only one I ask is that 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.530

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.530

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:27.249

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:32.249
 aquino companies so that it is believed to return or in terms of use 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.889

 we see that it works well 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.739
 and that volume 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.229
