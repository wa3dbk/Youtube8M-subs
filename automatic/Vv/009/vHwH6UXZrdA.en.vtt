00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.470
 hello how about youtube friends my name 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.660
 it's violet and welcome them a 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.610
 more time to my channel with this gameplay of 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.790
 a very strange game that did me the favor 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.700
 about spending my boyfriend basically it's about 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.380
 of color 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.289
 and well we are going to 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.910
 I do not want to play it for playing anything else there 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.190
 to remember a little bit that is the color 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.280
 and good color is the sensation 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.370
 caused in the retina of an observer 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:43.790
 by the luminous lengths between 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.100
 380 and 760 nanometers 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.610
 remember that the color has four 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.610
 properties the tone the intensity the 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:56.559
 brightness and saturation good I've seen 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.559
 this we are going to play 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.950
 we have a time for 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.320
 to advance 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.790
 let's see how far we got 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.490
 I wish there was a 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.940
 explanation of why we got up 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.980
 I do have a vision problem 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:19.060
 but there is no explanation 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.060
 you just have to keep playing 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.080
 and I can not find it 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.450
 there is a very difficult night 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.500
 I said 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.159
 I can not find it 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.750
 of these successes 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.750
 two seconds of seconds 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.340
 1 4 3 2 1 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:05.200
 already 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:07.060
 I got to level 28 I do not know every time 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.460
 it gets a little bit harder because 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.620
 the pictures get smaller 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.760
 then cover up with the phosphorescent 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.760
 as you will be dazzled 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.560
 the white marking of each box of the 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.410
 picture in general like that does not help 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.610
 much like that a trap so that what 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.940
 distinguish is well the difference and good 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.030
 I'm going to leave the link of the game here 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.480
 down play what 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:39.010
 and they tell me to what level they arrived and 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.010
 See you at the next job
