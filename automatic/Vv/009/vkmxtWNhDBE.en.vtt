00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.050
 the age of 3d 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.360
 cinemas televisions consoles 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.260
 the industry wants to change the format of vision and although the technology 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.230
 current 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.010
 does not just convince the manufacturers that are still trying to find the 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.909
 formula 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:25.209
 Well yes we have a 3d television and we have hardly any content on the phone 

00:00:25.209 --> 00:00:27.480
 o'higgins can help a lot 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.530
 we talk about tlc optimus 3d the first mobile market to incorporate not 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.000
 only three-dimensional video playback but the ability to record 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.420
 ovidio pictures without 3d and watch them both no television compatible through 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.859
 of the hdmi cable 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.380
 or on the same phone screen 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.069
 Well, here we find a strong point 

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:53.149
 we will not need special glasses boxers 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.770
 can fool us 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.750
 the optimus 3d is the largest android phone on the market 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:08.890
 and when I say big 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.470
 spoke of dimensions in three axes 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.860
 are they really did that with a lcd screen eti four comma 2 inch 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.240
 and a weight that goes beyond the conventional in the latter 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.150
 terminals 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.009
 The quality of the materials is decent 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:30.630
 more or less we find the line SME lg active 2 x and if it were not 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.729
 because they have changed the position of some buttons that would cost difference 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.710
 but well let's see what's really interesting about lg optimus 3d 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.640
 stand out first of all 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.260
 that enters a new dual core the market is not envy of Iran but one 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.040
 loves 4 although velvet pays 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.740
 really good 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.649
 now we start to have it new if we want the terminal we see the first 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.969
 indications that give him appointment artists March a wolf that says 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.920
 Stereoscopic 3d and a double lens camera to take photos 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.920
 will play matches in three dimensions 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:22.540
 we also have a dedicated button assumption is 3d 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.300
 which sometimes makes the launcher of a special menu that we will now see and other 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.790
 of the recording switch thÃ© 2p to 3 d 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:36.479
 besides that we found an output hdmi to bring the content in three 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:39.479
 dimensions to a compatible television 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.739
 let's go see what this continuous stress offers 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.930
 in principle against Moscow more or less what in others such as sandro 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:53.260
 today 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.190
 that is to say 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.300
 a custom interface 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.019
 several icons gutiÃ©rrez the sample of applications is accurate 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.749
 however lg there produced a very special menu that take advantage directly 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:09.339
 on the optimus 3d screen 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:13.949
 is a menu of access to the different three-dimensional functions of the terminal 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.229
 although through the camera can not be appreciated very well I assure you what 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:23.049
 it is spectacular the implementation of it on this screen 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:34.129
 from the we can access the camera to the gallery to the channel of videos 3d 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:38.699
 of youtube or applications and 3d games that come preloaded 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.650
 all with some transitions in 3d 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.650
 that make screen images skip 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.020
 if we enter the camera 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.939
 we can see a new engine of android interpreters 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.359
 there is a button to select the 2d or3b mode 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:01.580
 I know that the effect is not well appreciated through the camera 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.849
 but the feeling that it offers is incredible 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.139
 usually the 3d images and videos that I recorded this phone 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:10.780
 given a good result 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.990
 although noticed that in close-ups there is a small deviation from the effect 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.420
 the camera is capable of recording at 1080p 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.509
 only in 2d mode 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:23.289
 in three dimensional mode 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:26.330
 we only get a quality of 720 pixels 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:27.720
 which is not bad 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.950
 although it fails and that is serious at 15 fredes per second in clear 3d mode 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:38.599
 The best thing about all this is that if you have already invested in a 3d television and 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:41.090
 well stock there's hardly any content for her 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.310
 this moment opens the doors to a host of new content 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.910
 because not only serious reproduces in 3d but can also convert 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.910
 videos of two ap three dimensions 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.789
 leaving aside the functions in three dimensions 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:09.680
 we would like to highlight the good work of the team in the terminal's browser 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.400
 We are talking about a dual-core phone and you can see the speed at the time 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.389
 to open web pages 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.560
 but if something I liked about this section are the options offered 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.150
 we see as he the 3d optimus ekeko adds a menu at the bottom of 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.960
 the screen 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.280
 that allows us, on the one hand, to rewind previous pages 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.610
 but it also allows us to add windows 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.449
 and even 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:39.009
 navigate between them with a kind of eating products a detail that sure 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:42.009
 will like 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:48.280
 in conclusion we loved the 3d effect that gets the last 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:49.669
 lg smartphone 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:52.939
 is innovative and certainly creates expectation 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:56.959
 this point makes the power of the double core stays in a second 

00:05:56.959 --> 00:06:00.439
 flat and it's good because it means that you have taken a step forward 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:06.380
 there is no doubt that the lg optimus 3d is a phone thought 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.850
 burnt down for those people who want to generate content for their 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.569
 3d TVs 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:13.760
 because by weight 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.770
 quality of the cameras 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.190
 and the short duration of his battery of only one thousand 500 million pesos 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.540
 can not compete 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.629
 with no other double core market 

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:26.520
 we assume that for that league 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.780
 the one who has left his optimus 2x 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.970
 so I doubt that the potential customer of this phone 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.980
 go looking for a rival to samsung galaxy s2 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:38.009
 definitely 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:42.960
 it is a very interesting terminal if you want a good operator player 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.610
 of 3d contents 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.729
 that
