00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
off a little bit differently from how I

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.869 
off a little bit differently from how I
usually<00:00:45.660> do<00:00:46.020> these<00:00:46.200> videos<00:00:46.620> first<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.579> want<00:00:47.789> to

usually do these videos first I want to
get<00:00:47.969> rid<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.180> some<00:00:48.510> obvious<00:00:48.809> things<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
get rid of some obvious things that the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.319 
get rid of some obvious things that the
iPhone<00:00:49.680> 6<00:00:50.129> will<00:00:50.280> present<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.030> these<00:00:51.270> are

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
iPhone 6 will present this and these are

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.880 
iPhone 6 will present this and these are
very<00:00:51.780> predictable<00:00:52.230> things<00:00:52.469> such<00:00:52.710> as<00:00:52.739> a

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
very predictable things such as a

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.709 
very predictable things such as a
complete<00:00:53.340> redesign<00:00:53.640> hopefully<00:00:54.210> not<00:00:54.360> based<00:00:54.570> on

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
complete redesign hopefully not based on

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.750 
complete redesign hopefully not based on
any<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.170> previous<00:00:55.530> iPhones<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.550> more

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
any of the previous iPhones and a more

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.130 
any of the previous iPhones and a more
suitable<00:00:57.030> uncomfortable<00:00:57.629> for<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.960> hand

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
suitable uncomfortable for the hand

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.689 
suitable uncomfortable for the hand
design<00:00:58.410> because<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.129> only<00:00:59.250> find<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
design because I can only find the

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.540 
design because I can only find the
iPhone<00:00:59.969> 5<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.300> 5s<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:01.020> compact<00:01:01.440> for<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> hand

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
iPhone 5 and 5s to compact for the hand

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.270 
iPhone 5 and 5s to compact for the hand
will<00:01:03.420> obviously<00:01:03.690> see<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> chip<00:01:04.559> upgrade<00:01:04.920> to

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
will obviously see a chip upgrade to

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.820 
will obviously see a chip upgrade to
probably<00:01:05.580> da<00:01:05.820> 8<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.630> might<00:01:06.930> finally<00:01:07.619> be

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
probably da 8 and this might finally be

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.530 
probably da 8 and this might finally be
the<00:01:08.100> year<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.369> Apple<00:01:08.850> goes<00:01:09.030> quad-core

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the year that Apple goes quad-core

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.170 
the year that Apple goes quad-core
hopefully<00:01:10.200> touch<00:01:10.890> ID<00:01:11.070> should<00:01:11.430> be<00:01:11.580> included<00:01:12.030> as

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
hopefully touch ID should be included as

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.780 
hopefully touch ID should be included as
well<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.930> say<00:01:13.140> should<00:01:13.200> because<00:01:14.130> there<00:01:14.610> have

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
well and I say should because there have

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.310 
well and I say should because there have
been<00:01:14.939> rumors<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.659> button

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
been rumors of a button

less iphonedo not quite sure how that

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.300 
less iphonedo not quite sure how that
would<00:01:18.689> work<00:01:18.750> out<00:01:19.170> but<00:01:19.470> there<00:01:19.650> are<00:01:19.799> rumors<00:01:20.040> and

would work out but there are rumors and

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.219 
would work out but there are rumors and
finally<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.210> will<00:01:21.299> definitely<00:01:21.509> be<00:01:21.810> powered<00:01:22.200> by

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
finally it will definitely be powered by

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.880

which<00:03:24.780> was<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:24.989> new<00:03:25.650> technology<00:03:26.070> to<00:03:26.100> developing

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
which was a new technology to developing

which was a new technology to developing
that<00:03:26.910> is<00:03:27.000> probably<00:03:27.269> far<00:03:27.480> from<00:03:27.660> happening<00:03:28.049> but

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
that is probably far from happening but

thing we can all agree is that the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.320 
thing we can all agree is that the

and that is a curved screen we see no

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.460 
and that is a curved screen we see no
need<00:03:50.700> for<00:03:50.910> it<00:03:51.209> yet<00:03:51.420> but<00:03:51.690> we<00:03:52.079> can<00:03:52.200> always<00:03:52.320> hope

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
need for it yet but we can always hope

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.259 
need for it yet but we can always hope
for<00:03:52.680> it<00:03:52.920> it<00:03:53.040> will<00:03:53.130> be<00:03:53.220> pretty<00:03:53.519> cool<00:03:53.820> features

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
for it it will be pretty cool features

battery out of it I did a video on how

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.760 
battery out of it I did a video on how
to<00:04:21.060> save<00:04:21.390> some<00:04:21.870> tips<00:04:22.079> how<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.229> save<00:04:22.470> so<00:04:22.650> if<00:04:22.710> you

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
to save some tips how to save so if you

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:23.750 
to save some tips how to save so if you

want to check it out link will be in
description<00:04:23.820> down<00:04:24.240> below<00:04:24.570> I<00:04:25.020> also<00:04:25.200> predict

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
description down below I also predict

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.570 
description down below I also predict
that<00:04:25.800> that<00:04:26.039> will<00:04:26.250> obviously<00:04:26.430> be<00:04:26.789> an<00:04:26.880> upgrade

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
that that will obviously be an upgrade

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.719 
that that will obviously be an upgrade
in<00:04:27.780> terms<00:04:28.780> of<00:04:29.080> pixels<00:04:29.710> in<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:30.069> next<00:04:30.460> camera

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
in terms of pixels in the next camera

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.820 
in terms of pixels in the next camera
with<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.509> iPhone<00:04:31.990> the<00:04:32.229> anything<00:04:32.560> Apple

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
with the iPhone the anything Apple

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.770 
with the iPhone the anything Apple
should<00:04:32.979> really<00:04:33.280> improve<00:04:33.789> is<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.120> speakers

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
should really improve is the speakers

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.100 
should really improve is the speakers
HTC<00:04:35.680> One<00:04:35.860> had<00:04:36.039> quite<00:04:36.759> good<00:04:36.970> speakers<00:04:37.539> they

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
HTC One had quite good speakers they

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.570 
HTC One had quite good speakers they
were<00:04:38.169> quite<00:04:38.500> amazing<00:04:38.949> in<00:04:39.099> terms<00:04:39.340> of

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
were quite amazing in terms of

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.760 
were quite amazing in terms of
smartphones<00:04:40.449> and<00:04:40.659> I<00:04:41.080> think<00:04:41.379> Apple<00:04:41.500> should

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
smartphones and I think Apple should

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:42.990 
smartphones and I think Apple should
follow<00:04:41.919> those<00:04:42.129> kind<00:04:42.370> of<00:04:42.430> footsteps<00:04:42.789> and

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
follow those kind of footsteps and

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.360 
follow those kind of footsteps and
really<00:04:43.180> innovate<00:04:43.509> in<00:04:43.659> terms<00:04:43.930> of<00:04:44.259> speakers<00:04:44.770> I

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
really innovate in terms of speakers I

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.990 
really innovate in terms of speakers I
also<00:04:45.970> think<00:04:46.419> that<00:04:46.800> Siri<00:04:47.800> should<00:04:48.520> mainly<00:04:48.849> be

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
also think that Siri should mainly be

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.369 
also think that Siri should mainly be
improved<00:04:49.539> quite<00:04:49.690> a<00:04:49.750> lot<00:04:49.960> Google<00:04:50.259> now<00:04:50.349> is

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:50.379 
improved quite a lot Google now is

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:52.260 
improved quite a lot Google now is
offering<00:04:50.740> some<00:04:50.919> really<00:04:51.159> cool<00:04:51.310> features<00:04:51.729> and<00:04:51.940> I

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
offering some really cool features and I

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.240 
offering some really cool features and I
think<00:04:52.509> that<00:04:52.629> Siri<00:04:52.960> has<00:04:53.229> a<00:04:53.440> lot<00:04:53.590> of<00:04:53.740> potential

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
think that Siri has a lot of potential

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.249 
think that Siri has a lot of potential
but<00:04:54.430> that<00:04:54.759> we<00:04:54.909> just<00:04:55.090> don't<00:04:55.270> have<00:04:55.360> the<00:04:55.780> coolest

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259 
but that we just don't have the coolest

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:58.379 
but that we just don't have the coolest
functions<00:04:56.680> are<00:04:56.830> most<00:04:57.220> useful<00:04:57.430> functions<00:04:57.940> we

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
functions are most useful functions we

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.330 
functions are most useful functions we
all<00:04:58.509> know<00:04:58.629> that<00:04:58.780> Apple<00:04:58.960> loves<00:04:59.470> thin<00:05:00.009> things

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
all know that Apple loves thin things

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.210 
all know that Apple loves thin things

try to pronounce light quickly so I

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.649

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:04.659 
think that the iPhone 6 could probably

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:06.300 
think that the iPhone 6 could probably
regain<00:05:05.229> the<00:05:05.319> title<00:05:05.470> for<00:05:05.860> the<00:05:05.979> world's
