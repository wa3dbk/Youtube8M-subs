00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.750
 hand lenses made in the USSR from 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.500
 all Soviet lenses submitted 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.140
 On the market 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.779
 the most optimal and inexpensive 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.570
 is the lens jupiter 8 they 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.429
 produced in different years carving 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.130
 lens 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:35.670
 m39 on distance cameras vigilant 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.090
 or in this fifty kopecks 50 millimeters and 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.860
 very good apertures of 20 exist 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.710
 two versions of this lens 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.890
 silvery and black silvery happens 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.039
 Causes the earliest modifications and 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.239
 black they are black or glossy 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.460
 glossy this is the end of the 60s beginning of the 70s 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.390
 black this mid seventies by 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.820
 late 90s black more modern y 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.760
 them a little different glass they are different 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.909
 give a little picture and silver 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.549
 more vintage such lens checks and 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.200
 they give a vintage picture on this 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.570
 The moment these lenses are wide 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.490
 common in the secondary market can 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.040
 buy very cheap cost 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.189
 lenses vary according to 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.380
 condition and quality from 10 to 30 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.409
 dollars we have for example in the lens 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.960
 there is a silver export version 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.200
 it is written in Latin 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.270
 it says made in ussr collected 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.970
 quality lens can be checked for 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.790
 assembly as it is well assembled or 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.130
 already shaken from time to price from 10 to 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.020
 30 dollars is very inexpensive for such 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.680
 lens and because there is a version 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.590
 for example jupiter 3 it is more bright 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:56.070
 51 and 5 but it is already 10 times more expensive 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.760
 these lenses look like carl zeiss sonar 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.430
 50 20 he was taken for the original German 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.290
 lenses carl zeiss sonar they are made 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.080
 a little bit different there practically 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.210
 backlash is never worth it 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.250
 expensive for example antique as in 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.160
 intelligence costs you $ 500 a 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.070
 You can buy a lens Jupiter 8 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.110
 10 as I said at 30 dollars on 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.390
 micro system 43 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.320
 the lens will turn out as 100 millimeters 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.570
 she 's sony nex somewhere 75 80 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.450
 millimeters she is not a kanvon as he has 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.209
 blood 2 point 7 is 135 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.090
 everything will turn out very simply to 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.430
 install on the lumix system we need 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.250
 there will be an adapter an adapter stands there from 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.950
 200 to 300 rubles we certainly have someone 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.290
 sells and more expensive these adapters up to 1000 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.870
 rubles can we have to go abroad 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.820
 u is worth 5 10 dollars are bronze 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.040
 we are the easiest lumia 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.140
 Here we put the adapter adapter 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.600
 inserted very easily it is simply 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.989
 screw adapter like this 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.930
 he is called krasin m39 abroad 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.840
 called l-39 since this is standard 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.380
 watering can these lenses are one hundred percent 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.810
 compatible with micro 43 system because 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.180
 lumix is ​​a hybrid of panasonic fir trees 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.690
 considered and he is the successor 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:22.739
 of this system and since the lens is jupiter 8 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.739
 this is a copy of carl zeiss anar which l-39 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.750
 it is 100% compatible with this. 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.900
 standards officially panasonic 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.019
 produces adapters with l-39 system 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.770
 micro 4 3 other adapters they like 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.170
 42 can also exist 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.980
 other systems are compatible too 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.900
 system l-39 fully compatible 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.170
 absolutely what problems should not 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.630
 be with this lens is inserted all 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.220
 very easy adapter and camera 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.100
 marked with a red dot 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:04:00.170
 you just insert a lens by coloring 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:02.560
 and packs you snap everything and you 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.720
 the lens is installed what is interesting 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.970
 lens jupiter 8 primarily its 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.280
 at the cost of it is practically the cheapest 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.300
 portrait and high quality lens for 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.100
 of this camera which is available on 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.370
 domestic market of secondary lenses 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:23.360
 because already autofocus lens 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:26.990
 for example olympus 45 18 costs about there 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:30.320
 400 500 dollars and this lens 50 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.930
 millimeters aperture 20 costs from 10 to 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.900
 30 dollars how are you lucky to buy it and 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.810
 so for almost 1000 rubles you 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.030
 will already be a portrait of us for photos and for 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.610
 video he blurs the background well 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:47.060
 of course if you find jupiter 3 which 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.580
 51 and 5 then that's fine too but you don't 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.800
 can find it for the money if 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.890
 you want to get acquainted with manual 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.050
 With lenses, Jupiter 8 is practically 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.810
 the most optimal lens if you have 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.600
 there is a whale lens which is 1442 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.150
 aperture inside 5 and the same lens he 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.310
 50 millimeters it will be a continuation 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.890
 your whale lens and you already 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.530
 can darker places shoot without 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.600
 flashes with this lens if you already 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.580
 want something better not have 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.500
 more expensive you can just try on 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.050
 this lens and then go on 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.480
 some more expensive lenses such 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.300
 same plant but they will be a little bit better 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.900
 a little bit worse you will understand it already 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.900
 testing process
