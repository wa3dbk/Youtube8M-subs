charges you know there's no metal
contacts<00:02:25.810> it<00:02:26.140> just<00:02:26.470> sits<00:02:26.650> in<00:02:26.800> there<00:02:26.950> and

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
contacts it just sits in there and

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.230 
contacts it just sits in there and
charges<00:02:27.660> it's<00:02:28.660> also<00:02:28.810> similar<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:30.060> sonic<00:02:31.060> air

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
charges it's also similar to sonic air

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.390 
charges it's also similar to sonic air
and<00:02:31.390> principle<00:02:31.810> as<00:02:31.960> well<00:02:32.170> I<00:02:32.440> know<00:02:33.070> I<00:02:33.160> have<00:02:33.370> a

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
and principle as well I know I have a

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.790 
and principle as well I know I have a
Sonicare<00:02:33.730> toothbrush<00:02:34.390> a<00:02:34.690> lot<00:02:35.530> of<00:02:35.650> other

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
Sonicare toothbrush a lot of other

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.590 
Sonicare toothbrush a lot of other
people<00:02:36.130> I<00:02:36.220> know<00:02:36.280> have<00:02:36.520> Sonicare<00:02:36.970> toothbrushes

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
people I know have Sonicare toothbrushes

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.380 
people I know have Sonicare toothbrushes
and<00:02:37.810> it's<00:02:38.470> a<00:02:38.530> similar<00:02:38.830> concept<00:02:39.070> it's<00:02:39.550> it's<00:02:40.270> a

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
and it's a similar concept it's it's a

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.860 
and it's a similar concept it's it's a
brush<00:02:40.630> that<00:02:41.130> pulses<00:02:42.130> or<00:02:42.160> vibrates<00:02:42.940> very

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
brush that pulses or vibrates very

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.960 
brush that pulses or vibrates very
quickly<00:02:44.200> so<00:02:44.590> that<00:02:44.620> you<00:02:45.280> know<00:02:45.370> without<00:02:45.580> using

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
quickly so that you know without using

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.910 
quickly so that you know without using
without<00:02:46.209> moving<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.900> brush<00:02:47.020> or<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.530> the

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
without moving the brush or the the

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.920 
without moving the brush or the the
toothbrush<00:02:48.310> very<00:02:48.520> much<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:49.450> does<00:02:49.720> a<00:02:49.750> very

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
toothbrush very much it does a very

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.980

then you start to start the cycle by
hitting<00:03:16.360> this<00:03:16.480> button<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:17.830> I<00:03:18.070> think<00:03:18.280> you<00:03:18.370> can

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
hitting this button and I think you can

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.250 
hitting this button and I think you can
probably<00:03:18.610> hear<00:03:19.090> this<00:03:19.300> I'm<00:03:19.780> not<00:03:19.930> sure<00:03:20.080> if<00:03:20.170> you

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
probably hear this I'm not sure if you

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.890 
probably hear this I'm not sure if you
can<00:03:20.410> see<00:03:20.680> it<00:03:20.830> but<00:03:21.130> this<00:03:22.030> inner<00:03:22.360> circle<00:03:22.870> of

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
can see it but this inner circle of

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.729 
can see it but this inner circle of
brushes<00:03:23.410> is<00:03:23.790> pulsing<00:03:24.790> very<00:03:25.030> fast<00:03:25.470> this<00:03:26.470> this

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
brushes is pulsing very fast this this

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.650 
brushes is pulsing very fast this this
outer<00:03:27.010> circle<00:03:27.610> of<00:03:27.670> bristles<00:03:28.060> is<00:03:28.269> not<00:03:28.420> moving

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
outer circle of bristles is not moving

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.650 
outer circle of bristles is not moving
at<00:03:28.840> all<00:03:29.489> this<00:03:30.489> is<00:03:30.670> useful<00:03:30.850> because<00:03:31.209> when<00:03:31.510> this

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
at all this is useful because when this

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.050 
at all this is useful because when this
is<00:03:31.780> wet<00:03:31.989> and<00:03:32.200> with<00:03:32.680> water<00:03:32.890> and<00:03:33.100> cleanser<00:03:33.459> you

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
is wet and with water and cleanser you

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.750 
is wet and with water and cleanser you
know<00:03:34.150> it<00:03:34.269> does<00:03:34.450> mist<00:03:34.930> a<00:03:35.200> little<00:03:35.470> bit<00:03:35.680> so<00:03:36.040> this

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
using the scrub but it definitely

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.480 
using the scrub but it definitely
alleviates<00:05:32.240> the<00:05:32.390> day-to-day<00:05:32.830> need<00:05:33.830> to<00:05:34.040> always

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
alleviates the day-to-day need to always

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.330 
alleviates the day-to-day need to always
use<00:05:35.390> it<00:05:35.620> and<00:05:36.620> that's<00:05:36.770> one<00:05:36.919> of<00:05:36.950> the<00:05:37.100> things<00:05:37.250> I

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
use it and that's one of the things I

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.969

really like about Clarisonic in terms of

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:40.540 
really like about Clarisonic in terms of
the<00:05:40.040> brush

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
the brush

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.700 
the brush
the<00:05:40.760> brushes<00:05:41.390> are<00:05:41.660> detachable<00:05:42.200> you<00:05:42.440> kind<00:05:42.680> of

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
the brushes are detachable you kind of

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.740 
the brushes are detachable you kind of
push<00:05:42.890> it<00:05:42.919> down<00:05:43.190> and<00:05:43.370> turn<00:05:43.610> you<00:05:44.390> know<00:05:44.510> kind<00:05:44.720> of

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
like a pill cap and the brush comes off

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.680 
like a pill cap and the brush comes off
the<00:05:48.650> brush<00:05:48.860> you<00:05:48.890> do<00:05:49.160> have<00:05:49.310> to<00:05:49.430> replace<00:05:49.820> you

with<00:05:55.310> antibacterial<00:05:55.580> soap<00:05:56.090> which<00:05:56.540> is<00:05:56.690> I

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
with antibacterial soap which is I

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.590 
with antibacterial soap which is I
actually<00:05:57.290> use<00:05:57.620> my<00:05:57.860> hand<00:05:58.370> soap<00:05:58.610> which<00:05:59.270> happens

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
actually use my hand soap which happens

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.120 
actually use my hand soap which happens
to<00:05:59.690> be<00:05:59.780> into<00:05:59.960> bacteria<00:06:00.440> and<00:06:00.710> I<00:06:00.740> put<00:06:00.950> a<00:06:00.979> little

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
to be into bacteria and I put a little

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.550 
to be into bacteria and I put a little
of<00:06:01.250> this<00:06:01.370> on<00:06:01.669> there

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
of this on there

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.340 
of this on there
and<00:06:02.920> clean<00:06:03.160> it<00:06:03.190> with<00:06:03.370> hot<00:06:03.550> water<00:06:04.140> that<00:06:05.140> does

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.350 
and clean it with hot water that does

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.580 
and clean it with hot water that does
work<00:06:05.620> I<00:06:05.830> mean<00:06:05.950> I<00:06:06.070> I've<00:06:06.310> discovered<00:06:06.790> that

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
work I mean I I've discovered that

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.320 
work I mean I I've discovered that
despite<00:06:08.590> cleaning<00:06:09.280> it<00:06:09.340> regularly<00:06:09.880> this<00:06:10.090> brush

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
despite cleaning it regularly this brush

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.590 
despite cleaning it regularly this brush
actually<00:06:10.690> starts<00:06:11.020> to<00:06:11.110> smell<00:06:12.270> fairly<00:06:13.270> quickly

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
actually starts to smell fairly quickly

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.310 
actually starts to smell fairly quickly
so<00:06:14.430> you<00:06:15.430> know<00:06:15.520> I<00:06:15.580> replace<00:06:16.060> them<00:06:16.360> probably<00:06:17.230> more

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
so you know I replace them probably more

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.860 
so you know I replace them probably more
often<00:06:17.620> than<00:06:17.920> you<00:06:18.010> have<00:06:18.250> to<00:06:18.460> but<00:06:19.240> you<00:06:19.750> know
