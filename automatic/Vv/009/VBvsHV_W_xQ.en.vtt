for<00:05:37.050> example<00:05:37.349> I'm<00:05:37.529> concentrating<00:05:38.189> on<00:05:38.250> the

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
for example I'm concentrating on the

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.459 
for example I'm concentrating on the
cerebellum<00:05:38.849> where<00:05:39.360> with<00:05:40.020> the<00:05:40.110> turn<00:05:40.259> of<00:05:40.379> a<00:05:40.439> knob

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
I wonder what would happen if you

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.740 
I wonder what would happen if you
stimulated<00:05:53.770> the<00:05:53.950> whole<00:05:54.160> brain<00:05:54.490> at<00:05:54.640> once<00:05:54.850> are

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
stimulated the whole brain at once are

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:56.850 
stimulated the whole brain at once are
you<00:05:55.840> suggesting<00:05:55.990> that<00:05:56.260> doing<00:05:56.530> so<00:05:56.710> could

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
you suggesting that doing so could

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.470 
you suggesting that doing so could
