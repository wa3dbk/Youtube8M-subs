that that 0.25 L quarter Tab connectors
on<00:01:45.710> them<00:01:46.210> which<00:01:47.210> would<00:01:47.390> go<00:01:47.540> to<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:48.020> first

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
on them which would go to the first

00:01:48.890 --> 00:02:03.850 
on them which would go to the first
output<00:01:49.190> of<00:01:49.550> the<00:01:49.640> nerd<00:01:49.820> device<00:02:02.560> then<00:02:03.560> over<00:02:03.830> here

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
output of the nerd device then over here

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.890 
output of the nerd device then over here
on<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:04.370> controller<00:02:04.910> I'm<00:02:05.570> just<00:02:05.750> gonna

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
on the controller I'm just gonna

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.830 
on the controller I'm just gonna
parallel<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.340> same<00:02:07.580> spot<00:02:08.060> that<00:02:08.090> my<00:02:08.420> switch

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
parallel to the same spot that my switch

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.340 
parallel to the same spot that my switch
is<00:02:09.080> in<00:02:10.240> we're<00:02:11.240> just<00:02:11.270> gonna<00:02:11.570> connect<00:02:12.050> it<00:02:12.170> right

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
is in we're just gonna connect it right

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:24.780 
is in we're just gonna connect it right
there<00:02:13.630> that<00:02:14.630> one<00:02:14.870> in<00:02:15.290> this<00:02:15.680> one<00:02:22.450> right<00:02:23.450> there

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
there that one in this one right there

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.220 
there that one in this one right there
yeah<00:02:25.790> other<00:02:26.030> than<00:02:26.270> tucking<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.720> wires<00:02:26.930> away

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
yeah other than tucking the wires away

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.160 
yeah other than tucking the wires away
and<00:02:27.530> testing<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.100> that's<00:02:28.370> it<00:02:28.730> so<00:02:29.270> let's<00:02:29.600> give

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
inputs I'm not using any inputs at this

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.610 
inputs I'm not using any inputs at this
time<00:03:55.980> so<00:03:56.130> I'm<00:03:56.190> just<00:03:56.310> going<00:03:56.490> to<00:03:56.580> shut<00:03:56.760> those<00:03:56.970> off

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
using one input so let's just turn that

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.570 
using one input so let's just turn that
off<00:04:02.670> so<00:04:03.000> it<00:04:03.060> doesn't<00:04:03.120> confuse<00:04:03.720> everybody<00:04:04.580> same

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
and now we're left with just a simple

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:16.220 
and now we're left with just a simple
interface<00:04:10.470> that<00:04:11.040> should<00:04:11.340> have<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:12.510> name<00:04:15.230> do

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
interface that should have the name do

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.750 
interface that should have the name do
that<00:04:16.440> I<00:04:18.350> think<00:04:19.350> I<00:04:19.470> named<00:04:19.709> my<00:04:19.920> input<00:04:20.340> instead<00:04:20.640> of

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
that I think I named my input instead of

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:31.070 
that I think I named my input instead of
my<00:04:20.880> output<00:04:22.520> fireplace<00:04:23.520> done<00:04:27.290> turn<00:04:28.290> it<00:04:28.410> on<00:04:30.080> and
