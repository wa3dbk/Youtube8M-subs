it's<00:00:11.429> really<00:00:11.670> easy<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.300> it's<00:00:12.660> kind<00:00:12.900> of

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
it's really easy and it's kind of

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.269 
it's really easy and it's kind of
interesting<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.769> do<00:00:14.690> first<00:00:15.690> step<00:00:16.020> take<00:00:16.980> one

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
interesting to do first step take one

side making a triangle fold and crease

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.589 
side making a triangle fold and crease
well<00:00:24.830> but<00:00:25.830> then<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.550> will<00:00:26.670> want<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.970> unfold<00:00:27.359> it

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
well but then you will want to unfold it

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.950 
well but then you will want to unfold it
and<00:00:27.859> do<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:28.980> again<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.000> other<00:00:30.029> side<00:00:30.570> the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
and do this again to the other side the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.990 
and do this again to the other side the
other<00:00:30.990> corners<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.650> did<00:00:31.920> not<00:00:32.009> fold<00:00:32.279> yet

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
crease and unfold you will not have an X

running<00:00:42.930> through<00:00:43.110> your<00:00:43.260> paper<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:45.390> next<00:00:45.690> step

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
running through your paper the next step

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.479 
running through your paper the next step
is<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.520> take<00:00:48.420> each<00:00:48.660> corner<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.350> fold<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.399> into

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
is to take each corner and fold it into

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.850 
is to take each corner and fold it into
the<00:00:50.610> center<00:00:50.850> as<00:00:51.149> neatly<00:00:51.360> as<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.750> can<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.680> is

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
the center as neatly as you can this is

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.500 
the center as neatly as you can this is
an<00:00:52.949> important<00:00:53.370> step<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.180> will<00:00:54.270> want<00:00:54.480> to

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
an important step that you will want to

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.330 
an important step that you will want to
be<00:00:54.660> neat<00:00:54.840> on<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.260> try<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.500> align<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.980> up<00:00:56.070> as<00:00:56.219> well

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
be neat on to try to align it up as well

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.029 
be neat on to try to align it up as well
as<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.579> can<00:01:00.260> also<00:01:01.260> make<00:01:01.620> sure<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.829> you

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
as you can also make sure that you

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.979 
as you can also make sure that you
crease<00:01:02.280> very<00:01:02.550> well<00:01:02.850> pre<00:01:03.300> only<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.629> part<00:01:03.930> to

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
crease very well pre only this part to

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:26.260 
crease very well pre only this part to
stay<00:01:04.199> folded<00:01:04.439> further<00:01:05.430> stay<00:01:05.700> still

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.179 

now<00:01:26.840> you<00:01:26.900> should<00:01:27.290> have<00:01:27.320> a<00:01:27.500> smaller<00:01:27.920> square

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
now you should have a smaller square

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.050 
now you should have a smaller square
with<00:01:28.939> four<00:01:28.970> triangular<00:01:29.750> flaps<00:01:30.579> the<00:01:31.579> next<00:01:31.850> step

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
with four triangular flaps the next step

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.760 
with four triangular flaps the next step
and<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.360> final<00:01:32.689> step<00:01:32.899> would<00:01:33.140> be<00:01:33.200> to<00:01:33.290> take<00:01:33.560> each

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
and the final step would be to take each

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.300 
and the final step would be to take each
triangular<00:01:34.250> flap<00:01:34.490> and<00:01:34.729> fold<00:01:34.970> it<00:01:35.149> halfway<00:01:36.369> back

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
triangular flap and fold it halfway back

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.310 
triangular flap and fold it halfway back
so<00:01:40.310> you<00:01:40.399> will<00:01:40.490> have<00:01:40.670> it<00:01:41.030> coming<00:01:41.509> over<00:01:41.899> a<00:01:41.930> little

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
so you will have it coming over a little

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
so you will have it coming over a little
bit<00:01:42.470> but<00:01:42.680> it<00:01:42.770> will<00:01:42.860> still<00:01:43.189> be<00:01:43.220> in<00:01:43.789> the<00:01:44.570> square

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
bit but it will still be in the square

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.960 
bit but it will still be in the square
do<00:01:46.340> this<00:01:46.520> for<00:01:46.670> all<00:01:46.759> four<00:01:46.789> flaps<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:49.759> better

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
do this for all four flaps the better

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.740 
do this for all four flaps the better
you<00:01:50.119> line<00:01:50.299> it<00:01:50.420> up<00:01:50.539> the<00:01:51.170> nicer<00:01:51.500> it<00:01:51.530> will<00:01:51.710> look<00:01:51.890> to

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
you line it up the nicer it will look to

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:08.380 
you line it up the nicer it will look to
try<00:01:53.750> hard<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.140> line<00:01:54.289> it<00:01:54.320> up

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.400 

after<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.479> done<00:02:09.600> with<00:02:09.690> this<00:02:09.869> step<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.289> will

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
after you done with this step you will

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.610 
after you done with this step you will
have<00:02:10.560> your<00:02:10.679> finished<00:02:11.069> photo<00:02:11.280> frame<00:02:12.470> you<00:02:13.470> can

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
have your finished photo frame you can

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.860 
have your finished photo frame you can
use<00:02:13.800> this<00:02:13.980> for<00:02:14.400> any<00:02:14.580> square<00:02:14.850> photo<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.690> put

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870
