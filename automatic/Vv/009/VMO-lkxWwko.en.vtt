00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.530
 look at this typical american family are 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.200
 beautiful young people and they will be parents 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.390
 congratulations a new baby brings new 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.790
 possibilities and endless decisions 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.289
 one of the most important decisions is 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.300
 storing the blood and tissue 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.160
 of the umbilical cord of the baby we have heard 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.350
 of the umbilical cord banks but 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.940
 we do not know why we should cryopreserve 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.250
 the cord blood of our baby 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.590
 store the laces of your children 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.090
 Of course, if all of my 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.739
 children if they have the opportunity to 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.680
 conserve your baby's stem cells 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.909
 no doubt they should do so I explain the 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.829
 blood and umbilical cord tissue 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:40.569
 contain stem cells that are the 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.489
 pillars of all other tissues of 

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:44.409
 our body the stem cells of the 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.149
 cord are used to treat almost 80 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:48.819
 diseases like cerebral palsy 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.519
 leukemia autoimmune diseases and 

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:53.379
 genetic disorders 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.449
 that's the way it is and in fact as we get older 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.489
 many of these evils become more 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.620
 common so the need for these 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.600
 Stem cells increases with time 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.510
 They have made more than 30,000 transplants 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.010
 of umbilical cord stem cells 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.299
 new therapies arise practically 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.800
 every day 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.060
 preserve the stem cells of your 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.600
 newborn is the investment more 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.490
 healthy 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.520
 can do for your baby and your family 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.439
 our family if cord blood 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.299
 can be used to treat the baby 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.250
 brothers or other close members of the 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.110
 family depending on the disease the 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.399
 possibility of a compatible transplant 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.570
 It is much greater if it comes from a 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.640
 family that a donor does not 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.290
 relational and a transplanted patient 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.640
 recovers better when the donor 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.950
 the stem cells his relative 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.869
 surprising but there are risks in the 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.430
 process to collect blood and tissue 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.039
 of the cord after birth alone 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.950
 it takes a few minutes and there is no risk 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.869
 for the mother or the baby but they only have 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.560
 an opportunity to cryopreserve these 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.640
 valuable cells and how much it costs 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.229
 collect and store the blood of 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.539
 cord in a private bank to be a 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.280
 mother costs almost a thousand dollars plus one 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.080
 small annual fee of the bank the 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.539
 Preserves in cryogenic freezers 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.100
 for exclusive use of the family 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.369
 financing plans do it very 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.470
 accessible there is another option if they decide 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.420
 do not store the stem cells of your 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.160
 baby for your family can donate them to 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.530
 a public bank to be used by 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.900
 people who have medical emergencies 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.640
 Every year there are thousands of patients looking 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.860
 from a compatible donor in a bank 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.020
 public and your baby's stem cells 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.760
 could serve to save a life without 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.140
 However, once they are donated to a 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.330
 public bank may not be 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.880
 available for your child or family in the 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.470
 future in this case they would also have to 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.860
 wait for cells to appear 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.959
 compatible in 2013 the cost of cells 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.050
 compatible mother in a public bank is 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.060
 of approximately 35 thousand dollars and it 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.489
 included as part of the hospital payment 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.040
 but as we know that private bank to 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.590
 use think very carefully before 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.300
 choose an umbilical cord bank 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.100
 check accreditations records of 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:56.150
 success in therapeutic use and guarantees 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.150
 a few months later 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.510
 maternity ward 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:07.530
 ah 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.530
 and tranquility for all his family
