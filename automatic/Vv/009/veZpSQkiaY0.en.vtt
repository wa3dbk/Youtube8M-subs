00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.260 
right off of the boil really nice and
hot<00:01:59.650> water<00:02:00.040> from<00:02:00.190> the<00:02:00.280> tap<00:02:00.400> is<00:02:00.759> just<00:02:01.000> not<00:02:01.119> going

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
hot water from the tap is just not going

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.570 
hot water from the tap is just not going
to<00:02:01.330> be<00:02:01.450> hot<00:02:01.660> enough<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:02.350> towel<00:02:02.619> will<00:02:03.160> actually

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
to be hot enough the towel will actually

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.160 
to be hot enough the towel will actually
help<00:02:03.729> to<00:02:03.910> keep<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.240> cups<00:02:04.450> from<00:02:04.630> sliding

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
help to keep the cups from sliding

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.719 
help to keep the cups from sliding
around<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.890> towel<00:02:06.100> is<00:02:06.280> also<00:02:06.550> going<00:02:06.670> to

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
around the towel is also going to

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.370 
around the towel is also going to
elevate<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.330> cups<00:02:07.570> off<00:02:07.780> of<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:08.019> bottom<00:02:08.320> of

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
elevate the cups off of the bottom of

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.469 
elevate the cups off of the bottom of
the<00:02:08.470> pan<00:02:08.709> so<00:02:08.920> water<00:02:09.459> can<00:02:09.700> actually<00:02:09.850> circulate

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
the pan so water can actually circulate

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.110 
the pan so water can actually circulate
underneath<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.709> custard<00:02:12.070> cups<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.519> help<00:02:13.000> to

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
underneath the custard cups and help to

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.150 
underneath the custard cups and help to
speed<00:02:13.330> up<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.600> baking<00:02:13.959> after<00:02:14.709> I<00:02:14.739> have<00:02:14.980> these

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
speed up the baking after I have these

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.340 
speed up the baking after I have these
filled<00:02:15.489> up<00:02:15.670> about<00:02:15.940> where<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.959> water<00:02:17.140> level

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
filled up about where the water level

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.240 
filled up about where the water level
comes<00:02:17.650> halfway<00:02:18.100> up<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.810> height<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:21.010> cups

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
comes halfway up the height of the cups

for when we checking them we're looking

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.410 
for when we checking them we're looking
for<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.040> custard<00:02:30.670> cup<00:02:30.880> when<00:02:31.030> we<00:02:31.120> give<00:02:31.269> it<00:02:31.360> a

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
for the custard cup when we give it a

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.180 
for the custard cup when we give it a
little<00:02:31.600> shake<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:31.870> have<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.200> jello<00:02:32.560> like<00:02:32.769> jiggle

of this and make our burnt sugar crust

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.199 
of this and make our burnt sugar crust
in<00:02:44.320> order<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.620> make<00:02:44.769> a<00:02:44.799> creme<00:02:45.100> brulee<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:46.060> it

custard

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.849 

the<00:02:57.510> more<00:02:57.719> sugar<00:02:58.019> you<00:02:58.049> might<00:02:58.260> have<00:02:58.409> sprinkling

on to the custard the thicker of a crust

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.800 
on to the custard the thicker of a crust
you<00:03:01.379> will<00:03:01.500> produce<00:03:05.329> and<00:03:06.329> once<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.629> have<00:03:06.780> a

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
you will produce and once I have a

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.509 
you will produce and once I have a
really<00:03:07.079> nice<00:03:07.260> even<00:03:07.560> dusting<00:03:07.980> of<00:03:08.099> sugar<00:03:08.340> I'm

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
really nice even dusting of sugar I'm

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.459 
really nice even dusting of sugar I'm
going<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.790> come<00:03:08.969> in<00:03:09.120> with<00:03:09.269> a<00:03:09.299> propane<00:03:09.780> torch<00:03:10.170> I

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:10.469 
going to come in with a propane torch I

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:11.899 
going to come in with a propane torch I
have<00:03:10.739> one<00:03:10.950> here<00:03:11.099> that's<00:03:11.310> got<00:03:11.459> a<00:03:11.519> plumbers

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
have one here that's got a plumbers

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:13.970 
have one here that's got a plumbers
nozzle<00:03:12.329> on<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.510> so<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:13.260> don't<00:03:13.469> have<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.709> turn<00:03:13.829> the

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
nozzle on it so I don't have to turn the

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.800 
nozzle on it so I don't have to turn the
torch<00:03:14.189> upside<00:03:14.579> down<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.359> I'm<00:03:15.480> going<00:03:15.599> to<00:03:15.629> take

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
torch upside down and I'm going to take

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.629 
torch upside down and I'm going to take
the<00:03:15.959> flame<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.469> slowly<00:03:16.769> lower<00:03:17.129> it<00:03:17.159> on<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.519> the

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
the flame and slowly lower it on to the

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.429 
the flame and slowly lower it on to the
sugar<00:03:17.879> and<00:03:18.150> you<00:03:18.689> can<00:03:18.840> see<00:03:19.019> how<00:03:19.079> the<00:03:19.139> sugar

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:19.439 
sugar and you can see how the sugar

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:21.319 
sugar and you can see how the sugar
starts<00:03:19.859> to<00:03:20.010> melt<00:03:20.189> one<00:03:20.790> of<00:03:20.909> the<00:03:21.000> things<00:03:21.209> that's

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
starts to melt one of the things that's

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.699 
starts to melt one of the things that's
really<00:03:21.540> important<00:03:22.019> is<00:03:22.109> that<00:03:22.139> you<00:03:22.260> move<00:03:22.560> it

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
really important is that you move it

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.379 
really important is that you move it
around<00:03:22.799> you<00:03:23.159> don't<00:03:23.280> want<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.459> let<00:03:23.909> it<00:03:23.939> set<00:03:24.239> in

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
around you don't want to let it set in

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.509 
around you don't want to let it set in
one<00:03:24.540> spot<00:03:24.870> I<00:03:25.170> like<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.709> focus<00:03:25.920> on<00:03:26.219> the<00:03:26.340> sugar

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
one spot I like to focus on the sugar

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.729 
one spot I like to focus on the sugar
that<00:03:27.090> hasn't<00:03:27.299> been<00:03:27.510> melted<00:03:27.959> yet<00:03:28.109> it's<00:03:28.590> gonna

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
that hasn't been melted yet it's gonna

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.409 
that hasn't been melted yet it's gonna
send<00:03:29.040> up<00:03:29.159> some<00:03:29.370> smoke<00:03:29.700> so<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.180> want<00:03:30.329> to<00:03:30.389> open

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
send up some smoke so you want to open

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.229 
send up some smoke so you want to open
up<00:03:30.689> your<00:03:30.750> window<00:03:31.560> turn<00:03:31.919> on<00:03:32.069> your<00:03:32.340> exhaust<00:03:32.970> fan
