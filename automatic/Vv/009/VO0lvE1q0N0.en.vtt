00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
years by month so what we're going to do

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.430 
years by month so what we're going to do
first<00:02:49.300> is<00:02:49.570> we're<00:02:49.690> actually<00:02:49.780> going<00:02:50.080> to<00:02:50.170> create

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
first is we're actually going to create

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.100 
first is we're actually going to create
one<00:02:50.740> let's<00:02:51.430> go<00:02:51.640> to<00:02:51.730> powerpivot<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.540> open<00:02:53.020> up

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
one let's go to powerpivot and open up

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.260 
one let's go to powerpivot and open up
the<00:02:53.290> power<00:02:53.470> pivot<00:02:53.770> window<00:02:54.220> we're<00:02:55.090> actually

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
the power pivot window we're actually

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.200 
the power pivot window we're actually
going<00:02:55.630> to<00:02:55.720> use<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:56.110> Dax<00:02:56.440> expression<00:02:57.370> Dax

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
going to use a Dax expression Dax

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.960 
going to use a Dax expression Dax
to<00:02:58.810> create<00:02:59.170> a<00:02:59.350> new<00:02:59.620> column<00:02:59.890> a<00:03:00.190> new<00:03:00.340> calculated

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
to create a new column a new calculated

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:08.590 
to create a new column a new calculated
column<00:03:01.600> inside<00:03:02.470> our<00:03:02.770> date<00:03:03.070> dimension

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.630 

after<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:09.720> last<00:03:09.960> column<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.710> table<00:03:11.130> click<00:03:11.460> on

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
after the last column the table click on

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.240 
after the last column the table click on
add<00:03:11.910> column<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.680> then<00:03:13.680> you'll<00:03:13.830> be<00:03:13.890> able<00:03:14.069> to

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
add column and then you'll be able to

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.180 
add column and then you'll be able to
enter<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.520> Dax<00:03:14.790> formula<00:03:15.410> this<00:03:16.410> formula<00:03:16.470> is

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
enter the Dax formula this formula is

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.190 
enter the Dax formula this formula is
going<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.490> multiply<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.150> calendar<00:03:18.810> year<00:03:18.990> by<00:03:19.170> a

going to multiply the calendar year by a

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.059 
going to multiply the calendar year by a
hundred<00:03:19.740> and<00:03:19.950> then<00:03:19.980> add<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:21.720> month<00:03:21.990> number<00:03:22.230> to

hundred and then add the month number to

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.370 
hundred and then add the month number to
that<00:03:23.250> value<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:24.330> basically<00:03:24.690> give<00:03:24.930> us<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:25.170> way<00:03:25.320> to

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
that value to basically give us a way to

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:39.400 
that value to basically give us a way to
sort<00:03:25.890> by<00:03:26.480> year<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.660> month

field to give it a new name that makes

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.460 
field to give it a new name that makes
more<00:03:52.950> sense<00:03:53.010> than<00:03:53.970> calculated<00:03:54.720> column<00:03:55.080> one<00:03:55.260> in

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
more sense than calculated column one in

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.360 
more sense than calculated column one in
this<00:03:56.430> case<00:03:56.700> it's<00:03:57.060> a<00:03:57.390> year<00:03:57.660> month

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.100 

you<00:04:02.370> can<00:04:02.550> now<00:04:02.670> close<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.240> PowerPivot<00:04:03.780> window

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
you can now close the PowerPivot window

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.530 
you can now close the PowerPivot window
which<00:04:04.560> brings<00:04:04.830> you<00:04:04.950> back<00:04:05.160> to<00:04:05.340> excel<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:06.030> power

can check out the date dimension now and

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.039 
can check out the date dimension now and
you'll<00:04:14.250> see<00:04:14.340> your<00:04:14.700> new<00:04:14.760> calculated<00:04:15.510> field<00:04:15.780> at

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
you'll see your new calculated field at

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.449 
you'll see your new calculated field at
the<00:04:16.140> bottom

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.230 

so<00:04:21.459> let's<00:04:21.669> start<00:04:21.970> building<00:04:22.180> the<00:04:22.449> chart<00:04:24.240> the

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
so let's start building the chart the

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.760 
so let's start building the chart the
main<00:04:25.449> number<00:04:25.810> we're<00:04:25.960> interested<00:04:26.380> in<00:04:26.440> is<00:04:26.620> the

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
main number we're interested in is the

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.650 
main number we're interested in is the
sales<00:04:27.009> amount<00:04:27.340> that's<00:04:27.610> our<00:04:27.759> main<00:04:28.000> measure<00:04:28.300> and

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
sales amount that's our main measure and

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.210 
sales amount that's our main measure and
that's<00:04:29.169> what<00:04:29.319> that's<00:04:29.590> going<00:04:29.860> to<00:04:29.949> become<00:04:30.039> the

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
that's what that's going to become the

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.999 
that's what that's going to become the
x-axis<00:04:31.060> of<00:04:31.300> our<00:04:31.539> chart<00:04:31.870> so<00:04:32.410> when<00:04:32.590> we<00:04:32.740> check

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
x-axis of our chart so when we check

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:34.939 
x-axis of our chart so when we check
that<00:04:33.250> notice<00:04:33.610> that<00:04:33.639> it<00:04:33.849> creates<00:04:34.120> a<00:04:34.240> table<00:04:34.660> over

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
that notice that it creates a table over

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.820 
that notice that it creates a table over
in<00:04:35.949> the<00:04:36.280> blank<00:04:36.550> canvas<00:04:36.990> let's<00:04:37.990> resize<00:04:38.500> this

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
in the blank canvas let's resize this

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.340 
in the blank canvas let's resize this
table

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.820
