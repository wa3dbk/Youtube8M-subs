this<00:00:00.870> is<00:00:01.020> a<00:00:01.050> tutorial<00:00:01.469> for<00:00:01.800> the<00:00:02.370> changing<00:00:02.790> the

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
this is a tutorial for the changing the

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.150 
this is a tutorial for the changing the
color<00:00:03.179> of<00:00:03.300> a<00:00:03.449> custom<00:00:03.810> shape<00:00:04.049> in<00:00:04.560> Photoshop

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
color of a custom shape in Photoshop

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.330 
color of a custom shape in Photoshop
right<00:00:05.400> select<00:00:06.150> custom<00:00:06.540> shape<00:00:06.750> tool<00:00:07.099> go<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.130> the

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
right select custom shape tool go to the

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.400 
right select custom shape tool go to the
custom<00:00:08.670> shape<00:00:08.849> palette<00:00:09.269> select<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:10.080> custom

custom shape palette select a custom

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.400 
custom shape palette select a custom
shape<00:00:11.570> apply<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.690> custom<00:00:13.080> shape

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
shape apply the custom shape

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.079 
shape apply the custom shape
current<00:00:13.679> custom<00:00:14.009> shape<00:00:14.219> dog<00:00:14.429> we<00:00:14.580> generated

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
current custom shape dog we generated

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.670 
current custom shape dog we generated
would<00:00:15.210> be<00:00:15.330> generated<00:00:15.870> with<00:00:15.990> black<00:00:16.199> since

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
would be generated with black since

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.970 
would be generated with black since
that's<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.949> current<00:00:17.279> foreground<00:00:17.520> color<00:00:18.980> so

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
that's the current foreground color so

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.580 
that's the current foreground color so
I'm<00:00:20.910> just<00:00:21.060> going<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.270> create<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.109> they<00:00:22.470> are

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
I'm just going to create that they are

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.950 
I'm just going to create that they are
it<00:00:22.710> comes<00:00:23.580> out<00:00:23.789> black<00:00:26.210> now<00:00:27.210> if<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.480> go<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.689> the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
it comes out black now if I go to the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.810 
it comes out black now if I go to the
foreground<00:00:28.619> color<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:29.070> can<00:00:29.250> change<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.760> to

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
foreground color I can change that to

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.910 
foreground color I can change that to
red<00:00:29.939> green<00:00:30.420> blue<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:31.199> every<00:00:31.349> time<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.650> create<00:00:31.830> a

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
red green blue so every time I create a

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.770 
red green blue so every time I create a
new<00:00:32.099> custom<00:00:32.460> shape<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:33.120> will<00:00:33.239> actually<00:00:33.360> be<00:00:33.660> at

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
new custom shape it will actually be at

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.620 
new custom shape it will actually be at
that<00:00:33.930> color<00:00:34.340> so<00:00:35.340> I'm<00:00:35.430> just<00:00:35.550> going<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.820> click<00:00:36.510> on

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
that color so I'm just going to click on

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.130 
that color so I'm just going to click on
that<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.680> color<00:00:37.920> picker<00:00:38.129> change<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.000> red

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
that the color picker change that to red

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.119 
that the color picker change that to red
claw<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.200> custom<00:00:40.590> shape<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.010> whatever

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
claw the custom shape and whatever

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.650 
claw the custom shape and whatever
custom<00:00:41.550> shape<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.879> course<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.300> moment

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
custom shape of course that moment

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.869 
custom shape of course that moment
you'll<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.320> actually<00:00:43.469> displayed<00:00:43.890> as<00:00:44.040> red<00:00:46.879> blue

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
you'll be actually displayed as red blue

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.260 
you'll be actually displayed as red blue
and<00:00:48.890> draw<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.950> custom<00:00:50.430> shape<00:00:50.579> again<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.149> that

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
and draw the custom shape again and that

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.840 
and draw the custom shape again and that
will<00:00:51.390> be<00:00:51.539> blue<00:00:52.070> now<00:00:53.070> that's<00:00:53.219> for<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.399> fill

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
will be blue now that's for the fill

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.819 
will be blue now that's for the fill
pixels<00:00:54.149> now<00:00:54.780> there<00:00:54.960> are<00:00:55.110> other<00:00:55.320> options<00:00:55.530> as

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
pixels now there are other options as

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.889 
pixels now there are other options as
well<00:00:55.980> for<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.250> custom<00:00:57.210> shapes<00:00:57.449> such<00:00:57.690> as<00:00:57.719> a

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
well for the custom shapes such as a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.869 
well for the custom shapes such as a
shape<00:00:58.140> layer<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.680> path<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.879> or<00:01:00.510> C<00:01:00.719> fill<00:01:00.899> pixel

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
shape layer a path and or C fill pixel

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.280 
shape layer a path and or C fill pixel
most<00:01:02.879> time<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.149> use<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.329> fill<00:01:03.570> pixel<00:01:03.930> one<00:01:04.049> so

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
most time I use a fill pixel one so

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.020 
most time I use a fill pixel one so
that's<00:01:04.860> what<00:01:05.100> I'm<00:01:05.220> most<00:01:05.309> familiar<00:01:05.489> with<00:01:05.850> but

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
that's what I'm most familiar with but

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.929 
that's what I'm most familiar with but
you<00:01:06.659> can<00:01:06.810> also<00:01:06.960> use<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.439> shape<00:01:07.680> layer<00:01:07.939> that's

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
you can also use the shape layer that's

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.969 
you can also use the shape layer that's
gonna<00:01:09.119> be<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.299> next<00:01:09.420> where<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.659> show<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.979> you

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
gonna be the next where I show you you

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.859 
gonna be the next where I show you you
can<00:01:11.070> also<00:01:11.159> change<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.790> color<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.390> find<00:01:12.780> it

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
can also change the color I find it

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.920 
can also change the color I find it
easier<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.380> changed<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> color<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
easier to have changed the color of the

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.780 
easier to have changed the color of the
set<00:01:15.930> via<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.290> swatches<00:01:16.560> palette<00:01:17.100> that's<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
set via the swatches palette that's the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.130 
set via the swatches palette that's the
easiest<00:01:18.060> way<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.270> disobey<00:01:18.750> SH<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.900> can<00:01:18.990> just

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
easiest way to disobey SH you can just

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:27.020 
easiest way to disobey SH you can just
change<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.439> color<00:01:22.580> shape<00:01:23.580> layer<00:01:24.860> and<00:01:26.000> then<00:01:27.000> go

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
change the color shape layer and then go

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.690 
change the color shape layer and then go
to<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.570> color<00:01:27.780> option<00:01:28.560> there<00:01:28.770> or<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.189> top<00:01:29.400> bar

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
to the color option there or the top bar

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.940 
to the color option there or the top bar
and<00:01:30.000> change<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.930> color<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.290> as<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.740> change

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
and change the color and as you change

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.380 
and change the color and as you change
the<00:01:32.040> color<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.369> will<00:01:32.460> change<00:01:32.700> interactively

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
the color it will change interactively

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.080 
the color it will change interactively
so<00:01:33.840> now<00:01:34.079> I'll<00:01:34.409> see<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.590> light<00:01:34.799> blue<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.970> then

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
so now I'll see a light blue and then

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.380 
so now I'll see a light blue and then
pink<00:01:36.780> red<00:01:37.850> so<00:01:38.850> on<00:01:40.520> you<00:01:41.520> can<00:01:41.640> go<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.790> layer<00:01:42.119> layer

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
pink red so on you can go to layer layer

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.200 
pink red so on you can go to layer layer
style<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:43.259> color<00:01:44.100> overlay<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.820> then<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.060> can

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
style and color overlay and then you can

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.330 
style and color overlay and then you can
change<00:01:45.420> your<00:01:45.479> color<00:01:45.890> artists<00:01:46.890> I'm<00:01:47.070> dragged

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
change your color artists I'm dragged

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.420 
change your color artists I'm dragged
our<00:01:47.759> logo<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.810> then<00:01:49.530> change<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.070> color<00:01:50.250> at

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
our logo and then change the color at

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.679 
our logo and then change the color at
that<00:01:50.549> point<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.090> again<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.540> can<00:01:51.630> see

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
that point so again you can see

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.960 
that point so again you can see
interactively<00:01:52.380> changing<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.979> color<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.759> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
interactively changing the color of the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
interactively changing the color of the
custom<00:01:54.270> shape<00:01:54.509> by<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.110> color<00:01:55.409> overlay<00:01:55.740> option

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
custom shape by the color overlay option

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.819 
custom shape by the color overlay option
again<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.110> can<00:01:58.229> change<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.590> by<00:01:58.649> the

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
again you can change that by the

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.100 
again you can change that by the
swatches<00:01:59.280> by<00:01:59.460> passing<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.509> color<00:02:00.899> picker

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.120 
I'm gonna use red just going to go to
the<00:02:21.600> layers<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.230> I'm<00:02:22.560> going<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:22.770> create<00:02:22.980> an

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
the layers and I'm going to create an

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.460 
the layers and I'm going to create an
adjustment<00:02:23.370> layer<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.360> it's<00:02:25.260> the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
adjustment layer and it's the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.730 
adjustment layer and it's the
hue/saturation<00:02:27.080> and<00:02:28.080> again<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.440> can<00:02:28.590> change

hue/saturation and again you can change
the<00:02:29.070> color<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.730> custom-shape<00:02:30.270> by<00:02:31.080> this<00:02:31.140> of

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
the color of the custom-shape by this of

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.590 
the color of the custom-shape by this of
course<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:32.160> can<00:02:32.250> do<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:32.550> by<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.850> image<00:02:33.210> menu

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
course you can do so by the image menu

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.180 
course you can do so by the image menu
but<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.350> one<00:02:34.470> good<00:02:34.620> thing<00:02:34.680> about<00:02:34.830> the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
but the one good thing about the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.850 
but the one good thing about the
adjustment<00:02:35.970> layer<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.210> that<00:02:36.510> it's<00:02:36.830> can<00:02:37.830> be

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
adjustment layer is that it's can be

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.430 
adjustment layer is that it's can be
customized<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.090> changed<00:02:39.870> any<00:02:40.020> point<00:02:40.230> in<00:02:40.380> the

now<00:03:09.220> I'm<00:03:09.310> just<00:03:09.400> going<00:03:09.549> to<00:03:09.640> use<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.970> part

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
now I'm just going to use the part

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.789 
now I'm just going to use the part
option<00:03:10.569> the<00:03:10.659> part<00:03:10.840> option<00:03:11.200> is<00:03:11.290> a<00:03:11.409> way<00:03:11.769> of

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
option the part option is a way of

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.979 
option the part option is a way of
getting<00:03:12.579> to<00:03:12.849> the<00:03:12.970> selection<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.569> path<00:03:13.750> has<00:03:13.930> no

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
getting to the selection the path has no

getting to the selection the path has no
color<00:03:14.560> either<00:03:14.950> so<00:03:15.280> I'm<00:03:15.519> just<00:03:15.670> going<00:03:15.790> to<00:03:15.879> draw

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
color either so I'm just going to draw

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.759 
color either so I'm just going to draw
the<00:03:16.540> path<00:03:17.760> go<00:03:18.760> to<00:03:18.819> the<00:03:19.090> path<00:03:19.420> palette<00:03:20.379> and

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.860 

crisis<00:03:23.769> selection<00:03:24.329> and<00:03:25.329> then<00:03:25.510> of<00:03:25.599> course<00:03:25.659> you

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
crisis selection and then of course you

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.360 
crisis selection and then of course you
can<00:03:25.989> fill<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.349> selection<00:03:26.500> with<00:03:26.799> the<00:03:27.010> current

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
can fill the selection with the current

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.250 
can fill the selection with the current
color<00:03:27.670> so<00:03:27.909> just<00:03:28.359> going<00:03:28.480> to<00:03:28.569> select<00:03:28.689> color<00:03:28.989> and

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260

color so just going to select color and
the<00:03:29.349> fill<00:03:29.560> now<00:03:30.519> pink<00:03:30.849> and<00:03:31.120> just<00:03:31.329> apply<00:03:31.629> that

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
the fill now pink and just apply that

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.800 
the fill now pink and just apply that
okay<00:03:33.370> so<00:03:33.430> that's<00:03:33.730> filled<00:03:34.000> another<00:03:34.540> way<00:03:34.720> of

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
okay so that's filled another way of

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.660 
okay so that's filled another way of
doing<00:03:34.930> it<00:03:35.049> causes<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.590> fill<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:36.010> selection

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
doing it causes to fill the selection

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.880 
doing it causes to fill the selection
with<00:03:37.000> brushstrokes<00:03:37.989> so<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:38.290> can<00:03:38.530> just<00:03:38.709> change

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
with brushstrokes so you can just change

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.949 
with brushstrokes so you can just change
the<00:03:39.010> color<00:03:39.280> of<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.549> brushstroke<00:03:40.060> so<00:03:40.720> you<00:03:40.810> can

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
the color of the brushstroke so you can

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.390 
the color of the brushstroke so you can
say<00:03:41.109> maybe<00:03:41.260> that<00:03:41.530> make<00:03:41.739> our<00:03:41.889> blue<00:03:42.099> red

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
say maybe that make our blue red

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.399 
say maybe that make our blue red
whatever<00:03:42.730> and<00:03:43.269> then<00:03:43.659> just<00:03:43.840> basically<00:03:43.989> apply

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:44.409 
whatever and then just basically apply

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:46.170 
whatever and then just basically apply
the<00:03:44.470> brushstroke<00:03:45.010> there<00:03:45.579> are<00:03:45.730> another<00:03:45.970> ways

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
the brushstroke there are another ways

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.280 
the brushstroke there are another ways
of<00:03:46.329> changing<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.659> color<00:03:46.810> but<00:03:46.959> they're<00:03:47.109> the

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
of changing the color but they're the

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.170 
of changing the color but they're the
key<00:03:47.739> ways<00:03:47.950> of<00:03:48.190> quickly<00:03:48.430> changing<00:03:48.790> the
