the speed build let I talk well I'm
building<00:02:34.920> but<00:02:35.610> then<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:36.000> don't<00:02:36.330> speed<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.810> up<00:02:36.930> as

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
building but then I don't speed it up as

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.309 
building but then I don't speed it up as
much<00:02:37.200> as<00:02:37.560> i<00:02:37.830> do<00:02:38.099> with<00:02:38.580> speed<00:02:39.000> builds<00:02:39.450> i<00:02:39.629> will

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
much as i do with speed builds i will

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.309 
much as i do with speed builds i will
just<00:02:40.560> speed<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.250> up<00:02:41.489> a<00:02:41.790> little<00:02:42.510> bit<00:02:42.750> just<00:02:43.080> like

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
just speed it up a little bit just like

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.610 
just speed it up a little bit just like
one<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:44.390> 1.2<00:02:45.390> times<00:02:45.750> or<00:02:45.989> something<00:02:46.349> that<00:02:46.470> it

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
one a 1.2 times or something that it

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.160 
one a 1.2 times or something that it
doesn't<00:02:47.370> go<00:02:47.489> goes<00:02:48.209> too<00:02:48.390> slow<00:02:48.420> but<00:02:48.930> that<00:02:49.050> you

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
doesn't go goes too slow but that you

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.580 
doesn't go goes too slow but that you
can<00:02:49.319> still<00:02:49.560> really<00:02:50.310> see<00:02:50.580> what<00:02:50.760> i<00:02:50.790> do<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:52.200> i

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
can still really see what i do and i

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.790 
can still really see what i do and i
think<00:02:53.250> i'll<00:02:53.400> do<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.000> way<00:02:54.150> of<00:02:54.680> doing<00:02:55.680> that

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
think i'll do that the way of doing that

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.720 
think i'll do that the way of doing that
build<00:02:56.129> because<00:02:56.340> i<00:02:56.819> think<00:02:56.940> it's<00:02:57.629> a<00:02:58.310> whenever<00:02:59.310> I

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
build because i think it's a whenever I

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.750 
build because i think it's a whenever I
do<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.540> country<00:03:01.110> where<00:03:01.319> let<00:03:01.800> buildwell<00:03:02.159> really
