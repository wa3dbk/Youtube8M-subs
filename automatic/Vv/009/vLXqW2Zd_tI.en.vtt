00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
she wears zero to three MOT clothing

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.220 
she wears zero to three MOT clothing
and<00:00:12.340> I'm<00:00:13.340> really<00:00:13.639> happy<00:00:13.850> about<00:00:14.000> that<00:00:14.240> well<00:00:15.139> at

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
and I'm really happy about that well at

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.230 
and I'm really happy about that well at
least<00:00:15.320> I<00:00:15.500> so<00:00:15.650> she<00:00:15.710> sent<00:00:16.610> her<00:00:16.760> in<00:00:16.910> I<00:00:16.940> was

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
least I so she sent her in I was

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.910 
least I so she sent her in I was
thinking<00:00:17.540> she<00:00:17.570> would<00:00:17.810> wear<00:00:17.990> knee<00:00:18.170> newborn

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
thinking she would wear knee newborn

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.410 
thinking she would wear knee newborn
because<00:00:19.040> she's<00:00:19.369> a<00:00:20.590> 19<00:00:21.590> inch<00:00:21.770> sculpt<00:00:22.340> and<00:00:23.150> so<00:00:23.390> I

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
because she's a 19 inch sculpt and so I

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.450 
because she's a 19 inch sculpt and so I
figured<00:00:23.869> she<00:00:24.170> would<00:00:24.290> wear<00:00:24.470> newborn<00:00:24.950> she<00:00:25.189> still

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
figured she would wear newborn she still

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.780 
figured she would wear newborn she still
might<00:00:25.670> fit<00:00:25.910> newborn<00:00:26.360> but<00:00:27.080> I<00:00:27.110> have<00:00:27.410> some<00:00:28.310> zero

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:28.790 
might fit newborn but I have some zero

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.280 
might fit newborn but I have some zero
