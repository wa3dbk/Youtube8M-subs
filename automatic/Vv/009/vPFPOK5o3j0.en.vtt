 representation of all negotiations with 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.570
 confidential sources during

 news agency activities for 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.829
 two month period as well as how

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.290
 notifications 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.090
 concern is how can it 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.170
