00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
below we will be playing on the north

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.969 
below we will be playing on the north
american<00:01:30.720> servers<00:01:31.079> which<00:01:31.290> shouldn't<00:01:31.799> be<00:01:31.860> a

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
american servers which shouldn't be a

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.999 
american servers which shouldn't be a
problem<00:01:32.369> back<00:01:33.119> when<00:01:33.329> there<00:01:33.509> were<00:01:33.720> beta<00:01:34.650> keys

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
problem back when there were beta keys

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.670 
problem back when there were beta keys
the<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:36.030> beta<00:01:36.270> keys<00:01:36.509> were<00:01:36.750> region<00:01:37.170> specific

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
the the beta keys were region specific

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.859 
the the beta keys were region specific
but<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.130> think<00:01:38.369> now<00:01:38.549> once<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.180> install<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
but I think now once you install the

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.210 
but I think now once you install the
game<00:01:40.049> there<00:01:40.380> should<00:01:40.560> be<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.710> little<00:01:40.890> pull<00:01:41.070> down

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
game there should be a little pull down

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.219 
game there should be a little pull down
menu<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.520> let<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.850> choose<00:01:42.119> which<00:01:42.659> region

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
menu to let you choose which region

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.469 
menu to let you choose which region
you're<00:01:43.500> playing<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.340> make<00:01:44.939> sure<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.210> you

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
you're playing in so make sure that you

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.670 
you're playing in so make sure that you
can<00:01:45.659> connect<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.049> North<00:01:46.229> American

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
can connect to the North American

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.889 
can connect to the North American
servers<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.220> we'll<00:01:47.909> play<00:01:48.060> some<00:01:48.119> heroes<00:01:48.750> of

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
servers and we'll play some heroes of

the<00:01:49.200> storm<00:01:49.259> will<00:01:49.649> try<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.829> do<00:01:49.950> some<00:01:50.100> custom<00:01:50.399> 5v5

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
the storm will try to do some custom 5v5

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.929 
the storm will try to do some custom 5v5
stuff<00:01:51.829> and<00:01:52.829> what's<00:01:52.979> great<00:01:53.070> about<00:01:53.189> them<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.640> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
stuff and what's great about them is the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.800 
stuff and what's great about them is the
games<00:01:54.119> tend<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.509> be<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.780> relatively<00:01:55.409> short<00:01:55.610> so

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
games tend to be a relatively short so

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.920 
games tend to be a relatively short so
we<00:01:57.810> can<00:01:57.960> probably<00:01:58.439> squeeze<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.130> few<00:01:59.310> more

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
we can probably squeeze in a few more

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.550 
we can probably squeeze in a few more
